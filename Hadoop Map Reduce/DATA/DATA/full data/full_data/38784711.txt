a wink toby cause you know all about one an all youd have to do would be to tell us fellers what to do an wed tend to the rest  yes but you see we haint got a tent or bosses or wagons or nothin an i dont see how you could get a circus up that way and the speaker hugged his knees as he rocked himself to and fro in a musing way on the rather sharp point of a large rock on which he had seated himself in order to hear what his companions had to say that was so important  will you come down with me to bob atwoods an see what he says about it  yes ill do that if youll come out afterwards for a game of ispy round the meetinhouse  all right if we can find enough of the other fellers i will  then the boys slipped down from the rocks found the cows and drove them home as the preface to their visit to bob atwoods  the boy who was so anxious to start a circus was a little fellow with such a wonderful amount of remarkably red hair that he was seldom called anything but reddy although his name was knownby his parents at leastto be walter grant his companion was toby tyler a boy who a year before had thought it would be a very pleasant thing to run away from his uncle daniel and the town of guilford in order to be with a circus and who in ten weeks was only too glad to run back home as rapidly as possible  during the first few months of his return very many brilliant offers had been made toby by his companions to induce him to aid them in starting an amateur circus but he had refused to have anything to do with the schemes and for several reasons during the ten weeks he had been away he had seen quite as much of a circus life as he cared to see without even such a mild dose as would be this amateur show and again whenever he thought of the matter the remembrance of the death of his monkey mr stubbs would come upon him so vividly and cause him so much sorrow that he resolutely put the matter from his mind  now however it had been a year since the monkey was killed school had closed during the summer season and he was rather more disposed to listen to the requests of his friends  on this particular night reddy grant had offered to go with him for the cowsan act of generosity which toby accounted for only on the theory that reddy wanted some of the strawberries which grew so plentifully in uncle daniels pasture but when they arrived there the strawberries were neglected for the circus question and toby then showed he was at least willing to talk about it  there was no doubt that bob atwood knew reddy was going to try to induce toby to help start a circus and bob knew also that reddy and toby would visit him although he appeared very much surprised when he saw them coming up the hill towards his house he was at home evidently waiting for something at an hour when all the other boys were out playing and that in itself would have made toby suspicious if he had paid much attention to the matter  bob was perfectly willing to talk about a circusso willing that almost before toby was aware of it he was laying plans with the others for such a show as could be given with the material at hand  you see wed have to get a tent the first thing said toby as he seated himself on the sawhorse as a sort of place of honor and proceeded to give his companions the benefit of his experience in the circus line i spose we could get along without a fat woman or a skeleton but wed have to have the tent anyway sos folks couldnt look right in an see the show for nothin  reddy had decided some time before how that trifling matter could be arranged and as he went industriously to work making shavings out of a portion of a shingle he said  ive got all that settled toby an when you say youre willin to go ahead an fix up the show ill be on hand with a tent thatll make your eyes stick out over a foot  bob nodded his head to show he was convinced reddy could do just as he had promised but toby was anxious for more particulars and insisted on knowing where this very necessary portion of a circus was coming from  you see a tent is a big thing he said seriously an it would cost more money than the fellers in this town could raise if they should pick all the strawberries in uncle danls pasture  oh i dont say as the tent reddys got his eye on is a reglar one like a real circus has said bob slowly and candidly as he began to draw on the side of the woodshed a picture of what he probably intended should represent a horse but he knows how he can rig one up thatll be big enough an look stavin  with this information toby was obliged to be satisfied and with the view of learning more of the details in case his companions had arranged for them he asked  where you goin to get the companythe folks that ride an turn handsprings an all them things  ben cushing can turn twice as many handsprings as any feller you ever saw an he can walk on his hands twice round the enginehouse i guess you couldnt find many circuses that could beat him an hes been practising in his barn all the chance he could get for moren a week  without intending to do so bob had thus let the secret out that the scheme had already been talked up before toby was consulted and then there was no longer any reason for concealment  you see we thought wed kinder get things fixed said reddy quickly anxious to explain away the seeming deception he had been guilty of an we wouldnt say anything to you till we knew whether we could get one up or not  an were goin to ask three cents to come in an lots of the fellers have promised to buy tickets if well let em do some of the ridin or else lead the hosses  but how are you goin to get any hosses asked toby thoroughly surprised at the way in which the scheme had already been developed  reddy can get jack douglasss blind one an we can train him sos hell go round the ring all right an your uncle danl will let you have his old white one thats lame if you ask him i aint sure but i can get one of chandler merrills ponies continued bob now so excited by his subject that he left his picture while it was yet a threelegged horse and stood in front of his friends an if we could sell tickets enough we could hire one of rube rowes hosses for you to ride  an bobs goin to be the clown an his mothers goin to make him a suit of clothes out of one of his grandmothers curtains added reddy as he snapped an imaginary whip with so many unnecessary flourishes that he tumbled over the sawhorse thereby mixing a large quantity of sawdust in his brilliantly colored hair  an reddys goin to be ringmaster explained bob as he assisted his friend to rise and acted the part of good samaritan by trying to get the sawdust from his hair with a currycomb joe robinson says hell sell tickets an tend the door an hold the hoops for you to jump through  leander leightons goin to be the band hes got a pair of clappers an mrs doaks goin to show him how to play on the accordion with one finger sos hell know how to make an awful lot of noise said reddy as he gave up the task of extracting the sawdust and devoted his entire attention to the scheme  an we can have some animals said bob with the air of one who adds the crowning glory to some brilliant work  toby had been surprised at the resources of the town for a circus of which he had not even dreamed and at bobs last remark he left his sawhorse seat as if to enable him to hear more distinctly  yes continued bob we can get a good many of some kinds old mrs simpson has got a threelegged cat with four kittens an ben cushing has got a hen that crows an we can take my calf for a grizzly bear an jack haveners two lambs for white bears ive caught six mice an ill have moren a dozen before the show comes off an reddys goin to bring his cat that aint got any tail leander leightons goin to bring four of his rabbits an make believe theyre wolves an joe robinsons goin to catch all the squirrels he canwell have the largest for foxes an the smallest for hyenas an joell keep howlin while hes tendin the door sos to make em sound right  bobs sisters goin to show him how to sing a couple of songs an hes goin to write em out on paper sos to have a book to sell added reddy delighted at the surprise expressed in tobys face nahum baker says if we have any kind of a show hell bring up some lemonade an some pies to sell an pass em round jest as they do in a reglar circus  this last information was indeed surprising for inasmuch as nahum baker was a man who had an apology for a fruitstore near the wharves it lent an air of realism to the plan this having a grown man connected with them in the enterprise  but he mustnt get any of the boys to help him an then treat them as job lord did me said toby earnestly the scheme having grown so in the halfhour that he began to fear it might be too much like the circus with which he had spent ten of the longest and most dreary weeks he had ever known  ill look out for that said bob confidently if he tries any of them games well make him leave no matter how good a trade hes doin  now where we goin to have the show and from the way toby asked the question it was easily seen that he had decided to accept the position of manager which had been so delicately offered him  thats jest what we aint fixed about said bob as if he blamed himself severely for not having already attended to this portion of the business you see if your uncle danl would let us have it up by his barn that would be jest the place an i almost know hed say yes if you asked him  do you spose it would be big enough you know when theres a circus in town everybody comes from all around to see it an it wouldnt do to have a place where they couldnt all get in and toby spoke as if there could be no doubt as to the crowds that would collect to see this wonderful show of theirs  itll have to be big enough if we use the tent im goin to get said reddy decidedly for you see that wont be so awful large an it would make it look kinder small if we put it where the other circuses put theirs  well then i spose well have to make that do an we can have two or three shows if there are too many to come in at one time said toby in a satisfied way that matters could be arranged so easily and then with a big sigh he added if only mr stubbs hadnt got killed what a show we could have i never saw him ride but i know he could have done better than any one else that ever tried it if he wanted to an if we had him we could have a reglar circus without anybody else  then the boys bewailed the untimely fate of mr stubbs until they saw that toby was fast getting into a mood altogether too sad for the proper transaction of circus business and bob proposed that a visit be paid ben cushing for the purpose of having him give them a private exhibition of his skill in order that toby might see some of the talent which was to help make their circus a glorious success     chapter ii  the blind horse   reddy had laid his plans so well that all the intending partners were where they could easily be found on this evening when tobys consent was to be won and ben cushing was no exception on the hard uneven floor of his fathers barn with all his clothes discarded save his trousers and shirt he was making such heroic efforts in the way of practice that while the boys were yet some distance from the building they could hear the thud of bens head or heels as he unexpectedly came in contact with the floor  when the three visitors stood at the door and looked in ben professed to be unaware of their presence and began a series of handsprings that might have been wonderful if he had not miscalculated the distance and struck the side of the barn just as he was getting well into the work  illustration planning the circus  then having lost his opportunity of dazzling them by showing that even when he was alone he could turn any number of handsprings simply in the way of exercise he suddenly became aware of their presence and greeted his friends with the anxiously asked question as to what toby had decided to do about entering the circus business  bob and reddy instead of answering waited for toby to speak it was a good opportunity to have the important matter settled definitely and they listened anxiously for his decision  im goin into it said toby after a pause during which it appeared as if he were trying to make up his mind cause it seems as if you had it almost done now you know when i got home last summer i didnt ever want to hear of a circus or see one for id had about enough of them an then id think of poor mr stubbs an that would make me feel awful bad i didnt think either that we could get up such a good show but now you fellers have got so much done towards it i think wed better go aheadthough i do wish mr stubbs was alive an we had a skeleton an a fat woman  reddy grant cheered very loudly as a means of showing how delighted he was at thus having finally enlisted toby in the scheme and bob as proof of the high esteem in which all the projectors of the enterprise held this famous circusrider said  now you know all about circuses toby an you shall be the chief boss of this one an well do just what you say  toby almost blushed as this great honor was actually thrust upon him and he hardly knew what reply to make when ben ceased his acrobatic exercises and with bobby and reddy stood waiting for him to give his orders  i spose the first thing to do he said at length is to see if jack douglass is willin for us to have his hoss an then find out what uncle danl says about it if we dont get the hoss it wont be any use to say anything to uncle danl  reddy was so anxious to have matters settled at once that he offered to go up to mr douglasss house then if the others would wait there for his return which proposition was at once accepted  mr douglass was an old colored man who lived fully half a mile from the village but reddys eagerness caused quick travelling and in a surprisingly short time he was back breathless and happy the coveted horse was to be theirs for as long a time as they wanted him provided they fed him well and did not attempt to harness him into a wagon  the owner of the sightless animal had expressed his doubts as to whether he would ever make much of a circushorse owing to his lack of sight and his extreme age but he argued that if as was very probable the animal fell while being ridden he would hurt his rider quite as much as himself and therefore the experiment would not be tried so often as seriously to injure the steed  it only remained to consult uncle daniel on the matter and of course that was to be attended to by toby he would have waited until a fitting opportunity presented itself but his companions insisted so strongly that he went home at once to have the case decided  uncle daniel was seated by the window as usual looking out over the distant hills as if he were trying to peer in at the gates of that city where so many loved ones awaited him and it was some moments before toby could make him understand what it was he was trying to say  so ye didnt get circusin enough last summer asked the old gentleman when at last he realized what it was the boy was talking about  oh yes i did replied toby quickly but you see that was a real one an this of ours is only a little makebelieve for three cents we want to get you to let us have the lot between the barn an the road to put our tent on an then lend us old whitey were goin to have jack douglasss hoss thats blind an weve got a threelegged cat an one without any tail an lots of things  its a kind of a cripples circus eh well toby boy you can do as you want to an you shall have old whitey but it seems to me youd better tie her lame leg on or shell shake it off when you get to makin her cut up antics  then uncle daniel returned to his reverie and the show was thus decided upon the projectors going again to view the triangular piece of land so soon to be decorated with their tents and circus belongings  each hour that passed after toby had decided with uncle daniels consent to go into the circus business made him more eager to carry out the brilliant plan that had been unfolded by bob atwood and reddy grant until his brain was in a perfect whirl when he went to bed that night he was sure he could ride as well as when he was under mr castles rather severe training and he thought over and over again how he would surprise every one who knew him but he did not stop to think that there might be a difference between the horse he had ridden in the circus and the lame one of uncle daniels or the blind one belonging to mr douglass he had an idea that it all depended upon himself with very little reference to the animal and he was sure he had his lesson perfectly  early as he got up the next morning his partners in the enterprise were waiting for him just around the corner of the barn where he found them as he went for the cows and they walked to the pasture with him in order to discuss the matter  ben cushing was in lightmarching and acrobatic costume worn for the occasion in order to give a full exhibition of his skill and reddy had been up so long that he had had time to procure mr douglasss wonderful steed which he had already led to the pasture so that he could be experimented upon  i thought id get him up there he said to toby sos you could try him cause if we dont get money enough to hire one of rube rowe youll have to ride the blind one or the lame one an youd better find out which you want if you try him in the pasture the fellers wont see you but if you did it down by your house every one of em would huddle round  toby thought the general idea was a good one but he was just a trifle uncertain as to how the blind horse would get along on such uneven ground however he said nothing lest his companions should think he was afraid to make the attempt and when ben and bob proceeded to mark out a ring he advised them as to its size  the most level piece of ground that could be found was selected as the place for the trial but several small mounds prevented it from being all a circusrider could ask for  bob volunteered to lead the horse around the track several times hoping he would become so accustomed to it as to be able to go by himself after a while and toby made his preparations by laying his hat on the ground with a stone on it so that he should be sure to find it when his rehearsal was done  it was a warm job bob had undertaken this leading the blind animal along the illdefined line that marked the limits of the ring for the sun shone brightly and there were no friendly trees to lend a shelter but he paid no attention to his discomfort because of the fact that he was doing something towards the enterprise which was to bring them in both honor and money  the poor old horse was the least interested of the party and he stumbled around the circle in an abused sort of way as if he considered it a piece of gross injustice to force him on the weary round when the grass was so plentiful and tender just under his feet  ben was busily engaged in lengthening mr douglasss rather weak and aged bridle with a small piece of rope and from time to time he encouraged the ambitious clown in his labor  keep it up if it is hot he shouted an when we get him sos he can do it alone hell be jest as good a circushoss as anybody would want for we can stuff him with hay an grass till hes fat and ben looked at the clearly defined ribs in a critical way as if trying to decide how much food would be necessary to cover them with flesh  oh i can keep on as long as the hoss can said bob as he wiped the perspiration from his face with one hand and clung firmly to the forelock of the animal with the other but weve been round here as many as six times already an he dont seem to know the way any better than when we started  oh yes he does cried reddy who was practising for his duties as ringmaster anxious that his education should advance as fast as the horses did hes got so he knows enough to turn out for that second knoll though he does stumble a little over the first one  by this time ben had the bridle adjusted to suit him toby was ready to make his first attempt at riding since he left the circus and the more serious work was begun  ben bridled the horse after some difficulty reddy drew out from its hidingplace a whip made by tying a piece of codline to an alder branch and toby was about to mount when joe robinson came in sight  he had been running at full speed and was nearly breathless but he managed to cry out so that he could be understood after considerable difficulty  hold on dont go to ridin till after we get some hoops for you to jump through  i guess i wont try any jumpin till after i see how he goes said toby as he looked rather doubtfully first at the horses weak legs and then at his sharp back besides we cant use the hoops till he gets more used to the ring  joe threw himself on the ground as if he felt quite as much aggrieved because he was thus left out of the programme as the horse apparently did because he was in it and bob consoled him by explaining that he had no reason to feel slighted since he who as the clown was to be the life of the entertainment could take no other part in these preparatory steps than to lead a blind horse around a still blinder ring  hold him while i get on said toby as he clutched the mane and a portion of the prominent backbone drawing himself up at some risk of upsetting the rather shaky steed  but there was no necessity of his giving this order for although four boys sprang to do his bidding the weary horse remained as motionless as a statue save for his hard breathing which proclaimed the fact that the heaves had long since singled him out as a victim  toby succeeded in getting on the animals back after some exertion but he found standing there an entirely different matter from standing on the broad saddles that were used in the circus and the boy and the horse made a shakylooking pair  shall i start him asked bob while reddy stood as near the centre of the ring as he could get prepared to snap his codline whip at the first signal  toby hesitated a moment he knew that to attempt to stand upon or on either side of that prominent backbone after its owner was in motion would be simply to invite his own downfall and he said as he seated himself carefully astride the bone  let him walk around once till i see how he goes  reddy cracked his whip without producing any effect upon the patient steed but after much coaxing bob succeeded in starting him again while toby bounced up and down much like a kernel of corn on a griddle such a decided motion did the horse have  he wont ever do for a ridin hoss said toby with much difficulty when he was halfway around the circle cause you see his bones is so sharp that he feels as if he was comin to pieces every time he steps  jest get him to trottin once an then you can tell what hes good for suggested reddy anxious to try the effect of his whip and without waiting for the riders permission he lashed the unfortunate animal with the codline until he succeeded in rousing him thoroughly  it was in vain toby begged him to stop and bob shouted that such a course was not the proper one for a ringmaster to pursue reddy was determined the rider should have an opportunity of trying the horse under full speed and the result was that the animal broke loose from bobs guiding hand rushing out of the imaginary ring into the centre of the pasture at a rate of speed that would have surprised and frightened mr douglass had he been there to see it  shaken first up then down and from one side to the other toby stretched himself out at full length clasping the horse around the neck as the patched bridle broke and shouting whoa at the full strength of his lungs  after running fully fifty yards until it seemed to toby that his head and his body had been pounded into one the horse stopped leaned one heel up against the other and stood as if dreamily asking whether they wanted any more circus out of him  couldnt anybody ride him he jolts so said toby to his partners as they came running up to where he stood trying to find out whether or not his tongue was bleeding and fearing it was because his teeth had been pounded down on it so hard two or three times you see in the circus they had big wide saddles an the hosses didnt go anything like him  well we can fix a saddle said bob thoughtfully but i dont know as we could do anything to the hoss  perhaps old whiteyll go better cause shes lame suggested reddy feeling that considerable credit was due him for having made it possible to test the animals qualities in so short a time  i wouldnt wonder if this one would be all right when he gets a saddle on an is trained said joe and then he added quickly i haint got anything more to do today an ill stay up here an train him  the partners were only too glad to accept this offer and while joe led the horse back to the supposed ring ben gave a partial exhibition of his acrobatic feats omitting the most difficult owing to the uneven surface of the land  then the partners retired to the shade of some alder bushes where they could fight mosquitoes and talk over their plans at the same time while joe was perspiring in his selfimposed task of educating the blind horse     chapter iii  abner bolton   now ill see about makin the saddle said bob cause ive seen em a good many times in a circus an i know jest how theyre made while im doin that you fellers must be fixin bout who else well have in the show leander leighton will come up here tomorrow sos we can hear how he plays an we must have everything fixed by then  why didnt he come today asked ben thinking that all the members of the firm should have been present at this first rehearsal  well you see he had to split some wood an he had to take care of the baby i offered to help him with the wood but he said he couldnt get away any quicker if i did for just as soon as the baby saw another feller waitin round shed yell so awful hard hed have to stay in all day  this explanation as to the absence of the band appeared to be perfectly satisfactory to those present and they began to discuss the merits of certain of their companions in order to decide upon the proper ones to enlist as members since the number of their performers was not so large as they thought it should be in a show where an admission fee of three cents was to be charged  just as they were getting well into their discussion and of course speaking of such matters as managers should keep a profound secret from the public bob cried out  there comes abner bolton hes always runnin round where he haint wanted an i wonder how he come to know we was here ill send him off mighty quick now you see  the boy who had disturbed bob so greatly was so near when he was first discovered that by the time the threat had been uttered he was close upon them he was a small boy not more than eight years old and hardly as large as a boy of six should be he walked on crutches because of his deformed legs which hung withered and useless barely capable of supporting his slight weight  now what do you want asked bob in an angry tone  i dont want anything was the mild reply as the cripple halted just outside the shade as if not daring to come any farther until invited i heard you was goin to get up a circus an i thought perhaps youd let me watch you cause i wouldnt bother you any  you would bother us an you cant stay round here for we haint goin to have anybody watchin us you may come to the show if you can get three cents  i dont spose i could do that said the boy looking longingly towards the shade but still standing in the sun i dont have any chance to get money an i do wish you boys would let me stay where you are for its so awful lonesome out to the poorfarm an i cant run around as you can  well you cant stay here an the sooner you go back to the village the better well like it for we dont want anybody to know what were talkin about  toby had attempted to speak once or twice while bob was engaged with the cripple from the poorfarm but he did not get an opportunity until abner turned to go away looking thoroughly sad and disheartened  dont go abner but come and set down here where its cool an perhaps we can fix it for you  the cripple turned as toby spoke and the look which came into his face went right to the heart of the boy who for ten long weeks had known what it was to be almost entirely without a friend  i dont see what you want him round here for said bob petulantly as abner seated himself by tobys side thoroughly exhausted by his long walk he cant do nothin an if he could we dont want no fellers from the poorfarm mixed up with the show  it dont make any difference if he does live to the poorfarm said toby as he put his little brown hand on abners thin fingers he has to stay there cause his father and mothers dead an perhaps id been there cept for uncle danl if id thought before about his bein lonesome an not bein able to play like the rest of us id gone out to see him an now we do know it well let him stay with us an perhaps he can do something in the circus  the fellers will laugh at us an say were runnin a poorhouse show replied bob sulkily  well let em laugh well feel a good deal bettern they do cause well know were tryin to let a little feller have some fun what dont get many chances and in his excitement toby spoke so loudly that joe came running up to see what was the matter  let him stay round here today cause weve got all through practisin an then tell him to keep away said ben thinking this idea a very generous one  he can belong to the show jest as well as not an if you fellers will let him ill give you my part of all the money we make  this proposition of tobys put the matter on a very different basis and both ben and bob now looked favorably inclined towards it  dont you do that toby said abner his eyes filling with tears because of the kindness shown him ill go right away an i wont come into the village again to bother you  you shall come into the village every day abner an you wont bother us at all for you shall go long of me everywhere i do an i wont never walk any fastern you can and toby moved his seat nearer abner to show that he took him under his especial care  he might help tend the door said joe kindly anxious to please toby an thatll give me a chance to do more howlin for the hyenas cause thatll be bout all i oughter do if i have to hold the hoops  yes he can do that and toby was very eager now an we can get him a stool to sit on an he can do jest as much as if he could stand up  by this time bob and ben had decided that in consideration of tobys offer abner should be counted as one of the company and the matters under discussion that had been interrupted by the cripples coming were again taken up  owing to the possible chance that joe could not succeed in training the blind horse sufficiently to make him useful in the ring it was necessary to know just what animals they could procure and bob offered to see chandler merrill for the purpose of securing the services of his mexican pony who had never allowed any one to ride him without first having a severe battle  we can train him down all right said bob an you fellers come down now while i find out bout the pony sos we can come back here after dinner  as it was very important that this matter should be settled as soon as possible bobs advice was acted upon and as the boys started to go toby said  come abner you come home with me an get some dinner an then you can come back here when i do  bob was disposed to make sport of this sudden friendship but toby paid no attention to what he said and if any of them wanted to talk with him they too were obliged to walk with the boy from the poorfarm  by the time they arrived at uncle daniels toby had formed many plans for making the life of the homeless boy more cheerful than it ever had been     chapter iv  the pony   tobys interest in the crippled boy whom he had taken under his charge was considerably greater than in the contemplated circus and both bob and ben felt angry and injured when in the midst of some brilliant plan for startling those of the good people of guilford who should come to their circus toby would stop to say something to abner who was hobbling along as fast as possible in order that he might not oblige the party to wait for him  for a number of years toby had known that there was a crippled orphan at the poorfarm but it so happened that he had not met him very often and even then he had no idea of the lonely life the boy was obliged to lead  on the way to the village he had formed several plans by which he might aid abner but none of them could be put into operation until after he had consulted uncle daniel and aunt olive  it was nearly noon and the understanding was that each one should get his dinner and go to the pasture again when it would be known whether they were to be able to number chandler merrills pony among the attractions of their show or be wholly dependent upon the disabled horses that as yet made up their collection  youre comin to get dinner with me abner said toby as he stopped in front of uncle daniels gate while the little fellow was continuing on his way to the only place he could call home there to get his dinner with the other paupers  im afraid your aunt wont want me he said shyly while it was plain to be seen that he would be more than well pleased to accept the invitation  aunt olive wont care a bit an shell be glad to have you i know cause she says it always does her good to see hungry people eat though if thats so i must have done her an awful sight of good lots of times for it dont seem to me i ever set down to the table in my life but what i was awful hungry come on now sos well have time to get our hands an faces washed before the dinnerbell rings  abner followed toby in a hesitating way much as if he expected each moment to be ordered back and when they arrived at the door he stood on the threshold not daring to enter until permission had been given  this is abner bolton uncle danl said toby as he saw that his newly made friend would not come in without an invitation from some one besides himself he lives out to the poorfarm an he dont have any such nice home as ive got so i thought you wouldnt care if i brought him in to dinner  youve got a good heart toby boy and the lord will reward you for it said uncle daniel as he stroked the boys refractory hair and then he said to abner come in my lad and share tobys dinner nor need you ever hesitate about accepting any such invitation when it leads you here  then aunt olive greeted abner so kindly that the poor boy hardly knew whether it was reality or a dream so strange was it all to him  during the dinner toby told of the difficulty he had had in getting his partners to consent to abners being one of the company and aunt olive who had shown considerable interest in the circus scheme said  why dont you let him keep a stand and then he can make some money for himself i will bake him a lot of doughnuts and gingersnaps and your uncle danl will lend him money enough to buy lemons an sugar it will be a deal better than to have nahum baker there with his pies that are as heavy as lead an doughnuts that have soaked up all the fat in the pan  toby was delighted with the plan and abners eyes glistened at the mere idea that it might be possible for him to do once in his life at least as did other and more fortunate boys  it certainly seemed when they arrived at the pasture again as if everything was conspiring in favor of their circus for chandler merrill had willingly consented to let them use his pony but he had done so with the kindly prophecy that the little animal would kick their brains out if they were not careful with him  in order to make sure that the consent would not be withdrawn and at the same time to prove that he told the truth bob had brought the pony with him and judging from his general appearance as he stood gazing suspiciously at the douglass horse he deserved all that was said of him regarding his vicious qualities he was about half the size of an ordinary horse and his coat was raggedlooking owing to its having been rubbed off in spots thus giving him the air of just such a pony as one would suppose willing to join a party of boys in starting a circus  now theres a hoss that haint either lame or blind said bob proudly as he led the pony once around the ring to show his partners how he stepped if he was intending to say anything more he concluded to defer it while he made some very rapid movements in order to escape the blow the hoss aimed at him with his hindfeet  kicks dont he said toby in a tone which plainly told he did not think him very well suited to their purpose  well he did then and bob fastened the halter more securely by putting one end of the rope through the ponys mouth but you see thats cause he haint been used much an hes tickled cause hes goin to belong to a circus  how long before hell get over bein tickled asked joe im willin to train jack douglasss hoss but i dont know bout this one till he gets sorry enough not to kick  oh hell be all right jest as soon as toby rides him round the ring a little while  do you think im goin to ride him asked toby beginning to believe his partners expected more of him than ever mr castle did  of course a feller whats been with a circus ought to know how to ride any hoss that ever lived replied bob with considerable emphasis owing to the fact that the pony kicked and plunged so that his words were jerked out of him rather than spoken  i spose some fellers can but i wasnt with the circus long enough to find out how to ride such hosses as them and toby retired to the shade of the alder bushes where abner was sitting to wait until bob and the pony had come to terms  it was quite as much as bob could do to hold his prize without trying to make any arrangements for having him ridden and he called reddy to help him  now as the ringmaster of the contemplated circus reddy ought to have known all about horses and he thought he did until the pony made one plunge just as he came up smiling with whip in hand then he said as he ran towards toby  i dont believe i want to be ringmaster if were goin to have that hoss  here joe you help me cried bob in desperation growing each moment more afraid of the steed i want to get him up by the fence where we can hitch him till we find out what to do with him  joe was perfectly willing to assist the unfortunate clown in his troubles but as he started towards him the pony wheeled and flung his heels out with a force that showed he would do some damage if he could and joe also joined the party among the bushes  bob was thus left alone with his prize and a most uncomfortable time he appeared to be having of it standing there in the hot sun clinging desperately to the halter and jumping from one side to the other when the pony attempted to bite or strike him with his forefeet  let him go he haint any good shouted reddy from his secure retreat  if i let go the halter hell jump right at me and there was a certain ring in bobs voice that told he was afraid  hitch him to the fence an then climb over suggested joe  but i cant get him over there for he wont go a step and bob continued to hold fast to the halter afraid to do so but still more afraid to let go  he had borrowed the pony but it certainly seemed as if the animal had borrowed him for his fear caused him to cling desperately to the halter as the only possible means of saving his life  the boys under the alder bushes were fully alive to the fact that something should be done although they were undecided as to what that something should be  joe proposed that they all rush out and scare the pony away but bob insisted that he would be the sufferer by such a course reddy thought if bob should show more spirit and let the vicious little animal see that he was not afraid of him everything would be all right but when it was proposed that he try the plan himself he concluded perhaps there might be serious objections to such a course  ben thought if all of them got hold of the halter they could pull the pony to the fence and this plan was looked upon with such favor that it was adopted at once  every one except abner took hold of the halter after some little delay in getting there owing to the readiness of the pony to use his heels at the slightest provocation and just when they were about to put forth all their strength in pulling the pony jumped towards them suddenly rendering their efforts useless and starting all save bob back to the alder bushes in ignominious flight  bob still remained at his post or more correctly speaking the halter and it was very much against his will that he did so  i wish chandler merrill would come up here an get his old hoss for i dont want him any longer he said angrily he ought to be prosecuted for lettin us have such a old tiger  bob did not seem to remember that if he had refused the loan of the pony he would have considered chandler merrill very selfish in fact he hardly remembered anything save his own desire to get rid of the animal and as quickly as possible  what shall i do he cried in desperation i cant stand here all day an the hoss dont mean to let me get away  weve got to help bob said toby decidedly as he arose to his feet again and went towards the unfortunate clown if you fellers will try to hold him ill get on his back an then bob can get away  but hell throw you off an hurt you objected abner trying to prevent his newly made friend from going  i can stop him from doing that an its the only way i know of to help bob  you get on toby an then ill scoot jest as soon as you get hold of the halter said bob happy at this prospect of being relieved then when you get a chance you jump off an well let somebody else take him home  it was a hard task and they all ran considerable risk of getting kicked but at last it was accomplished so far as mounting was concerned toby was on the ponys back with a firm grasp of the rope that was made to serve as bridle  now be all ready to run he said and there was no disposition to linger shown by any of his friends  let go he shouted and at the sound of his voice the boys went one way and the pony another at full speed  it was not until the wouldbe circus managers were within the shelter of the clump of bushes that they stopped to look for their partner and then they saw him at the further end of the pasture the pony running and leaping as if doing his best to dislodge his rider  even the douglass horse seemed to be excited by the display of spirit for he capered around in a manner very unbecoming one as old and blind as he  only for a few moments could they watch the contest and then the distant trees hid toby tyler and chandler merrills pony from view     chapter v  old ben   some time the boys watched for tobys return and just as they were beginning to think they ought to go in search of him and fearing lest he had been hurt by the vicious pony they saw him coming from among the trees alone and on foot  well said bob with a sigh of relief hes got rid of the hoss an that was all we wanted  tobys story when at last hot and tired he reached the alder bushes was not nearly so exciting as his partners anticipated he had clung to the pony until they entered the woods where he was brushed off by the branches of the trees as easily as if he had been a fly and with as little damage  how they should get the pony back into its owners keeping was a question difficult to answer and they were all so completely worn out by their exertions to get rid of him that they did not attempt to come to any conclusion regarding it  while they were resting from their labors and before they had ceased to congratulate each other that they had succeeded in separating themselves from the pony leander leighton his accordion under his arm and his clappers in his hand made his appearance  his struggle with the baby had evidently come to an end sooner than he had dared hope and the managers were happy at this speedy prospect of hearing what their band could do in the way of music  boys shouted leander excitedly while he was some distance away theres a real circus comin here next weekthe same one toby tyler run away withan the men are pastin up the bills now down to the village  the boys looked at each other in surprise it had never entered into their calculations that they might have a real circus as a rival and certainly toby had never thought he would again see those whom he had first run away with and then run away from he was rather disturbed by the prospect at first for it seemed certain that job lord and mr castle would try to compel him to go with them but a moments thought convinced him that uncle daniel would not allow them to carry him away and he grew as eager for more news as any of the others  leander knew no more than he had already told after having been relieved from his care of the baby he had started for the pasture and had seen the showbills as he came along he was certain it was the same circus toby had gone with for the names on the bills were the same and he had heard some of the townspeople say so as he came along  an i shall see the skeleton an the fat woman again said toby delighted at the idea of meeting those kind friends from whom he had thought himself parted with forever  dont you spose you could get em to leave that show an come with ours asked bob thinking perhaps some kind fortune had thrown this opportunity in their way that they might the better succeed in their project  toby was not sure such a plan could be made to work for the reason that they were only intending to give two or three performances and mr and mrs treat might not think it worth their while to leave the circus they were with on the strength of such uncertain prospects  and you shall go to the show abner said toby pleased at the opportunity he would have of making the crippled boy happy for one day at least an ill take all of you fellers down an get the skeleton to talk at you sos you can see how nice he is you shall see his wife an old ben an ella an  but wont you be afraid of job lord interrupted leander fearful lest tobys dread of meeting his old employer might prevent them from having all this promised enjoyment  uncle danl wouldnt let him take me away an now im home here i dont believe old ben would let him touch me  there was evidently no probability that they would transact any more business relative to their own circus that day so intent were they on talking about the one that was to come and it was not until nearly time to drive the cows home that they remembered the presence of their band  ben proposed that leander should show them what he could do in the way of music so that he need not be at the trouble of bringing his accordion up into the pasture again and the boys ceased all conversation for the purpose of listening to the socalled melody  after considerable preparation in the way of polishing his clappers on the cuff of his jacket and fingering the keys of his accordion to make sure they were in proper working order leander extracted with one finger a few bars of yankee doodle from the lastnamed instrument and gave an imitation of a drum with the clappers in a manner that won for him no small amount of applause  now well go home said toby cause uncle danl will be waitin for me an the cows an tomorrow ill meet you downtown where the circus pictures be  then he helped abner on to his crutches and walked beside him all the way wishing oh so much that he could save the poor boy from having to go out to the poorfarm to sleep  you come in just as early as you can in the mornin abner an you shall eat dinner with me he said as he parted with the boy at uncle daniels gate an perhaps youll make so much money at our circus that you wont ever have to go out to the poorfarm again  abner tried to thank his friend for the kindness he had shown him but the sobs of gratitude came into his throat so fast that it was impossible and he hobbled away towards his dreary home while toby ran into the house to tell the astounding news of the coming of the circus  so all the people who were so kind to you will be here next week will they said rather than asked aunt olive well toby well kill one of the lambs an you shall invite them up here to dinner which will kind of encourage them to be good to any other little boy who may be as foolish as you were  toby lay awake a long time that night thinking of the pleasure he was to have in seeing mr and mrs treat old ben and little ella eating dinner in uncle daniels home and of how good a boy he ought to be to repay his uncle and aunt for their lovingkindness to him  operations were almost entirely suspended by the wouldbe circus managers in view of the coming of the real show it would have been commercial folly to attempt to enter into competition with it the real circus would without a doubt prove too strong a rival for them to contend against and by waiting until after it had come and gone they might be able to pick up some useful ideas regarding the show they proposed to give  this delay would be to their advantage in a great many other ways the band would have so much time for practice that he might learn another tune or even be able to play with more than one finger their acrobat would have so many rehearsals that he could perhaps double his present allowance of handsprings and joe would be able to bring his horses to a more perfect state of training  mr douglass having no use for his horse was perfectly willing he should remain under joes tuition providing it was done in uncle daniels pasture but matters were not in so good a condition regarding the pony  chandler merrill was anxious to have his property returned to him and not willing to go after it besides mr douglasss horse was in great danger of being kicked to death so long as the vicious little animal remained in the same pasture  very many were the discussions the boys had on the subject but nothing could be suggested which promised any relief after bobs brilliant idea of driving the pony out and letting him find his way home as best he might was tried without success the pony not only refused to go out but he actually drove the boys away by the liberal use he made of his heels  slowly the time passed until the day before the one on which the circus was to arrive toby had almost been counting the hours and abner who was to see the interior of a circus tent for the first time in his life was quite as excited as he  the lamb had been killed as aunt olive had promised and a rare store of good things in the way of applepies cake doughnuts and custards had been prepared until the pantry looked like a largesized bakers shop just opened for inspection  everything was ready for the guests who were to be invited to dinner next day and when toby went to bed that night it seemed as if he would never get to sleep for thinking of all the friends he was to see  abner was in quite as sleepless a condition as toby aunt olive had invited him to remain overnight so that he might see everything that was going on and as he lay in the soft geraniumscented bed his eyes were kept wide open by his delight with what seemed to him the magnificence of the room  it seemed as though each boy in the village considered himself tobys particular and intimate friend during the week that preceded the coming of the circus and the marbles balls and boats that were showered upon him in the way of gifts would almost have stocked a small shop  then on this day before the circus all the boys in town were most anxious to know just where toby proposed meeting the cavalcade at what time he was to start and other details which showed quite plainly it was their intention to accompany him if possible  when toby went to bed it was with the express understanding with uncle daniel that he was to be called at daylight in order that he might start out to meet the circus when it stopped to prepare for its entrance into the town the place where the procession was usually formed was fully two miles from town and as abner could hardly walk that distance and certainly could not walk so fast as toby would want to go he had agreed to drive the cows to pasture after which he was to go to the tentingground where his friend would introduce him to all the celebrities     chapter vi  the great event   uncle daniel seemed quite as anxious as toby that he should leave the house in time to meet his circus friends before the entrée was made and aunt olive afterwards said he didnt sleep a wink after two oclock for fear he might not waken in time to rouse the anxious boy  it was fully an hour before sunrise when uncle daniel awakened toby and cautioned him to eat as much of the lunch aunt olive had set out as possible insisting that what he could not eat he should put into his pocket as it would be a long while before he would get his dinner  the two miles toby was obliged to walk seemed very short ones and at nearly every house on the road one or more boys were watching for him quite as eagerly as for the show itself so that by the time he arrived at the place where two or three of the wagons had drawn up by the side of the road he had as many as a hundred boys for an escort all of whom were urging him to get the manager to take out a few lions and tigers for their inspection before starting for the village  toby could hold out no promise to them on the contrary he insisted that he hardly knew the manager save by sight and explained to them that they were unwise to come with him on any such errand since none of the curiosities could be seen there and if old ben were still with the company he should ride back with him  but the boys put very little faith in what he said seeming to have the idea that he simply wanted to get rid of them and instead of going away they surrounded him more closely  toby watched anxiously as each wagon came up and he failed to recognize any of the drivers for the first time it occurred to him that perhaps those whom he knew were no longer with this particular company and his elation gave way to sadness  fully twenty wagons had come and he had just begun to think his fears had good foundation when in the distance he saw the wellremembered monkeywagon with the burly form of old ben on the box  toby could not wait for that particular team to come up even though it was driven at a reasonably rapid speed but he started towards it as fast as he could run and following him something like the tail of a comet were all his friends who having come so far were determined not to lose sight of him for a single instant if it could be prevented by any exertions on their part  old ben was driving in a sleepy sort of way and paid no attention to the little fellow who was running towards him until toby shouted and then the horses were stopped with a jerk that nearly threw them back on their haunches  well toby my son i declare i am glad to see you and old ben reached down for the double purpose of shaking hands and helping the boy on to the seat beside him well well well its been some time since youve been on this ere box haint it id kinder forgotten what town it was we took you from i knew it was somewhere hereabouts though an ive kept my eye peeled for you ever since weve been in this part of the country so you found your uncle danl all right did you  yes ben an he was awful good to me when i got home but mr stubbs got shot  no you dont tell me how did that happen  then toby told the story of his pets death and although it had occurred a year before he could not keep the tears from his eyes as he spoke of it  you mustnt feel bad bout it toby said ben consolingly for you see monkeys has got to die jest like folks an your stubbs was sich a old feller that i reckon hed died anyhow before long but ive got one in the wagon here that looks a good deal like yours an ill show him to you  as ben spoke he drew his wagon now completely surrounded by boys up by the side of the road near the others and opened the panel in the top so that toby could have a view of his passengers  curled up in the corner nearest the roof where mr stubbs had been in the habit of sitting toby saw as ben had said a monkey that looked remarkably like mr stubbs save that he was younger and not so sedate  toby uttered an exclamation of surprise and joy as he pushed his hand through the bars of the cage and the monkey shook hands with him as mr stubbs used to do when greeted in the morning  why i never knew before that mr stubbs had any relations said toby looking around with joy imprinted on every feature do you know where the rest of the family is ben  there was no reply from the driver for some time but instead toby heard certain familiar sounds as if the old man were choking while his face took on the purplish tinge which had so alarmed the boy when he saw it for the first time  no i dont know where his family is said ben after he had recovered from his spasm of silent laughter an i reckon he dont know nor care say toby you dont really think this one is any relation to your monkey do you  why it must be his brother said toby earnestly cause they look so much alike but perhaps mr stubbs was only his cousin  old ben relapsed into another spasm and toby talked to the monkey who chattered back at him until the boys on the ground were in a perfect ferment of anxiety to know what was going on  it was some time before toby could be persuaded to pay attention to anything else so engrossed was he with mr stubbss brother as he persisted in calling the monkey and the only way ben could engage him in conversation was by saying  you dont seem to be very much afraid of job lord now  you wont let him take me away if he should try will you toby asked quickly alarmed at the very mention of his former employers name even though he had thought he would not be afraid of him protected as he now was by uncle daniel  no toby i wouldnt let him if he was to try it on for you are just where every boy ought to be an thats at home but jobs where he cant whip any more boys for some time to come  wheres that  hes in jail about a month after you left he licked his new boy so bad that they arrested him an he got two years for it cause it pretty nigh made a cripple out of the youngster  toby was about to make some reply but ben continued unfolding his budget of news  castle stayed with us till the season was over an then he went out west i dont know whether he got his hair cut trying to show the injuns how to ride or not but he never come back an nobody i ever saw has heard anything about him  are mr and mrs treat with the show  yes theyre still here hes a leetle thinner i believe an shes twenty pound heavier she says she weighs fifty pounds moren she did but i dont believe that even if she did strike for five dollars more a week this season on the strength of it an get it they keep right on cookin up dinners an invitin of folks in an the skeleton gets choked about the same as when you was with the show i dont know how it is that a feller so thin as treat is can eat so much  uncle danl says its cause he works so hard to get full said toby quietly an i shouldnt wonder if i grew as thin as the skeleton one of these days for i eat jest as awful much as i used to  well you look as if you got about all you needed at any rate said ben as he mentally compared the plump boy at his side with the thin frightenedlooking one who had run away from the circus with his monkey on his shoulder and his bundle under his arm  is ella here asked toby after a pause during which it seemed as if he were thinking of much the same thing that ben was  yes an she keeps talkin about what big cards you an her would have been if you had only stayed with the show but im glad you had pluck enough to run away toby for a life like this haint no fit one for boys  and i was glad to get back to uncle danl said toby with a great deal of emphasis i wouldnt go away without he wanted me to if i could go with a circus seven times as large as this do you suppose young stubbs would act bad if i was to take him for a walk  who asked ben looking down at the crowd of boys with no slight show of perplexity  mr stubbss brother and toby motioned to the door of the cage id like to take him up in my arms cause it would seem so much like it used to before his brother died  ben was seized with one of the very worst laughing spasms toby had ever seen and there was every danger that he would roll off the seat before he could control himself but he did recover after a time and as the purple hue slowly receded from his face he said  ill tell you what well do toby you come to the tent when the afternoon performance is over an ill fix it sos you shall see mr stubbss brother as much as you want to  just then toby remembered that ben was to be his guest for a while that day and after explaining all aunt olive had done in the way of preparing dainties invited him to dinner  ill come toby because its to see you an them that has been good to you said ben slowly and after quite a long pause but there haint anybody else i know of who could coax me out to dinner for you see rough fellows like me haint fit to go around much except among our own kind but say toby your uncle danl haint right on his speech is he  toby looked so puzzled that ben saw he had not been understood and he explained  i mean he dont get up a dinner for the sake of havin a chance to make a speech like the skeleton does he eh  oh no uncle danl dont do that i know youll like him when you see him  and i believe i shall toby said ben speaking very seriously id be sure to because hes such a good uncle to you  just then the conversation was interrupted by the orders to prepare for the parade and as the manager drove up to see that everything was done properly he stopped to speak with and congratulate toby on being home again a condescension on his part that caused a lively feeling of envy in the breasts of the other boys because they had not been so honored     chapter vii  attractions for the little circus   while he stood there the wagon in which the skeleton and his wife travelled rolled past but toby knew they were still sleeping and would continue to do so until their tent was ready for them to go into  the carriage in which the women of the company rode also passed him and he almost fancied he could see ella sitting in one of the seats sleeping with her head on her mothers shoulder as she had slept on the stormy night when his head was nearly jerked from his body as he tried to sleep while sitting upright  there were but three of the drivers who had been with the circus the year before and after speaking with them he stood by the side of the road and watched the preparations for the entrée with feelings far different from those with which he had observed such preparations in that dreary time when he expected each moment to hear job lord order him to attend to his work  the other boys crowded quite as close to him as they could get as if by this means they allied themselves in some way with the show and when a drove of ponies were led past joe robinson said longingly  there toby if we had one or two of them to train it would be different work from what it is to make the douglass boss remember his way round the ring  you wouldnt have to train them any began toby and then he had no time to say anything more for ben who had been talking with the manager called to him  has your uncle danl got plenty of pasturage asked ben when the boy approached him  well hes got twenty acres up by the stone quarry an he keeps three cows on it an jack douglasss hoss that dont count for hes only there till we boys have our circus said toby never for a moment dreaming of the good fortune that was in store for him  so youre goin to have a circus of your own eh asked ben with a smile that alarmed toby because he feared it was a signal for one of those terrible laughing spells  were only goin to have a little threecent one replied toby modestly noting with satisfaction that bens mirth had gone no further than the smile  two of our ponies are about used up said the manager and weve got to leave them somewhere ben tells me he is going to see your uncle danl this noon so suppose you take one of these boys and ride them up to the pasture ben will make a bargain with your uncle for their keeping and you can use them in your circus if you want to  joe robinson actually jumped for joy as he heard this and tobys delight spread itself all over his face while bob atwood and ben gushing went near the fence where they stood on their heads as a way of expressing their elation at thus being able to have real live ponies in their circus  a black and a red pony were the ones pointed out for toby to take away and they were not more than twice as large as newfoundland dogs they were in fact just exactly what was wanted for a little circus such as the boys were about to start  joe was so puffed up with pride at being allowed to ride one of these ponies through the village that if his mind could have affected his body he would not have weighed more than a pound and he held his head so high that it seemed a matter of impossibility for him to see his feet  very much surprised were uncle daniel and aunt olive at seeing toby and joe dash into the yard astride of these miniature horses just as they were sitting down to breakfast and when the matter had been explained abner appeared quite as much pleased that the boys would have this attraction in their circus as if he were the sole proprietor of it  it was with the greatest reluctance that either of the boys left his pony in the stableyard and sat down to breakfast so eager was joe to get back to the tentingground to see what was going on and so anxious was toby to see the skeleton and his wife as soon as possible but they ate because uncle daniel insisted that they should do so and when breakfast was over he advised that the ponies be left in the stable until chandler merrills pony could be removed from the pasture  when they started down town again abner went with them and it was so late in the morning that toby was sure the skeleton and his wife would be prepared to receive visitors  when toby abner and joe reached the tentingground everything was in that delightful state of bustle and confusion which is attendant upon the exhibition of a circus in a country town where the company do not expect that the tent will be more than half filled and where in consequence the programme will be considerably shortened  it did not require much search on tobys part to find the tent wherein the skeleton and his wife exhibited their contrasting figures for the pictures which hung outside were so gaudy and of such an unusually large size that they commanded the attention of every visitor  now im goin in to see em said toby first making sure that the exhibition had not begun an joe you take abner over sos he can see how nahum baker keeps a stand an then hell know what to do when we have our circus ill come back here for you pretty soon  then toby ran around to the rear of the tent where he knew he would find a private entrance thus running less risk of receiving a blow on the head from some watchful attendant and in a few moments he stood before mr and mrs treat who having just completed their preparations were about to announce that the exhibition could be opened  why toby tyler you dear little thing cried the enormous lady in a joyful tone after she had looked at the boy intently for a moment to make sure he was really the one whom she had rescued several times from job lords brutality and then she took him in her fat arms hugging him much as if he were a lemon and she an unusually large squeezer where did you come from how have you been did you find your uncle daniel  her embrace was so vigorous that it was some seconds after she had released him before he could make any reply and while he was trying to get his breath the fleshless mr treat took him solemnly by the hand and cleared his throat as if he were determined to take advantage of the occasion to make one of his famous speeches  my dear mr tyler he said squeezing tobys hand until it ached it is almost impossible for me to express the joy i feel at meeting you once more welilly and ihave looked forward to such a moment as this with a great deal of impatience and even during our most prosperous exhibitions we have found time to speak of you  there there samuel dont take up so much time with your longwinded talk but let me see the dear little fellow myself and mrs treat lifted her slim husband into a chair where he was out of her way and again greeted toby by kissing him on both cheeks with a resounding smack that rivalled anything reddy grant had yet been able to do in the way of cracking his whip  then she fairly overwhelmed him with questions nor would she allow her husband to say a word until toby had answered them all he was again obliged to tell the story of mr stubbss death of his return home and everything connected with his running away from the circus while all the time the fat lady alternately kissed and hugged him until it seemed as if he would never be able to finish his story  and now that you are home again dont ever think of running away even though i must admit that you made a wonderful success in the ring and mr treat crossed one leg over the other in a triumphant way pleased that he had at last succeeded in getting a chance to speak  toby was very emphatic in his assurances that he should never run away again for he had had quite as much experience in that way as he wanted and after he had finished mrs treat by way of further showing her joy at meeting him once more brought out from a large black trunk fully half a dozen doughnuts each quite as large among their kind as she was among women  now eat every one of them she said as she handed them to toby an it will do me good to see you for you always used to be such a hungry little fellow  toby had already had two breakfasts that morning but he did not wish to refuse the kindly proffered gift and he made every effort to do as she requested though one of the cakes would have been quite a feast for him at his hungriest moment  the food reminded him of the dinnerinvitation he was to deliver and as he forced down the rather heavy cake he said  aunt olives killed a lamb an made an awful lot of things for dinner today an uncle danl says hed be glad to have you come up bens coming an im goin to find ella sos to have her come an well have a good time  lilly an i will be pleased to see your aunts lamb and we shall be delighted to meet your uncle daniel replied the skeleton before his wife could speak and then a faraway look came into his eyes as if he could already taste or at least smell the feast in which he was certain he should take so much pleasure  thats just the way with samuel said mrs treat as if she would offer some apology for the almost greedy way in which her husband accepted the invitation hes always thinking so much about eating that im afraid hell begin to fat up and then i shall have to support both of us  now my dearand mr treat used a tone of mild reproofwhy should you have such ideas and why express them before our friend mr tyler ive eaten considerable perhaps at times but during ten years you have never seen me grow an ounce the fatter and surely i have grown some leaner in that time  yes yes sammy i know it and you shall eat all you can get only try not to show that you think so much about it then turning to toby she said hes such a trial sam is well go to see your uncle toby and we should be very glad to do so even if we wasnt going for dinner  ben an me will come round when its time to go said toby and then in a hesitating way he added abners out herehes a cripple that lives out to the poorfarman he never saw a circus or anything cant i bring him in here a minute before you open the show  of course you can toby my dear and you may bring all your friends well give an exhibition especially for them we havent got a swordswallower this year and the albino children that you used to know have had to leave the business because albinos got so plenty they couldnt earn their salt but weve got a new snakecharmer and a man without legs and a bearded lady so  so that our entertainment is quite as morally effective and instructively entertaining as ever said mr treat interrupting his wife to speak a good word for the exhibition  toby ran out quickly that he might not delay the regular business any longer than was absolutely necessary and at the very entrance of the tent looking at the pictures in wonder that almost amounted to awe he found abner with his partners and about a dozen other boys  come right in quick fellers said toby breathlessly an you can see the whole show before it commences     chapter viii  the dinner party   the invitation was no sooner given than accepted and in a twinkling every one of those boys was inside the tent looking at the skeleton and the fat woman as though they had been old acquaintances  toby had told mr and mrs treat of the little circus they were intending to have and he introduced to them his partners in the enterprise  the fleshy lilly smiled encouragingly upon them and the skeleton moving his chair slightly to prevent his wife from interrupting him said  i am pleased to meet you gentlemen principally and i might almost say wholly because you are the friends of my old friend mr tyler whatever business relations you may have with him whether in the great profession of the circus or in the humbler walks of life i am sure he will honor the connection  from appearances mr treat would have continued to talk for some time but his wife passed around more doughnuts and the attention of the visitors was so distracted that he was obliged to stop  and this is abner said toby taking advantage of the break in the skeletons speech to lead forward his crippled friend  abner limped blushingly towards the gigantic lady and when both she and her thin husband spoke to him kindly he was so covered with confusion at the honor thus showered upon him that he was hardly able to say a word  but the time was passing rapidly and as there were many persons outside probably waiting for an opportunity to pay their money to see the varied attractions of the show mrs treat gave the signal for the snakecharmer to begin the entertainment which was given as a mark of respect as the skeleton explained to their friend toby tyler  illustration mr and mrs treat exhibit privately  this private exhibition lasted about fifteen minutes and when at its close the doors were thrown open to such of the public as were willing to pay to come in the boys were not at all anxious to leave  let them stay as long as they want to toby said the skeleton indulgently  the boys were only too glad to avail themselves of this permission and toby said to abner  i want to see if i can find ella an you stay here till i come back  ill keep him right here by me said mrs treat and hell be safe enough  remembering how she had served job lord toby had no fears for the safety of his friend he went at once therefore to deliver the invitation to the last of aunt olives expected guests  when after some little time toby returned the boys had satisfied their curiosity so far as the sideshow was concerned and all except abner had left the tent  that he had found ella was evident as that young lady herself skipped along by his side in the greatest possible delight at having met her former riding companion and that she had accepted his invitation to dinner was shown by the scrupulous care with which she was dressed  its time to go up to uncle danls toby whispered to mrs treat an bens harnessin the hosses into your wagon sos you wont have to go to the trouble of puttin on your other clothes  i dont know as we ought to go up there in this rig said mrs treat doubtfully as she looked down at her show dress made to display her arms and neck to the greatest advantage and then at her husbands costume which was as scanty as his body i wanted to dress up when we went there but i dont see how ill get the chance to do it  i wouldnt bother cause uncle danl will like you jest as well that way an it will take you too long said toby impatiently  the skeleton on being consulted as to the matter decided to do as toby wished because by adopting that course they would the sooner get the dinner about which he had been thinking ever since he had received the invitation  but while mrs treat was ready to believe that her costume might be reasonably fit to wear to a dinner party she was certain that something more than tights and a pair of short red velvet trousers was necessary for her husband  mr treat tried to argue with his much larger half insisting that uncle daniel would understand the matter but his wife insisted so strongly and with such determination to have her own way that he compromised by adding to his scanty wardrobe a black frockcoat and a tall silk hat which gave him a rather more comical than distinguished appearance  the audience were dismissed as soon as possible abner was helped into the wagon perfectly delighted at being allowed to ride in a circus van and the party started for uncle daniels  toby sat on the box with ben to show him the way and when the gaudily painted cart stopped in front of the farmhouse it was much as if a peacock had suddenly alighted amid a flock of demure hens  uncle daniel was out in the yard to receive his strangely assorted guests and the greeting they received from both him and aunt olive was as hearty as if they had been old acquaintances  there was a look of calm satisfaction on the skeletons face as the odor of roast lamb was mingled with uncle daniels welcome when he descended from the wagon and as the company were ushered into the foreroom the air of which was pungent with the odors of herbs used to keep the moths from carpet and furniture a restful feeling came over them such as only those whose lives are dreary rounds of travelling can feel  uncle daniel insisted on taking care of the horses himself for his idea of the duties of host would not allow that ben should help him and almost as soon as he had finished this work dinner was ready  when all the guests were at the table and uncle daniel bowed his head to invoke a blessing on those who had befriended the fatherless the look of general discomfort old ben had worn from the time he reached the house passed away and in its place came the peaceful look toby had seen on sundays after the old driver had come from church  it seemed to toby that he had never really known uncle daniel before so jolly was he in his efforts to entertain his guests and the manner in which he portioned out the food keeping the plates well filled all the time was in the highest degree pleasing to mr treat  of course very much was said about the time when toby was an unwilling member of the circus and mrs treat and ben told of the boys experiences in a way that brought many a blush to his cheeks mr treat was too busy with aunt olives lamb as he affectionately spoke of it to be able to say anything he was wonderfully fortunate in not choking himself but once and that was such a trifling matter that it was all over in a moment  old ben told toby that night however that treat would not have got on so well if his wife had not trodden on his toes frequently as a hint to eat more slowly  although abner had spent several hours in the sideshow it seemed as if he would never tire of gazing at mrs treats enormous frame and so intently did he look at her that he missed a good chance of getting a second piece of custard pie though toby nudged him several times to intimate that he could have more as well as not  ben told a number of stories of circus life mrs treat related some of her experiences in trying to prevent her husband from eating too fast ella told aunt olive of the home she and her mother lived in during winter and the hour which had been devoted to this visit passed so pleasantly that every one was sorry when it was ended  youve got a trim little farm here said ben to uncle daniel when the two went out to harness the horses an i reckon that a man who has got land enough to support him is fixed jest about as well as he can be i dont know of anything id rather be than a farmer if i could only get away from circus life  whenever you want to leave that business said uncle daniel solemnly and earnestly you come right here and ill show you the chance to become a farmer  id like to said ben with a sigh of regret that the matter seemed so impossible but ive been with a circus now man an boy goin on fortyone years an i spose i shall always be with one  then he changed the conversation making an arrangement with uncle daniel for pasturing the ponies that were to be left behind and by the time the bargain was completed the horses were at the door  while uncle daniel and old ben had been at the stables mr treat had been showing his liberality by giving aunt olive tickets for the sideshow and circus and inducing her to promise that she and uncle daniel would see both shows he had also given toby fully a dozen circus tickets for distribution among his friends and then as uncle daniel entered he said  i wish to express thanksboth for myself and my wife lillyfor the very kind manner in which you have entertained us today  before he could say anything more the others came to say goodbye and he was disappointed again aunt olive kissed ella several times while the parting with the others was almost as between old friends and the guests started for the tent again more than satisfied with their visit  now toby you look me up jest after the show is out this afternoon an well fix it sos you shall have a chance to talk with mr stubbss brother said ben as they were driving along  as a matter of course toby promised to be there and to bring abner with him  you said that little cripple had to live at the poorfarm didnt you asked ben after quite a long pause  yes an its cause he haint got no father or mother nor no uncle danl like ive got said toby sadly  haint he got any relations anywhere  no uncle danl said he didnt have a soul that he could go to  it must be kinder hard for him to live there alone an i dont spose hell ever be able to walk  toby was not at all certain whether or not abner could ever be cured but he told the old driver what he knew of the lonely life the boy led ben did not appear to hear what was said for he was in one of his deep studies and seemed unconscious of everything except the fact that his horses were going in the proper direction  ill tell you what ill do toby he said after remaining silent until they were nearly at the tent i haint got a child or a chick in the world an ill take care of that boy  toby looked up in surprise as he repeated in a puzzled way  youll take care of him  i dont mean that ill take hold an tote him round but he shall have as much as he needs out of every dollar i get ill see your uncle danl an fix it somehow so hell be taken out of the poorhouse  why ben how good you are and toby looked up at his friend with sincere admiration imprinted on his face  it haint cause im good my lad but if i didnt help that poor fellow in some way id see them big eyes an that pale face of hisn every night i rode on this box alone so you see i only do it for the sake of havin peace said ben with a forced laugh and then he stopped the horses at the rear of mr treats tent now you jump down toby sos to see the skeleton dont break himself all to pieces gettin out for im kinder fraid he will some day id rather drive a hundred monkeys than one sich slim man as him  then ben had a fit of internal laughter caused by his own remark and uncle daniels guests were ready to resume their duties at the circus     chapter ix  mr stubbss brother   it was so near the time for the circus to begin that toby was obliged to hurry considerably in order to distribute among his friends the tickets the skeleton had given him and he advised abner to remain with mrs treat while he did so in order to escape the crowd among which he might get injured  then he gave his tickets to those boys who he knew had no money with which to buy any and so generous was he that when he had finished he had none for himself and abner  that he might not be able to witness the performance did not trouble him very greatly although it would have been a disappointment not to see ella ride but he blamed himself very much because he had not saved a ticket for abner and he hurried to find ben that he might arrange matters for him  the old driver was easily found and still more easily persuaded to grant the favor which permitted abner to view the wonderful sights beneath the almost enchanted canvas  from one menagerie wagon to another toby led his friend as quickly as possible until they stood in front of the monkeys cage where mr stubbss supposed brother was perched as high as possible away from the common herd of monkeys which chatted familiarly with every one who bribed them  toby was in the highest degree excited it seemed as if his pet that had been killed was again before him and he crowded his way up to the bars of the cage dragging abner with him until he was where he could have a full view of the noisy prisoners  toby called to the monkey as he had been in the habit of calling to mr stubbs but now the fellow paid no attention to him whatever there were so many spectators that he could not spend his time upon one unless he were to derive some benefit in return  fortunately so far as his happiness was concerned toby had the means of inducing the monkey to visit him for in his pocket yet remained two of the doughnuts mrs treat had almost forced upon him and remembering how fond mr stubbs had been of such sweet food he held a piece out to the supposed brother  almost immediately that monkey made up his mind that the frecklefaced boy with the doughnut was the one particular person whom he should be acquainted with and he came down from his perch at a rapid rate  so long as toby was willing to feed him with doughnuts he was willing to remain but when his companions gathered around in such numbers that the supply of food was quickly exhausted he went back to his lofty perch much to the boys regret  he looks like mr stubbs and he acts like him an it must be his brother sure said toby to himself as abner hurried him away to look at the other curiosities when he was at some distance from the cage he turned and said goodbye as if he were speaking to his old pet  during the performance that afternoon abner was in a delightful whirl of wonder and amazement but tobys attention was divided between what was going on in the ring and the thought of having mr stubbss brother all to himself as soon as the performance should be over  he did however watch the boy who sold peanuts and lemonade but this one was much larger than himself and looked rough enough to endure the hardships of such a life  toby was also attentive when ella was in the ring and he was envied by all his acquaintances when she smiled as she passed the place where he was sitting  abner would have been glad if the performance had been prolonged until midnight but toby still thinking of mr stubbss brother was pleased when it ended  he and abner waited by the animals cages until the crowd had again satisfied their curiosity and as the last visitor was leaving the tent old ben came in followed by mr and mrs treat both in exhibition costume  toby was somewhat surprised at seeing them for he knew their busiest time was just at the close of the circus and while he was yet wondering at their coming he saw ella approaching from the direction of the dressingtent  he had not much time to spend in speculation however for ben said as he came up  now boy you shall see mr stubbss brother and talk to him just as long as you want to  the skeleton and his wife and ella looked at each other and smiled in a queer way as ben said this but toby was too much excited at the idea of having the monkey in his arms to pay any attention to what was going on around him  ben unlocking the door of the cage succeeded after considerable trouble in catching the particular inmate he wanted and handing him to toby said  now lets see if he knows you as well as stubbs did  toby took the monkey in his arms with a glad cry of delight and fondled him as if he really were the pet he had lost  whether it was because the animal knew that the boy was petting him or because he had been treated harshly and was willing to make friends with the first one who was kind to him it is difficult to say certain it is that as soon as he found himself in tobys arms he nestled down with his face by the boys neck remaining there as contentedly as if the two had been friends for years  there dont you see he knows me cried the boy in delight and then he sat down upon the ground caressing the animal and whispering all sorts of loving words in his ear  he does seem to act as if he had been introduced to you said old ben with a chuckle it would be kinder nice if you could keep him wouldnt it  deed it would replied toby earnestly id give everything ive got if i could have him for he does act so much like mr stubbs it seems as if it must be him  then ella whispered something to the old driver the skeleton bestowed a very mysterious wink upon him the fat woman nodded her head till her cheeks shook like two balls of very soft butter and abner looked curiously on wondering what was the matter with tobys friends  he soon found out what it was however for ben after indulging in one of his laughing spasms asked  whose monkey is that youve got in your arms toby  why it belongs to the circus dont it and the boy looked up in surprise  no it dont belong to the circus it belongs to youthats who owns it  me mine why ben  toby was so completely bewildered as to be unable to say a word and just as he was beginning to think it some joke ben said  the skeleton an his wife an ella and i bought that monkey this forenoon an we give him to you sos youll still be able to have a mr stubbs in the family  oh ben was all toby could say with the monkey tightly clasped in his arms he took the old driver by the hand but just then the skeleton stepped forward holding something which glistened  mr tyler he said in his usual speechmaking style when our friend ben told us this morning about your having discovered mr stubbss brother we sent out and got this collar for the monkey and we take the greatest possible pride in presenting it to you although if it had been something that my lilly could have made with her own fair fingers i should have liked it better  as he ceased speaking he handed toby a very pretty little dogcollar on the silver plate of which was inscribed                   mr stubbss brother                       presented to                            toby tyler                                                                        by                                                              the skeleton    the fat woman        old ben         little ella            toby took the collar and as he fastened it on the monkeys neck he said in a voice that trembled considerably with emotion  youve all of you been awful good to me an i dont know what to say sos youll know how much i thank you it seems as if ever since i started with the circus youve all tried to see how good you could be an now youve given me this monkey that i wanted so much some time when im a man ill show you how much i think of all youve done for me  the tears of gratitude that were gathering in tobys eyes prevented him from saying anything more and then mrs treat and ella both kissed him while ben said in a gruff tone  now carry the monkey home an get your supper for youll want to come down here this evening an you wont have time if you dont go now  ella after making toby promise that he would see her again that night went with mr and mrs treat while old ben as if afraid he might receive more thanks walked quickly away towards the dressingrooms and there was nothing else for toby and abner to do but go home  it surely seemed as if every boy in the village knew that toby tyler had remained in the tent after the circus was over and almost all of them were waiting around the entrance when the two boys came out with the monkey  if toby had stayed there until each one of his friends had looked at and handled the monkey as much as he wanted to he and abner would have remained until morning and mr stubbss brother would have been made very illnatured  he waited until his friends had each looked at the monkey and then he and abner started home escorted by nearly all the boys in town  the partners in the amateurcircus scheme were nearly as wild with joy as toby was for now their enterprise seemed an assured success since they had two real ponies and a live monkey to begin with they seemed to consider it their right to go to uncle daniels with toby and when the party reached the corner that marked the centre of the village they decided that the others of the escort should go no farthera decision which relieved toby of an inconvenient number of friends  as it was the party was quite large enough to give aunt olive some uneasiness lest they should track dirt in upon her clean kitchen floor and she insisted that both the boys and the monkey should remain in the yard  toby had an idea that mr stubbss brother would be treated as one of the family and had any one hinted that the monkey would not be allowed to share his bed and eat at the same table with him he would have resented it strongly  but uncle daniel soon convinced him that the proper place for his pet was in the woodshed where he could be chained to keep him out of mischief and mr stubbss brother was soon safely secured in as snug a place as a monkey could ask for  not until this was done did the partners return to their homes or the centre of attractionthe tentinggroundsnor did toby find time to get his supper and go for the cows  not once during the afternoon had toby said anything to abner of the good fortune that might come to him through old ben but when he got back from the pasture and met uncle daniel in the barn he told him what the old driver had said about abner  are you sure you heard him rightly toby boy asked the old gentleman as he pushed his glasses up on his forehead as he always did when he was surprised or perplexed  i know he said that but it seems as if it was too good to be true dont it  the lords ways are not our ways my boy and if he sees fit to work some good to the poor cripple he can do it as well through a circus driver as through one of his elect said uncle daniel reverentially and then he set about milking the cows in such an absentminded way that he worried old shorthorn until she kicked the pail over when it was nearly half full     chapter x  the accident   that night toby and abner went to the circus grounds with uncle daniel and aunt olive and when old ben approached the party as they were nearing the tent toby motioned the cripple to come with him for he thought it might be better that the boy should not hear the conversation concerning himself  it had been decided by uncle daniel that the boys should go to the circus grounds that evening and stay there until it was nearly dark when they were to go home and go to bed for he never believed it could do boys any good to be out after dark while he was certain it was better for their health if they went to bed early  therefore toby intended to make this visit simply one of farewell after abner should see a little more of the bustle and confusion that had so fascinated him in the afternoon  to that end the boys walked around the enclosure listened to the men who were loudly crying the wonderful things they had for sale and all the while kept a bright lookout in the hope of seeing some of their circus friends  it was nearly time for the performance to begin when the boys went into the skeletons tent and said goodbye to the thin man and his fat wife  then toby anxious to run around to the dressingrooms to speak with ella and not daring to take abner with him said to the boy  now you wait here for a minute an ill be right back  abner was perfectly contented to wait it seemed to him that he would have been willing to stay there all night provided the excitement should be continued and he gazed around him in perfect delight as he leaned against one of the tent ropes  toby found ella without much difficulty but both she and her mother had so much to say to him that it was some time before he could leave them to go in search of ben  the old driver was curled up on his wagon taking forty winks as he called a nap before starting on the road again  when toby awakened him he explained that he would not have taken the liberty if it had not been for the purpose of saying goodbye and ben replied goodnaturedly  thats all right toby i should only have been angry with you if you had let me sleep ive fixed it with your uncle about that little cripple and now when i get pitched off and killed some of these dark nights therell be one whatll be sorry im gone be a good boy toby dont ever do anything youd be afraid to tell your uncle danl of and next year ill see you again  toby wanted to say something but the old driver had spoken his farewell and was evidently determined neither to say nor to hear anything more for he crawled up on the box of the wagon again and appeared to fall asleep instantly  toby stood looking at him a moment as if trying to make out whether this sudden sleep was real or only feigned in order to prevent the parting from being a sad one and then he said as he started towards the door  well i thank you over and over again for mr stubbss brother even if you have gone to sleep then he went to meet abner  when he reached the place where he had left his friend to his great surprise he could see nothing of him there was no possibility that he could have made any mistake as to the locality for he had left him standing just behind the skeletons tent  toby ran quickly around the enclosure asked some of the attendants in the dressingroom if they had seen a boy on crutches and then he went into mr treats tent but he could neither hear nor see anything of abner whose complete disappearance was to say the least very strange  toby was completely bewildered by this sudden disappearance and for some moments he stood looking at the place where he had left his friend as if he thought that his eyes must have deceived him and that the boy was still there  there were but few persons around the outside of the tent those who had money enough to pay for their admission having gone in and those who were penniless having gone home so that toby did not find many of whom to make inquiries the attachés of the circus were busily engaged packing the goods for the nights journey and a number of them had gathered around one of the wagons a short distance away but toby thought it useless to ask them for tidings of his missing friend for he knew by experience how busy every one connected with the circus was at that hour  after he had looked at the tent rope against which he had seen abner leaning until he recovered his presence of mind he went into the tent again for the purpose of getting uncle daniel to help him in the search as he was passing the monkey wagon however he saw old benwhom he had left apparently in a heavy sleepexamining his wagon to make sure that everything was right and to him he told the story of abners strange disappearance  i guess hes gone off with some of the other fellows said ben thinking the matter of but little importance but yet going out of the tent with toby as he spoke boys are just like eels an you never know where to find em after you once let em slip through your fingers  but abner promised me hed stay right here said toby  well some other fellows came along an he promised to go with them i spose  but i dont believe abner would hed keep his promise after he made it  while they were talking they had gone out of the tent and ben started at once towards the crowd around the wagon for he knew there was no reason why so many men should be there when they had work to do elsewhere  did you go over there to see what was up asked the old driver  no i thought they were getting ready to start an i could see abner wasnt there  somethings the matter muttered the old man as he quickened his pace and toby alarmed by the look on his friends face hurried on hardly daring to breathe  one look into the wagon around which the men were gathered was sufficient to show why it was that abner had not remained by the tent as he had promised for he lay in the bottom of the cart to all appearances dead while two of the party were examining him to learn the extent of his injuries  what is the matter how did this boy get hurt asked ben sternly as he leaped upon the wagon and laid his hand over the injured boys heart  he was standing there close by the guy ropes when we were getting ready to let the canvas down one of the side poles fell and struck him on the head or shoulder i dont know which replied a man  it struck him here on the back of the neck said one of those who were examining the boy as he turned him half over to expose an uglylooking wound around which the blood was rapidly settling its a wonder it didnt kill him  he haint dead is he asked toby piteously as he climbed up on one of the wheels and looked over in a frightened way at the little deformed body that lay so still and lifeless  no he haint dead said ben who had detected a faint pulsation of the heart but why didnt some of you send for a doctor when it first happened  we did replied one of the men some of the village boys were here and we started them right off  almost as the man spoke dr abbott one of the physicians of the town drove up and made his way through the crowd  toby too much alarmed to speak watched the doctors every movement as he made an examination of the wounded boy and listened to the accounts the men gave of the way in which the accident had happened  his injuries are not necessarily fatal but they are very dangerous he lives at the poorfarm and should be taken there at once said the doctor after he had made a slight and almost careless examination  toby was anxious that the poor boy should be taken to his home rather than to the comfortless place the doctor had proposed but he did not dare make the suggestion before asking uncle daniels consent to it he was about to ask them not to move abner until he could find his uncle when ben whispered something to the doctor that caused him to look at the old driver in surprise  ill ask uncle danl to take him home with us said toby as he slipped down from his high perch and started towards the tent  ill take care of that said ben as he went towards the tent with him i had just fixed it with your uncle sos hed take abner from the poorfarm an board him an now theres all the more reason why he should do it you go back an stay with abner an ill bring your uncle danl out  then toby went back to the wagon where the poor little cripple still lay as one dead while the blood flowed in a tiny stream from one of his arms where the physician had opened a vein  not understanding the reason for this bloodletting and supposing that the crimson flow was due to the injuries abner had received toby cried out in his fear but one of the men explained the case to him and then he waited as patiently as possible for the drivers return  both uncle daniel and aunt olive came out with ben and within a very few moments abner was being carried to the farmhouse in the same wagon that had taken him there before in company with the skeleton and his party for that famous dinner  it frightened toby still more to see the unconscious boy carried into the house by ben and the doctor as though he were already dead and when aunt olive led them into the best room where no one had slept since uncle daniels sister died it seemed as if every one believed abner could not live or they would not have carried him there  toby hardly knew when ben went away or whether he said anything before he left or in fact anything else so sad and confused was he he did not even think about mr stubbss brother but remained in one corner of the room almost hidden by one of the flowing chintz curtains until uncle daniel heard him sobbing and led him away to his room  there is good reason to hope abner will recover said the old man as he stroked tobys hair but he is in the keeping of the one who never errs and whatsoever he does is good  then uncle daniel actually kissed the boy as he told him to go to bed and go to sleep toby went to bed as he was commanded though it seemed impossible he should sleep while it might be that abner was dying     chapter xi  change of plans   toby was thoroughly surprised when he awoke to find that it was morning and that his slumber had been as sweet as if nothing had happened he dressed himself as quickly as possible and ran downstairs and uncle daniel told him the doctor had just left after saying he thought abner would recover  it was a sad visit toby paid mr stubbss brother that morning and as he petted him the tears came into his eyes when he thought of poor abner until he was obliged to leave the monkey to himself after having tied him so that he could take a short run out of doors  then he visited the ponies in the stable and when he returned to the house he found all his partners in the circus enterprise as well as several other boys waiting to hear an account of the accident  dr abbott had reported that abner had been injured but as he had not given any particulars the villagers were in a state of anxious uncertainty regarding it  after toby had told them all he knew about the matter and had allowed them to see the monkey and the ponies which some of them seemed to regard as of more importance than the injured boy bob asked  well now what about our circus  why we cant do anything on that till abner gets well said toby as if surprised that the matter should even be spoken about  why not he wasnt goin to do any of the ridin an nows the time for us to go ahead while we can remember what they did at the show yesterday it dont make any difference bout our circus if he did get hurt and bob looked around at the others as if asking whether they agreed with him or not  i think we ought to wait till he gets better said joe cause he was goin in with us an it dont seem jest fair to have the show when hes so sick  thats foolish said ben with a sneer if he hadnt come up to the pasture the other day you wouldnt thought anything bout him an hed been out to the poorfarm where he belongs  if he hadnt come up there said toby id never known how lonesome he was an id gone right on havin a good time without ever once thinkin of him an if he hadnt come up there perhaps he wouldnt got hurt an it seems almost as if id done it to him cause i took him to the circus  dont make a fool of yourself toby tyler and ben gushing spoke almost angrily you act awful silly bout that feller an father says hes only a pauper anyway  it wouldnt make any difference if he was cause hes a poor lonesome cripple but he haint a pauper for old bens goin to take care of him an he pays uncle danl for lettin him stay here  this news was indeed surprising to the boys and as they fully realized that abner was under the protection of a circus man he rose considerably in their estimation  they were anxious to know all about the matter and when toby told them all he could they looked at the case in such an entirely different light that ben gushing even offered to go out in the field where he could be seen from the windows of the room in which abner lay and go through his entire acrobatic performance in the hope the sight might do the invalid some good leander leighton also offered to come twice each day and play yankee doodle with one finger on the accordion in order to soothe him  but toby thought it best to decline both these generous offers he was glad they had been made but would have been much better pleased if they had come while it was still believed abners only home was at the poorhouse  when the boys went away toby pleaded so hard that aunt olive consented to his sitting in the chamber where abner lay with the agreement that he should make no noise and there he remained nearly all the day as still as any mouse watching the pale face on which death seemed already to have set its imprint  each day for two weeks toby remained on watch leaving the room only when it was necessary and he was at last rewarded by hearing abner call him by name  after that aunt olive allowed the two boys to talk a little and a few days later mr stubbss brother was brought in to pay his respects to the invalid  many times during abners illness had the boys been up to learn how he was getting on and to try to persuade toby to commence again the preparations for the circus but he had steadily refused to proceed further in the matter until abner could at least play the part of spectator  uncle daniel had had several letters from ben inquiring about abners condition and as each one contained money some of which had been sent by the skeleton and his wife to toby tylers friend the sick boy had wanted for nothing ben had also written that he had gained the consent of the proprietors of the circus to have the ponies driven for abners benefit and had sent a dainty little carriage and harnesses so that he could ride out as soon as he was able  chandler merrill had grown tired of waiting for his pony and had taken him from the pasture while reddy had long since returned the blind horse to its owner  but during all these five weeks the work had gone slowly but steadily on circusward leander had become so expert a musician on the accordion that he could play yankee doodle with all his fingers old hundred with two and was fast mastering the intricacies of old dog tray  as to ben gushing it would be hard to say exactly how much progress he had made the reports differed so much he claimed to be able to turn handsprings around the largest circus ring that was ever made and to stand on his head for a week but some of the boys who were not partners in the enterprise flatly contradicted this and declared that they could do as many feats in the acrobatic line as he could  joe robinson had practised howling until reddy insisted that there was little or no difference between him and the fiercest and strongestlunged hyena that ever walked bob could sing the two songs his sister had taught him and had written out twelve copies of them in order to have a good stock to sell from but leander predicted that he would not be able to dispose of many because one was the suwanee river and the other a poor wayfaring man the words of which any boy could get by consulting an old musicbook  reddy had made a remarkably large whip which he could snap once out of every three attempts and not hit himself on the head more than once out of five  thus the circus project was as promising as ever and abner as well as the other partners had urged toby to take hold of it again but he had made no promises until the day came when abner was able to sit up and dr abbott said that he could go out for a ride in another week if he still continued to improve  then it was that toby told his partners he would meet them on the first day abner went out for a ride and tell them when he would take up the circus work again which made every one more anxious than ever to see the poorfarm boy out of doors  from the time when the tiny little carriage and the two sets of harness glistening with silver had come toby had been anxious for a drive with the ponies but he had resolutely refused to use them until abner could go with him although uncle daniel had told him he could try them whenever he wished he had waited for his other pleasures until abner could join him and he insisted on waiting for this one one day when aunt olive spoke to him about it he said  if i was sick an had such a team sent to me id feel kinder bad to have some other boy using it an so im goin to let abner be the first one to go out with the ponies  it was hard not even to get into the little carriage that was so carefully covered with a white cloth in the stable but toby resisted the temptation and when at last the day did come that aunt olive and uncle daniel helped the sick boy downstairs and lifted him into the prettiest little pony carriage ever seen in guilford he felt amply rewarded for his denial  they drove all over the town stopping now and then to speak with some of their friends or to answer questions as to abners health and when it was nearly time to return home toby turned the ponies heads towards the pasture where he knew his partners were waiting for him according to agreement  well go on with the circus now he said to abner for i can take you with me in this team an you can stay in it all the time were practising sos itll be most as good as if you could do something towards it yourself  abner was quietly happy the tender thoughtful care that had been bestowed upon him since his mishap had been such as in his mind at least repaid him for all the pain  i hope you will have it he said earnestly for even if i cant be with you all the time i wont feel as if i was keepin you from it  then he put his hand in a loving way on tobys cheek and the boss of the circus felt fully repaid for having waited for his pleasure  at the pasture all the partners were gathered for toby had promised to tell them when he would begin operations and as he drove the ponies up to the bars he shouted  abner an me will be up here about nine oclock tomorrow morning an well bring mr stubbss brother with us  there was a mighty shout and ben cushing stood on his head when this announcement was made and then toby and abner drove home as quickly as their ponies could scamper     chapter xii  a rehearsal   when toby told uncle daniel that night of their intention to go on with the work of the longdelayed circus and that abner was to ride up to the pasture where he could see everything that was going on the old gentleman shook his head doubtingly as if he feared the consequences to the invalid who appeared very much exhausted even by the short ride he had taken  abner interpreting uncle daniels shake of the head the same way toby did pleaded hard to be allowed to go insisting that he would be no more tired sitting in the little carriage than he would in a chair at home and aunt olive joined in the boys entreaty promising to arrange the pillows in such a manner that abner could lie down or sit up as best suited him  well see what the doctor has to say about it replied uncle daniel and with much anxiety the boys awaited the physicians coming  go why of course he can go and it will do him good to be outofdoors said the medical gentleman when he made his regular afternoon visit and uncle daniel laid the case before him  toby insisted on bringing mr stubbss brother into the invalids room as a signal mark of rejoicing at the victory the doctor had won for them and abner was so delighted with the funny pranks the monkey played that it would have been difficult to tell by his face that the morning ride had tired him  mr stubbss brother was quite as mischievous as a monkey could be he capered around the room picking at this thing and looking into that until aunt olive laughed herself tired and uncle daniel declared that if the other monkey was anything like this one toby was right when he named him steve stubbs so much did he resemble that gentleman in inquisitiveness  the day had been so exciting to the boy who had been confined to one room for several weeks that he was quite ready to go to bed when aunt olive suggested it and toby went about his evenings work with a lighter heart than he had had since the night he found his crippled friend lying so still and deathlike in the circus wagon  the next morning toby was up some time before the sun peeped in through the crevices of uncle daniels barn to awaken the cows and he groomed the tiny ponies till their coats shone like satin the carriage was washed until every portion of it reflected ones face like a mirror and the harnesses with their silver mountings were free from the slightest suspicion of dirt  then after the cows had been driven to the pasture mr stubbss brother was treated to a bath and was brushed and combed until losing all patience at such foolishness he escaped from his too cleanlydisposed master taking refuge on the top of the shed where he chattered and scolded at a furious rate as he tried to explain that he had no idea of coming down until the currycomb and brush had been put away  but when the pony team was driven up to the door and toby decorated the bridles of the little horses with some of aunt olives roses mr stubbss brother came down from his high perch and picked some of the flowers for himself putting them over his ears to imitate the ponies then he gravely seated himself in the carriage and toby had no difficulty in fastening the cord to his collar again  aunt olive nearly filled the little carriage with pillows so soft that a very small boy would almost have sunk out of sight in them and in the midst of these abner was placed carefully looking for all the world as toby said like a chicken in a nest  mr stubbss brother was fastened in the front in such a way that his head came just above the dashboard over which he looked in the most comical manner possible  then toby squeezed in on one side declaring he had plenty of room although there was not more than three square inches of space left on the seat and even a portion of that was occupied by a fan and some other things aunt olive had put in for abners use  both the boys were in the highest possible state of happiness and abner was tucked in until he could hardly have been shaken had he been in a cart instead of a carriage with springs  be sure to keep abner in the shade and come home just as soon as he begins to grow tired cried aunt olive as toby spoke to the ponies and they dashed off like a couple of welltrained newfoundland dogs  ill take care of him like he was wax cried toby as they drove out through the gateway and mr stubbss brother screamed and chattered with delight while abner lay back restful and happy  it was just the kind of a morning for a ride and abner appeared to enjoy it so much that toby turned the little steeds in the direction of the village driving fully a mile before going to the pasture  when they did arrive at the place where the first rehearsal was to be held they found the partners gathered in full force and although it was not even then nine oclock they had evidently been there some time  joe robinson ran to let the bars down while the ponies pranced into the field as if they knew they were the objects of admiration from all that party and they shook their tiny heads until the petals fell from the roses in a shower upon the grass  mr stubbss brother stood as erect as possible and was so excited by the cheers of the boys that he seized the flowers he had tucked over his ears and flung them at the party in great glee  the carriage was driven into the shade cast by the alders the ponies were unharnessed and fastened where they could have a feast of grass and toby was ready for business or thought he was but just as he was about to consult with his partners a scream from both abner and the monkey caused him to turn towards the carriage quickly  from the moment they had entered the pasture mr stubbss brother had shown the greatest desire to be free and when he saw his master walking away while he was still a prisoner he made such efforts to release himself that he got his body over the dashboard of the carriage and when toby looked he was hanging there by the neck as if he had just committed suicide  toby ran quickly to the relief of his pet and when he had released him from his uncomfortable position the other boys pleaded so hard that toby gave him his freedom which he celebrated by scampering across the pasture on all four paws with his tail curled up over his back like a big letter o  it seemed very much as if mr stubbss brother would break up the rehearsal for he did look so comical as he scampered around that all the partners neglected their business to watch and laugh at him until toby reminded them that he could not stay there very long because of abners weakness  then bob and reddy straightened themselves up in a manner befitting circus proprietors and began their work  leander is goin to commence the show by playin yankee doodle said bob as he consulted a few badly written words he had traced on the back of one of his fathers business cards an while hes doin it joell put in an howl all he knows how for thats the way the hyenas did at the last circus  the entire programme was evidently to be carried out that morning for as bob spoke leander marched with his accordion and a great deal of dignity to a rock near where a line representing the ring had been cut in the turf  now youll see how good he can do it said bob with no small amount of pride and leander with his head held so high that it was almost impossible to see his instrument struck one or two notes as a prelude while joe took his station at a point about as far distant from the ring as the door of the tent would probably be  leander started with the first five or six notes all right and joe began some of the most wonderful howling ever heard which appeared to disconcert the band for he got entirely off the track of his original tune and mixed yankee doodle with old dog tray in the most reckless manner joe howling louder at every false note  almost every one in that pasture save possibly the performers themselves was astonished at the din made by these two small boys and mr stubbss brother who had hung himself up on a tree by his tail dropped to his feet in the greatest alarm adding his chatter of fear to the general confusion  but the two performers were not to be daunted by anything that could occur in fact joe felt rather proud that his howling was so savage as to frighten the monkey and he increased his efforts until his face was as red as a nicely boiled beet  for fully five minutes the overture was continued then the band stopped and looked around with an air of triumph while joe uttered two or three more howls by way of effect and to show that he could have kept it up longer had it been necessary  there what do you think of that asked reddy in delight you couldnt get much more noise if you had a whole band could you  its a good deal of noise said toby not feeling quite at liberty to express exactly his views regarding the music but what was it leander was playin  i played two tunes replied leander proudly i can play yankee doodle with the whole of one hand but i think it sounds better to play that with my thumb and two fingers an old dog tray with the other two fingers you see i can give em both tunes at once that way  the monkey went back to the tree as soon as the noise had subsided but from the way he looked over his shoulder now and then one could fancy he was getting ready to run at the first sign that it was to commence again  didnt that sound like a whole cageful of hyenas asked joe as he wiped the perspiration from his face and came towards his partners i can keep that up about as long as leander can play only its awful hard work  toby had no doubt as to the truth of that statement but before he could make any reply bob said  now this is where ben comes in he starts the show an he ends it an i sing right after he gets through turnin handsprings this first time now leander you start the music jest as soon as ben comes an keep it up till he gets through  ben was prepared for his portion of the work his trousers were belted tightly around his waist by a very narrow leather belt with an enormously large buckle and his shirtsleeves were rolled up as high as he could get them in order to give full play to his arms  hes been rubbin goosegrease all over him for as much as two weeks an he can bend almost any way whispered reddy to toby as ben stood swinging his arms at the entrance to the ring as if limbering himself for the work to be done  leander started yankee doodle in slow and solemn strains ben gathered himself for a mighty effort and began to go around the ring in a series of handsprings in true acrobatic style     chapter xiii  the results of long training   mr stubbss brother had been a close observer of all that was going on probably to guard against another sudden fright such as the overture had given him and the moment ben commenced to revolve he leaped from the tree running with full speed towards the whirling acrobat  toby started to catch him but the monkey was too quick in his movements before any one could prevent him he had caught the revolving boy by one leg and for a few seconds it was difficult to tell which was ben and which the monkey  of course such an interruption as that broke up the performance for the time being and toby was obliged to exert all his authority to disentangle the monkey from the performer  i knew it wouldnt do to let him be loose said toby in a halfapologetic tone now ill set here an hold him while you commence over again ben  well now be sure you hold him said ben seriously for i dont want him to catch me again when im goin round so fast for it hurts a feller to tumble the way he made me  bob offered to help hold the unruly monkey and when he and toby had taken a firm grip on the collar the music was started again and ben recommenced his performance  this time he got through with it in a highly successful and creditable manner he proved to be a really good acrobat so far as turning handsprings and standing on his head were concerned and toby felt certain that this portion of the entertainment would be pleasing  bob now went into the ring and began to sing the suwanee river in a manner which he intended should captivate his audience but he had neglected to give the band any orders and the consequence was that when he commenced to sing leander began to play old dog tray a proceeding which mixed the musical matters considerably  you mustnt do that leander bob said sharply after he had done his best to sing the band down and failed in the attempt it wont do for you to play one thing while im tryin to sing something else now you be restin while im doin my part  leander was so deeply interested in the enterprise that he was perfectly willing to keep on playing without ever thinking of taking a rest but in deference to bobs wishes he ceased his efforts although he did venture to remark that he noticed particularly when the real circus was there that the band always played when the clown sang  bob got along very well with his portion of the rehearsal after the first mistake had been rectified and when he finished he bowed gracefully in response to the applause bestowed upon him  nows the time when you come in toby said bob an if youll see how you can ride the ponies joell run around the ring with em  toby was willing to do his share of the work and all the more so because he could see that abner from his cosy seat under the bushes was deeply interested in all that was going on  joe got one of the ponies while toby made his preparations and after the little horse had been led around the circle two or three times to show what was expected of him toby got on his back this was reddys opportunity to act the part of ringmaster and he seized his long whip standing in the centre of the ring in what he believed to be the proper attitude  run around with him till i tell you to let go said toby as he tied the reins together to form a bridle and then stood on the ponys back as mr castle had taught him to do  there was so great a difference between the motion of this horse and that of the one owned by mr douglass that toby began to understand it might be quite as necessary to train the animal as its rider  owing to his lack of practice he was a little clumsy but after one or two attempts he went around the ring standing on one foot almost as well as he had done it when with ella  the boys who had never seen toby ride before were thoroughly elated by the brief exhibition he gave them and if he had done as they wanted he would have tired both himself and the pony completely  ill practise some now abner can come out said toby as he led his steed to a spot where he could get more grass but neglected to fasten him an i wouldnt wonder if i could ride two at once after a little while  his partners in the enterprise were more than delighted with their rider and they already began to believe they should have such a circus as would in some points eclipse the real one that had lately visited the town  after the excitement caused by tobys riding had in a measure died away ben continued with his feats according to the programme and then bob commenced his second song  the audience of partners were listening to it intently the more because it seemed to them that bob had made a mistake as to the tune and they were anxious to see what he was going to do about itwhen the pony toby had been riding suddenly dashed into the ring with what looked very like a boy on his back  the partners were amazed at this interruption and bob continued to sound the note he was wrestling with when he first saw the pony coming towards him until it ended almost in a shriek  who is it cried joe as the pony dashed across the pasture urged to full speed by its rider and in an instant more all saw a long curling tail which showed unmistakably who the culprit was  its mr stubbss brother cried toby in alarm and how shall we catch him  it was indeed the monkey and during the next ten minutes it seemed to the boys that they ran over every square foot of that pasture scaring the cows and tiring themselves until the frightened little horse was penned up in one corner and his disagreeable rider was taken from him  this last act of the rehearsal had occupied so much time and the monkey was making himself so troublesome that toby decided to go home the others promising to come to uncle daniels barn that afternoon when reddy was to explain how the tent was to be procured a matter which up to this time he had kept a profound secret from all but bob  short as the time spent at the rehearsal seemed to the boys it was considerably too long for one in abners weak condition as was evident from his face when aunt olive came to the door to help him out of the carriage  he seemed thoroughly exhausted and as soon as he got into the house asked to be allowed to lie downa confession of weakness that gave aunt olive a great deal of uneasiness because she considered herself in a great measure responsible for the ride and its results as she had urged abner to go before the doctors advice had been heard in the matter  tobys fears regarding the invalid were always reflections of aunt olives but when he saw abner go to sleep so quickly he thought she was alarmed without cause and believed his friend would be quite himself so soon as he should awaken  dinnertime came and passed and abner was still sleeping sweetly therefore toby could see no reason why he should not join his partners whom he saw going into the barn before dinner was over  the boys have come up to see bout the tent he said to aunt olive an im goin out to the barn where theyre waitin for me will you call me when abner wakes up  aunt olive promised that he should be informed as soon as the sick boy could see him and toby joined his partners with never a fear but that abner would soon be able to participate in all his sports  that the boys had come to uncle daniels barn on very serious business was evident from their faces and the two large packages they brought  two rolls of what looked to be sailcloth were lying on the barn floor and around them bob reddy joe ben and leander were seated with a look on their faces that was very nearly a troubled one  whats them asked toby in surprise as he pointed to the bundles  the tent and reddy gave a big sigh as he spoke  what have you got two asked toby a look of glad surprise showing itself on his face  reddy shook his head  whats the matter if there haint two tents here what makes the two bundles and toby was almost impatient because he could not understand the matter  well you see this is just how it is said reddy as he began to untie the fastenings from the rolls of canvas when i told you i could get a tent id asked captain whetmore to lend me two of the sails what he took off his schooner an he told me yes  an youve got em havent you and toby looked meaningly at the canvas  yes weve got em replied joe but now we dont know how to fix em cause you see weve got to put em up like a roof an we haint got anything for the ends  reddy had planned to use each of the sails as a side to the tent fastening them along the top to a ridgepole and it had never occurred to him in all the time he had had to think the matter over that as yet he had nothing with which to form the ends  it was a question that puzzled the boys greatly and caused their faces to grow very long until toby said  ill tell you how we can fix one end we can put it right up against the barn where the little door is an then we can have the stalls for a dressinroom  the faces of the partners lightened at once and each wondered why he had not thought of such a plan  an ill tell you how we could fix the other end said toby quickly as another happy thought presented itself if mr mansfield would lend us his big flag it would jest do it  thats the very thing an ill go an ask him now and bob started out of the barn at full speed while reddy now that the important question was settled displayed great alacrity in unrolling his treasures  the sails were not in a remarkable state of preservation or captain whetmore would not have taken them from his vessel but reddy explained that the holes could be closed up by pasting paper over them or by each boy borrowing a sheet from his mother and pinning it up underneath  one of the sails was considerably larger than the other but reddy had also thought of this and proposed to make them look the same size by tucking one in at the end  bob returned before the sails had been thoroughly inspected and brought with him the coveted flag thus showing he had been successful in his mission  now lets put it right up an then we can build our ring an do our practisin there instead of goin up to the pasture suggested ben  since there was no reason why this should not be done bob and ben started for the woods to cut some young trees with which to make a ridgepole and posts while the others carried the canvas outofdoors and made calculations as to where and how it should be put up  when they commenced work they had no idea but that it would be completed before suppertime but when the village clock struck the hour of five they had not finished making the necessary poles and pegs  we cant come anywhere near getting it done tonight said toby surprised at the lateness of the hour and wondering why aunt olive had not called him as she had promised lets put the sails back in the barn an tomorrow mornin we can begin early an have it all done by noon  there was no hope that they could complete the work that night therefore tobys advice was followed and when the partners separated each promised to be ready for work early the next morning     chapter xiv  raising the tent   toby went into the house feeling rather uneasy because he had not been called but when aunt olive told him that abner had aroused from his slumber but twice and then only for a moment he had no idea of being worried about his friend although he did think it a little singular he should sleep so long  that evening dr abbot called again although he had been there once before that day and when toby saw how troubled uncle daniel and aunt olive looked after he had gone he asked  you dont think abner is goin to be sick do you  uncle daniel made no reply and aunt olive did not speak for some moments then she said  i am afraid he stayed out too long this morning but the doctor hopes he will be better tomorrow  if toby had not been so busily engaged planning for abner to see the work next day he would have noticed that the sick boy was not left alone for more than a few moments at a time and that both uncle daniel and aunt olive seemed to have agreed not to say anything discouraging to him regarding his friends illness  when he went to bed that night he fancied uncle daniels voice trembled as he said  may the good god guard and spare you to me toby boy but he gave no particular thought to the matter and the sandman threw dust in his eyes very soon after his head was on the pillow  in the morning his first question was regarding abner and then he was told that his friend was not nearly so well as he had been aunt olive even said that toby had better not go into the sickroom for fear of disturbing the invalid  go on with your play by yourself toby boy and that will be a great deal better than trying to have abner join you until he is much better said uncle daniel kindly  but haint he goin to have a ride this mornin  no he is not well enough to get up you go on building your tent and you will be so near the house that you can be called at any moment if abner asks for you  toby was considerably disturbed by the fact that he was not allowed to see his friend and by the way uncle daniel spoke but he went out to the barn where his partners were already waiting for him feeling all the more sad now because of his elation the day before  he had no heart for the work and after telling the boys that abner was sick again proposed to postpone operations until he should get better but they insisted that as they were so near the house it would be as well to go on with the work as to remain idle and toby could offer no argument to the contrary  although he did quite as much towards the puttingup of the tent as the others did it was plain to be seen that he had lost his interest in anything of the kind and at least once every halfhour he ran into the house to learn how the sick boy was getting on  all of aunt olives replies were the same abner slept a good portion of the time and during the few moments he was awake said nothing except in answer to questions he did not complain of any pain nor did he appear to take any notice of what was going on around him  i think its because he got all tired out yesterday an that hell be himself again tomorrow said aunt olive after toby had come in for at least the sixth time and she saw how worried he was  this hopeful remark restored toby to something very near his usual good spirits and when he went back to his work after that his partners were pleased to see him take more interest in what was going on  the tent was up firmly enough to resist any moderate amount of wind but it did not look quite so neat as it would have done had it not been necessary to perform the operation of tucking in one end which made that side hang in folds that were by no means a pleasing addition to the general appearance  the small door of the barn over which the tent was placed served instead of a curtain to their dressingroom and at one side of it on an upturned barrel arrangements were made for a bandstand  mr mansfields flag covered the one end completely and all the boys thought it gave a better appearance to the whole than if they had made it wholly of canvas  the ring which reddy marked out almost before the tent was up occupied nearly the whole of the interior but since they did not intend to have any seats for their audience it was thought there would be plenty of room for all who would come to see them the main point was to have the ring and to have it as nearly like that of a regular circus as possible while the audience could be trusted to take care of itself  the animals to be exhibited were to be placed in small cages at each corner reddy had at first insisted that each cage should be on a cart to make it look well but he gave up that idea when bob pointed out to him that six mice or two squirrels would make rather a small show in a wagon and that they would be obliged to enlarge their tent if they carried out that plan even provided they could get the necessary number of carts which was very doubtful  in the matter of getting sheets from their mothers they had not been as successful as they had anticipated no one of the ladies who had been spoken to on the subject was willing to have her bedlinen decorating the interior of a circustent even though the show was to be only a little one for three cents  reddy was quite sure he could mend one or two of the largest holes if he had a darningneedle and some twine but after he got both from aunt olive and stuck the needle twice in his own hand once in joe robinsons and then broke it he concluded that it would be just as well to paste brown paper over the holes  it was a hard job to dig the ground up in order to make as large a ring as the boys had marked out but by persistent work it was accomplished as almost everything can be and then ben went to practising in order that he might as he expressed it get the hang of the thing  of course the fact that a tent had been put up by the side of uncle daniels barn was soon known to every boy in the village and the rush of visitors that afternoon was so great that joe was obliged to begin his duties as doorkeeper in advance in order to keep back the crowd  the number of questions asked by each boy who arrived kept joe so busy answering them that after every one in town knew exactly what was going on reddy hit upon the happy plan of getting a large piece of paper and painting on it an announcement of their exhibition  it was while he was absent in search of the necessary materials with which to carry out this work that the finishing touches were put on the interior and the partners were counting the number of handsprings ben could turn without stopping when a great shout arose from the visitors outside and the circus owners heard a pattering and scratching on the canvas above their heads  mr stubbss brother has got loose an hes tearin round on the tent shouted joe as he poked his head in through a hole in the flag and at the same time struggled to keep back a small but bold boy with his foot  toby followed by the other proprietors rushed out at this alarming bit of news and sure enough there was the monkey dancing around on the top of the tent like a crazy person while the rope with which he had been tied dangled from his neck  it seemed to toby that no other monkey could possibly behave half so badly as did mr stubbss brother on that occasion he danced back and forth from one end of the tent to the other as if he had been a tightrope performer giving a free exhibition then he would sit down and try to find out just how large a hole he could tear in the tender canvas until it seemed as if the tent would certainly be a wreck before they could get him down  toby coaxed and scolded and scolded and coaxed but all to no purpose the monkey would clamber down over the end of the tent as if he were about to allow himself to be made a prisoner and then just as toby was about to catch the rope he would spring upon the ridgepole again chattering with joy at the disappointment he had caused  the visitors fairly roared with delight and even the proprietors whose borrowed property was being destroyed could not help laughing at times although there was not one of them who would not have enjoyed punishing mr stubbss brother very severely  hell break the whole show up if we dont get him off said bob as the monkey tore a larger hole than he had yet made and the crowd encouraged him in his mischievous work by their wild cheers  i know it but how can we get him down asked toby in perplexity knowing that it would not be safe for any one of them to climb upon the decayed canvas even if there were a chance that the monkey would wait for them to catch him after they got there  get a long pole an scrape him off suggested joe but toby shook his head for he knew that to scrape a monkey from such a place would be an impossibility  bob had an idea that if he had a rope long enough to make a lasso he could get it around the animals neck and pull him down but just as he set out to find the rope mr stubbss brother settled the matter himself  he had torn one hole fully five inches long and commenced on another a short distance from the first when the thin fabric gave way the two rents were made one and down fell mr monkey only saved from falling to the ground by his chin catching on the edges of the cloth  there he hung his little round head just showing above the canvas with a bewildered and at the same time discouraged look on his face  toby knew that it would be but a moment before the monkey would get his paws out from under the canvas and thus extricate himself from his uncomfortable position running quickly inside the tent he seized mr stubbss brother by his long tail pulling him completely through and the mischievous pet was again a prisoner  it was a great disappointment to the boys on the outside when this portion of the circus was hidden from view but it was equally as great a relief to the partners that the destruction of their tent was at last averted  after the excitement had nearly subsided and toby was reading his pet a lesson on the sin of destructiveness reddy arrived with the materials for making his circus postera sheet of brown paper a bottle of ink and a brush made by chewing the end of a pine stick  he began his work at once it was a long task but was at last accomplished and when the partners went to their respective homes that night the following placard adorned one side of the tent                     big circus                                               doors open putty soon                                             price 3 cents                 chapter xv  stealing ducks   after toby had secured mr stubbss brother so that he could not liberate himself he ran into the house to inquire for abner  the news this time was more encouraging for the sick boy had awakened thoroughly after his long sleep and had asked how the work on the tent was getting on aunt olive thought toby could see him and after promising that he would not remain very long or allow abner to talk much he went upstairs  the crippled boy was lying in the bed bolstered up with pillows looking out of the window that commanded a view of the tent and evidently puzzled to know whether the large sheet of brown paper which he saw on one side was there as an ornament or to serve some useful purpose  toby explained to him that it was the poster reddy had made and then told him all that had been done that day towards getting ready for the great exhibition which was to dazzle the good people of guilford as well as to bring in a rich reward in the way of money to the managers  abner was so interested in the matter and seemed so bright and cheerful when he was talking about it that tobys fears regarding his illness were entirely dispelled he came to the conclusion that abner had simply been tired as aunt olive had said and that he would be better than ever by morning  this belief was strengthened by the doctor who came while toby was still with his friend and who in answer to a question said cheerily  of course hell be all right he may not be quite smart enough to go out tomorrow but before the week is ended ill guarantee that youll have hard work to keep him in the house  tobys heart was light again as he attended to his evenings work and when he met joe on his way to the pasture he laid plans for the coming exhibition with a greater zest than he had displayed since the matter was first spoken of  now that the tent was up and abner on the sure and rapid road to recovery toby thought it quite time that mr stubbss brother should be taught to take some part in the performance joe was of the same opinion and they decided to commence the education of the monkey that very night giving him two or three lessons each day until he should be thoroughly trained  the cows were not exactly hurried on the way home that night but they were not allowed to loiter by the roadside when they saw particularly tempting tufts of grass and as soon as they were in the barn mr stubbss brother was taken to the tent  he was in anything rather than a good condition for training for he evidently remembered his frolic of the afternoon and was anxious to repeat it toby thought he could be made to leap through hoops as a beginning of his circus education and all the energies of the boys were bent to the accomplishment of this  but the monkey was either remarkably stupid just then or determined to take no part in the show for although joe held the hoops until his arms ached and toby coaxed and scolded till he was hoarse mr stubbss brother could not be persuaded even to attempt to leap  its no use to try any more tonight said toby impatiently when it was nearly dark inside the tent and his pet was showing signs of anger well commence the first thing in the mornin an i guess hell do it  id whip him if i was you said joe who was thoroughly tired and angry at the monkeys obstinacy if you would give him a good switchin hed know hes got to do it  i wouldnt whip him if he never did anything said toby as he hugged his pet tightly almost as if he feared joe might attempt as one of the partners in the enterprise to whip the unwilling performer  taint my monkey so i haint got nothin to say about it and joe was impatient now but if he was mine ill bet hed do what i told him to  it seemed almost as if mr stubbss brother knew what had been said about him for he nestled close to toby hiding his face on the boys neck in a way that would have prevented his master from whipping him even if he had been disposed so to do  well put him in the shed an i guess hell be good enough tomorrow said toby cheerfully and then after fastening the flag in the front of the tent in such a way that the wind would be kept out if nothing more he and joe walked towards the house discussing the question of the kind of tickets they should use at the show  while they were yet some distance from the woodshed in which mr stubbss brother was lodged aunt olive called toby to come quickly to the house  you put him in the woodshed an fasten him in snug said toby as he handed the monkey to joe and started for the house at full speed  now joe knew perfectly well where mr stubbss brother was kept but as he had never seen him put away for the night he was uncertain whether he should be tied there or simply shut in it hardly seemed to him that toby would leave the monkey tied up by the neck all night so he set him up comfortably on a bench and carefully shut the door  toby had been called to go to the druggists for some medicine and he came out of the house in such haste calling to joe to follow him that nothing more was thought of the insecurely prisoned monkey  when toby returned it was so late that uncle daniel advised him to go to bed if he had any desire to be healthy wealthy and wise and he obeyed at once  positive that abner was on the road to recovery sure that all his work had been done and with nothing to trouble him it was not very long that toby lay awake after he was once in bed  it seemed to him that he had been sleeping a long while when he was awakened by the sound as of some one hunting around in his room and before he had time to call out the candle was lighted showing that the intruder was uncle daniel only partially dressed and in a high state of excitement  what is it whats the matter asked toby in alarm thinking at once of abner and fearing that something had happened to him  hush said uncle daniel warningly dont make a noise for some one is trying to get into the henhouse an i am going to make an example of him i suppose its one of the tramps who went by here today an i want to find that gun i saw in here yesterday  there was such a weapon in tobys room or at least what had once been a gun was there for a hired man whom uncle daniel had employed left it there it had been an army musket and appeared to have been used as a collection of materials to repair others guns with for the entire lock ramrod and at least four inches of the stock had been taken away leaving it a mere wreck of a gun  its up there in the corner behind the washstand said toby coming out of the bed as quickly as if he had tumbled out and alarmed at the thought of burglars it haint no good uncle danl for theres only a little of it left  it will do as well for me as a better one said uncle daniel grimly i dont want to shoot anybody only to give them a severe fright and perhaps capture them  then whatll you do with em asked toby in a whisper almost as much alarmed by uncle daniels savage way of speaking as by the thought of the burglars  i dont know toby boyi dont know the tramps do trouble me greatly an id like to make an example of these but i suppose they must be hungry or else they wouldnt try to get into the henhouse i guess if we catch one well give him a good breakfast and try to persuade him to go to work like an honest man  uncle daniels anger usually had some such peaceful ending as toby knew but he did look bloodthirsty as he stood there in his shirtsleeves with one stocking on and his nightcap covering one ear and but a small portion of his head while he handled the invalid gun recklessly  by the time he was ready to go in search of the supposed chickenthief aunt olive looking thoroughly frightened came into the room with his other stocking and his boots in her hand insisting that he should put them on before he ventured out  it must have been a very tame burglar who would have continued at his work after the lights had warned him that the inmates of the house were aroused but toby did not think of that he saw that aunt olive had armed herself with the fireshovel that uncle daniel kept a firm hold of the gun even while he was trying to put his boots on and he was frightened by the warlike preparations  toby put on his trousers and shoes as quickly as possible and when uncle daniel was ready to start he stationed himself directly behind aunt olive a position which he thought would afford him a fair view of what was going on and at the same time be safe  now be careful of that gun danl an dont go so far that they can hurt you for theres no telling what they will do if they find out you mean to catch them and aunt olive looked quite as badly frightened as did toby  there there olive dont be alarmed said uncle daniel soothingly they will probably run as soon as they see the gun and that will end it i only hope that i can catch one and uncle daniel went down the stairs as determined and savage looking a man as ever started in search of a supposed chickenthief  aunt olive insisted on carrying the candle though uncle daniel urged that it would not be possible for him to surprise the burglars if she held this light as a warning but she had no idea of allowing him to go out where there was every probability that he would be in danger unless she could see what was going on  when the party reached the kitchen the sounds which came from the henhouse told plainly that the party they were in search of had not ceased his work because the household had been alarmed the snapping of wood could be heard and if aunt olive had not been thoroughly aroused before she was then for laths were being broken and one of her choicest broods of ducks was secured only by such frail barriers against either two or fourlegged thieves  stop them quick or all the ducks will be out she screamed and thus urged uncle daniel made a bold stand  get behind me and hold your hand over the light he whispered and then he shouted as he brought the gun up to his shoulder in a very threatening manner come out here and give yourselves up at once  there was no answer made to this peremptory command and strangely enough the work of destruction was continued as vigorously as if uncle daniel and his broken gun were a thousand miles away instead of on the spot and ready for action  come away from there instantly and save yourself any further trouble shouted uncle daniel in a louder voice stamping his foot while aunt olive brandished the fireshovel to give emphasis to his words  there was silence for a moment as if the burglar had stopped to consider the matter and then the work was continued with greater energy than before  well i declare exclaimed uncle daniel as he brought the butt of his gun down on his own foot with such force that he was obliged to give immediate attention to the wounded member  toby had always had a wholesome dread of a gun but his fear became greater than ever when he saw how much mischief could be done with one as near a total wreck as that was for uncle daniel had seated himself on the grass regardless of the dew and was hugging his foot as if he feared he should lose it     chapter xvi  a lost monkey   even though her husband was wounded aunt olive could not stop to offer any aid while her precious ducks were in such peril as the breaking of the laths proved they were and she started forward alone and unarmed save with the shovel until a loud quacking indicated that the robber had made at least one prisoner  dropping the shovel but still clinging to the candle aunt olive seized the gun and dragging it along by the muzzle she cried  ill shoot you if you dont let them ducks alone and go right straight away from here  the loud quacking of another duck proved that she had not alarmed the burglar and as she was now quite near the bold robber by holding her candle above her head she could discern in the darkness what looked like a boy with a duck tightly clutched in each hand  its only a boy she cried to uncle daniel who had given over attending to his foot and was coming up and then as she ran towards the thief she cried put down them ducks you little rascal or i will whip you soundly  the boy did not put the ducks down nor did he stay for the whipping but with both the noisy prizes held in one hand he began to climb the henhouse in a manner surprising in one so small  by this time both toby and uncle daniel were on the spot and the former saw that the supposed boy was using a long tail in his work of climbing the henhouse  its mr stubbss brother dont shoot him he cried forgetting in his excitement that the gun was dangerous only when dropped on ones foot and then he too tried to climb upon the henhouse  the monkey cried uncle daniel as he felt on his forehead for his spectacles to enable him to see better aunt olive made use of almost the same words but instead of feeling for her spectacles she ran towards the building as if she fancied it to be the easiest thing in the world to catch a mischievous monkey  toby knew if aunt olive did not that it would be the work of some time to catch mr stubbss brother and that no threats would induce him to come down therefore he put forth all his energies in the vain hope of overtaking him  although the monkey was encumbered by the two ducks he had stolen he could climb twice as fast as toby could and aunt olive realized the fact very soon  scare him till he drops the ducks she cried to toby and then to do her portion of the scaring she brandished the fireshovel and cried shoo in a very energetic manner  uncle daniel waved his arms and shouted come down come down as he ran from one side of the building to the other but the only reply to his shout was the quacking of the halfstrangled ducks  catch him toby catch him before he kills the ducks cried aunt olive in an agony of fear lest these particular inmates of her poultryyard should be killed  thats what im tryin to do panted toby as he chased mr stubbss brother from one end of the roof to the other without even a chance of catching him  the quacking of the ducks was growing fainter every moment and knowing that something must be done at once uncle daniel hunted around until he found a long pole with which he struck at the monkey  this had the desired effect for mr stubbss brother was so nearly hit two or three times that he dropped the almost dead ducks curled his tail over his back and leaped to the ground he alighted so near aunt olive that she uttered a loud shriek nearly falling backward over the woodpile but the monkey was out of sight in an instant going in the direction of the road  as his pet disappeared in the darkness toby scrambled down from the roof of the building and started in pursuit but before he had gone far he heard uncle daniel calling to him while at the same time he realized that pursuit would be useless under the circumstances  hes run away an i wont ever find him again he said in so mournful a tone that uncle daniel knew the tears were very near his eyelids  he wont go very far toby boy said uncle daniel consolingly and you can soon find him after the sun rises  hell be moren seven miles off by that time said toby as he choked back his sobs and tried to speak firmly  i dont know much about the nature of monkeys replied uncle daniel speaking very slowly but i am inclined to the belief that he will remain near here since he has come to consider this his home but it will be daylight in less than an hour and then you can start after him i will drive the cows to the pasture so that you will have nothing to delay you  aunt olive had caught up the ducks as soon as mr stubbss brother had dropped them and believing it was yet possible to save their lives she had started towards the house for the purpose of applying some remedies  its so near morning that i shant go to bed again she said and ill get you something to eat and put up a lunch for you so you can stay out until you find him  this offer on aunt olives part seemed doubly kind since the monkey had done so much mischief among her pets and toby realized that it would be ungrateful in him to complain more especially as uncle daniel and aunt olive were willing to do all in their power to enable him to catch the fugitive  ill mend the duckpen he said resolutely putting from his mind the thought of mr stubbss brother who he firmly believed was trudging up the road in the direction taken by the circus when it left town  uncle daniel thought it would be just as well to remain up also and he dragged the wreck of the gun into the house putting it carefully away lest some one should be injured by it before he commenced to build the fire  mr stubbss brother had labored industriously when he set about reducing the duckpen to kindlingwood and although toby worked as fast as possible it was nearly time for the sun to rise before he finished the job of repairing it  by that time aunt olive had a nice breakfast ready for him and a generous lunch done up neatly in paper  abner had not wakened therefore toby was obliged to go away without knowing whether he was better or worse but aunt olive told him that she thought he need have no fear regarding the invalid for she felt certain he would be much better when he awoke  toby ate his breakfast very hurriedly and then started down the road in the direction of his partners homes for he thought there would be a better chance of capturing the runaway if four or five boys set out in pursuit than if he went out alone  fully two hours were spent in arousing his partners explaining what had happened and waiting for them to get their breakfast but at the end of that time every one of the circus managers was ready for the search  there was a decided difference of opinion among them as to which direction they should take some believing the monkey had gone one way and some another and the only plan by which the matter could be settled was to divide the force into two parties  bob reddy and ben formed one division and they started into the woods in a nearly straight line from uncle daniels house toby joe and leander making up the other party went up the road toby insisting on this course because he was sure that mr stubbss brother would attempt to follow the circus of which he had once been a member although so many weeks had elapsed since it had passed along there  leander was of the opinion that they ought to have borrowed a dog with which to track the monkey more easily and even offered to go back to get one but toby thought that would be a waste of valuable time more especially as it was by no means certain that leander could procure the dog if he did go back  joe thought each inch of the road should be examined with a view to finding tracks of the monkey but that plan was given up in a very few moments after it was tried for the good reason that the boys could not distinguish even their own footprints the road was beaten so hard and so they could only walk straight ahead hoping to come up with the fugitive or to hear some news of him  at each house on the road they stopped to ask if a stray monkey had been seen but they could hear nothing encouraging until they had walked nearly three miles and were just beginning to think it would have been wiser to remain with the party who went into the woods  at last however a farmer told them that he had seen an animal come up the main road just about sunrise and that it had gone up through his field into an oak grove he had had no idea at the time that it was a monkey and had intended to take his gun and go in search of it as soon as he could spare the time  toby trembled as the man said this for mr stubbss death was too vivid in his mind for him to think without a shudder of any one going in search of this monkey with a gun he started for the grove at full speed fearing that some one with more time at his disposal had seen his pet and might even now be in pursuit of him  of course the boys did not know certainly that the animal the farmer had seen was mr stubbss brother but all were quite sure it was and before they had been in the oak grove ten minutes they saw the monkey himself hanging by his tail and one paw from the branch of a tree     chapter xvii  driving a monkey   toby was so delighted at seeing his pet safe and alive that he set up a great shout and the monkey thus warned that boys who would chain him down to the drudgery of a circus ring were on his track started off at full speed scolding furiously as he went  to catch a monkey in the woods was even a harder task than to scrape him from the tent or to capture him on the roof of the henhouse but he must be caught and the three boys started after him fully aware of the difficult task before them  to mr stubbss brother this flight and pursuit was simply the wildest kind of a frolic and he fairly screamed with delight as he leaped from one tree to another sometimes allowing them almost to touch him and then starting off at full speed until nearly out of sight  for an hour this tantalizing work was continued and the pursuers were nearly exhausted half the time they had been running at full speed and the only chance for rest had been when they were trying to creep upon mr stubbss brother unawares which was just about no rest at all  leander who was naturally a very slowmoving boy and quite fleshy was more quickly tired than the others when for at least the twentieth time they thought they had the monkey within their grasp and he darted to the top of one of the tallest trees leander declared he could not take another step even though the life of the monkey and the success of the circus depended upon it  of course it was not to be thought of that they should leave their band there exhausted and alone so toby decided they should rest as long as mr stubbss brother remained in the tree and it was determined to occupy the time by eating the luncheon aunt olive had prepared  during the last ten minutes of the chase leanders face had worn a very gloomy expression but it lighted wonderfully when the package of food was opened and toby helped him to a very generous slice of bread and meat  nor was leander the only one who looked with favor upon the food mr stubbss brother had been a close observer of all that was going on at the foot of the tree in which he had taken refuge and he showed every disposition to make one of the eating party  seeing his evident hunger toby was sure it would be possible to capture the monkey by means of the food and he walked around the trunk of the tree holding a piece of gingerbread temptingly in his fingers  the monkey came down from branch to branch as if he had decided to allow himself to be made a prisoner for the sake of the food but just as toby was about to seize him he jumped back with a cry that sounded much as if he were laughing because of the disappointment he had caused  then joe tried his skill at monkeycatching coming about as near success as toby had done and leander was roused to action by the new phase the chase had assumed he too held out some food in order to give mr stubbss brother the impression that all he had to do was to come and get it  in thus trying the coaxing plan all three of the boys got on one side of the tree while the greater part of their provisions was on the opposite side  the monkey descended again first towards one boy and then towards another as if it were his purpose to allow all three to catch him and all were equally certain they were about to succeed when mr stubbss brother suddenly ran along the branches towards the food before it was possible for any of the boys to intercept him he had dropped to the ground seized two of the very largest pieces of cake and was up in the tree again so quickly that but for the cake he had in his paws it might have been doubted whether or not he had been on the ground at all  now mr stubbss brother could laugh at his pursuers if it is possible for a monkey to laugh for without any thanks to them he had a trifle more than his share of the provisions and was still at liberty  it haint any use said joe in despair as he threw himself on the ground and attacked the luncheon savagely i dont believe we shall ever get him an if we dont it wont be much use for us to have our show for every real circus has a monkey  we must catch him replied toby mournfully looking up into the tree where his pet sat eating the stolen food with the greatest possible enjoyment i wouldnt go home an leave him here if i had to stay all night  one might watch here while the others went back to the village an got every feller there to come out an help catch him suggested leander who was famous for having ideas so brilliant that no one could carry them into execution  were goin away from home all the time this way said toby after he had studied the matter carefully without paying any attention to the suggestion made by leander now lets get a little ways the other side of the tree an when he comes down again hell have to go towards home even if we cant catch him perhaps we can drive him into the village  even leander could see the wisdom of this plan and the party moved their luncheon and themselves to the side of the tree opposite to that on which they had approached it  of course there was nothing to do but await mr stubbss brothers pleasure in the matter and he seemed to be in no haste to make a move he ate his cake in the most leisurely fashion possible and then appeared to be wonderfully interested in the leaves for he would spend several minutes pulling one apart probably to see how it was made  but he was obliged to come down at last and he chose the time just as leander had settled himself comfortably for a nap which did not tend to make the band regard him with additional favor  as toby had thought the monkey started back in the direction they had come and as he was going towards home they did not make any effort to hurry him if they could not catch him they could at least drive him and they were satisfied to let him go as slowly as he chosea plan which met with hearty approval from leander  for some time mr stubbss brother moved along as if it were his greatest desire to be back at uncle daniels again and then toby saw him run along swiftly as if he had found something under a tree which interested him greatly  afraid that the monkey had done this simply to avoid being driven and that he might dart through the underbrush and get in rear of them again toby ran forward quickly but before he had taken more than a dozen steps he heard piercing shrieks which evidently came from the monkey while the commotion among the bushes indicated that a struggle of some kind was taking place there  with but one thought and that for the safety of his pet toby ran ahead regardless of the bushes that tore his clothing and scratched his face a struggle was going on as he saw when he pulled the branches of the trees away and mr stubbss brother was getting decidedly the worst of it  a small prickly ball curled up at the foot of the tree and the monkey striking at it savagely with his paws while porcupine quills were sticking in his face and body told the whole story  the monkey had seen the porcupine and much to his discomfort had tried to make that animals acquaintance as every boy knows when one of these animals is attacked it immediately rolls itself up into a ball with the quills or spines sticking straight out and the attacking party generally gets plentifully supplied with them in a very short time  it was some moments before toby could persuade his pet to stop trying to inflict punishment when he was getting the greater part himself but he pulled him away at last and the porcupine unrolling himself with a grunt of satisfaction trotted away into the bushes  there was no disposition on the part of mr stubbss brother to run away again he stood there looking as sad and discouraged as a monkey ought to look who had commenced his days work by stealing ducks and concluded it by fighting a porcupine  the quills stood out from his face making him look as if sadly in need of shaving while on almost every inch of his body there was one of these natural weapons giving him a decidedly comical appearance  as he stood there holding out his paws to toby as if asking him to extract the spines and squinting down now and then at those in his face the boys did not try to restrain their laughter which appeared to make the inquisitive monkey very angry  he screamed and scolded in the shrillest tones until toby set about picking out the quills for him and joe took a firm hold of his collar to make sure he should not escape when he was relieved from the effects of his introduction to the porcupine     chapter xviii  collecting the animals   it was quite a task to extract the porcupine quills from mr stubbss brother because the operation was painful and he danced about in a way that seriously interfered with the work  but the last one was out after a time and the monkey was marched along between joe and toby looking very repentant now that he was in his masters power again  i tell you what it is said joe sagely after he had walked awhile in silence as if studying some matter wed better get about six big chains an fasten mr stubbss brother to the tent cause if we keep on tryin to train him hell keep on gettin loose an before he gets through with it we shant have any show left  i think thats the best thing we can do panted leander cause if all hands of us has to start out many times like this some of the boys will come up while were off an pull the tent down  we can tie him in the tent and have him for a wild man of borneo suggested joe  i guess we wont train him replied toby rather sorry to deprive his pet of the pleasure of being one of the performers and yet fearing the trouble he would cause if they should try to make anything more than an ordinary monkey out of him  the pursuit had led the boys farther from home than they had imagined and it was noon when weary and hungry they arrived at the tent where they found the other party who had given up the search some time before they had travelled through the woods without hearing or seeing anything of the runaway and had returned in the hope that the others had been more successful  leaving mr stubbss brother in charge of the partners who it was safe to say would now take very good care to prevent his escape toby hurried into the house to see abner  the sick boy was no better aunt olive said neither did he appear to be any worsehe was sleeping then and after eating some of his dinner at the table and taking the remainder in his hands toby went out to the tent again  he found his partners indulging in an animated discussion as to when the performance should be given  reddy was in favor of having it within two or three days at furthest bob thought that as mr stubbss brother was not to be one of the performers there was no reason for delay  all the others were of the same opinion but toby urged them to wait until abner could take part in it  to this bob had a very reasonable objection in two weeks more school would begin and then of course the circus would be out of the question if their first exhibition should be a success as it undoubtedly would be they could give a second performance when abner should get well enough to attend it and that would be quite as pleasing to him as for all the talent to remain idle while waiting for his recovery  toby felt that his partners asked him to do only that which was fair the circus scheme had already done abner more harm than good and as he did not seem to be dangerously sick it would be unkind to the others to insist on waiting  id rather abner was with us when we had the first show said toby but i spose itll be just as well to go ahead with it an then give another after he can come out  then well have it saturday afternoon an while reddys fixin up the tickets ben an ill get the animals up here sos to see how theyll look an to let em get kinder used to the tent  reddy was a boy who did not believe in wasting any time after a matter was decided upon and almost as soon as toby consented to go on with the show he went for materials with which to make posters and tickets  his activity aroused the others and all started out to bring in the animals leaving toby to guard mr stubbss brother and the tent the canvas would take care of itself so long as it was unmolested but the other portion of tobys charge was not so easily managed after much thought however he settled the monkey question by tying mr stubbss brother to the end pole with a rope long enough to allow him to climb nearly to the top but short enough to keep him at a safe distance from the canvas  by the time this was done ben arrived with the first instalment of curiosities his crowing hen he had under his arm and mrs simpsons threelegged cat and four kittens he brought in a basket  joes got a cage most built for the hen an ill fix one for the cat this afternoon he said as he seated himself on the basket and held the hen in his lap  you cant fix it if youve got to hold her said toby as he brought from the barn a bushelbasket which was converted into a coop by turning it bottom side up and putting the hen underneath it  ben was about to make a search of the barn for the purpose of finding some materials with which to build the cats cage when a great noise was heard outside and the two partners left the tent hurriedly  its bob an his calf said ben who had got out first and then he started towards the newcomers at full speed  it was bob and his calf but the animal should have been mentioned first for it seemed very much as if he were bringing his master instead of being brought by him in order to carry his cage of mice and lead the calf at the same time bob had tied the rope that held this representative of a grizzly bear around his waist and had taken the cage under his arm this plan had worked well enough until just as they were entering the field that led to the tent when bob tripped and fell scaring the calf so that he started at full speed for the barn of course dragging the unfortunate bob with him  sometimes on his face sometimes on his back screaming for help whenever his mouth was uppermost and clinging firmly to the cage of mice bob was dragged almost to the door of the tent where the frightened animal was finally secured  well ive got him here an i haint lost a single mouse said bob as he counted his treasures before even scraping the dirt from his face  ben and toby led the calf into the tent after some difficulty owing to the attempts of mr stubbss brother to frighten him and then they did their best to separate the dirt from their partner  in this good work they had but partially succeeded when reddy arrived with a large package of brown paper and his cat without a tail this startling curiosity he carried in a bag slung over his shoulder and from the expression on his face when he came up it seemed almost certain that the cats claws had passed through the bag and into her masters flesh  there he exclaimed with a sigh of relief as he threw his live burden at the foot of the post to which mr stubbss brother was tied ive kept shiftin that cat from one shoulder to the other ever since i started an i tell you she can scratch as well as if she had a tail as long as the monkeys  it surely seemed as if the work of building the cages had been too long neglected for here were a number of curiosities without anything in which they could be exhibited and the audience might be dissatisfied if asked to pay to see a cat in a bag or a hen under a bushelbasket  toby spoke of this and bob assured him that it could easily be arranged as soon as all the partners should arrive  you see weve got to carry mrs simpsons cat an kittens home every night cause she says the rats are so thick she can spare her only daytimes an we dont need a cage for her till the show comes off said bob as he bustled around again to find materials  mr stubbss brother demanded his masters attention about this time owing to his attempts to make friends with the calf from the time that this peaceful animal who was to be transformed into a grizzly bear had been brought into the tent the monkey had tried in every possible way to get at him and the calf had shown unmistakable signs of a desire to butt the monkey but the ropes which held them both had prevented the meeting now however bob detected mr stubbss brother in trying to bite his rope in two and it was considered necessary to set a guard over him  reddy was already busily engaged in painting the posters despite the confusion that reigned and as his work would keep him inside the tent he was chosen to have general care of the animals a task which he without a thought of possible consequences accepted cheerfully  leander and joe came together the first bringing his accordion and four rabbits in a cage and the last carrying five striped squirrels in a pasteboard box  leander was the only one who had been thoughtful enough to have his animals ready for exhibition and the cage in which the longeared pets were confined bore the inscription done in a very fanciful way with blue and red crayons wolves keep off  this cage was placed in the corner near the bandstand where the musician could attend to his musical work and have a watchful eye on his pets at the same time  reddy had been busily engaged in painting a notice to be hung up over the calf and as he fastened it to the barn just over the spot where the animal was to be kept bob read with no small degree of pride in the thought that he was the fortunate possessor of such a prize                          grizslee bare                  from the rocky mountains   then the artist went back to his task of painting posters while the others set to work full of determination to build the necessary number of cages if there was wood enough in uncle daniels barn  they found timber enough and to spare but as it was not exactly the kind they wanted toby proposed that they should all go over to the house explain the matter to aunt olive and ask her to give them as many empty boxes as she could afford to part with  as has been said before aunt olive looked upon the circus scheme with favor and when she was called upon to aid in the way of furnishing cages for wild animals she gave the boys full permission to take all the boxes they could find in the shed they found so many that they were able to select those best suited to the different species of animals and yet have quite a stock to fall back upon in case they should make additions to their menagerie  now that the boys had found cages ready made and needing only some bars or slats across the front they did not think it necessary to hurry they stayed for some time to talk of abner and to test some doughnuts aunt olive was frying it is very likely that they would have remained even longer than they did if the doughnutfrying had not been completed and the tempting dainties placed upon a high shelf beyond their reach as a gentle intimation that they had had about as many as they would get that afternoon  after leaving the house they walked leisurely towards the barn little dreaming what a state of confusion their property was inuntil reddy rushed out of the tent his jacket torn his face bleeding and his general appearance that of a boy who had been having rather a hard time of it     chapter xix  the show broke up   why whats the matter why dont you stay an watch the animals asked bob in a tone intended to convey reproach and surprise that one of the projectors of the enterprise should desert his post of duty  watch the animals screamed reddy in a rage you go an watch em awhile instead of eatin doughnuts an see how you like it mr stubbss brother picked a hole in the bag so my cat got out an she jumped on the calf an he tore round awful till he let the hen an mrs simpsons cat loose an i got knocked down an scratched an the whole shows broke up  reddy sat down on the ground and wiped the blood from his face after he had imparted the painful news and all the party started for the tent as rapidly as possible  it was a scene of ruin which they looked in upon after they had pulled aside mr mansfields flag and one well calculated to discourage amateur circus proprietors  mr stubbss brother was seated amid reddys paper and paint holding the crowing hen by the head while he picked her wingfeathers out one by one mrs simpsons cat and kittens each had one of bobs mice in its mouth while reddys cat was chasing one of the squirrels with a murderous purpose the calf was no longer an inmate of the tent but a large rent in the canvas showed that he had opened a door for himself when the cat scratched him and afar in the distance he could be seen head down and tail up as if fleeing from everything that looked like a circus  the destruction was as complete as it could well have been made in so short a time and the partners were quite naturally discouraged toby retained sufficient presence of mind amid the trouble to rescue the crowing hen from the murderous clutches of mr stubbss brother and the monkey scampered up the tentpole brandishing two or three of poor biddys best and longest wingfeathers while he screamed with satisfaction that he had accomplished at least a portion of the work of stripping the fowl  the shows broke up an thats all theres to it said bob sorrowfully as he gazed alternately at the hole in the canvas and his rapidly vanishing calf  are the squirrels all gone asked joe driving the cat from her intended prey long enough to allow master bushytail to gain a refuge under the barn  every one replied reddy the calf kicked the box over when he come towards me an it looked as if there was as many as a hundred come out jest as soon as the cover was off i could have caught one or two but somehow mrs simpsons cat got out of the basket jest then an she flew right on to my face  the marks on reddys cheeks and nose told most eloquently with what force the cat flew and search was at once made for that pet of the simpson family she with her kittens had taken refuge under the barn as soon as the boys entered and thus another trouble was added to the load the circus managers had to bear for that cat must be returned to her mistress by night or trouble might come of it  the mice were entirely consumed two tails alone remaining of what would have been shown to the good people of guilford as strange animals from some faroff country  the squirrels were gone the calf had fled the hen was in a thoroughly battered condition and nothing remained of all that vast and wonderful collection of animals except mr stubbss brother and the rabbits protected by the cage which their masters thoughtfulness had provided  illustration toby rescues the crowing hen from mr stubbss brother  i guess ill take the rabbits home said leander as he lifted the box to his shoulder it wouldnt do to have only them for animals an it haint very certain how long theyll stay alive while that monkeys round  hes broke up the whole show thats what hes done and ben shook his fist at mr stubbss brother while he tried to soothe his halfplucked hen  what are we goin to do asked toby almost in despair  i know what im goin to do said ben as he again placed the hen under the basket im goin to crawl under the barn an try to catch that cat an then im goin home with my hen  it seemed to be the desire of all the partners to get home with what remained of their pets and as ben went under the barn on his hands and knees leander started off with his rabbits bob went to look for his calf reddy gathered up his bundle of paper and joe seized his pasteboard box all going away where they could think over the ruin in solitude  but high up on the post the cause of all this trouble chattered and scolded while his master sat on the ground looking at him as if he wondered whether or not it would ever be possible to reform such a monkey     chapter xx  abners death   after toby was left alone in the tent he remained for some time looking at the triumphant monkey and listening to bens attempts to crawl around under the barn as fast as the cat could when suddenly as if such a thought had not occurred to him before he cried out  dont you want me to come an help you ben  you keep that monkey back thats all the helpin i want ben replied almost sharply and then the sounds indicated that the cat had suddenly changed her position to one farther under the barn while the boy was trying to frighten her out  give it up ben shouted toby after waiting some time longer and not seeing any sign of success on the part of his friend if you come up here about dark youll have a chance to catch her for shell have to come out for something to eat  you take the monkey into the house an ill get along all right was the almost savage reply she smells him an jest as long as hes there shell stay under here  it seemed to toby almost cruel to desert his friend and partner just at a time when he needed assistance but he could do no less than go away since he had been urged so peremptorily to do so and catching his pet without much difficulty he carried mr stubbss brother away from the scene of the ruin he had caused  bens remark that the monkey had broke the show all up seemed to be very near the truth for the boys would not think of going on with so small a number of animals and even if they decided to do without the menagerie bobs calf had wrecked one side of the tent so completely that that particular piece of canvas was past mending  i dont know what well do said toby mournfully after he had finished telling the story to aunt olive the boys act as if they blamed me because mr stubbss brother is so bad and joes squirrels an bobs mice are all gone bens hen dont look as if shed ever mount to much an it dont seem to me that he can get mrs simpsons cat an every one of the kittens out from under the barn  now dont go to worryin about that toby said aunt olive as she patted him on the head and gave him a large piece of cake at the same time you can get a dozen cats for mrs simpson if she wants em and as for mice you tell bob to set his trap out in the granary two or three times an hell have as many as he can take care of im glad the squirrels did get away for it seems such a sin to shut them up in a cage when theyre so happy in the woods  toby was cheered by the very philosophical view that aunt olive took of the affair and came to the conclusion that matters were not more than half so bad as they might have been  you be careful that your monkey dont get out again an go to cuttin up as he did last night for i shall get provoked with him if he hurts my ducks any more and with this bit of advice aunt olive went upstairs to see abner  toby went out to the shed to assure himself that mr stubbss brother was tied so that he could not escape and while he was there uncle daniel came in with an armful of strips of board  there toby boy he said as he laid them on the floor and looked around for the hammer and nails im going to build a pen for your monkey right up here in one corner so that we shant be called up again in the night by a false alarm of burglars besides its almost time for school to begin again an im most too old to commence chasing monkeys around the country in case he gets out while youre away  had it been suggested the day before that mr stubbss brother was to be shut up in a cage toby would have thought it a very great hardship for his pet to endure but the experience he had had in the last twentyfour hours convinced him that the imprisonment was for the best  he helped uncle daniel in his labor to such purpose that when it was time for him to go to the pasture the cage was built and mr stubbss brother was in it looking as if he considered himself a thoroughly abused monkey because he was not allowed to play just such pranks as had roused the household as well as broken up the circus scheme  on his way to the pasture toby met joe and the two had a long talk about the disaster of the afternoon joe believed that the enterprise must be abandonedfor that summer at leastas it would take them some time to repair the damage done and his short experience in the business caused him to believe that they could hardly hope to compete with real circuses until they had more material with which to work  joe promised to see the other partners that evening or the next morning and if they were of the same opinion the tent should be taken down and returned to its owner  perhaps we can fix it all right next year an then abner will be round to help said toby as he parted with joe that night and thus was the circus project ended very sensibly for the chances were that it would have been a failure if they had attempted to give their exhibition  during that afternoon toby had worried less about abner than on any day since he had been sick he had felt that his friends recovery was certain and a load was lifted from his shoulders when he and joe had decided regarding the circus for that out of the way he could devote all his attention to his sick friend surely with the ponies and the monkey they could have a great deal of sport during the two weeks that yet remained before school would begin and toby felt thoroughly happy  but his happiness was changed to alarm very soon after he entered the house for the doctor was there again and from the look on the faces of uncle daniel and aunt olive he knew abner must be worse  what is it uncle danl is abner any sicker he asked with quivering lip as he looked up at the wrinkled face that ever wore a kindly look for him  uncle daniel laid his hand affectionately on the head of the boy whom he had cared for with the tenderness of a father since the day he repented and asked forgiveness for having run away and his voice trembled as he said  it is very likely that the good god will take the crippled boy to himself tonight toby and there in the heavenly mansions will he find relief from all his pain and infirmities then the poorfarm boy will no longer be an orphan or deformed but with his almighty father will enter into such joys as we can have no conception of  oh uncle danl must abner really die cried toby while the great tears chased each other down his cheeks and he hid his face on uncle daniels knee  he will die here toby boy but it is simply an awakening into a perfect glorious life to which i pray that both you and i may be prepared to go when our father calls us  for some time there was silence in the room broken only by tobys sobs and while uncle daniel stroked the weeping boys head the great whitewinged messenger of god came into the chamber above bearing away with him the spirit of the poorfarm boy   the end
