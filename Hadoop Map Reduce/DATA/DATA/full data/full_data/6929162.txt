6929162	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     the monkeys paw   i  without the night was cold and wet but in the small parlour of laburnam villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly  father and son were at chess the former who possessed ideas about the game involving radical changes putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the whitehaired old lady knitting placidly by the fire  hark at the wind said mr white who having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it  im listening said the latter grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand  check  i should hardly think that hed come tonight said his father with his hand poised over the board  mate replied the son  thats the worst of living so far out bawled mr white with sudden and unlookedfor violence of all the beastly slushy outoftheway places to live in this is the worst  pathways a bog and the roads a torrent  i dont know what people are thinking about  i suppose because only two houses in the road are let they think it doesnt matter  never mind dear said his wife soothingly perhaps youll win the next one  mr white looked up sharply just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son  the words died away on his lips and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard  there he is said herbert white as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door  the old man rose with hospitable haste and opening the door was heard condoling with the new arrival  the new arrival also condoled with himself so that mrs white said tut tut  and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall burly man beady of eye and rubicund of visage  sergeantmajor morris he said introducing him  the sergeantmajor shook hands and taking the proffered seat by the fire watched contentedly while his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire  at the third glass his eyes got brighter and he began to talk the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds of wars and plagues and strange peoples  twentyone years of it said mr white nodding at his wife and son when he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse  now look at him  he dont look to have taken much harm said mrs white politely  id like to go to india myself said the old man just to look round a bit you know  better where you are said the sergeantmajor shaking his head  he put down the empty glass and sighing softly shook it again  i should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers said the old man  what was that you started telling me the other day about a monkeys paw or something morris  nothing said the soldier hastily  leastways nothing worth hearing  monkeys paw  said mrs white curiously  well its just a bit of what you might call magic perhaps said the sergeantmajor offhandedly  his three listeners leaned forward eagerly  the visitor absentmindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again  his host filled it for him  to look at said the sergeantmajor fumbling in his pocket its just an ordinary little paw dried to a mummy  he took something out of his pocket and proffered it  mrs white drew back with a grimace but her son taking it examined it curiously  and what is there special about it  inquired mr white as he took it from his son and having examined it placed it upon the table  it had a spell put on it by an old fakir said the sergeantmajor a very holy man  he wanted to show that fate ruled peoples lives and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow  he put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it  his manner was so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter jarred somewhat  well why dont you have three sir  said herbert white cleverly  the soldier regarded him in the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth  i have he said quietly and his blotchy face whitened  and did you really have the three wishes granted  asked mrs white  i did said the sergeantmajor and his glass tapped against his strong teeth  and has anybody else wished  persisted the old lady  the first man had his three wishes  yes was the reply i dont know what the first two were but the third was for death  thats how i got the paw  his tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group  if youve had your three wishes its no good to you now then morris said the old man at last  what do you keep it for  the soldier shook his head  fancy i suppose he said slowly  i did have some idea of selling it but i dont think i will  it has caused enough mischief already  besides people wont buy  they think its a fairy tale some of them and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward  if you could have another three wishes said the old man eyeing him keenly would you have them  i dont know said the other  i dont know  he took the paw and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb suddenly threw it upon the fire  white with a slight cry stooped down and snatched it off  better let it burn said the soldier solemnly  if you dont want it morris said the other give it to me  i wont said his friend doggedly  i threw it on the fire  if you keep it dont blame me for what happens  pitch it on the fire again like a sensible man  the other shook his head and examined his new possession closely  how do you do it  he inquired  hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud said the sergeantmajor but i warn you of the consequences  sounds like the arabian nights said mrs white as she rose and began to set the supper  dont you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me  her husband drew the talisman from pocket and then all three burst into laughter as the sergeantmajor with a look of alarm on his face caught him by the arm  if you must wish he said gruffly wish for something sensible  mr white dropped it back in his pocket and placing chairs motioned his friend to the table  in the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second instalment of the soldiers adventures in india  if the tale about the monkeys paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us said herbert as the door closed behind their guest just in time for him to catch the last train we shant make much out of it  did you give him anything for it father  inquired mrs white regarding her husband closely  a trifle said he colouring slightly  he didnt want it but i made him take it  and he pressed me again to throw it away  likely said herbert with pretended horror  why were going to be rich and famous and happy  wish to be an emperor father to begin with then you cant be henpecked  he darted round the table pursued by the maligned mrs white armed with an antimacassar  mr white took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously  i dont know what to wish for and thats a fact he said slowly  it seems to me ive got all i want  if you only cleared the house youd be quite happy wouldnt you said herbert with his hand on his shoulder  well wish for two hundred pounds then that ll just do it  his father smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity held up the talisman as his son with a solemn face somewhat marred by a wink at his mother sat down at the piano and struck a few impressive chords  i wish for two hundred pounds said the old man distinctly  a fine crash from the piano greeted the words interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man  his wife and son ran toward him  it moved he cried with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor  as i wished it twisted in my hand like a snake  well i dont see the money said his son as he picked it up and placed it on the table and i bet i never shall  it must have been your fancy father said his wife regarding him anxiously  he shook his head  never mind though theres no harm done but it gave me a shock all the same  they sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes outside the wind was higher than ever and the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs  a silence unusual and depressing settled upon all three which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the night  i expect youll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed said herbert as he bade them goodnight and something horrible squatting up on top of the wardrobe watching you as you pocket your illgotten gains  he sat alone in the darkness gazing at the dying fire and seeing faces in it  the last face was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement  it got so vivid that with a little uneasy laugh he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it  his hand grasped the monkeys paw and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed    ii  in the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears  there was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night and the dirty shrivelled little paw was pitched on the sideboard with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues  i suppose all old soldiers are the same said mrs white  the idea of our listening to such nonsense  how could wishes be granted in these days  and if they could how could two hundred pounds hurt you father  might drop on his head from the sky said the frivolous herbert  morris said the things happened so naturally said his father that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence  well dont break into the money before i come back said herbert as he rose from the table  im afraid itll turn you into a mean avaricious man and we shall have to disown you  his mother laughed and following him to the door watched him down the road and returning to the breakfast table was very happy at the expense of her husbands credulity  all of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postmans knock nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired sergeantmajors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailors bill  herbert will have some more of his funny remarks i expect when he comes home she said as they sat at dinner  i dare say said mr white pouring himself out some beer but for all that the thing moved in my hand that ill swear to  you thought it did said the old lady soothingly  i say it did replied the other  there was no thought about it i had just whats the matter  his wife made no reply  she was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside who peering in an undecided fashion at the house appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter  in mental connection with the two hundred pounds she noticed that the stranger was well dressed and wore a silk hat of glossy newness  three times he paused at the gate and then walked on again  the fourth time he stood with his hand upon it and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path mrs white at the same moment placed her hands behind her and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair  she brought the stranger who seemed ill at ease into the room  he gazed at her furtively and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room and her husbands coat a garment which he usually reserved for the garden  she then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business but he was at first strangely silent  iwas asked to call he said at last and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers  i come from maw and meggins  the old lady started  is anything the matter  she asked breathlessly  has anything happened to herbert  what is it  what is it  her husband interposed  there there mother he said hastily  sit down and dont jump to conclusions  youve not brought bad news im sure sir and he eyed the other wistfully  im sorry began the visitor  is he hurt  demanded the mother wildly  the visitor bowed in assent  badly hurt he said quietly but he is not in any pain  oh thank god said the old woman clasping her hands  thank god for that  thank  she broke off suddenly as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned upon her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the others perverted face  she caught her breath and turning to her slowerwitted husband laid her trembling old hand upon his  there was a long silence  he was caught in the machinery said the visitor at length in a low voice  caught in the machinery repeated mr white in a dazed fashion yes  he sat staring blankly out at the window and taking his wifes hand between his own pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courtingdays nearly forty years before  he was the only one left to us he said turning gently to the visitor it is hard  the other coughed and rising walked slowly to the window  the firm wished me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss he said without looking round  i beg that you will understand i am only their servant and merely obeying orders  there was no reply the old womans face was white her eyes staring and her breath inaudible on the husbands face was a look such as his friend the sergeant might have carried into his first action  i was to say that maw and meggins disclaim all responsibility continued the other  they admit no liability at all but in consideration of your sons services they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation  mr white dropped his wifes hand and rising to his feet gazed with a look of horror at his visitor  his dry lips shaped the words how much  two hundred pounds was the answer  unconscious of his wifes shriek the old man smiled faintly put out his hands like a sightless man and dropped a senseless heap to the floor   iii  in the huge new cemetery some two miles distant the old people buried their dead and came back to a house steeped in shadow and silence  it was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen something else which was to lighten this load too heavy for old hearts to bear  but the days passed and expectation gave place to resignationthe hopeless resignation of the old sometimes miscalled apathy  sometimes they hardly exchanged a word for now they had nothing to talk about and their days were long to weariness  it was about a week after that the old man waking suddenly in the night stretched out his hand and found himself alone  the room was in darkness and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window  he raised himself in bed and listened  come back he said tenderly  you will be cold  it is colder for my son said the old woman and wept afresh  the sound of her sobs died away on his ears  the bed was warm and his eyes heavy with sleep  he dozed fitfully and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start  the paw  she cried wildly  the monkeys paw  he started up in alarm  where  where is it  whats the matter  she came stumbling across the room toward him  i want it she said quietly  youve not destroyed it  its in the parlour on the bracket he replied marvelling  why  she cried and laughed together and bending over kissed his cheek  i only just thought of it she said hysterically  why didnt i think of it before  why didnt you think of it  think of what  he questioned  the other two wishes she replied rapidly  weve only had one  was not that enough  he demanded fiercely  no she cried triumphantly well have one more  go down and get it quickly and wish our boy alive again  the man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs good god you are mad  he cried aghast  get it she panted get it quickly and wishoh my boy my boy  her husband struck a match and lit the candle  get back to bed he said unsteadily  you dont know what you are saying  we had the first wish granted said the old woman feverishly why not the second  a coincidence stammered the old man  go and get it and wish cried his wife quivering with excitement  the old man turned and regarded her and his voice shook  he has been dead ten days and besides hei would not tell you else buti could only recognize him by his clothing  if he was too terrible for you to see then how now  bring him back cried the old woman and dragged him toward the door do you think i fear the child i have nursed  he went down in the darkness and felt his way to the parlour and then to the mantelpiece  the talisman was in its place and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized upon him and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door  his brow cold with sweat he felt his way round the table and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand  even his wifes face seemed changed as he entered the room  it was white and expectant and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it he was afraid of her  wish  she cried in a strong voice  it is foolish and wicked he faltered  wish  repeated his wife  he raised his hand  i wish my son alive again  the talisman fell to the floor and he regarded it fearfully  then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman with burning eyes walked to the window and raised the blind  he sat until he was chilled with the cold glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window  the candleend which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls until with a flicker larger than the rest it expired  the old man with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman crept back to his bed and a minute or two afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him  neither spoke but lay silently listening to the ticking of the clock  a stair creaked and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall the darkness was oppressive and after lying for some time screwing up his courage he took the box of matches and striking one went downstairs for a candle  at the foot of the stairs the match went out and he paused to strike another and at the same moment a knock so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible sounded on the front door  the matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage  he stood motionless his breath suspended until the knock was repeated  then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room and closed the door behind him a third knock sounded through the house  whats that  cried the old woman starting up  a rat said the old man in shaking tonesa rat  it passed me on the stairs  his wife sat up in bed listening  a loud knock resounded through the house  its herbert  she screamed  its herbert  she ran to the door but her husband was before her and catching her by the arm held her tightly  what are you going to do  he whispered hoarsely  its my boy its herbert  she cried struggling mechanically i forgot it was two miles away  what are you holding me for  let go i must open the door  for gods sake dont let it in cried the old man trembling  youre afraid of your own son she cried struggling  let me go  im coming herbert im coming  there was another knock and another  the old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room  her husband followed to the landing and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs  he heard the chain rattle back and the bottom bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket  then the old womans voice strained and panting  the bolt she cried loudly  come down  i cant reach it  but her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw  if he could only find it before the thing outside got in  a perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door  he heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back and at the same moment he found the monkeys paw and frantically breathed his third and last wish  the knocking ceased suddenly although the echoes of it were still in the house  he heard the chair drawn back and the door opened  a cold wind rushed up the staircase and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him courage to run down to her side and then to the gate beyond  the street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road
