americans      289     the minute boys of york town     chapter i  two young virginians   when uncle rasmus loses his temper because of some prank which we lads of james town may have played upon him he always says that no good can ever come of that in which chillun an women are mixed  it had never entered my mind that there was in such a remark any cause for anger on my part until that day when saul ogden repeated it shaking his head dolefully as uncle rasmus always did and speaking in the negro dialect so faithfully that one not seeing him might well have supposed his skin was black  of course you remember the engagement at spencers ordinary which place is the same as if i had said spencers tavern on the 26th of june in the year of grace 1781 when lieutenantcolonel simcoe of the queens rangers and lieutenantcolonel tarleton with his legion of horse began to prance around here as uncle rasmus would put it and we virginians were disturbed in more ways than one  there were a number of our people who would have been loyal to the king if governor dunmore had not written himself down such a consummate ass and many even at this time whose sympathies were all with the struggling colonists but who yet hoped matters could be settled without loss of honor to either side meaning that the socalled rebels and his majesty might come together in friendship once more  but when this prancing began when colonel tarleton rode roughshod over our people of virginia without seeming to understand the meaning of the word humanity then it was that even those who had hoped against hope that the colonies might remain in peace and harmony with the mother country began to realize it was no longer possible  it had required five long weary years during which our americans in the north had borne nearly all the brunt of this struggle against the king and i dare not say how much of friendship to persuade those few in virginia who strove to hold some shred of loyalty to the king that the time had come when they must take sides with those who had the best interests of the country at heart no longer looking to royalty for relief  saul ogden is my cousin being but three days younger than i who was in august of 1781 just turned fifteen and although it may seem strange to the lads of new england that we two virginians knew so little concerning what was being done in this america of ours it is true that until the engagement at spencers ordinary there had never been a thought in our minds that we might be called upon or that it would be possible for us to take any part in the bloody struggle which had been prolonged until it seemed of a verity that the people of new york and boston must have come to an end of all their resources so far as struggling against the kings soldiers was concerned  it is true saul and i had heard now and then that even boys in massachusetts and in new york were enrolled or had agreed among themselves to act as minute boys ready to do whatsoever they might at any time regardless of all things else save the proving of that declaration of independence to the satisfaction of the whole wide world  it was on the day before the action at spencers ordinary that i fitzroy hamilton and saul my cousin met for the first time a little french lad by name of pierre laurens who had come up from new orleans with his widowed mother to visit at my home after having spent a summer in boston  a companionable sort of a lad was this little french boy who waved his hands and shrugged his shoulders when he talked as if they were in some way connected with his tongue one who was able to tell many an entertaining story and who had seen so much of this land of america that it was to saul and me as if he was some great traveler while we were only two country louts never having strayed a dozen miles from home  it is not of pierre whom i have set myself down to tell but it was necessary i should refer to him in order that you might understand how we two lads of james town who seldom went away from the plantation save to ride into the settlement and whose longest journey had been from the james to the york river across that neck where one may best arrive at york town came to know that we might serve the cause as minute boys  it was little frenchie who took it upon himself to tell us what he knew he having met several lads in boston who called themselves minute boys he held up before saul and me pictures of the duty we owed our homes as if we virginians needed to be taught our duty and painted in glowing colors the honor and glory which was to be won by those lads who stood ever ready to perform the work of minute boys until we were quite aflame with the idea  i doubt much however whether anything would have come of it had it not been for that same engagement at spencers ordinary when lieutenantcolonel simcoe counting to ride over the pennsylvania men under colonel butler as he had ridden over us virginians found much to his displeasure that it was not always possible for his high mightiness to do exactly as he wished  do not get the idea that i intend to make it appear as if the kings troops were worsted at spencers tavern but it was a drawn battle as i have heard even those who really loved the king admit and it must have been a startling surprise to the swaggering simcoe to have received even a check  it was only natural that after this engagement saul and i egged on by pierre should talk quite seriously of forming a company of minute boys but no sooner would we begin and i strive to point out how we might do this thing or that which would advantage our colony of virginia than saul would break in with the saying of uncle rasmuss that where chillun an women were mixed matters went awry  yet despite my cousins seeming scorn pierre continued to urge that we enroll ourselves as minute boys and when saul asked irritably whether he believed any good would come to the cause if only three lads were banded together agreeing to do whatsoever they might thereby as you can see throwing cold water on the scheme pierre his hands waving and his shoulders shrugged nearly to his ears would insist again and again that if no more than three should set themselves about striving to do something in aid of those who were battling against the king much of good might be accomplished  then saul without really meaning to be unkind would cry out that colonel simcoe had better have a care when our company of three virginia minute boys set out on the warpath and while his friendly scorn fretted me now and then it did not distress pierre in the least  i say it did not distress him and yet i may be mistaken for after saul had repeated uncle rasmuss maxim and spoken sneeringly of the fear which a company of minute boys numbering three might produce throughout the colony little frenchie said waving his hands as if to brush my cousin aside  oh well if you are afraid then it would not be of avail even though you had a company of twenty  afraid saul cried the red blood flushing his face as he advanced almost threateningly toward the little fellow from new orleans do you dare come here and tell a virginian that he is afraid of any person who walks this earth even though he wear a crown  i did not say you were afraid pierre replied sweetly still shrugging his shoulders and waving his hands i said if you were afraid then it would not do for you to talk of being a minute boy it is only those lads in the colonies who dare do this or dare do that who could be of value to the cause  now it is just possible little frenchie was irritated when he made this reply but however it came about certain it is from that moment saul ceased to throw cold water upon the plan of raising a company of minute boys and no longer quoted uncle rasmus or spoke scornfully of what might be accomplished yet at the same time he was not enthusiastic about it until after that sixth of july when at green spring plantation the british under my lord cornwallis met the americans commanded by general lafayette the kings troops getting much the best of the battle  i had thought saul might strive to get even with pierre by pointing out that the young french general was defeated where an american might have been victorious but no he held his peace concerning the nationality of the commander of the army and seemed all afire with a desire to do something with his own hands that should be of benefit to the cause  he insisted we form ourselves into a company of minute boys at once even though there were but three of us claiming even as little frenchie had claimed days and days before that it might be possible even for so small a number to accomplish considerable of good and promising that as the time went by we would be able to add to our numbers  and thus it was that saul and i two virginia lads joined with pierre a frenchie to form a company of minute boys in aid of the cause of liberty and even went so far after agreeing among ourselves that we were to stand by each other so long as life should last to write a letter to master patrick henry telling him of what we had done and offering our services much the same as if they might be of great value  the strangest part of all as it seemed to me was that master henry did actually answer the letter which saul wrote did really speak of us as if it might be possible that we do somewhat of good to the cause and commending us for coming together in such a fashion it was much as if he believed he was writing to three men of importance in virginia who could do this or do that according to their will instead of three lads who had hardly ever with the exception of pierre ventured off the hamilton plantation  i questioned seriously whether master henry really understood sauls letter if he was aware of the fact that we were lads only just turned fifteen and argued that he must have read the missive so hurriedly that he thought three influential planters if you please who may formerly have been lukewarm to the cause were now turned about ready to do whatsoever they might  had saul and i been alone i could have convinced my cousin that i was in the right but little frenchie must needs start up insisting that master henry knew to whom he was writing that a great man like master patrick henry would not read a letter which if it had come from men was of importance so hurriedly as not to understand who had written it he argued from all this that our calling ourselves minute boys even though we might not succeed in doing much that would advantage the colony was of moment even in the eyes of so able a man as he who had been governor of virginia  i must say this for pierre that when he starts out to convince you of a matter there is in his manner and his voice such winning qualities that even though at the outset you were positive he was in the wrong before many minutes had passed you were saying to yourself that all his words were true all his beliefs noble and all that he would do exactly right  it was one thing to call ourselves minute boys to write to governor henry and to be praised by him and quite another matter to be able to do anything whatsoever in aid of the cause  it is true that we did not go far afield in search of opportunities and for the very good reason that we knew not where to go between our town of james and the village of york we knew our way as well as we did through the pantry to that jar of cake which aunt dinah always kept so well filled but beyond that it was all a strange world to us so strange that we doubted whether we might make our way even so far as baltimore without writing ourselves down as the veriest country louts  then came that day when my lord cornwallis led his redcoated men into james town itself and we found ourselves not only surrounded by these soldiers of the king but literally overrun by them so high and mighty was his majestys officer that he quartered his soldiers here there or in the other place at whatsoever house pleased his fancy insisting that we virginians who claimed we had the right to break off from the mother country should take care of those who had come to shoot us down  then of a verity did it seem to me the time had come when we minute boys might do something and i said as much to saul and pierre  my cousin held his peace looking around eagerly as if striving to see here or there some opportunity while little frenchie shrugged his shoulders as if the matter was of little consequence to him and i irritated by his movements taunted him with being a coward saying it was all very well for him while the british soldiers were at a distance to talk loudly about forming a company of minute boys but instantly the enemy were come within reach he was well content to lie down at their feet  i was ashamed of myself even as i spoke and looked to see pierre fly into a rage but instead he shrugged his little shoulders yet higher advising that i go back into the stable yard where uncle rasmus with the hounds around him was sunning himself and there take advice from the old negro who claimed that where chillun an women were mixed no good could come  and to what end should i take advice from uncle rasmus i cried in a rage whereupon pierre waving his hands with the palms uppermost said in a most friendly way  to the end my dear fitz that you may come to understand there is a time for work and a time for remaining idle that he who would accomplish something does not set out upon a task which even before beginning it he knows to be impossible  all of which means what saul demanded and i understood that the lads heart was heavy for within the hour he had been crowded against the wall and a redcoated captain of the foot had shaken him soundly because he did not give way to the swaggerers who had come into virginia to teach us manners  all of which means that the time will come when we shall be able to do something to please even your governor henry pierre said sulkily and then turned away himself to take counsel of uncle rasmus leaving saul and me gazing into each others faces like a couple of simples until my cousin said with a mirthless laugh  i am beginning to believe fitz that little frenchie has more in his head than ever you or i can hope to find in ours  it was the first time i had ever heard him suggest that pierre was wise beyond his years in fact he had always looked upon the little fellow as a pleasant companion and i had believed that i was more than his equal when it came to such tasks as minute boys should do i had set it down in my mind that when the time for real work arrived if it ever did it would be saul and i who would do credit to our town of james  my lord cornwallis did not linger at james town but continued on down the river until he was come to portsmouth having stopped meanwhile on the way to give lafayette a lesson as some of our tory neighbors suggested  then as you very well know it began to appear as if this valiant officer who represented the king in virginia was beginning to get uneasy because the young french general was pressing him rather warmly and continued what was well nigh a retreat until that first day of september in the year of grace 1781 when he entered york town and immediately began to fortify the settlements of york and gloucester as if counting to make there a permanent abiding place  it never occurred to me that my lord cornwallis had really beaten a retreat before the americans and was now come to where he must have aid from new york or from overseas in order to get out from what was much like a trap until uncle rasmus when we lads were gathered about him in the stableyard said shaking his grey head as he chewed meditatively on a straw  it kind er pears to me chillun like as ef dat yere britisher whats flutterin roun ober york way wid his hosses an his guns an his shinin sword was heapin up a sight ob misery for hisself  but surely uncle rasmus after the engagement at green spring you cant believe it would be possible for the french general to do him any harm saul cried surprised by the old negros words which seemed much like a prophecy  i ain sayin chile dat de french ginral is gwine for to hurt de britishers so berry much but it kinder pears to me dis erway you see deys come down yere to de jumpinoff place an dere ain much chance for em to get away cept dey goes by water now ise done hear dat deres a power ob french vessels hangin roun off de capes des like as if dey was waitin to swaller up de redcoated genmen  if he cant get away by water hell go back by land saul suggested and uncle rasmus shook his head mournfully as if it pained him to believe that my lord cornwallis had come into a veritable trap  what bout dat yere virginia genman deys got up norfwhat bout ginral washington do you count chillun des gwine for ter lay stock still when hes got de chance ob nabbin all dis yere stuff what dey lows blongs to de king ef it was some ob yere po wuffless northern trash what was runnin dis yere war for de people ob america den it might be dat lord cornwallis was gwine to turn roun slap when he done got ready but mark you chillun its one ob our virginia genmen dats lookin after tings he knows de lan roun erbout kase why kase hes bin here chillun hes bin right on dis yere plantation an he knows dat when you strikes de town ob york youse got to be sumfin like a flea able to hop a mighty big hop  even suppose my lord cornwallis does beat back the americans who are led by one of my countrymen he might find it very difficult to break through their ranks if he wanted to go back toward richmond by the same way he came pierre said with a wave of the hand which i never hope to fully describe for there was ever much of feeling in his gestures  we remained there in the stable yard until the sun was low in the western sky discussing the situation with uncle rasmus as our oracle it is true we lads could not speak intelligently upon military matters and as i look back now upon that day i realize how much of folly there was in our words but our hearts were nigh to bursting with the desire to do something toward ridding our colony of virginia of those swaggering insolent redcoated men all of whom we believed to be quite as brutal as colonel tarleton and his followers  the result of that afternoons conversation with uncle rasmus if such it can be called was that we three lads decided to go over to york town and see for ourselves how the britishers were disposed there and what they had done in the way of throwing up fortifications for word had come through the negroes that not only the town of york but gloucester also was being fortified thoroughly well  it is not above eight miles from our plantation to the town of york and we counted to ride there and back before the next noon until uncle rasmus as if terrified by such a proposition insisted that we ought never even think of trusting the horses so near the british encampment he told us what we very speedily came to know was true that these servants of the king would not hesitate to despoil us virginians who might be accused of what they were pleased to term disloyalty even to the extent of taking from us our lives  i could not then believe the old negro was talking other than veriest nonsense but before another week had passed i came to understand all too well that we of virginia who were called rebels had no rights which these redcoated gentry were bound to respect  it seemed fortunate that uncle rasmus succeeded in convincing us it would be in the highest degree dangerous to ride good saddle horses and there were none other on the hamilton plantation within the british lines at york town and finally we agreed among ourselves so eager had we grown to know what was being done by my lord cornwallis to walk there and back it would not be a severe journey for we might count on going and returning between sunrise and sunset and yet not exert ourselves overly much  it is not necessary i should set down anything concerning our movements from the time we parted with uncle rasmus until next morning an hour after sunrise when we were come within view of york town having walked at a rapid pace for even though it was yet early in september there was a bit of frost in the air which induced one to move rapidly lest he become chilled  it was when we were come so near the end of our journey that we saw ahead of us less than a quarter of a mile away horry sims who lived on the old livingston plantation three miles above my home and he appeared to be talking earnestly with a mounted officer who was in command of mayhap a dozen men  now horry sims was a lad who might fairly have been called a friend of mine because we had had no angry words together such as could not readily be wiped out but since two or three years neither saul nor i chummed very much with the lad it was believed and with good cause that his father yet remained loyal to the king and was not only ready to make a display of love for his majesty but appeared so willing to show disloyalty to his neighbors that it almost amounted to eagerness  uncle rasmus declared again and again that master sims had had a hand in whatsoever of mischief had been done in virginia and perhaps saul and i might have believed the old negro had he not set down so much of evil to the account of horrys father that it was impossible one man could have compassed it all  certain it is however we had come to look upon master sims as a rank tory and fancying his son might hold the views of his father we two lads meaning saul and me had kept away from him not in the way of enmity but rather to avoid the lad although we treated him fairly when he came where we were  after all we believed we knew it should not have seemed strange to us that horry sims was talking in an apparently friendly fashion with this officer in his majestys service yet we were surprised for now was come the time if he felt so disposed when it was possible for him to do much of harm to his neighbors and on the instant i stepped aside from the highway that i might be screened by the bushes beckoning my companions to do the same  we had thus hidden ourselves from view of those who were ahead of us as i believed before they came to know that we were in the vicinity and saul thinking that now was the time when we might do minuteboy duty whispered to me  shall we creep among the shrubbery until we are come where it is possible to hear the conversation of those beyond  before i could make reply little frenchie shrugging his shoulders whispered  how far think you it would be possible to go without being overheard by some of those who wear red coats if it was night or if yonder men were deaf then might you do it  it is certain they would hear you before you were where it could be possible to distinguish a word of the conversation i said in reply to sauls suggestion and he was seemingly satisfied that such would be the case for instead of making any attempt at an argument he crept more closely to my side pulling pierre with him until we three in order to hold in view that group of red in the midst of which was horry sims were forced to part the foliage with our hands that we might peer between the leaves  perhaps our suspicions of the lad prompted us to see more than really was presented but certain it is i fancied that the officer who was mounted plied horry with questions to which the lad replied as if it gave him pleasure to impart information i also suspected they were saying somewhat concerning our plantation for now and again horry pointed in the direction of my home and the foot soldiers looked back as if fancying they might see the buildings in the distance all of which was the more real to me because betwixt where we stood and the hamilton plantation there was no other dwelling  we remained there in hiding a full half hour and then it appeared to me as if the officer and horry sims parted in friendly fashion the lad to continue on toward york town and the officer and his men to march in our direction as if counting to follow back on our trail  as a matter of course there was nothing we lads could do save remain in hiding trusting that our whereabouts would not be discovered for although we had been doing no harm if a servant of his majesty should come to understand that we three lads were striving to keep out of sight he might take it into his thick head to fancy we were bent on mischief  in those days it was only needed that an officer in the service of the king should have a suspicion in order to straightway plunge into difficulties that person toward whom the suspicions were directed  we held ourselves in cover therefore and i confess to a sense of most profound relief when the squad continued on without giving heed to the possibility that there had been witnesses to the meeting with horry sims  illustration that we might peer between the leaves  now it is only for us to know where those gentlemen with the red coats may be going little frenchie said shrugging his shoulders as we came out from the bushes and turned our faces in the direction from which we had just come whereupon saul asked hotly  are you not for york town have your legs grown weary with walking three or four miles  the town of york will remain where it is yet many a day and i dare venture to say my lord cornwallis will not take his departure suddenly therefore shall we have plenty of time in which to look at the british encampment pierre replied retracing his steps as if he had no care whether we followed  but why go back i cried impatiently of what avail for us to follow that squad who are most likely out foraging  i have seen soldiers nearabout new orleans therefore do i know that when foragers go out they take with them huge wagons to bring back such as may be found those who have just passed are emptyhanded save for muskets and never one of them carried his full complement of accoutrements  well suppose he doesnt saul asked sulkily but yet following little frenchie nevertheless for there was something about the lad which caused you to do that which pleased him whether it was to your liking or not  then it must be they are out on some special duty pierre continued and i am of the mind that we shall find more amusement in watching them than if we follow on the heels of your tory friend who seems also to count on visiting york town  whether pierre had any suspicions of what might be afoot i cannot say but certain it is he pressed forward striving to accommodate his pace with that of the soldiers so that he might not come directly on their heels and saul and i inwardly angry with ourselves for thus copying the movements of the little lad from new orleans kept well alongside him till we had covered a distance of mayhap a mile when my cousin suddenly halted saying almost angrily  we are showing ourselves simples in thus turning back simply because a squad of british soldiers have gone ahead  yet those same gentlemen who wear red coats are marching in the direction of the hamilton plantation little frenchie said with another shrug of his shoulders and a wave of his hands as if to intimate that there was very much more which he might say and i understanding somewhat of the gesture cried out impatiently  why do you say that what have they to do on the hamilton plantation  it is that which i would learn pierre replied it is what i believe it would be better for us to see than if we wandered through the british encampment at york town  until that instant i had never fancied my fathers property might be in any danger from the kings men true it is that he was known as one devoted to the cause of liberty but thus far the war had been at such a distance from us that we had seen little of its horrors and for the first time i began to realize there might be somewhat of mischief afoot therefore pressed forward hotly pierre holding me back from time to time lest we overtake the soldiers  the britishers must have walked more rapidly than we fancied for when finally we were come within view of my home we saw riding out from the stableyard each man mounted and more than one with a ledhorse by his side all the company that had passed us on the road and the animals which they rode and led were horses belonging to my father yea among them sauls mare and my own favorite colt which i cherished as the dearest thing on earth next to my mother  what does it mean i cried speaking with difficulty because of that seeming lump in my throat and little frenchie shrugging his shoulders in a manner that set every nerve in my body aquiver replied as if it was a matter of small moment  they have been to the hamilton plantation in order to get mounts for the officers of my lord cornwalliss army and from this on your colt will carry a burly englishman bedecked with gilt lace and red cloth instead of the lad who loves her so dearly     chapter ii  silver heels   it was for a moment as if i could scarcely credit my senses the idea that any one even those belonging to the plantation should bestride my own colt my little silver heels as i had named her  she had been given to me when a baby and no hand save mine had touched her except when some of the negroes would rub her coat to silken glossiness in order to curry favor with me now she was being ridden and roughly handled by a redfaced private of simcoes queens rangers  when my surprise had given way to anger which it did within a very few seconds i would have run swiftly forward claiming my own silver heels and defying if needs be all that company of redcoats for the rage in my heart was so great that i had no thought of prudence nor of my inability to cope even with a single one of those rangers but that pierre seizing me firmly by the arm actually dragged me amid the foliage where we might be screened from view for the menthe thieves i should say were by this time riding directly toward us  have you lost your wits entirely pierre whispered angrily and forgetting to shrug his shoulders of what avail for you to demand your silver heels when the kings officers would have her for their own do you count on being carried to the guardhouse at york town as a malcontent or even worse a dangerous rebel  i care not where they carry me so i take silver heels from yon brute that is bestride her  and how will you take her little frenchie whispered this time shrugging his shoulders and waving his hands i having so far obeyed him as to be standing by his side beneath the shelter of leaves do you fancy that after colonel simcoes men have seized a likely lot of horseflesh a lad such as you may wrest from them their spoils  but silver heels is my own my very own no one not even the king himself has the right to take her i cried in my folly  but some one has taken her and he is stronger than you my friend fitz pierre said stroking the sleeve of my coat as he would the back of an angry cat it is no less than colonel simcoe of the queens rangers a trusted officer of my lord cornwallis who thus gathers in mounts for his men that they may the better punish the rebels of virginia among whom may be counted your father and even you lad since you are pleased to call yourself a minute boy will you not listen to reason little frenchie continued in a coaxing tone did you not see horry sims talking with these very men and pointing in the direction of the hamilton plantation do you not know he was telling them that a rank rebel owned the placeone whose stables were filled with the best horseflesh in virginia before those men took your silver heels they knew right well to what plantation she belonged and even though you had had by your side a dozen neighbors and friends the result would have been the same now what would it avail that you should pour out your unreasoning wrath simply to the end that they might abuse or perhaps imprison  even before pierre had ceased speaking did i come to understand how useless it would be for me to make any attempt at taking poor little silver heels from those who had stolen her and i crouched yet further among the foliage as the horsemen approached for there had come into my mind on the instant a certain thought call it plan if you will the carrying out of which depended upon holding myself free  then like a great wave upon the seashore there flowed into my heart the memory that it was horry sims who had directed these men where to gohorry sims who had ever envied me the possession of silver heels and who most like knowing that these redcoated minions of the king were looking for horseflesh pointed out the hamilton plantation counting that i would lose my colt he the son of the rankest tory in virginia without cause for enmity against me had laid train for the cruelest blow that could be struck at my heart  during all this while saul had not spoken but now it was even as the horsemen were well abreast our hiding place he turned fiercely upon me clutching both shoulders of my coat as if i were an enemy whom he would bring face to face with himself and whispered in hoarse anger  it is well you formed your company of minute boys just as you did fitz hamilton for now has come the time when they shall see service are we simply because of being lads to remain idle while our own horses are being stolen  on the instant my heart went out in sympathy to saul for i knew full well that he loved his mare even as i did my own colt silver heels and harking back to the thought which had come into my mind a few seconds before i said to him stoutly shaking my fist in the direction of that popinjay of an officer who was riding so proudly in advance of his squad of thieves  we will make them pay for this days work saul ogden and while we are casting up the reckoning with those who wear red coats there is one not far away who must also be held accountable for that which has just been done  meaning horry sims saul cried actually trembling in his impotent rage  meaning that worse than tory for it was with no idea of serving the king or aiding the kings cause that the miserable scoundrel pointed out to those horse thieves where your mare and my colt might be found  he shall have cause to regret that he saw this days sun rise saul said in a low tone his voice aquiver with anger and then the horsemen having passed he stepped out into the road turning his face toward york town  where would you go pierre cried excitedly following the lad to seize him by the skirt of his coat would you venture into the british encampment at a time when your heart is so filled with anger that it is not possible you could hold it in check  ay that is exactly where i count on going you need have no fear pierre laurens that i shall do aught which may deprive me of my liberty for i will hold myself in the presence of those who wear red coats as gentle as any dame in silken skirts until i have got back my mare or shot her with my own hand to spare the poor creature the abuse that would come from such handling if however in the meanwhile i should come across horry sims where were none of his kidney who could fall upon me with too great force then is it certain you would see whether a minute boy and of late im beginning to be proud of that titleyou would see whether a virginian a member of a company of minute boys even though they number only three could do anything toward paying off his just and lawful debts  to have argued with saul at that time would have been worse than useless as i knew full well for when the cloud of anger was upon him he would not listen to prayers or to arguments and in good truth i was more than willing he should go his way counting to make it my own for at that time i believe it would have been actually impossible for me to have turned my back on poor little silver heels even though by going into the british encampment at york town i could do her no good  pierre soon realized that he could not hope to turn saul from the path he had set out on and he showed himself the dear little comrade i have ever since known him to be by ranging alongside first of saul and then of me as we went in single file knowing full well that we might encounter great danger and yet holding himself ready to bear full share of it  we were not in the mood for conversation saul and i as we pressed forward on the way to york town giving no heed to anything around us and little frenchie soon came to understand this for after striving to speak first with one and then the other in a friendly fashion and receiving no reply he held his peace but now and again taking us by the hand as if to show his friendliness and loyalty to his friendships  i was burning with the desire to come up with horry sims who it was reasonable to believe had gone into the town of york and to that end quickened my pace although knowing full well it was best i did not speak with the viper that day  there was yet before us if we both lived plenty of time in which to settle the debt and if i attempted to wipe off the score before having done that which was in my mind then might it be that i sacrificed silver heels herself simply to gratify my desire for revenge  that which i had in my mind it was as wild a scheme as ever entered a boys brain i am willing to confess and yet it was neither more nor less than the following of poor little silver heels until i could see where she was quartered after which devoting all my time and my energy to her rescue for it was to me almost as if she was a human being in the hands of a vengeful enemy  all this may seem wild or witless when spoken by a lad of fifteen but i had the will and determination of a man who had grown greyheaded and knew that i lacked not the courage once my anger had been aroused  in cold blood i could be as timorous as any girl but once the fever of rage beset me i lost sight of all the odds that might be against me which mayhap is much the same as saying that at heart i was a coward and when i showed any token of bravery if indeed i ever did it was the madness of anger rather than true courage  be that as it may i am not more disposed at this day to discuss such a question than i was on that morning when with the blood seemingly boiling in my veins i trod on the heels of saul as we plodded our way toward york town in moody angry silence while little frenchie ran by the side of first one and then the other mutely striving to show the wealth of friendship which was in his heart  it was well for us that the miles were long and reasonably many on the road to the town of york else might we have blundered into the british encampment to our sorrow for we had no plan save that of following our horses and it was not until we were come within sight of the village having met neither man woman nor child on our way that pierre said shrugging his shoulders and waving his hands as he ran swiftly ahead to turn and face us  are you members of the minuteboy company intent on blundering into the very midst of our lord cornwalliss army without knowing what it is you count on doing  we count on finding our horses saul exclaimed sturdily striving to push little frenchie aside but failing because the lad stood firm  ay that is your desire my dear friend but tell me how you would compass it by pressing on in sulky fashion and telling every redcoated soldier you meet that you are here to force the british troops into giving up your property  both saul and i came to a sudden halt astonished by the quick change in pierres manner for now his voice was filled with scorn and one might have said he was chiding us as an elder chides a child  there is little need of telling why we have come i replied impatient because the lad would thus delay us surely we may wander at will through the town of york  in new orleans i have been among soldiers who were encamped and did not find it possible to wander at will pierre said again shrugging his shoulders in that peculiar manner which set my nerves atingling it will be strange indeed if my lord cornwallis allows the rabble to enter his lines at pleasure  rabble saul cried in anger do you call us of hamilton plantation a rabble  i am not the one who would thus misname you and pierre held out his hands deprecatingly but unless i am much mistaken in these redcoated followers of the king they will give even worse names to those who are suspected of being friendly to the cause which the colonists have thus far upheld so nobly it might be mayhap that if you were of the rabble you would be permitted to enter the enemys lines simply because of your curiosity but i doubt me much whether a minute boy would be allowed to inspect the encampment lest he give information to general lafayette  we are not known as minute boys saul cried fiercely striving to wave pierre aside but the little frenchie held his ground as he said with a peculiar laugh  ay but you are known as worse my lad you are known as coming from the hamilton plantationfrom a place which general cornwallis and colonel simcoe have set down as a nest of rebels otherwise they would not have made such a wholesale seizure of horseflesh without having given some notice once let you be recognized and i question whether you may not have some trouble to return at will  who knows saul began and then stopped abruptly because as i understood full well he realized that horry sims was somewhere nearabout york town perhaps within the british encampment and he must have stood fairly well with a certain portion of simcoes rangers after giving such information as he did concerning the hamilton plantation  if we were seen loitering about the works it was certain horry would point us out as having a leaning toward the cause as much as this last did he know for a fact because many a time since general cornwallis had come into virginia had we lads discussed the situation when neither saul nor i were backward in saying that it would give us greatest pleasure if we were of age to be taken into the ranks of the american army as soldiers  perhaps you who have seen so much of military encampments can tell us what we ought to do saul said sneeringly and a deep flush came over pierres face as he understood the meaning of my cousins tone but like the true little comrade that he was he gave due heed to the grief in sauls heart and seemingly paid no attention to the sneer as he replied in a friendly tone  i am not setting myself up as having more of wisdom than either you or fitz but i truly believe it is within my power to give good advice to two lads who are yet so angry as to have lost sight of prudence you have due reason to believe that horry sims who has already this morning done you grievous wrong is in york town and if there was enough of vileness in his heart for him to point out to those soldiers of the king your horses that he might strike a heavy blow then would he do yet worse on seeing you within the encampment i have never met the lad but once he has no cause for enmity against me i am so poor in this worlds goods that it is beyond his power to deprive me of anything save liberty and on seeing me alone i dare venture to say he would have no thought that i might have been your comrade this morning but  yet he knows that you and your mother are guests at the hamilton plantation saul added sharply  my mother and i are french who have lately come from new orleans and he can not point us out as having said a word of disrespect against the king  for my part it was needless for pierre to argue i had come to understand before he was done with speaking that it would be better for him to reconnoitre the ground that he could learn as much if not more than the three of us meanwhile running comparatively no risk and when saul would have argued i cried out impatiently  can you not see that it is better pierre go alone do you not realize that however eager we may be it is not possible we could gain possession of the horses within any very short time and all we are needing now is to know where they are quartered let pierre do as he suggests and learn so much as he can then when we are minded to venture our heads within the lions jaws it will seemingly be the first visit to the town of york instead of the second thereby shall we stand less risk of being suspected of an intent to do harm  saul soon gave way although he was burning to venture so far as might be possible inside the british lines because running into real danger was as a balm to his heart while he yet smarted under the loss of his mare  therefore it was i told little frenchie to go his way taking due care to his own safety and endeavor to find out where the stolen horses had been quartered pressing upon him although there was no necessity of so doing that we were more eager to learn where silver heels and sauls mare were than to know the whereabouts of the other horses  and do you poor lads believe it may be possible for you to wrest from the grasp of these redcoated soldiers that which they have laid hands upon pierre asked in a tone of sadness and i replied striving in vain to repress the tone of irritation  we shall at least make an attempt pierre laurens even though there is little hope of success i could not find it in my heart to remain idle while silver heels is in the possession of a britisher no matter how much of danger i might be sticking my nose into now go and if so be your visit is vain then will i take the chances myself although i have come to believe with you that saul and i should not be seen loitering around the village this morning of all others because it would easily be guessed why we had come  pierre made as if to speak and then most like realizing the uselessness of attempting while we were in such angry frame of mind to combat any plans we had formed he turned on his heel and strode off in the direction of the town from whence we could hear now and then the beating of drums the hum of voices and noises which betokened the digging up of earth  saul had thrown himself face downward amid the bushes striving as i understood from the pain in my own heart to prevent giving noisy token to his grief and i was in no mood to exchange words with him therefore we two lads lay concealed by the side of the road giving no heed to what might happen to our disadvantage but dwelling only upon the loss which had come to us  to some it may seem veriest folly that we should so mourn over the loss of our horses but let him who laughs once have companionship with such a colt as silver heels as i have had and then if he can have mirth in his heart when she has been taken away from him most like to be abused as are horses in the army then will i say that he has not within him the instincts of a true man  silver heels had come to know me as i knew her at my faintest call she would gallop to my side however tempting the grass when she was hungry and no dumb animal could have given greater proof of joy at being with me than did she time and time again when we scampered here or there bent only on pleasure  i could not have said how long little frenchie remained absent for neither saul nor i took heed to the passage of time as we lay there amid the foliage eating our hearts out with sorrow  certain it is however that the afternoon was well spent before we saw him coming up the road and our surprise can well be imagined when we learned that he had with him as companion none other than horry sims  he has taken up with that snake of a tory brood simply because of believing that those on the sims plantation stand higher in favor with the redcoated soldiers than do we of the hamilton plantation saul cried angrily and so incautiously loud that i pressed my hand over his mouth as i whispered in reproof  you have no right saul ogden to cast aught of discredit upon pierre even though you have known him so short a time he has shown himself a good friend and to my satisfaction at least has proved that he would not turn traitor more especially when it might be simply to his own advantage  now little frenchie knew full well where he had left us by the roadside for i saw him mark the dead cottonwood tree neath the foot of which we were lying and yet he went on his way past us giving no heed but talking busily and as it seemed interestedly with horry sims  i must admit that just for the instant there came into my heart a great fear lest that which saul had said might be true and then i thrust it from me saying in my mind that i would not so wrong a lad who had all the marks of gentlemanly breeding surely even though he might at some other time be willing to play us false he would not do so while we were in such deep sorrow  if he is playing fair with us why should he at this minute be hand in glove with that tory scoundrel saul whispered hoarsely as he sat up to gaze after the two who were walking rapidly down the road in the direction of our home why did he not have speech with us surely he knows where we are  to have spoken when he passed would have been to tell horry sims that we were lying in hiding while he went into york town to pick up such information as might be possible the chances are the lad met the young torycame across him by accident of course and could do no less than show a friendly front unless he was minded to much the same as tell him we were counting on making reprisals because of the loss of our horses  although this was the reasonable and to my mind the only explanation of little frenchies behavior saul would not at first admit it but insisted that there must be treachery somewhere else than in horry simss heart and thus he argued until i verily believe he convinced himself that our little comrade from new orleans could have done no different then came the question as to whether we should remain where we were or start homeward for now it was too late for us to make any venture into the town of york even though we had been so minded  saul was for pushing on hurriedly and overtaking the young tory flog him within an inch of his life it was all i could do to hold him back sufficiently long to repeat again and again that a flogging was all too poor a punishment for the crime he had committed and that if we should lay hand against him now we might and very likely would put a stumbling block in our way for until the moment came when we could repay the debt in full it was absolutely necessary we seem to hold ourselves friendly with this fellow who had dealt us such a cruel blow  i forced saul to listen to me so long that it would have been useless to set out in pursuit and after that again came the question as to whether we ought to go on our way homeward or wait where we were  it was fortunate we spent so much time in such discussion fortunate that saul differed from me as to what we had best do for while we lay there disputing we heard a crashing of the underbrush where the growth was thick and a moment later little frenchie looking heated and so nearly breathless that for a full minute he could not speak so we might understand came into view  panting and with the perspiration streaming down his face he threw himself headlong on the ground beside me breathing like one who had been running a race until it was possible to have control over his voice when he said hurriedly as if eager we should understand all the reasons for his movements without loss of time  i was forced to go a certain distance with that young villain else would he have mistrusted that you might be near about  how did you get rid of him i asked why might he not suspect something when you broke away instead of continuing on so far as his home which lay directly in your path if you were heading for the hamilton plantation  i made out that i knew of a short way through the woods which would take me directly out of his path and when we were come to that trail which leads off toward the york river i left him although he was mightily surprised at hearing that such a course would bring me to your home more directly than if i continued on the road  where did you pick him up saul asked impatiently why did you waste time on the scoundrel it would seem to me that after all he has done it was your business to flog rather than make friends with him  by this time pierre had so far recovered his breath that it was possible for him to speak distinctly and without undue effort rising to his feet and shrugging his shoulders as he spread his hands palm outward he said in his mild voice and with that peculiar accent  to have done so my friend would have been to show myself an enemy to you while i was striving to make my way inside the british lines pretending that i was simply bent on curiosity he came up seemingly having a right of way everywhere within the encampment and when he greeted me civilly evidently wondering why i was there alone i could do no less than treat him as i would have done yesterday in the hope that something might drop from his lips which would aid me in my search  and did it i asked eagerly for now i began to understand that by bearing himself friendly toward horry sims pierre had succeeded where otherwise the chances were he must have failed  indeed it did the lad said in a tone of triumph it was far better than if i had indulged in a game of fisticuffs with him because his redcoated friends would speedily have come to his relief  what did you learn saul demanded fiercely  where your mare and fitzroys silver heels are stabled was the quiet reply whereupon i sprang up as if within my body was a stout steel spring which had lately been released  you learned where they were stabled i cried excitedly  ay that i did pierre replied with a shrug of the shoulders and without any great labor for horry sims led me at once and meeting with no interference from the soldiers to where all the horses which had been taken from the hamilton plantation were quartered showing them to me as if it caused him great pain in the heart because such an injury had been done a neighbor  what did he say about it saul demanded  he told me that he was walking along bent only on coming into that town of york in order to see the british encampment when a squad of rangers rode past him leading your mare and fitzroys silver heels then i asked if he had no suspicion such a thing might have been thought upon by the britishers and he replied that until he was come this time to york town he had never seen the rangers in fact had not believed they were with my lord cornwalliss army all of which went to prove that he the snakey tory told the redcoated soldiers where they might find the largest and best supply of saddle beasts  did he explain how it chanced he could wander at will inside the encampment and also take with him a companion i asked  he told me he had come upon a lieutenant of tarletons legion who when cornwallis was in james town had been quartered at the sims plantation and that this officer had made the way plain for him saying he might visit the encampment at will  if there had been any question in our minds up to this time as to the guilt of horry sims no doubt now remained we knew because of having seen the scoundrel that he had had speech with simcoes rangers before the horses were seized and his story that one of tarletons officers had been quartered at the sims plantation during cornwalliss short stay in james town i knew to be absolutely false he had played the traitor deliberately and as the price of his treachery gained admission to the encampment most like vouched for by the officer who had met him on the road that morning  the hope is pierre said after a short pause and with that indescribable gesture that the tory horry will not suspect i took the trail to york river for any other purpose than that of gaining the hamilton plantation as quickly as might be  why i asked  because it is not well he should know i have been in your company this day else he might suspect that we know of his treachery it is in my mind that we must keep him to the belief that we know nothing whatsoever concerning his misdeeds of this day  but how can we come at the scoundrel save he does know that same thing saul cried he ever being hotheaded and not inclined to listen to any plans or arguments when he was burning for revenge or excited by the desire for pleasure  i have in mind pierre said waving his hands in that odd fashion that which i believe will give the tory lad into our keeping where we may do by him without fear of interference  what is it i asked eagerly for all that time we had been awaiting the lads return from the town of york i had turned over and over in my mind without avail plans for laying the tory villain by the heels  it may not be that i shall explain everything now little frenchie said as he shrugged his shoulders and for the very reason that it is not as yet plain in my own mind i have a plan which if it can be worked out will not only give him to our hands but also gain possession of at least the mare and silver heels despite the fact that they are within the british encampment     chapter iii  uncle rasmuss advice   plead though i might little frenchie would give us no hint as to the plan of which he had spoken but when we were on our homeward way walking well within the cover of the foliage lest we inadvertently come upon horry sims he turned the conversation upon such of the fortifications of the town of york as he had seen and both by his tone and by his manner did i understand that he would give us no inkling whatsoever of that which he had in mind concerning silver heels and sauls mare  the lad must have seen more of military movements than we had fancied for he knew full well all the names of the different kinds of fortification and could explain their construction speaking at times almost as a veteran soldier might have spoken  although saul and i knew nothing whatsoever concerning such matters we understood from pierres speech that he had not only taken note of each halfcompleted redoubt or bastion but knew full well what part each might be called to play in the defences of the town if so be our american army made an attack  he told us that the british line extended on an irregular course from the river to the sloping grounds in the rear of the village near what is known as the pigeon quarter and was seemingly intended when completed to entirely surround york town across the peninsula of gloucester and just in the rear of that settlement he said that another line of entrenchments was being thrown up  from what he had seen of the completed work as well as that which was half finished or but just begun he announced that there would be seven redoubts and six batteries on the land side all to be connected by entrenchments and that on the river bank preparations were making for a line of batteries the largest or grand battery being near the church  as for outworks pierre said there would be three redoubts on the margin of the ravine to the southwest of the town another a little eastward of the road to hampton two on the extreme right near the river and the fusileers redoubt on the left  he also told us that my lord cornwallis had made his headquarters at governor nelsons house for it can well be understood that our governor of virginia noted for more than a leaning toward the cause of liberty would not remain within the limits of york town or anywhere that it was likely the britishers could get hold of him while general cornwallis was occupying this portion of our state of virginia  more than this little frenchie in his quiet way had learned that my lord cornwalliss army numbered nearabout seven thousand men meaning that such number of british troops were encamped either at gloucester or in the town of york  when i questioned him as to how he had gathered all this information which it seemed to me none save an adroit man might gain he put me off with a laugh declaring that while englishmen and frenchmen were natural enemies these redcoated soldiers seemed to take an especial liking for a small french boy who had lived no nearer france than new orleans  it came into my mind more than once that mayhap pierre had found even among the kings troops an old friend improbable though this possibility might be but if such was the case the lad never admitted it and to this day it is impossible for me to say how he learned so much concerning york town and the enemy who occupied it in that one visit of four or five hours  the pain in my heart caused by the theft of silver heels was in no degree lessened as we journeyed on now listening to what little frenchie had to say regarding the situation of affairs at york town and again either saul or i breaking out in some wild plan for regaining possession of our horses which if put into execution would have led to our arrest if not to our death  then we were arrived home and although i might have expected it i was thoroughly surprised at finding everything in confusion the greatest excitement prevailed everywhere among the people and work was seemingly at a standstill  as a matter of course my father was not at home he being with the american army somewhere in the north and i wondered much that dalton the overseer had not set matters straight for many hours had elapsed since the visit of the redcoated thieves  uncle rasmus was the only one among the slaves or the servants who appeared to have regained possession of his senses and he was sitting in the stableyard as i had seen him almost every day of my life when the sun was shining meditatively chewing a straw and looking straight ahead as if he could see in the distance that which was not visible to other eyes  the old fellow was apparently unmoved by the bustle and confusion everywhere around him and i certain of finding in him a sympathizer went to speak with him even before visiting my mother  are all the horses gone uncle rasmus i asked seating myself by his side while saul and pierre followed my example  all de saddle hosses chile de britishers done took ebery las hoof dat was wuff takin  and silver heels with them i said in a tearful voice  yes chile silber heels is wid de res i kinder lowed it was gwine ter break your heart honey but dere was nuffin ole rasmus could do to stop it kase it seemed like dis yere stableyard was plum full ob redcoats all ob em swearin an laughin till it seemed like dey was jes achin to buse some ob us niggers scandalous an i low dey would ef wed giben em de least little word ob back talk  do you know who sent them here uncle rasmus saul asked suddenly and the old negro nodded his head as he replied  ise done gone hab my spicions chile deres plenty ob plantations nearer de town ob york dan dis yere an yet cordin to what i heard de sogermen say dey habent been anywhere else yet so i was lowin dat some ob de folks roun here dem as claim to hab a mighty big love for us set em on  cant you guess who it was uncle rasmus saul continued and the old man replied in a dreamy tone  i done hab my spicions but in dese yere times when you don know whos your friend moren half de time dere ain any sense in talkin right out what youse tinkin ise lowin i can guess who set de redcoats aflame  you couldnt guess in a week saul interrupted because youre thinking it might be some one of the planters like master sims instead of which it was that worthless son of hishorry  watching uncle rasmus closely i fancied that this information was not new to him and straightway fell awondering how it was that this old negro who seldom strayed out of the stableyard let alone going away from the plantation should have an inkling of what might be done so far away as the sims place  pierre has been to york town uncle rasmus and he knows where silver heels and sauls mare are quartered  an is dat all he knows chile  it strikes me thats finding out considerable in one day and then i explained how it was little frenchie was able to move about york town as he had after which uncle rasmus asked in a hopeful tone  did he fin out chile which ossifer was gwine to ride silber heels an which one laid his mark on sauls mare  as a matter of course pierre could not give the information but he explained with great minuteness where the horses were stabled and i was impatient with him because of wasting so many words when it could do no good  much to my surprise uncle rasmus drank it all in and when little frenchie had come to an end of his overly long story the old negro said taking the straw from his mouth and holding it in the air as if to ascertain from which direction came the wind  i reckon ise bleeged to be goin chillun for an ole man like uncle rasmus its quite a journey from here to de town ob york an ef i counts on doin it twixt now an sunrise id better get my ole legs amovin  york town uncle rasmus i cried in surprise and well i might for within the past three years i had never seen the old negro go as far from the house as the cotton fields  dats what i said chile an ise bleeged to be amovin  but why are you going there uncle rasmus i cried catching him by the arm to insure his attention and he replied dreamily but as it seemed to me with a certain air of decision  i low its time i was lookin arter marse hamiltons house down yander whar ole mary libed when he done set her free  theres no need of your looking after that old shanty uncle rasmus i cried surely father gives no heed to it now it isnt worth half a dozen shillings except for firewood  i know dat honey ise done foun all dat out but sumfins tellin me dat its time i was lookin arter marse hamiltons property whats been lef dere in de town ob york whar de britishers am rampagin an rarin roun like dey was gone crazy  but youll starve to death there uncle rasmus i dont fancy there are very many of old marys goods left in the hovel for if i remember rightly young dinah laid claim to the greater portion and how will you get along for something to eat  i was kinder lowin chile as how you an saul an maybe little pierre as you call him would tend out on de ole man des enough to fetch now an den what he was needin to hol de soul in his body  but if as pierre says the british entrenchments run back of the town as far as the pigeon quarter then old marys cabin must be inside and how would we be able to get through the lines  well chile i ain got any great lub for de britishers but ise lowin dey ain so hardhearted as to hold out a couple ob chillun what wanted to feed a pore ole nigger it kinder seems as if deyd be shamed to let your uncle rasmus starbe eben ef he is no count kase ob bein so ole specially ef all deyd hab to do to keep him erlong was to let a couple or three chillun in de lines  it was all blind to me this sudden whim of uncle rasmus to take up his quarters in old marys cabin which was hardly more than the veriest shanty and while i stood looking at the old man trying to get some glimmer of truth out of what was fast becoming a mystery little frenchies face lighted up wondrously as he leaped forward seizing the old darkey by both hands while he cried joyously  its a great plan uncle rasmus its a great plan ill go with you a good part of the way sos to help along for of course you count on carrying something  i spects ise boun to hab a blanket chile an sumfin in de way ob food kase i ain sich a foolish ole nigger as to tink i could get trou a sogermans lines in de night an so ill be needin sumfin for a bed ef nothin more  but if you are foolish enough to go to york town whats the sense of starting tonight why not wait till morning you say yourself you dont expect to get through the lines after dark therefore why sleep on the ground when you could stay here in comfortable quarters saul cried whereupon pierre turning from uncle rasmus said to the lad  cant you understand that this old negro is paving a way for you and fitz to get at your horses  i may be a thickhead but i surely cant see how taking up his quarters in old marys cabin where weve got to carry food to him every day or two is helping us along very fast saul cried angrily and little frenchie throwing back his shoulders laughed heartily finding something so comical in sauls words that it was a full minute before he could make reply  then he said his voice all atremble with mirth  dont you see that uncle rasmus is making a reasonable excuse for you to go into the town of york every day if so be youre minded cant you understand that once hes in old marys cabin theres good reason why we should spend the night with him now and then suppose we carried uncle rasmus food three days running it would become necessary to explain that the old man had been intending to come out to the plantation but since we had lost our horses we were forced to feed him as best we might because he was too feeble to walk home cant you also see pierre continued eagerly why the old man wants to get there in the night he counts on sneaking through the lines instead of meekly lying down on the ground as he has said and intends if so be it is possible to get into old marys cabin without making known to the britishers that he has just come into the village but rather counts on letting it be understood that he has been there ever since they entered the town  its amazin how some ob dese yere chillun can pick up an idee what oder folks am tryin to hide uncle rasmus said as he patted little frenchie on the head and then hobbled toward his cabin as if he was so feeble that only with the greatest exertion could he drag one foot after another  surely i was thickheaded on that afternoon for even after pierre had made full explanation of uncle rasmuss intended movements it was a good five minutes before the whole scheme came plain in my mind and then i realized that this old negro of ours was about to do more toward regaining possession of silver heels if indeed she ever did come into my possession again than all of us lads with our noisy talk  he would take up his abode in the town of york sneaking through the lines if so be it was possible to the end that the british might not know he had just come in from the outside and once there the way was open for all three of us lads to wander at least so far through the town as old marys cottage it would be strange indeed after the redcoats were accustomed to seeing us come and go for there could be no question but that we would get permission to minister to the poor old negro if we could not venture further and further inside the lines until should fortune favor us we might be able to go whithersoever we desired  at all events with uncle rasmus dwelling in the townwith uncle rasmus ill and needing our attention we would be enabled to spend our time in york without arousing even the suspicions of that miserable snake whom people call horry sims  of course so far as the little scoundrel was concerned he might well wonder how it chanced that uncle rasmus had gone into the town of york for whenever any of the lads had come around the hamilton plantation they had been accustomed to seeing the old negro sitting in his favorite place in the stableyard but i could see now as the scheme came home to me that it would be possible in case horry sims made inquiries to let it be understood that uncle rasmus had gone there some days before my lord cornwalliss army entered the town being stricken so ill he could not be safely moved  in fact i saw nothing but brightness in the future and all through this old negro whom i had seen sitting in the stableyard chewing straw day after day until he had come to seem much like one of the dogs or the horses having no mind of his own but implicitly obeying the will of his master  having come to fully understand all of benefit which might accrue to us in this move of uncle rasmus i would have aided the old negro to the best of my ability and insisted that he wait until i go to this plantation or that where i might borrow a horse to carry him but he would have none of it  he was bent on entering the town of york in his own way and alone the only assistance he would agree to was that we might carry his blankets and scanty store of provisions a certain portion of the distance and when i would have insisted on bringing out some delicacies from the house he positively refused to accept them whereupon i urged almost angrily to be allowed to do as i pleased until little frenchie whose head is ever clear said to me laughingly  cant you understand you thickheaded fitz that it would be strange if uncle rasmus was disabled in old marys cabin with all sorts of delicacies in the way of food if the britishers should grow suspicious and look into the matter wouldnt they think it odd the old man had been allowed to remain in that hovel while there were yet horses in the stables of the hamilton plantation to bring him back where he belonged  surely there was good reason why i should be called thickheaded for this was not the only time since morning that i had shown myself to be a stupid yet i was not so simple but i could readily understand that even though we might have the advantage of being able to go and come from the town of york to the plantation at will we would not be so far advanced toward the recovery of the stolen horses as to be able to say that our work was in a fair way of being performed  it was one thing and i grant you an important one to enter the town without giving rise to suspicions but quite another and more serious to take from the quarters of the british army horses which would be guarded by soldiers and get away with them through the lines of sentinels out over the entrenchments  then this minuteboy business that you talked about fitz is to be dropped saul asked a few moments after uncle rasmus had left us and i turned upon him in astonishment whereupon he reading the question which must have been plainly written on my face added  it would seem as if we were turning all our attention to getting back the mare and silver heels in which case as a matter of course there can be no other work for us if we should be so fortunate as to succeed it would become necessary to scurry out of this part of the country lest my lord cornwallis lay us by the heels for i suppose they would set it down as stealing if we should reclaim our own  and why might it not be that you would continue the work of minute boys even while striving to get back the horses which were taken from you little frenchie asked as if in wonderment it is not to be supposed we can go into the town of york and without delay take from the stables where simcoes rangers keep their horses two of the best but many days will pass yea must pass before the work can be accomplished in the meanwhile if we are free to go in and out of the town why might it not be possible for us to carry much of information to the americans it would seem as if our work as minute boys was but just beginning  what between your plans and those of uncle rasmuss i confess to being thoroughly mixed saul muttered impatiently in the first place even though you deem it of so much importance i fail to see how being able to go in and out of the town will add to the possibility of getting our horses unless i am much mistaken in regard to military matters it will not be a simple affair to steal either the mare or silver heels from the soldiers then if we are bending all our efforts to that one purpose how are we to serve the colony what we could learn in the town of york that would be of importance to the americans passes my understanding  we shall see pierre said laughingly with a shrug of the shoulders and a wave of his hand it shall be for a little french boy from new orleans who never saw the land where his father and mother were born to teach you virginians how it may be possible to bear a hand in this business which is like to grow exceeding warm when our french general closes in on cornwalliss army for now has come the time to hold the kings men as a strong man holds a child in his grasp if so be your general washington is minded to give him the authority  to hear you talk pierre one might suppose you had served with soldiers all your short life saul cried irritably and again little frenchie laughed as he replied  my father was a soldier and fought bravely i have heard him and his comrades conversing i have seen them draw plans for a campaign and discuss the strength of fortifications until it seemed to me even though i have had no experience in such matters that i knew much concerning them  then the conversation ceased saul seemingly giving himself up to a sulky mood while i had so much food for reflection with dwelling upon what we might do and the possibilities of running our necks into a british noose that i was not minded to give play to my tongue  uncle rasmus remained within his cabin a good half hour while we lads awaited him having no inclination to meet our mothers just at this time lest we be ordered to keep within the bounds of the plantation and thereby prevented from carrying out our plans foolhardy though they might be  when the old negro did appear among us again he was ready for the journey that is to say he had with him two blankets and a small bundle or package which i doubted not contained the store of food he was minded to carry with him to york town in addition to this outfit i noticed that he had his heaviest cane which was fashioned with a handle much like a crutch and i dimly wondered hardly knowing that i did so whether he had taken this particular stick just at this time as a weapon or simply to guide his faltering steps  i reckon ise done put ole rasmuss business on dis yere plantation in shape an now chillun ise gwine ter be moseyin erlong an ef youse countin to help de ole man it wont be out ob de way ef yer carry dese yere blankets an de little bundle kase i ain been much used to totin stuff dese las years  of course were going to help you uncle rasmus i said quickly taking the blankets from his hands we count on keeping right by your side from here until you come within sight of the town of york  ise lowin chile dat our roads don come together till we get to a dead cottonwood tree whar you say you an saul lay hid while de little french boy went on inter de town  but which way are you going uncle saul cried theres no other road than the nearest course from here to york  ise lowin your ole uncle rasmus knows bettern dat he cried hes libed on dis yere plantation nigh to forty years an it would seem kinder strange ef he didnt know all de rabbit an de coon paths trou dis yere growth ef it wont tucker you chillun out to carry de blankets an de bundle an leabe em at de ole cottonwood ill get em twixt now an mornin ef so be youse feelin kinder trubbled bout de ole man come to see him wheneber you gets ready hes gwine ter be right dar in ole marys cabin sures youre bawn  it was a surprise to me that uncle rasmus should be able to find his way anywhere between the two rivers for i hardly remembered of seeing him stray from the bounds of the plantation but certain it was at least to my mind that he should go his gait for now had we come to put all our dependence upon him so far as making any move toward recovering the stolen horses was concerned  in fact it now began to seem to me so far as proving ourselves minute boys that unless we could get within the british entrenchments we could do naught of good for those men who i doubted not were slowly making their way toward the town of york to hold my lord cornwallis prisoner until the time should come when they might lay their hands heavily upon him  thus it was that uncle rasmus went off by himself going down past the line of grapevines across the creek as i supposed while we three struck out along the road until we had traveled perhaps a quarter of a mile when little frenchie suddenly halted and said as he turned upon us  why is it that all three shall travel twelve miles or more this day and repeat the same journey tomorrow forenoon  you know why it is saul cried angrily you claimed to understand all that uncle rasmus had in his crazy head  i did understand and it is because of seeing what we may do with his help i am asking why the three of us should go from here to york and back this night simply to retrace our steps tomorrow morning  what else may we do i asked impatiently  two might go on with the blankets and the bundle and arriving at the dead cottonwood remain there all night while the third staying behind now can set off from the plantation at break of day bringing with him such an amount of food as will explain why we wish to visit old marys cabin  then those who went on tonight would sleep on the ground whereas the one who remained here would take his rest in bed saul said grimly and with that shrug of the shoulders which sometimes irritated and sometimes pleased me pierre replied  yes that is true and if you have not yet slept on the ground you could be the one to stay here it makes no difference which two of us go on but it seems important that one remain here in order to bring fresh food in the morning thus making a pretext for entering the british lines  i was not so thickheaded but that i could understand what the lad was driving at and straightway said to saul  suppose you go back home make such excuses for pierre and me as seems to you best perhaps it would be as well if you confided our secret in mother for we must have some one on the plantation who will work with us else we shall not be able to get provisions in sufficient quantity to keep all of us from hunger  and suppose she demands that you return and i take her command to you  she cannot call us back before tomorrow night in case only one stays on the plantation now pierre said and by that time we will have been able to get a look around the townmayhap be so fortunate as to see some way by which we can work our will at all events it seems best that we do as i have said although i am willing to fall in with whatsoever other plan you lads may propose  turn you back saul it is not well we should stand here quibbling about a trifle when there is a possibility that such sneaks as horry sims may come along and wonder why we are carrying blankets toward the town of york at this hour of the day  i spoke impatiently because i was growing anxious and had begun to fear that some one might come who would suspect that we were plotting mischief against the redcoated trespassers  my cousin wheeled sharply around as if angry and under other circumstances i would have held him back lest we part in unfriendly fashion but at this moment there was so much of fear in my heart lest we be prevented from carrying out the halfformed plan that i could not parley with my kinsman as i should have done rather was it a relief to me when he turned about to retrace his steps and clutching little frenchie by the arm i said curtly  now step out lad and if so be we hear any one approaching either from the front or rear it is for us to seek cover amid the foliage even as rabbits do for we must not be seen twixt now and the time we make ready to enter the town bearing provisions for uncle rasmus  pierre did as he was bidden making no protest at my rough handling of him and from that time until we were come to the dead cottonwood neither of us spoke i fancy that his heart like mine was filled with forebodings of the future and with questions as to whether he was not on a road which would lead to the gallows  it was not yet dark when we arrived at our destination without having seen man or woman on the road all of which caused me yet more anxiety for i failed to understand why it was that on this day when the curious people of virginia should have been going to and fro to see the kings soldiers none save ourselves were abroad  pierre and i sought the same resting place as had saul and i earlier in the day the little french lad spread out the blankets as if making ready to spend the night and i asked if he did not count on seeing uncle rasmus very soon whereupon he said with a laugh and a shrug that it made no difference to him when the old negro arrived at the rendezvous although it would please him better did the old man come later rather than earlier but he was intending to get what rest he could while he had at his command such an apology for a bed  we neednt expect him before midnight at the soonest pierre said as he nestled down on the blankets motioning for me to follow his example and twixt now and then we may get a fairly good nights rest if we do not spend too much time in talking  we were where it would be impossible for any passersby on the highway to see us unless peradventure they were so curiously inclined as to make their way through the underbrush which was thick at this point and i understood as little frenchie had intimated that it was better for us to hold our peace because the sound of our voices would carry far on the night air and no one could say when such as horry sims might come sneaking around  excited and anxious though i was slumber came to my eyelids within a very few moments after i had stretched myself out to rest and i was all unconscious of what might be happening around me until a light pressure on my shoulder caused me to spring to a sitting posture very suddenly  then it was i could distinguish even in the gloom of the night uncle rasmuss form and i cried out to know how long he had been there whereupon the old negro put his hand upon my lips in token that i should speak with more of caution whispering at the same time he aroused pierre  i des come up honey an cant ford to lose any mo time yere po ole uncle des hobbles roun like er toad an it takes him a mighty long while to get ober much ob de groun ise powful sorry to sturb you chillun but allow its time for me to be toddlin erlong ef i counts on gettin whar de britishers are before sunrise ill be needin dese yere blankets and it sure am a pity to turn two likely babies out in de cold  dont fret yourself about us uncle rasmus i said quickly leaping to my feet followed by pierre  then we two lads rolled the blankets into as small a compass as possible putting inside them the package of food and fastening the whole upon the old mans shoulders according to his directions in such a manner that it would not impede him in his movements  ise surely gwine to spect you chillun fore anudder nightfall the old man said after we had explained to him why saul was not with us i clean forgot to tell ole missey dat i was bleeged to go erway an am countin on your doin it honey he added turning to me  before i could make reply the old man was striding off in the direction of the village walking as spritely so it seemed to me as i myself might have done  be careful uncle dont run your woolly pate into danger when theres no necessity for it i cried after him and back to me on the night air came the quavering voice  de ole fox allers looks arter hisself when de houns are roun but its de cubs what are mos likely fo to get inter trubble  then little frenchie and i were alone standing within the shelter of the foliage at the foot of the dead cottonwood and placing my hands on his shoulders for just then i literally ached to come into close touch with a friend i said striving to hold my voice steady  it may be pierre that saul and i had no right to drag you into this mad scheme of ours for even since uncle rasmus has set off does it come to me that it is reckless for us to risk our lives in the hope of getting back the horses i have little faith that we shall be able to accomplish anything as minute boys therefore we must set it down in all honesty to ourselves that we are pressing forward simply to recover that which has been stolen and we have no right to lead you into danger  do not think i am boasting fitz hamilton and pierre shrugged his shoulders in a way that caused me to laugh despite the heaviness of my heart but yet there comes in upon me the thought that mayhap it is i the french lad from new orleans who is dragging you and saul rather than that you are dragging him     chapter iv  the town of york   i had not counted that it would be possible for us to indulge in slumber after uncle rasmus had carried off the blankets but yet before he was well on his way toward the village both of us were wrapped in sleep as profound as even when our bed was softer  neither the thought of poor silver heels in the hands of a brutal british officer nor the possibility that we might come to grief when on the morrow we ventured into the town of york prevented me from gaining all the rest a lad needs as may be judged by the fact that not until the sun was an hour high in the heavens and saul was shaking me into consciousness did i have knowledge of my surroundings  then it was with a feeling of shame that i started to my feet none the worse for having been stretched out so long on the bare ground but deep down in my heart was a painful sense of having shown myself a child by thus indulging in repose when others stood ready to aid in the task which should have been all my own  have you lads given over going into the village this morning that you sleep so late and so soundly saul asked with a note of scorn in his tones and i replied quickly as if making apology for having been such a laggard  even though we had risen as early as did you it would not have been wise for us to go forward yet i am free to admit that it might have been more seemly had we opened our eyes before sunrise  it is to my mind that we were wise to get all the sleep possible little frenchie said with a shrug of the shoulders a good soldier should be able to sleep anywhere and at any time and it is his duty to take advantage of every opportunity to rest in order that he may be the better able to undergo fatigue when it becomes necessary  but you are not a soldier saul said sharply as if offended by the words but pierre nothing daunted replied cheerily  yet am i in a fair way to be one having enrolled myself as a minute boy i am much the same as an apprentice according to my way of thinking and being so should copy after my elders  meaning that you ought to sleep like a laggard until the sun is high in the heavens saul cried and i growing irritated because he persisted in harping upon our indolence said speaking quite as sharply as had he  we have done no harm by being laggards i would like for you to explain how we might have been advantaged by awakening at daybreak and sitting here waiting for you to come it seems to me just as well that we should sleep as sit around twiddling our thumbs  i was astir a full hour before daybreak attending to the work set me else i would not be here thus early ready to make the venture as agreed upon  one might have fancied saul was eager to be praised for his early rising and i might have said something calculated to irritate him but that pierre cried with a laugh  so you were my brave minute boy but remember that most like you crawled into bed a good two hours before fitz and i did and it is also reasonable to suppose you were not awakened at midnight to give up your blankets  this remark seemed to anger saul instead of soothing him and fearing we might have then and there a wordy battle between the excitable little french boy and my quick tempered cousin i broke in by saying  look you here lads there is no reason why you should squabble as to who turned out of bed first this morning that is over and done with and it strikes me we had best look forward rather than backward did you speak with my mother saul  ay that i did  and was she opposed to our going into york  i would not be willing to say quite as much as that but certain it is her heart was troubled sorely when i told her what we counted on doing i believe of a verity if uncle rasmus had not already left the plantation she would have set her face against it as it is knowing that now most like the old negro is housed up in the cabin unless the britishers suspecting intended mischief have given the poor fellow lodgings in a guardhouse she realizes that we can do no less than continue as we have begun although her command is that we do not run our heads into danger unnecessarily she says it is foolish for us to venture our liberty and perhaps our lives in the effort to reclaim two horses when it is possible to buy others that would serve us equally well  we could never find a colt that would be as dear to me as is silver heels i interrupted hotly all the grief which had come upon me the evening previous returning to my heart and setting my pulse beating so loudly that it seemed as if the lads might hear the blood leaping through my veins  what did you bring in the way of provisions frenchie asked and his question reminded me that we had gone supperless to bed  enough to keep us all from hunger a full week i believe saul replied with an air of pride as if he alone should have the credit not only for bringing but for providing the supplies  then it was he opened the sack he carried and displayed an ample store of cold boiled ham cornbread fried hominy and fried ham saying as he did so  if so be we are allowed to remain with uncle rasmus some of us should be able to catch fish enough to add to this store until it will serve as a weeks rations  pierre and i at once set about making a hearty meal giving no heed to the possibility that we might come to short rations later and even sulky saul was not averse to joining us  before we had satisfied our hunger my cousin was in a more pleasant frame of mind and condescended to explain to us all that had been said and done on the plantation after we left as nearly as i could make out it seemed that my mother was willing we should go our own pace although as a matter of course she like any other woman was frightened at the idea of our venturing among enemies for surely with my father in the socalled rebel army we could count that these redcoated gentry would be anything but friendly to those who came from the hamilton plantation  it heartened me wonderfully if indeed i had needed heartening after remembering that poor little silver heels was awaiting my coming to know that mother had not really set her face against what we would do and i contented myself so far as was possible by saying that we would let nothing stand in the way of carrying out the scheme that was afoot unless having become convinced that we were venturing on too dangerous ground  when breakfast had been eaten and we had divided sauls burden into two parcels for the more convenient carrying came the question as to when we should make the attempt to gain speech with uncle rasmus in the old cabin  saul was for setting off at once although the sun was no more than two hours high while frenchie argued strongly that we should wait until the forenoon was half spent when there would likely be many visitors in the village and we would attract less attention than if we were the first comers  this last seemed to me the wisest course and despite sauls grumbling for he claimed that we were wilfully wasting time even going so far as to hint that we were afraid to really make the trial we remained within shelter of the foliage near by the dead cottonwood until i should say ten oclock in the forenoon  are you ready now saul cried impatiently after having tried half a dozen times in vain to force us forward will you make the venture now or shall we turn back to the plantation and say that our hearts failed us at the last moment  i looked at pierre who rose to his feet as if in answer to the question he saw in my eyes and straightway we set off toward the town of york little frenchie insisting that we walk leisurely as if having nothing of moment on our minds and arguing that if we pressed forward at a rapid pace we might come upon those who would suspect we had some other aim than that of feeding an old slave  i am free to confess that my heart beat much more rapidly than it should have done when we approached the guard stationed here and there at intervals along the entire line of entrenchments on which soldiers were working with pick and shovel  until that moment i had not questioned whether we might be allowed to enter the town but now it seemed certain that whoever accosted us could read our purpose on our faces and mentally nerved myself either for disappointment or for disaster  who shall do the talking saul asked when we were come near to a battery in which the guns were already mounted although the entrenchments on either side were far from being completed and i fancied the lad was eager to act as spokesman but i dared not trust him because of his quick temper therefore it was i said firmly believing i spoke the truth  pierre is the one of us three who can best perform the part if his tongue fails us then can we make certain saul that either you or i would have brought disaster the lad has a quicker wit knows far more about military encampments although he boasts not and can hold his temper in check  i have an idea that my cousin was not well pleased at being thus put under the command as you might say of little frenchie but there was no time for him to have made protest even though he was so disposed because we were come so near the outposts that all our conversation might have been heard by the redcoated soldier who paced to and fro with a bayonet on his musket looking as if ready to spit or strike any of us rebels who dared approach him  i believe none of us except little frenchie could have worked the trick he advanced within four or five paces of the sentinel touched his hat in regular military salute and asked if it might be possible for him to speak with the officer of the day  this puzzled me not a little for i had no idea whatsoever who the officer of the day might be or what his duties but it appeared that pierre knew what he was about for straightway the sentinel seeming to understand that this little lad was familiar with military usages called up the officer of the guard and without waiting to be questioned pierre addressed him stating courteously but without too many words that there was an old slave in the town whom we feared stood in need of food and care therefore had we come to hunt him up  when the officer asked where we counted on finding this slave i had wit enough to step forward quickly and make reply for pierre who had but little knowledge of the town of york and none whatsoever as to the location of old marys cabin could not have given answer  illustration he  touched his hat in regular military salute  the whole matter was far more simple than i had hoped for pierres story was so straight he was so exceeding courteous and apparently so ready to tell everything about himself and us that even the most suspicious person would have been disarmed and within five minutes after requesting permission we were allowed to pass the sentinel with no limit set as to the time we might remain in the lines  saul who i verily believed was disgruntled because little frenchie had been allowed to act the part of leader now took upon himself the command of our company by marching in advance for he knew as well as did i where old marys cabin was located  you may be certain we kept our ears and eyes wide open as we walked through the village toward the pigeon quarter and i was greatly disappointed because our way did not lead us past where the horses of simcoes rangers were stabled although certain it is it would have given me greatest pain to have seen silver heels roughly used  there were many visitors in york on this forenoon people from roundabout who had tory inclinations or who were ready to sell to the enemies of their country such of vegetables or farm produce as might bring them in a few shillings a number from gloucester who had been allowed to come across the river and i even saw two lads whom i knew lived on mobjack bay roaming around with mouths wide open in astonishment at this vast encampment wherein to their uneducated eyes were soldiers enough to overrun all our colonies  squads of britishers were marching here and there officers lounged through the narrow streets most like making their way to the entrenchments from every direction could be heard sounds telling of pick and shovel the shouts of teamsters as they hauled heavy guns into position the beating of drums the shrill cry of fifes and in fact all that bustle noise and confusion which i have since learned attends a military encampment  as a matter of course we did not dare linger here or there although very much was going on which it would have pleased me to observe but we took good care to continue without hesitation toward the pigeon quarter contenting ourselves with seeing what we might as we walked at a reasonably rapid pace  strange as it may seem i had given no thought as to whether uncle rasmus had succeeded in entering the village during the night but took it for granted that he must have done so until we were come within a stones throw of old marys cabin and then it was as if my heart stood still for there were many chances that the old negro might have been arrested while trying to pass the guard and we would find in the hovel a squad of redcoats waiting to make prisoners of those who presented themselves there  i had so worked up my fears as to feel certain the moment had arrived when we were come to grief that it was with difficulty i could check a cry of mingled relief and triumph on seeing uncle rasmuss black face at the window  i had never thought there was anything of beauty in the old negros features and as a matter of fact wrinkled and black as it was one might truly have said that at times it was almost repulsive yet as i saw him then it was as if i had never looked upon anything more beautiful  i ran hurriedly excitedly into the cabin throwing myself into the old fellows arms much as though welcoming him from the grave  fo de lawds sake honey whas gettin on to you so powful bad the old man cried in surprise for probably this was the first time in all my life when i had shown real affection for him hab de britishers bin cuttin up roun de plantation since i done lef  no everything was quiet there when saul set out this morning but oh uncle rasmus i had come to fancy you might have been taken prisoner and that we were all in danger of being arrested for conspiring against the king  ho ho the old negro laughed why honey you don spects uncle rasmus is gwine ter git his brack head inter trubble arter all dese yere years does yer  but we knew you were counting on slipping through the lines and if youd been caught in anything of the kind  did you eber try fo to ketch a possum honey when he kinder had a inklin you was arter him i lows uncle rasmus is gettin mighty ole but he ain so feeble yet but he kin hol his own agin dese yere redcoated sogers why bress yer soul honey i des walked right in like i was comin home an don low one o em knowed dat a wuffless ole nigger was anywhar nigh him  little frenchie had taken the precaution to close the door immediately after our entrance and while uncle rasmus and i were talking with no little show of excitement the lad moved here and there pulling a ragged curtain in front of one window or closing the shutter of another so that we might not attract attention from any passersby although this cabin of old marys was in what might well be called the outskirts of the village where was little danger many people would come our way  tell us how you got in here uncle rasmus i asked for after seeing the long line of sentinels which guarded the halfformed entrenchments it seemed to me little less than marvelous that one could have made his way through without being challenged  i des walked right trou honey course i wasn no ways tryin to tract tention but kinder waited for a chance when dere wasn too man sogers round it was easy chillun an id bin out ob dis yere house long ago huntin for silber heels ef it hadn been dat i was tryin to wait till you done come  then uncle rasmus insisted on knowing how my mother had received the news that we were bent on making a visit to york town  when saul had told him all that had been said and done on the plantation after his departure the old negro suggested that we lounge around the village following the example of the curious visitors lest some one note the fact that we were apparently taking council together and it would not seem reasonable we would willingly remain with an old negro shut up in such a wretched cabin when there was so much to be seen on the outside  in view of all that occurred before this day was come to a close it may be well that i describe the hovel which we called old marys cabin even though there was nothing in or around it worthy of particular notice under ordinary circumstances the fact that later it served us much as a citadel in the midst of our enemies who were in turn surrounded by their foes renders it necessary i go into detail concerning it for the better understanding of what happened later  an ordinary hut built of logs perhaps twenty feet square with a door made of puncheon planks by which i mean planks that have been hewn out of the log with an axe rather than cut by a saw and two windows in one of which four panes of glass were broken but both protected by shutters which swung from the outside the building consisted of one room on the floor where the occupants were supposed to eat sleep and live while above was a loft formed by the roof and approached through a scuttle situated directly opposite the door at the rear of the hovel  to gain access to this scuttle one was forced to climb a sort of ladder which had been formed by nailing strips of wood against the logs and as i learned before we were come to an end of using this cabin as a place of refuge it was by no means a simple task to ascend even for lads who were accustomed to swarming up trees or shinning the slender masts of our river craft  the loft was as i have said formed by the roof and its floor like the one below was made of puncheon planks yet not so closely laid together but that there were crevices through which ones foot might slip if he walked carelessly at either end small holes had been cut between the logs perhaps four or five inches square which served as windows although there was nothing to prevent the wind or the rain from entering  i judged that when old mary lived in the place these apertures were closed most like with boards or perhaps with cloth but now they stood naked and the wind coming in across the river found direct vent through the attic thus insuring good ventilation if not comfort  on the outside and at the rear was a chimney built of sticks and clay with a hole cut through the logs near the floor of the lower room where was a fireplace of stones laid up with mortar and the inside of this rude chimney was plentifully bedaubed with mud to the depth of two or three inches as a safeguard against fire  just outside the front door not more than ten feet away was a small well which had once been stoned up properly but was now fallen into such a state of decay that i questioned whether the water in it could be wholesome at the time this seemed of but little moment for it would not be a great task to bring from the river all the water one would need to drink and i failed to give heed to the fact that if we were ever to use this cabin as a place of refuge the hour might come when we would suffer from thirst  after uncle rasmus had taken care of the provisions we brought by stowing them in a poor apology for a cupboard near the side of the fireplace he insisted that we lads go out and look about the town claiming that the time might come when it would be much to our advantage to know where this regiment or that legion was quartered and insisting also that we must show ourselves as curious rather than hugging the hovel so closely  i was eager to make my way toward that part of the village where the horses of simcoes rangers were stabled hoping i might get a glimpse of poor little silver heels and therefore not averse to following the old negros advice  uncle rasmus announced that it was his intention to remain close within the building as if it was not possible for him to move around and this was necessary if we lads counted on making his helplessness an excuse for coming frequently to the town of york  it was as if saul had determined on this day to be as disagreeable as possible as i have already set down he reproached us with indolence when he first came up in the early morning and grumbled as we came toward the village because little frenchie insisted on walking leisurely lest suspicion might be aroused while we remained in old marys cabin with uncle rasmus he cried out loudly at our wasting time when we might accomplish something although the lad knew full well that much time must be spent and many plans made before we could hope even to set about our purpose  he was the first to leave the cabin when uncle rasmus insisted that we play the part of curious ones and pressed on ahead as if he would go his own way leaving us behind until pierre said to me in a whisper  it is not well that we separateat least not until we have made some agreement as to a rendezvous later  then it was that i quickened my pace to overtake saul who had just disappeared around the corner of that shop wherein a man named bemis who had lately come from baltimore displayed stuffs for dresses and gewgaws of all kinds intended to attract the attention of the women and girls  i was for going directly to where the rangers were quartered and therefore felt not a bit hurt that my cousin should start off by himself without giving heed to our wishes and finding it was impossible to overtake him at any ordinary pace i quickened to a run in consequence i turned the corner of the shop rapidly coming directly upon and almost overrunning a lad who had halted saul and was engaged with him in angry altercation  while one might have counted ten i was too nearly dazed with having come into violent contact with the fellow to fully realize the situation and then a cry of mingled surprise and dismay burst from my lips for i found myself clutching and being clutched by none other than horry sims  even then no great harm might have been done had it not been for sauls ill temper little frenchie seeing that we had thus inadvertently come upon the lad whom we knew to be an enemy to us as well as a traitor to his country would have treated the matter as a pleasing incident and began by saying with a friendly shrug of his shoulders and a wave of the hands that he was glad we had found a friend in the town because we were feeling like cats in a strange garret when saul interrupted him as he cried angrily  there is no reason pierre laurens why you should put on a false face you know full well after all that happened yesterday when this little villain sent the britishers to take fitzroys horse and mine that we are not pleased at seeing him and that we count on dealing out to him the punishment he deserves  i was well nigh paralyzed at thus hearing my cousin make public that which we had agreed should be held a secret it alarmed me more than i can well say for i had come to believe it was in the highest degree necessary if we would succeed in regaining possession of the horses to prevent this tory scoundrel from suspecting we knew of all his villainy and i held up my hand warningly whereat saul cried hoarsely being unable to keep the slightest check over his temper  it is not for you fitzroy hamilton to play a double part after what i saw on the road yester morning we know all this little scoundrel has done and have already agreed that he shall pay the penalty for his treachery  there was no longer opportunity to check my cousin the cat was out of the bag so to speak we had at the very moment when we were counting on beginning our work shown horry sims that we knew of his treachery and thereby made of him an open enemy one who would do all he might against us which promised to be no little for after having given information as to where the best horses in the vicinity could be found it was reasonable to suppose he stood on friendly terms with the kings officers  who says i told where the soldiers could find your horses horry asked with a pretense of ignorance and saul cried fiercely  no one says so all three of us lads saw you on the road when you halted the squad of rangers and pointed out the direction of the hamilton plantation after which they rode straight away there and took possession of the horses as you know full well  if you are so wise as to what happened yesterday why was it you treated me in friendly fashion last night horry screamed growing angry now that his surprise at being thus accused had passed away in a measure and no doubt feeling safe in his position because he was surrounded by those whom he believed would stand his friends and who were all powerful in that town of york  it was because we counted on using you to serve our own ends saul replied seizing horry sims by the coatcollar as if fancying the young tory was eager to make his escape it was a foolish scheme hatched by fitz and pierre but i will have none of it when a lad proves himself an enemy to me as you have since yesterday morning i count on standing up manfully accusing him of his crime instead of crawling around like a red indian hiding my own feelings with the hope of getting the advantage of him in some way  well now that you have stood up as you call it what do you count on doing horry asked with a sneer and saul shaking him vigorously replied threateningly  i count on flogging you until it is a question whether you can leave this town without assistance  it may not be safe to venture anything of the kind and horry looked around in the hope that some of the britishers might be near at hand of course when there are three to one i cannot expect to hold my ground but let me warn you of this saul ogden whatever you do to me while the odds are in your favor shall be paid back an hundred fold before you are outside these lines now i know why that little french sneak claimed that there was a short cut through the woods from the york road to the hamilton plantation you fellows were hiding somewhere nearabout and he counted on joining you without my knowledge  well is it necessary we shall explain to you what we do or where we are going saul shrieked anger now having so far gotten the better of him that he was hardly responsible for the words which came from his mouth  pierre and i looked at each other in dismay which amounted almost to fear we had but just succeeded in paving a way for ourselves to enter the town at will and through sauls hasty temper all the fat was in the fire  i could see no other course than to warn uncle rasmus as soon as might be possible then take to our heels trusting to the poor chance that we might gain the plantation without being laid by the heels and all through an unthinking lad who had agreed equally with us that we must not let horry sims know we were aware of his treachery  its a case of getting away from here as soon as may be i whispered to pierre while saul stood shaking horry sims and uttering threats which might have been heard fifty yards away my cousin must pay the penalty for thus losing his temper and destroying all our chances of regaining the horses for in order to save uncle rasmus as well as ourselves we must leave him here to fight his battles with the tory  i am not so certain that we should leave either of them little frenchie said thoughtfully and seemingly forgetting to shrug his shoulders it is true the fat is all in the fire so far as our playing friendly with horry sims is concerned but it seems to me possible that we can yet prevent that scoundrel from upsetting all our plans even though it may be a dangerous venture  of what are you talking i cried in amazement the mischief has already been done it is no longer possible for us to hold the lad in check because he will go straight away to such officers as he knows giving information that we are here once it is learned we claimed that uncle rasmus had been held in the cabin through his helplessness and we were come to aid him all our scheming will be made public and we called upon to pay the penalty whatever it may be  but horry sims has not yet laid information pierre whispered hurriedly if it be possible for you to call saul off and make him understand now on the instant before any come nearer that he must hold himself in check we meaning you and i may be able to deal with the tory by such methods that he can not do us one whit of harm until we are ready to give him the opportunity  i looked at the little french lad in amazement too much bewildered to be able to make reply for it seemed to me he was talking veriest folly and yet there was on his face an expression of determination in which i could see no token of fear or even uneasiness of mind     chapter v  our prisoner   even as i gazed at little frenchie in what was very like bewilderment i noted that the lad was looking here and there furtively as if to make certain there were no eavesdroppers near and on the instant the haze of perplexity was cleared from my mind allowing me to realize that the french lad had some plan on foot whereby the mischief wrought through saul might be counteracted  although the situation seemed to me so desperate and the possibility of extricating ourselves from the difficulties into which we had been suddenly thrown was so slight that i could see no ray of light yet had i come to have such great faith in pierre laurenss quick wit and coolheadedness that straightway much of the trouble was taken from my mind and i laid my hand on his shoulder as if to say i depended upon him to draw us out from this slough into which my cousins ill temper had plunged us  meanwhile saul was giving no heed to anything save the desire to flog horry sims for what he had done to our harm and pierre whispered to me sharply and quickly  is there no place near by where we can remain in hiding for a time  during an instant i failed to remember anything whatsoever concerning this shop of master bemiss although it was familiar to me owing to my having visited it a dozen times or more then i suddenly recalled to mind that just around the corner in the rear was an old shed sometimes used for the stabling of horses which had frequently been halffilled with rubbish of such sort as empty cases lumber or straw  this much i explained to pierre in the fewest words possible and a look of relief came over little frenchies face as he went directly up to saul laying one hand on my cousins shoulder and with the other clutching the tory sneak by the coatcollar  mayhap not more than thirty seconds had passed from the time my cousin announced his intention of paying off the score we held against horry sims until pierre said in a low sharp tone to saul and conveying much of reproof  you have forgotten that by giving way to anger you not only endanger yourself but fitz and me to say nothing of uncle rasmus now pull yourself up with a sharp turn check that ill temper of yours if you would keep yourself at libertymayhap if you would hold the breath of life in your body  as he spoke it seemed to me that horry sims had a dim understanding of what was about to come upon him for he lunged quickly here and there like some trapped animal and i fancied he was about to raise his voice in a cry for help when i sprang forward and clapped my hand over his mouth  what are you about now saul asked angrily what right have you to interfere when i count on dealing with this tory villain even as he deserves  i have every right and now pierre spoke in a sharper tone than i had ever before heard him use even though there be no other reason i shall protect myself and it would seem if you keep on at this pace saul ogden that fitz and i must consider you equal enemy with this tory we are undone from this moment and can count surely on being thrust into the guardhouse as malcontents and rebels unless you find strength of will enough in that hulking body of yours to behave in a decent fashion  illustration i sprang forward  nothing in the way of argument could have moved saul so quickly as did reproof from the little french lad who until this moment he had most like considered a child as compared with himself now however that the boy was talking in manly fashion and with sound doctrine my cousin gave way before him on the instant becoming as meek and docile as any lamb  what would you have me do i had no right to give rein to my temper and yet i swear to both of you that i could not have held it in check  this is no time for making excuses pierre said still speaking in a commanding tone the wonder of it is that we have had so many minutes allowed us and now it stands us in hand to get this fellow out of sight  out of sight where and saul was in as thick a cloud of bewilderment as i had been whereupon pushing horry sims forward with my hand still pressed over his mouth i said hurriedly  pierre would have us hide him in the shed i know not how that may advantage us but let me tell you saul ogden that little frenchie has got more sound sense in one side of that head of his than you and i in both ours put together now do as he has said and we will listen to him afterwards  i forced horry sims on from behind still gagging his mouth with my hand while pierre retaining a firm hold on the torys coatcollar dragged him along in the direction i indicated saul assisting as well as he could while in such a state of perplexity  it was little less than a miracle that we could have stood talking there by master bemiss shop and then made our way half around it without coming in contact with some of the redcoats even at this day as i sit here in safety writing down that which we did in the town of york it seems to me more than marvelous that we were not taken into custody before little frenchie had time to give words to his suddenly conceived plan  i set it down to the fact that all those soldiers of the king were busily engaged throwing up entrenchments for it was known that not many miles away lay general lafayette with his army and my lord cornwallis must have said to himself that general washington finding he had so many of his majestys troops in much the same as a trap would push down from the north all the men he could spare therefore it came about that every officer was urging the men under his command to the greatest activity and fortunately this shop of master bemiss was at a considerable distance from any part of the british works which explains at least to myself why we were not lodged as prisoners in the british garrison  i believe that from the first moment pierre began to speak in a tone of command horry sims understood he was in danger not of a mere flogging but of something he could not explain to himself therefore was his fright all the greater  when little frenchie while we were circling around the building threatened vengeance even to the shedding of blood if he made any outcry the lad was so terrified that even though he had had fair opportunity i question whether he could have raised his voice sufficiently loud to have been heard a dozen paces away  he was as limp as any rag in my grasp as we forced him along and for an instant i feared the cowardly cur would fall helpless from sheer terror of that which he knew not the nature  within the time it would take a tonguetied man to count ten we had hustled horry sims from the southerly corner of master bemiss shop around to the rear where was the shed of which i had told little frenchie and again did fortune favor us for no horses were stabled there and the rude structure was so nearly filled with rubbish of all kinds that it would have been impossible to have sheltered even a mule beneath the crazy roof  we entered with our prisoner pierre leading the way grasping horry by the coatcollar while i brought up the rear with my arm around the torys neck so that i might keep a hand clapped over his mouth  shut the door and if it be possible bar it so that no one may come without giving due warning little frenchie said to saul and my cousin obeyed as meekly as a well whipped cur obeys his master  there was a crazy affair made of puncheon planks which had served as door but it hung loosely on its hinges and i question whether it had been used for many a year but saul was by this time so intent on doing whatsoever he might to repair the mischief wrought while his temper had the best of him that it was as if he had the strength of two men  while pierre was looking about him trying to plan something in his mind my cousin had the barrier closed and fastened with four or five short lengths of logs it was not done so securely but that one from the outside might force an entrance yet it would require a minute or two to effect such purpose and this was what i fancy little frenchie counted on when he gave the command  over yonder he said pointing toward the end of the shed where were several casks and some old boxes is the place to which we must take him  how long do you count on keeping him there i could not refrain from asking and pierre replied promptly thus showing that he had a plan thoroughly mapped out in his mind  only until night when we must get him to old marys cabin where he can be held prisoner  i was astounded to use a mild term by the idea that we were to hold this tory a prisoner for any length of time here we were shut up within the british lines in danger at any moment of being haled before some high mightiness of an officer to answer to the charge of being rebels or of being in the town with evil intent and we took it upon ourselves to capture a lad who stood to a certain degree in the favor of our enemies  it was to my mind at that instant and is even now as reckless a bit of business as can well be conceived why we did not take to our heels at the first moment when saul gave way to his anger leaving uncle rasmus to his fate and shake the dust of the town of york from our feet i cannot understand yet i am wrong in saying this last for it was pierre laurens who held us where we belonged and who proved that if there were minute boys in york town he stood above them head and shoulders as their commander  but for pierres quick wit and decision we had at that moment been racing through the village intent only on passing the british lines yet i said then while we pulled horry sims across the rubbish that perhaps it would have been greatly to our advantage if we had fled the town even though the hue and cry was raised on the instant rather than remain where it might be impossible for us to go out again save in the custody of a squad of redcoated soldiers  by the time saul barricaded the door horry sims had been taken to the rear of the building and there little frenchie turned two huge casks down on their side with the mouths facing each other leaving sufficient space between them for a lad to crawl in saying to the prisoner when this work was done  creep in there lad and hold your peace if you raise your voice above a whisper i swear that it shall be the last moment of your life you can well fancy we would not flinch at killing such as you when it might be to save ourselves to hold you secretly and yet securely is our hope therefore bear well in mind to what lengths we are bound to go rather than allow you to give us the slip  the tory crawled head foremost into one of the casks which was so large that he could readily turn around in it and in the gloom of the shed i could see that his face was as white as my mothers table linen he shook like one in an ague fit as well he might for the threats pierre made carried with them such a ring of truth that he would have been dull indeed had he failed to understand how far we would go in order to save our own skins  pierre followed him into this snug hiding place and i stood helplessly by awaiting some word from little frenchie ready to obey whatever commands he might give while saul shamefaced because of his indiscretion came up to my side  it is like this pierre said as if he had asked a question so long as we can hold this tory sneak secretly so long are we at liberty to remain in york town to compass the business which brought us here but on the instant he gives us the slip we may count on coming before a military court charged with being rebels if not with being spies  how long do you think he can remain in this shed without being discovered saul asked stupidly and then it was that pierre explained his plan so far as he had formed it  one of us and you should be that one inasmuch as it was through you that all this trouble came about he said looking at saul must remain here until midnight or thereabouts on the alert all the while lest he give an alarm while fitz and i move about the village as we were intending when we left old marys cabin when night has come and if we find it possible this tory must be carried across the town and stowed safely in that loft above the room in which uncle rasmus is living there one or the other of us must act as jailor all the while untili cannot guess when our duties may be ended if perchance the american forces give lord cornwallis battle and are victorious then may we come out of the snarl with whole skins but if so be the british are the conquerors we can look to have the tables turned on us when horry sims will get all the revenge he may desire  a pretty pickle we were in because of what saul had done the most we could hope for would be to hold horry day after day in that loft of old marys cabin with but one show of getting out of the box which would be such a victory by the americans that they might take possession of the town of york  it was a slim chance though i doubted not that general lafayettes army if reinforced as it should be would whip the britishers but again and again the socalled rebels had been worsted by the kings soldiers and why might they not get a drubbing here it was well within the range of possibilities that the british army would be reinforced by vessels sent down from new york in which case we stood to suffer  even though the britishers allowed us to go here or there at will we were held as close prisoners because of having horry sims in custody as though they put us under a strong guard if at that moment when we stood by the casks in the shed speculating upon the situation i had known that the town of york was to be besieged and shelled by our people i would not have reckoned that my life was worth the turn of a hand  fortunate indeed was it for us that we could not look into the future fortunate we had no inkling of all that was to take place between the rivers of york and james within the next few days else had our courage failed us entirely as it was however i had great faith pierre would pull through his scheme successfully and trusted that the future would show us some way out of this snarl into which we had been so suddenly plunged  come in here and stretch yourself out beside this lad with your hand closing on his throat so that at the lightest sign of his counting on giving an alarm you can choke him to death pierre said to saul who was crouching that he might look into the cask and my cousin did meekly as he was bidden for by this time he had come fully to understand that he alone was responsible for all this trouble which had come upon us  not until saul was within the cask and had taken position close by the side of the prisoner did little frenchie venture to come out then halting and leaning over so his voice would carry to the prisoner and his jailor without being heard by any who might be in the vicinity of the shed he said still speaking in a tone of command which had i been less excited and anxious would have sounded comical from one so small  remember saul that your life mayhap and ours depends upon your holding that tory scoundrel safe fitz and i will learn what we may toward aiding us in getting him to the cabin  how long am i to stay here saul asked and i fancied that he was growing sulky again whereupon i said soothingly laying my hand on his leg in friendly fashion  do not let your temper get the best of you again saul else are we all undone past mending we have fallen into a hobble and each must do his best to come out alive  i am ready to do what i may and understand without its being roughed into me that i am the one who is responsible for it all but yet i ask how long am i to stay here  until we come again little frenchie said decidedly there is no probability we shall dare risk a visit here twixt now and the time when we have made ready to carry him to old marys cabin therefore you can count that your duties as jailor will hold you inside that cask until midnight  i would have added somewhat to that which pierre had said counting thereby to soothe my cousin but little frenchie dragged me back motioning with his finger on his lips that i hold my peace i understood that again was the lad right for if we did what we might toward coaxing saul into a better humor we were possibly giving him an opportunity to fly off in a rage again and that would have been fatal to all the faint hopes in which we then indulged  pierre clambered softly down across the rubbish motioning for me to follow his example and then set about pulling away from the ramshackle door the short lengths of logs which barred it but he was careful to remove only sufficient of the barrier for us to creep out  when we were in the open air with the shed so nearly closed that no one unless having special business there would be likely to enter he said to me in a whisper as he led the way up into the village once more  now we will set about our work and before saul sees us again he will have had plenty of time in which to repent having given way to his temper  our work i repeated dully isnt it enough that we must hold horry sims prisoner without thinking of aught else  we came here to find sauls mare and your silver heels and even though it be necessary to stand guard over the tory i am counting that we shall continue the work even as was at first proposed  it is to my mind that we have enough on our hands without taking more i said and mayhap there was in my voice that same sulky tone which i had heard in sauls a few seconds before  surely one of us is enough to hold that tory quiet unless the britishers get an inkling that we have him in our hands and besides uncle rasmus should be able to help us in no small degree do you remember that we counted to call ourselves minute boys and to do the work of minute boys  ay that is what we reckoned on when we were footfreewhen we had not fettered ourselves with a tory prisoner but now it is all impossible  why impossible and for the first time since we had come upon horry sims did pierre indulge in that indescribable shrug and wave of the hands which was peculiar to him it would seem to me that now is the time if ever when we can do somewhat for the causewhen we can prove that although our company of minute boys numbers but three we are of importance and may make our names known to those who are staking their lives for the liberty of this country  i looked at the little lad in amazement the idea that we three boys who were in as bad a hobble as lads ever could bewe three who stood one might almost say face to face with death should think of aught else was to me most astonishing and yet this small fellow from new orleans was all afire with great plans  surely if our company of minute boys ever did anything in behalf of the cause it would be wholly due to him for i had come to consider half an hour since that his was the only brain among us  my countryman with an army of americans is near at hand holding this english lord here as if he was in a prison and do you not believe that it may be possible for us to carry to general lafayette such information concerning what is being done here in this town of york as would be of importance pierre asked his eyes flashing and his cheeks flushing  ay if so be we were free to act we might one or another of us creep out through the lines and get speech with our people but hampered as we are how will it be possible we are prisoners here ourselves holding a prisoner  look upon it in that way if you please and again pierre shrugged his shoulders i count on having one try for the horses and failing that of having speech with general lafayette himself after we have been through this town of york and set down in our minds all the work on which the britishers are now engaged  i hope most sincerely you may succeed lad but yet i doubt it sorely in the meanwhile what about uncle rasmus  we will go to his cabin now explain what has happened and then lounge around the stable quarters of the rangers where you shall have a glimpse of your beloved silver heels  i believe the lad reminded me of the horse i loved so well with the purpose of holding my courage straight and he could have used no other bait that would have lured me so quickly from out the slough of despond into which i had fallen  there was no hope in my heart however sanguine he appeared that i could regain possession of my horse the most i dared look forward to was that events might so shape themselves as to make it possible for us to escape from this town into which we had voluntarily come and yet i was such a simple that i failed of understanding it was pierre laurens who would get us out of the hobble if indeed we ever did get out but i followed him meekly as he led the way toward the pigeon quarter  uncle rasmus was seated by the window we could see his wrinkled black face through the dirty glass and surely he had every appearance of being near to death as he sat there huddled up in a little ball so to speak wrapped in his blanket although the day was unusually warm  are you really sick uncle i asked hurrying into the hovel with the fear that i should find there additional trouble  ise mighty bad honey mighty bad the old man replied with an odd twinkle in his eyes i spects ise bleeged ter stay right here wid neber a chance ob gettin back to de ole plantation kase ise got de misery in my back my head an my legs till ise des de same as a wuffless ole cripple  thats right uncle rasmus pierre said cheerily you are a promising looking old invalid and i guarantee that if any of these redcoated gentry have a suspicion you may be playing a part one glimpse of that face of yours will convince them you are nigh to death  ise bin reckonin on des dat same ting an while de ole nigger am so poly dese yere genmen whos in de army carn grudge my seein you chillun now an den  you are likely to see a good deal of us uncle rasmus i said grimly now understanding that the old negro was simply playing his part as had been agreed upon we had the ill luck to come across horry sims saul lost his temper and let the fellow know we were acquainted with what he had been about  lan ob massy chillun lan ob massy hab you bin rubbin up agin dat tory sneak  its worse than that uncle rasmus pierre said with a smile in order to save our own skins we have been forced to make him a prisoner and can stay in york town only so long as it is possible to keep him out of sight we count on bringing him here if theres a living show for it twixt now and midnight  chilluns chilluns i low to goodness youse done gone crazy whars saul whas become ob de chile  i explained to uncle rasmus where my cousin was and what he was doing after which pierre gave him a brief outline of his plans and when both of us had come to an end of our speech there was no need for the old man to exert himself very strenuously in order to play the part of invalid  his wrinkled face went ashy pale as the facts of the situation were borne in upon him and he sank back in the chair with both hands uplifted as if in supplication  you chilluns hab done gone crazy gone crazy he repeated again and again and i stood helplessly by not knowing what to do but little frenchie set about soothing the old mans fears by explaining how it might be possible for us to do this or do that and declaring we could keep horry a prisoner in the loft so long as one of us stood close by to insure his silence until uncle rasmus recovered a goodly measure of his former serenity  i clar for it chillun it beats de snakes how much trubble youse got us all into but i reckon wese boun to hol our backs stiff agin it else dese yere britishers am gwine ter make mighty short work ob us  thats just it uncle rasmus thats just it pierre cried cheerily weve got into the muss and it stands us in hand to hold our own so long as we can were no worse off if horry sims gives us the slip after weve brought him here than we would have been had we allowed him to go free after saul was so foolish as to let the fellow understand we knew of all his knavery now its a case of keeping our backs stiff trying to get possession of the horses and doing all we can toward carrying to the americans news of whats being done in this town  sure honey you ain countin on doin nuffin cept holdin horry sims quiet and again uncle rasmus showed signs of terror  now look here uncle and pierre knelt by his side looking up into the wrinkled black face with a cheery smile as if there was nothing in all this wide world to trouble him we are not going to waste our time on one torythat is to say all of us are not for one must remain on guard after what has happened saul should do more than his fair share of playing the jailor now you wouldnt have fitz and me loafing around this town doing nothing would you  sure enuf honey sure enuf  you believe if we could carry any word of importance to the americans we should do it dont you uncle  sure enuf honey sure enuf  and if matters should turn such as we cant really hope for that there was a possibility of getting hold of the horses would you have us do it  sure enuf honey sure enuf  in such manner did this little french lad talk with the old negro until he revived all his courage and before having come to an end uncle rasmus was as eager as pierre to be up and doing meanwhile as seemingly careless of what the future might bring us as was that little lad on whom all my hopes for the future so far as the britishers were concerned depended  having thus restored uncle rasmus to hopefulness and courage pierre announced as if there could be no question of any protest from me that we would make our way to where the rangers were quartered and i obeyed him much as a child might have done mentally clinging to the lad as if he had been my elder  we two walked around the village as if having no other purpose than to view a military encampment we gaped here or stood there in openmouthed astonishment as if mightily impressed with everything we saw and while doing so pierre would whisper now and then as we passed this redoubt or that battery  have you got everything well in mind now lad seven redoubts and six batteries on the land side a line of batteries on the river bank the grand battery near the church three redoubts just at the ravine one near the road to hampton and two by the river  thus it was he called my attention to each point where the britishers were working although in some cases it would have been impossible for me to have said whether they were building redoubts throwing up earthworks for a battery or simply digging a canal it appeared that little frenchie understood all their purpose and i said to myself that if so be he could make his way from out this town of york into the american lines of a verity he would be able to give general lafayette such information as would be of exceeding value  we saw silver heels she was made fast to the stable line with a lot of other horses and so far as i could see was receiving even more attention than if she had been at home on the plantation for there were a dozen men or more working all the time currying this horse rubbing that one down bandaging a leg that showed signs of swelling and in many ways taking as good care of the steeds as the best jockeys in virginia could have done  you see she hasnt fallen into such bad hands pierre said as we passed for the third time where i could have a good view of my pet and i replied sorrowfully  it isnt that she wont be taken care of pierre for he into whose hands she might fall would indeed be a fool if he neglected so valuable a bit of horseflesh but it is the thought that she will be taken into battle wounded and left on the field to die that breaks my heart  and yet many a poor fellow will be wounded on the field of battle and left there to die mayhap it will be the fate of you or of me and since silver heels has been reared by a rebel she must take the same chances that all us rebels in this country are forced to take if the yoke of the kings oppression is to be removed from our necks  little frenchie spoke like a preacher and i dimly wondered whether his courage might not be failing him now that we were fully committed to as desperate a venture as ever lads embarked on but i need have had no forebodings for after remaining silent a dozen seconds or more he seemingly shook off somber thoughts and said cheerily  the less you and i think of the future and the closer we keep to the present the better now let us make our way along the outer works in order to decide where we may have the best show of getting through the lines if so be we decide to play the part of spies  what about making ready to bring horry sims into the cabin  theres plenty of time for that twixt now and sunset pierre said carelessly we need spend little time in forming plans because it must all be done by accident or what is the same thing through chance and the negligence of the enemy well get a good idea of the general situation and then go back to uncle rasmus for something to eat  as pierre had said so we did twice we traversed the entire length of the outer works meaning the entrenchments facing the north noted where each sentinel was posted and otherwise gained all the information possible that might be of advantage to one who was trying to escape from the british  then we went back to old marys cabin where uncle rasmus despite his seeming feebleness had made ready for us a most appetizing meal by warming the cornbread and toasting some of the boiled ham in a fryingpan  although the outlook was most dismal to me it did not affect my appetite on this day and i ate as heartily and with as great satisfaction as i ever ate a meal at the hamilton plantation     chapter vi  a disagreeable surprise   while we ate with so much of pleasure i could not but let my thoughts go out to saul who was doubtless as hungry as we had been and gave words to my regret that we had not first carried the lad some of the food which we had in such generous abundance but to my repinings of this kind little frenchie put a stop by saying  i have no desire that your cousin shall be in distress because of hunger and yet it is in my mind that he should have somewhat more of punishment because of having given way to ill temper and put us in such a plight than simply standing guard over horry sims he will be the more careful in the future if he suffers considerably because of what has been done  i was far from desiring that saul should be punished the mischief had been wrought and however bitterly he repented it would not right matters i believed for the time that pierre was overly harsh and would have insisted on going straight to the lad with food but that i realized how dangerous it might be if we visited the shed in the rear of master bemiss shop more often than was absolutely necessary  again i consoled myself with the belief that most like saul had partaken of a hearty breakfast that morning before leaving the plantation whereas we lads had satisfied our hunger with cold food and thus arguing with myself desiring to be convinced i came to the conclusion that since it was not possible to mend matters save at the expense of much risk it was well i should get such enjoyment as was possible out of the present moment  not until we had finished the meal did uncle rasmus have anything of importance to say and then he surprised me beyond the power of expression by proving that he was not counting on being a mere figurehead in this wild plan to regain possession of sauls mare and silver heels  ise done bin tol chillun dat deres six or seben big french ships layin in lynn haven bay whar deyve come to stop de britishers from runnin away fore ginral washington gets a chance to trounce em right smart  youve been told that uncle rasmus i cried in amazement have you been toddling around this town after pretending that you were so crippled with aches and pains that you couldnt move out of your chair  sure i hasn honey sure i hasn yer uncle rasmus ain no sich fool as dat but de still trout wha lays under de shadder ob de rock catches a good many more flies what drif down de stream dan does de fish what am leapin an plungin to beat de band say wha you tink when i done tole you ginral lafayette wid all his army is layin at williamsburg des waitin fo a chance to jump down on de back ob ginral cornwallis  pierre and i looked at each other questioningly as if asking whether the old negro had suddenly taken leave of his senses for it seemed impossible he could have gathered information which was of the greatest importance to us while we who had been moving around through the encampment had failed to hear anything of the kind  have you been dreaming uncle rasmus little frenchie asked with a smile surely you couldnt have picked up all that news while being denned in here  i did fo a fac honey an sposen yer uncle rasmus kin tell you dat ginral washington is a hustlin fo to get all his sogers down dis yere way sos to make de britishers don gib him de slip ise lowin chillun dat nows de time when de kings men hab done got dereselves in a mighty small box  if you didnt dream it how did you come to learn all these things i asked impatiently and the old negro replied as he pattered to and fro in front of the fire adding to the already plentiful supply of provisions before us  don you member marse peytons ole joe honey course you do kase youve seen him on de plantation more times dan ise got hairs on dis yere gray head well ole joe is right in dis yere town waddlin back an forth makin out as ef he was waitin on some ob de british ossifers marse peyton done sent him down here sos he could keep his ears open an hes come dis berry day from williamsburg where he sneaked off sos to tell ginral lafayette wha he done foun out  again pierre and i looked at each other in amazement and i must also add with no little of disappointment we had been flattering ourselves that it might be possible for us to play the spy upon the britishers and thereby earn much of credit for our small company of minute boys never for the moment dreaming that there might be others in the village who were playing the same part but surely not allowing that an old negro a slave might be employed in the same work  it begins to look as if we were not needed very much in this town of york pierre said after a brief time of silence and i could well understand by the tone of his voice how disappointed he was because thus suddenly had we been shown that the american army could well dispense with our services since others were engaged in the work we would have taken up  im not so certain pierre but that your skill at reading the meaning of military moments will yet prove of great value i exclaimed as a happy thought came into my mind it isnt possible old joe would be able to tell what the british are doing here with so much exactness as you who seem to be familiar with such work theres no good reason why we shouldnt continue to pick up all the information possible and if we find that we have gained more than has colonel peytons negro then one of us shall make his way to williamsburg after we have horry sims stowed snugly away in the loft  it appeared as we understood from uncle rasmuss story when he told it later that old joe had by accident seen him sitting at the cabin window and quite naturally come in when explanations followed  as both pierre and i came to realize instead of grieving over the fact that this slave of colonel peytons was playing the spy in the town of york we should have rejoiced for here was at least one person who might be able to aid us in a time of extremity  surely situated as we lads then were with a prisoner on our hands even the assistance of an old slave who was free to move about within the encampment as he pleased might be of great value  after we had turned the matter over and over in our minds discussing what seemed much like a new phase of the situation uncle rasmus advised that we did not venture out again until the time had come when we could relieve saul from his duties as jailor by bringing horry sims to the cabin  the old negro argued and with much of wisdom it seemed to me that having been through the encampment more than once seemingly bent on curiosity there was no good reason why we should do so again he contended that it would not be wise to show ourselves too often during one day and urged that we remain concealed until the time arrived when we were to perform our task of the night  following his advice we went into the loft and spreading down a blanket on the puncheon floor stretched ourselves out on the hard bed with the hope of gaining sleep we could have disposed ourselves more comfortably below but there was a possibility that some of the soldiers curious to know who was dwelling in this ramshackle of a building might enter to gratify their curiosity and it would not be well if they saw us living there with the old negro at least there was a chance harm might come of it and we were not inclined to take any such risk simply in order to enjoy a trifle more of comfort  hard though our bed was both us lads fell asleep shortly after we were in a position to invite slumber and without heed to the many dangers which surrounded us slept soundly and peacefully until being awakened by uncle rasmus who unable to ascend by the rude ladder was calling us by name softly from below  it was dark when i opened my eyes aroused by the old negros voice so dark that i could not even distinguish the outlines of my comrade and i understood that now was come the time for the venture of bringing horry sims to the cabin  pierre was already making his way toward the scuttle when i had come to a full realization of the situation and i followed him as nearly in silence as was possible until we had descended to where uncle rasmus stood awaiting us at the foot of the rude ladder  its pas midnight chillun an ise lowin dat de time hab come for you to snake dat young tory up here  is everything quiet uncle rasmus pierre asked and the old negro replied  i ain heard a soun dis las hour cept when dem sogers what am on guard raise up dere hootin to let folks know deyre awake its dark as de lan ob egypt eber was an ise kinder reckonin you kin go down to marse bemiss shop widout makin trubble for yoursefs member chillun ef dese yere redcoats do sneak up on yer an fin out what youse erbout take to your laigs don stop to fight kase it wont be any use des say to yoursefs dat de hamilton plantation am a heap better place dan dis yere town ob york an you get dere honey you get dere  what about yourself uncle rasmus i asked with deep concern suppose the britishers learn of our doings and we run away you would be in danger for surely horry sims neverd let the chance slip him to mix you up in the row  don you gib any heed to your uncle rasmus honey ef trubble comes you des look arter yoursefs an leabe de ole nigger to crawl out ob de hole de bes way he kin don stop to talk nor to fight ef de britishers pounce on yer but get back to de plantation git dere honey git dere  uncle rasmuss advice instead of strengthening my courage was weakening it in the darkness and now when we were about to make this venture which i knew to be in the highest degree dangerous i was growing weakkneed the attempt to bring horry sims across the entire length of the village where were britishers on every hand seemed an entirely different matter from what it had been when the sun was shining and fearing lest i might show the white feather if we stood there many moments i went out hurriedly into the night giving little heed as to whether pierre followed until i felt the soft pressure of his hand upon my arm  there is no need of great haste fitz he whispered and i replied in a tremulous voice  indeed there is pierre else am i like to grow so cowardly as to turn tail and make for the hamilton plantation regardless of anything save my own feelings  you will never do anything of the kind fitzroy hamilton and that you know as well as i the little lad whispered with emphasis i am not afraid you will turn coward for it is not cowardly to be afraid when one makes such a venture as this providing he keeps his face resolutely toward the goal  i might fill up an hundred pages with an account of my fears and forebodings as pierre and i went cautiously through the darkness from old marys cabin to bemiss shop and yet not have told anything which would interest a stranger therefore it is that i shall content myself by simply saying that we crossed the village without having been molested almost without having heard a sound from the enemy  as a matter of course it was necessary we pass at this point or that near by where soldiers were in camp or on duty but the darkness was so intense that by making a slight detour we could avoid being seen and judging from what few noises we heard the encampment was in a state of almost complete repose  arriving at the shed door we stood motionless and silent while one might have counted twenty our ears pricked up to catch the lightest sound which would tell of the approach of an enemy after which hearing nothing we set about making our way into the rude building and thence across the rubbish to where were the two casks which formed horry simss prison  this last was anything rather than a simple matter if we would move noiselessly for in the darkness it was impossible to make out what obstruction lay in our way and we were forced to pass our hands over every inch of the rubbish before daring to advance a single pace  not until we were come to the opening between the casks was a word spoken and then came an exclamation from saul  thank god you are come i was beginning to believe you had been made prisoners and i would be left to get out of here unaided which meant beyond a peradventure that i would speedily find myself in the clutches of the britishers  has horry attempted to raise any row i whispered  beyond speaking now and then to make threats as to what will surely come to us in the future he has behaved himself and saul stood erect stretching his limbs to throw off the cramp which had come upon him i have given him to understand thoroughly well how necessary it is we hold him prisoner and to what lengths we are ready to go therefore i believe he realizes that it would be taking his life in his hands if he made any attempt at giving us the slip  then saul would have asked concerning what we had been doing during the day and how we counted on making our way to the cabin but i silenced him promising that he should hear of all our movements when it should be possible for us to hold converse without danger of betraying ourselves  once more little frenchie took upon himself the command of the party by literally dragging horry out from the casks and saying to me when the lad was on his feet beside us  help me thrust this in his mouth for it is not safe to take him through the streets without being gagged  to my surprise i found that this little french lad had without acquainting me with his purpose made ready for the venture thus again proving his right to act as our captain  he had at some time while in old marys cabin made ready a gag of wood covered with strips torn from a blanket and this much against horry simss will we thrust into the fellows mouth tying it securely but promising that if he followed at his best pace and without making an attempt to get away he should soon be relieved from what must have been in the highest degree painful  then we began again to make our way over the rubbish this time with greater noise than when pierre and i had entered because we could not direct the young torys footsteps as cautiously as our own and more than once before we had come to the door did we dislodge a bit of timber or a fragment of wood causing such a disturbance as must have been heard by any who might have been within an hundred paces of the shed  at each time such a thing occurred we halted silent and motionless striving to learn whether any of the enemy had been aroused by the noise and hearing nothing that betokened danger kept on until another misstep forced us to a halt once more thus we continued traversing a distance of no more than fifteen or eighteen feet but which seemed to me a full mile until we were come to the door and had crept out into the darkness when i breathed a fervent prayer of thanksgiving for surely it seemed as if we had already overcome the greater portion of the difficulties that lay in our way  saul and pierre were leading the tory cur one on either side of him and i set off in advance as if believing i was the only lad of the three who could pilot us in safety  illustration without the slightest warning i found myself in the clutches of a man  because we had succeeded in getting out of the shed without making sufficient of noise to bring the guard down upon us did i fancy we were much the same as free to do as we pleased and set off at a reasonably rapid pace around the corner of the shop when suddenly and without the slightest warning i found myself in the clutches of a man my throat held so tightly in his grasp that i could not give the faintest alarm to my comrades  that a british sentinel who had dogged our footsteps held me prisoner i had no doubt and my heart sank like lead in my breast for to my mind now was come the end of all things for me in this world because of having been taken while prowling around the village in the night there could be no question but that i would be considered and punished as a spy  i strove in vain to give some warning to my comrades so they might make their escape even though i was doomed but he who held me seemingly understood that which was in my mind for he forced me onward lest pierre and saul should overrun us and thus for mayhap a distance of an hundred yards we advanced i a prisoner forced to lead my comrades into what i felt certain was a shameful death  because the night was so black they could not see that there were two persons in advance of them instead of one therefore did they follow blindly and all unconscious of the sickly deathly terror in my heart until we were come to the rise of the land on our way toward the pigeon quarter where the outlines of him who held me and my own body were marked against the lighter sky  then i heard a muffled exclamation from pierre whereupon my captor suddenly wheeled me about until we were facing the two lads and their prisoner when he whispered softly yet sharply  continue on as you were going and as you value your lives make no outcry or delay  having thus spoken one can well fancy that i was nigh to being paralyzed with mingled astonishment and bewilderment because the tone was friendly and the words indicated that he would aid us he released his grasp on my throat and involuntarily i stretched out my hands when they came in contact with my captor and by the sense of touch i understood that he wore a uniform  you are a british soldier i stammered terror once more taking firm hold upon me  ay that i am for the time being but now move on if you would continue that which you have begun else are you like to fall into the hands of other soldiers in this encampment who will have less care for your safety  i wish it might be possible for me to set down in words so that he who reads could understand the frame of mind into which i was plunged by this remark when he first seized me i had no doubt but that i had begun my journey on the road which leads to the gallows and on learning that he was a british soldier my fears were not lessened yet was his behavior and his words so unaccountable taking into consideration who he appeared to be that i became numbed like one who has received a blow which deprives him of a portion of his senses  how my comrades were affected i had no means of knowing but understood that they were obeying the commands of this man who had captured us because they continued on close at my heels and from the strangers movements now and then i knew he was making certain they did not attempt to deviate from the straight course which led to old marys cabin  never did a journey seem so long or a way so strange as that over which i walked like one in a dream in the darkness surrounded on every hand by the enemy and knowing as i did that the kings officers set little value on the life of those whom they call rebels  as we advanced the situation became yet more strange and terrifying if indeed that could be possible for suddenly i came to understand that this stranger who had taken us in custody seemed familiar with the course we should pursue for instead of lagging ever so slightly to learn in which direction we would go he led us straight as an arrow might be driven toward our destination and having come to the cabin door pushed it open and himself entered leaving us to follow or to flee as might be our inclination  i am free to confess that when he thus left me at liberty there was but one thought in my mind and that to seek my own safety in flight regardless of my comrades or of the old negro whose life might be in danger if i thus deserted him i was cowardly enough for an instant to think only of myself to look forward only to the possibility of saving my own skin but fortunately even before i could have turned to flee like a poltroon i realized that it was my duty as a lad of virginia even though i had seemingly thrown aside the name of minute boy to remain with my comrades whom i had thus counselled into peril  even at that supreme moment when as i believed death stood facing me there came into my heart a feeling of shame that i should have even thought of doing such a dastardly thing as to seek my own safety by deserting my comrades and i went into the cabin following the footsteps of our captor hoping that no one not even that redcoated soldier might suspect what had been in my mind a few seconds before  pierre and saul must have understood that they could do no less than enter this place of shelter for it was the only one open to them in the town of york even though we were led by an enemy and so thrust horry sims forward on my heels until uncle rasmus closed the door behind us  i stood there enveloped in a darkness so dense that one might as is said almost feel it wondering what strange turn of affairs had come and why it was that this british soldier should be so harmlesswhy he should have allowed us to come into the cabin when most like he counted on taking us to the nearest guardhouse  we remained there in silence and so far as i was concerned in most abject terror while one might have counted ten and then the stranger throwing himself down on the floor at one side of the fireplace in which a few halfdead coals yet glimmered faintly as if he was a welcome visitor said in a low whisper yet in a tone which carried distinctly through the room  you lads are from the hamilton plantation  no one made reply i was yet too much confused to have answered such a simple question and as pierre afterward told me he refrained from speaking because of not understanding whether it would be safe to admit the truth  you need have no fear in speaking plainly before me the man continued i am wearing a british uniform and mayhap am putting my life in jeopardy and doing a grievous injury to the cause by interfering in this matter while you have a prisoner who may be able later to carry to headquarters information of what you have done this night i beg you to trust me for the time being and tell me who is this lad that you have brought from yonder hiding place gagged lest he make an outcry  i was yet too thoroughly bewildered to make an intelligent reply but fortunately little frenchie had begun to get his wits together and most like to suspect at least a portion of the truth for he answered promptly not only giving the young torys name but explaining why we thus held him  to my alarm he went so far as to tell the whole story even though more than once i clutched him by the arm to prevent his laying bare all our secrets but he threw me off with friendly violence and continued until the redcoated man who lay by the fireplace had full knowledge not only of what we had done but of what we would do  then pierre was come to an end of his story and so seemingly eager was he to give all the details to this stranger who by his costume was an enemy and by the tones of his voice a friend that he spent no little time in the telling of it while i was nearly beside myself with grief and rage because we had thus put ourselves wholly within the mans power  it would have been better so i said to myself with bitterness if we held our peace in case he charged us with being spies as i counted he intended to do let him prove what we were rather than that we should give him all the evidence making his way plain if he would hang us and i cried out to pierre my voice trembling with anger  now that you have doomed us lad tell me in what better position you stand than if we had held our peace of what advantage can it be to us to proclaim ourselves spies in intent if not in deed to this soldier of the king  before i could say more and the hot words of anger were slipping from my mouth so rapidly that i might have continued casting reproaches upon little frenchie until many moments had passed the stranger interrupted me by asking calmly  now that you have brought your prisoner here to this cabin what are you counting on doing with him  again pierre unbosomed his very heart and explained that we would carry horry sims into the loft one of us standing guard over him all the time while the others went about the work which they had set themselves  it may be well to continue as if nothing had occurred the man said thoughtfully i have no doubt but that you are burning to know why i have done this thing tonight and yet explanations may not be made while that tory lad can overhear although it is true i have already said and done far too much in his presence let him understand that if an hour ago you counted on holding him close prisoner now are you doubly intent on doing so for he has at least a portion of my secret and there are others in this town of york besides myself who would compass his death rather than that he should whisper the lightest word of what he has heard or seen  now it was i began to get a glimmer of light through my head my tired limbs ceased to tremble and my heart beat less furiously as i set about aiding pierre force horry sims up the rude ladder  the tory must have been quite as terrified as i had been a few seconds before for he obeyed all our whispered commands striving to find here and there a foothold on the shaky crosspieces and otherwise making every effort to ascend rapidly  when we were in the loft and had led our prisoner to where the blanket was spread over the puncheon planks little frenchie took the gag from his mouth saying as he did so  even though you would have spied upon us horry sims i am sorry we were forced to give you the pain of wearing this ornament but our own lives are of more concern than your suffering therefore was it a necessity now if so be you are minded to give up all hope of making your escape and do what you may toward remaining hidden from your redcoated friends who would lend assistance if they knew of your plight we promise to treat you fairly and with more of tenderness than you deserve  are you counting on leaving him to guard himself i asked in surprise believing from pierres words that such was his intention and the little lad replied promptly  i cannot say that it will be possible for him to do very much guarding of himself certain i am that there is only one way of escape from this loft since the holes which serve as windows are too small to admit of his crawling through for i myself tried that experiment this afternoon if he leaves here it can only be through the scuttle and with all of us on the floor below i question whether he would make much headway  but he can raise his voice to give an alarm i answered and pierre replied softly turning toward the young tory so that there might be no question of his hearing the words  if he should dare to speak above a whisper then i promise you fitz hamilton that this gag goes into his mouth not to be removed until the hour comes when we no longer fear his tongue  it seemed to me reckless to leave the tory sneak alone in the loft even though we would be on the floor below but there had been so many happenings within the past four and twenty hours which had aroused in me needless fear that i was ashamed to give words to what was in my mind lest pierre begin to believe i was grown cowardly and when the little lad moved toward the scuttle i caught him by the arm as i whispered in his ear  what would you do you have told the man below all you can and now are we to follow him meekly in case it is his intent to drag us off to the guardhouse as spies  i believe if he gives us the name of spies it will be a case of the pot calling the kettle black pierre said cheerily are you so thickheaded fitz hamilton that you cannot understand somewhat of this strangers purpose surely if he was what his uniform gives token we would not have been treated so gently when he first came upon us but instead the alarm must have been given and a squad of britishers summoned to take us away from the instant he failed to call the guard i began to suspect what he might be therefore followed willingly his directions  and i followed in fear and trembling i replied shamefacedly for i had no doubt but that he was leading me to the gallows  then have you suffered needlessly as do all who fail of taking heed to everything which goes on around them judging one incident from its connection with another little frenchie said with a low soft laugh and then taking my hand in his as if he was the father and i a baby he led me to the scuttle going down the ladder in advance cautiously much as though believing it would be necessary to aid my faltering steps     chapter vii  morgan the spy   when pierre and i were come to the lower floor i noted that some one had thrown a bit of wood on the embers and it was blazing up sufficiently to cast faint rays of light whereby we could see uncle rasmus standing midway between the outer door and the chimney looking down upon the redcoated man who lay near the fireplace as if questioning what his intentions might be  saul stood opposite the stranger gazing at him in mingled wonderment and alarm while the man himself appeared to be wholly unconcerned and entirely at his ease as if he was among friends in the one place of all others he most desired to be  it was a strange scene that thus presented itself to me and rendered so by this seeming britisher among us who claimed the proud title of rebels apparently friendly after having learned what should have brought us to a speedy military trial the conclusion of which must have been conviction and the halter  it was the soldier who broke the silence as he said with a faint smile wherein was more of sadness than of mirth  by this time you lads must have come to understand that i am a friend instead of an enemy and yet i am enlisted in the kings service wearing this uniform in token of being willing to serve him  you are a spy pierre said thoughtfully whereupon the stranger nodded and motioning to the loft above replied in a tone so low that we were forced to gather close around him in order to hear the words  although the lad up yonder has seen enough to convict us all if he had an opportunity to give information there is no reason why he should be let into all the secrets and necessity demands that i confide in you had it not been that i suspectedin fact had fairly good proof of very much regarding the situation i would be this night considered a deserter and no longer able to serve the colonies in their righteous war  meaning what sir pierre interrupted  meaning that in order to carry information to general lafayette which it is important he should know i would have left the lines this night thus betraying my mission here  who are you sir if you please pierre asked for neither saul nor i had gathered our wits sufficiently to be able to question this friendly redcoat  my name is morgan i am better known in the american army as morgan the jerseyman it was by special request of the marquis general lafayette that i enlisted and were we at this moment at my home in new jersey i could show you such writing from the commanderinchief general washington as would convince you that while my coat is red my heart is true blue  how long have you been in the british army little frenchie asked  since my lord cornwallis was in james town there it was i enlisted representing myself as a tory at heart who had been forced to take up arms in the american army and thus far as it seems to me i have conducted myself in such manner as not to raise any suspicion regarding my purpose else had i long since been dancing with nothing beneath my feet  and you say you knew during this last day what was our purpose in coming here pierre continued  i suspected it lad because of seeing this old negro stealing into the cabin yesterday morning just before daylight and wondering what his purpose might be in coming here i kept close watch over the building until i saw you lads enter it and afterward wander around the encampment you did not cloak your designs so closely but that a watchful britisher might have had an inkling for i noted more than once that you were taking careful heed to all the fortifications although why you lingered so long near the quarters of simcoes rangers i failed to understand  then little frenchie told him what our original purpose was in coming to the town of york explained that we would have been minute boys until the time when we were forced to take horry sims a prisoner and otherwise gave all the details which he had passed over when he first gave up his heart to the man who had seemingly made us captives  now if you please sir will you tell us why you would have been counted a deserter from the british army if you had not had your suspicions aroused regarding us pierre asked in conclusion and morgan replied promptly  it is absolutely necessary general lafayette have early information of the work which is being done here in york and in order that there may be no uncertainty as to getting word with him some one must set off without delay for unless i mistake the american forces will besiege cornwallis as he lays here in much the same as a trap after which to go back and forth between this place and williamsburg will be exceeding difficult if i myself go then i must be absent such a length of time that i shall be set down as a deserter and could not return save at cost of my life whereas one of you lads could repeat my words to the marquis as well as i  why not more than one i asked in my folly thinking that two might make the journey with greater safety and morgan replied with a smile as he motioned toward the loft above  what about the lad whom you must guard as you would your own lives for verily his escape would mean your death since only one is really needed to carry my message at least two should remain behind to play the part of jailors  i will set off at once pierre said without hesitation and i knew the dear little lad was burning to do something of moment but there came into my mind like a flash of light that he was the only one of us who called ourselves minute boys who had sufficient wit and cool judgment to keep our secret in case any suspiciously inclined redcoats should venture into the cabin therefore it was i cried quickly and decidedly  no no pierre not you if horry sims is to be held prisoner you are the only one among us fitted to take charge of the scoundrel but for you he would long since have told the britishers of our coming into this town of york and having proven yourself capable of conducting such a game as we are playing it is your duty to remain here in charge  then who will go and pierre looked from saul to me and back again to saul  i waited while one might have counted five to learn if my cousin was eager for this mission which promised somewhat of dangervery much of peril if he who left the village was seen going in the direction of the american lines and since saul remained silent i said with so much of cheerfulness as i could command  i am the one to go i know well the road from here to williamsburg and it may be that my father is among the troops there in which case i shall have no trouble in getting speech with the french general  it was quite plain to me that pierre would have insisted on his right to play the part of messenger between spy and general but i was not minded to be left in such a delicate position as must be that lad who remained to guard our secret and without giving him a chance to make protest i continued hurriedly as if he was indeed my superior and i forced to obey him  let me go pierre dear i am too thickheaded to be left in charge should more dangers arise than already surround us you have already shown your adroitness in crawling out of narrow quarters and therefore must remain here  up to this time uncle rasmus had not spoken it was as if he failed even after all that had been said of understanding the true situation but now it appeared much as if the truth had burst in upon him for i saw what was like unto a sudden flash of light come over his black wrinkled face as he stepped forward to lay his hand on frenchies shoulder while he said gravely and with more of dignity in his manner than i had ever fancied the old negro could assume  your place is des here honey here wid uncle rasmus an marse fitz is de one to go kase deres a chance hell meet wid his father ise lowin it would do misseys heart good ef she could get word from marse straightway frou de chiles lips stay whar you is honey kase ise gwine to be needin you mighty bad  why uncle rasmus was so eager for me to act the part of messenger rather than pierre i failed to understand but it gave me wondrous relief of mind that he did interfere and the little french lad immediately stepped back a pace or two from the fireplace as if to say he would make no protest  then i to clench the matter fearing lest pierre might reconsider his apparent determination to remain asked the redcoated spy what message he would have carried to general lafayette and when it was his desire the messenger should set out whereupon he replied by demanding  tell me what you lads saw today while taking note of the fortifications  i repeated that which pierre had impressed upon my mind and in order that little frenchie should have due credit for the military intelligence displayed i explained that he it was who had given me my lesson as we walked and he it was who had surmised that a battery was to be placed here or a redoubt there whereupon master morgan said in a tone of approbation  you may set it down that your friend is a keen lad one who keeps his eyes wide open and understands whereof he speaks there are many men who could have walked through the town of york this day and not seen onehalf nay not onequarter for you have placed a redoubt here on the right and there on the left which is as yet hardly begun how know you lad that such works are to be put there and the spy turned toward pierre as he spoke  i knew that if my lord cornwallis was fortifying this town against a siege he would need redoubts to the right and left of the village near the river and indeed the ground has already been broken for such works  you must have seen somewhat of military movements in this short life of yours  my father was a soldier pierre said proudly i have heard him and his friends discussing their campaigns and sieges until it seems to me i should be able to say with somewhat of reason how a town like this could be fortified  i give you credit for stationing the grand battery near the church to my mind cornwallis counted on putting it farther to the westward but now i can see that you are right then turning to me again the spy continued you will say to the marquis when you have speech with him that i sent you not being able to leave the village as he can readily understand and after giving a description of the fortifications say that much of the information has come through your friend a little french boy who seems to have a better idea of military works than a jerseyman like myself let him know that one of his countrymen has been thus keen in finding out the plan  when am i to go i inquired and morgan said quickly  as soon as may be now that you have the message there is no reason why you should linger and if you go at once i can point out the safest place to make your way through the lines an hour later i must be in quarters lest suspicions be aroused  i confess to a weakness of heart on learning that i was to set off on a mission without delay when i had proposed to act the part of messenger the work was seemingly in the future and i did not give much heed to the possibility of danger until he set the time for departure so close at hand now i could see before me all the perils which might be encountered and imagined many that might never come my way but i strove to the utmost to prevent the others from reading by my face that which was in my heart putting on a bold front as i buckled my belt a bit the tighter and turned toward the door as if to take my departure  morgan rose to his feet and uncle rasmus seized both my hands in his as he whispered softly  take care ob yoursef honey take care ob yoursef make a straight getaway for williamsburg an don go gallivantin roun kase deres danger from de time you leabe here till you get inside de rebel lines  i had had a certain affection for the old negro before this moment but now something akin to love came into my heart because of the anxiety he displayed concerning my welfare and i returned his handclasp heartily saying in what i strove should be a cheery tone  dont let your heart be troubled about me uncle rasmus ill pull through without difficulty for the road is short and i have had so much of rest this day that i am fitted for travel  little frenchie patted me on the shoulder but remained silent saul stood shifting uneasily from one foot to the other not attempting to bid me goodbye nor even to meet my gaze and i understood that he was saying to himself with shame that he ought at least have striven to act the part of messenger rather than held his peace which was much the same as showing that he did not dare make the venture  i had no time to give further heed to the surroundings the redcoated spy had taken me by the arm and was hurrying me out of the house doubtless fearing lest i grow timorous because of parting words and he prevented the others from following by closing the door quickly behind him  moving cautiously and not venturing to speak he led me a certain portion of the way across the village toward the west as if i was counting on going to my own home and when we were come to where a line of entrenchments was but just begun he whispered softly in my ear  there are but three sentinels on this end the line and you should be able to make your way past them go straight ahead until coming to the road which leads to your home and then strike off to the right for the williamsburg highway after which the way is clear unless british scouting parties are abroad move cautiously take plenty of time until you are outside the lines then see to it that you waste not a single moment but push forward at your best speed for the new day is near at hand  having said this and once more pointing out the direction in which i should go to best avoid the sentinels morgan turned abruptly leaving me to my own devices and during the halfminute i stood there irresolute i felt more desolate and with a greater sense of abandonment than ever before or since however desperate the situation  now was i indeed embarked in the business of spy now had i set my face on that road which led to a shameful death in case i was taken prisoner and while i would not have exchanged places with the lad i regretted that pierre not i had set out to do this work for i doubted my own ability in event of being overhauled by the enemy and questioned i was not so quick of wit and ready of speech as the little lad from new orleans and would fall in many a trap of words where he could pass safely by and with seeming honor  fortunate indeed was it so far as my own good name was concerned that i did not stand there many seconds in the darkness reflecting upon what might be before me else had i become so timorous that i believe of a verity i would have gone back to old marys cabin admitting to my comrades that i dare not go further on the venture  luckily however a sense of shame at my own cowardice urged me forward and when i heard the footsteps of the sentinel giving token that he had gone toward the other end of his beat i crept softly along in a crouching posture even though i might not have been seen in that dense darkness had i walked erect and having covered a distance of fifty yards or more i was come to the road which led toward the hamilton plantation  in front of me was the way which if pursued would have brought me to those i loved and to safety for the time being instead of which i must turn my back upon it and go on the road where i might reasonably expect to meet with the enemy for it was not likely my lord cornwallis would remain quietly in york town without striving to learn what his adversaries were doing even as general lafayette had striven to ascertain when he sent morgan to enlist as a british soldier  it pleases me to be able to say now that when the moment came to set my face away from home and toward danger i did not hesitate believing i was so far from the enemys lines that i could safely advance at a rapid pace i set off at a lope which i knew from past experience i could hold until having traversed the distance from york town to williamsburg and back again  the old adage that he who crosses a bridge before he comes to it is a fool was proven in my case from the moment of insisting that i should be the one to act as messenger there had been before my mind all kinds of dangers to be encountered and i had vexed myself with the belief that there was hardly more than one chance out of twenty that i could go through in safety and yet i did never seeing friend or foe until i was come as nearly as i could judge to within a mile of where morgan had said the americans were encamped  then suddenly while i was halfrunning halfwalking along the highway dreaming no evil came a voice from the thicket on my right shouting  halt or ill fire halt i say  illustration halt or ill fire  on the instant i obeyed the command my heart standing still as it were with terror for i made certain i had blundered upon a british scouting party and one can well fancy the relief of mind which was mine when there came out from amid the foliage a man in the uniform of our own virginia riflemen who was followed by two others and i knew i had been stopped by a friend to the cause  by this time it is needless for me to say the new day had come and they could see me as clearly as i could them therefore i counted on being given a friendly welcome instead of which he who acted as commander of the squad and i counted he was a corporal at the very least asked as if in anger  where are you from in such haste and where going  from york town and with a message to general lafayette  you from york town he cried with a coarse laugh you from york town wanting to see the marquis  ay that i am was my angry reply why should i not come from york and why should a boy of virginia not carry a message to a general who is serving in the american army  there is no reason why he should not providing it was being done honestly but there are virginians who would go from cornwallis to lafayette on anything rather than honest business if you are acting as messenger who in the town of york would send you  for an instant the name of morgan trembled on my lips and then i realized in what danger i might put the spy by thus proclaiming that he had enlisted in the british army while the man seeing me hesitate laid his hand heavily upon my shoulder as he said in what sounded very like a tone of triumph  if you were bent on honest business there is no reason why you should delay in saying who sent you it looks to me much more as though you were one of the tory spawn that infest virginia and were counting on learning what you might concerning our people  now indeed was my anger aroused and i ministered to the suspicions of this zealous patriot by giving way to it instead of speaking him fairly as pierre laurens would have done had he been in my place i must needs fly into a temper asking if he saw on my face anything betokening a tory leaning if he could not recognize an honest lad when he saw him and all that sort of foolish talk which only made the matter worse whereas if i had explained on the instant who i was then would he have had no doubt  the result of my folly was that not only the man who acted as spokesman but both his companions were straightway convinced i was playing the part of a british spythat i was one of those vile things known as a tory who was willing to work whatsoever of harm he might to his own country  at once i found myself a close prisoner being seized by both arms and marched in triumph up the road by these men who i must confess were doing no more than their duty and being given no further opportunity to make explanation  during two or three minutes i held my peace the anger in my heart being so great that i could not think clearly and then realizing that the truth must be shortly known when i was brought before the marquis general lafayette as in my folly i believed i would be i set about telling that which had best been told before i gave way to anger  my name is fitzroy hamilton i said striving to speak in a friendly tone surely you know the hamilton plantation and that my father is in the american army  who in the town of york sent you with a message to the american lines the man demanded  that i cannot tell you but general lafayette will know for it is from one whom he sent into the village  that wont do if you had come from a friend to the cause there would have been no reason why you refused to give his name instead of flying into a passion  i realized only too well that there was much of truth in what the man said but did not give over striving to convince him of my honesty and loyalty to the cause until he angrily bade me hold my peace saying i should straightway stand before those who would know how to get the truth out of me  then it was i begged him to carry me before virginia soldiers if indeed there were any under general lafayette claiming that they would know who i was and most like have come in touch with my father whereupon he said with a sneer as if my prayers had only strengthened his suspicions  if indeed you were a loyal virginian you would know from the uniform i wear that we are riflemen and you are in the presence of three of those same virginian troops you claim to be so eager to meet  this last was enough to silence me finally i had made another mistake where pierre laurens would have come out triumphantly for i did recognize the mans uniform i did know he was a rifleman and had simply meant to ask that he carry me to some other virginian who might be willing to listen more patiently whereas instead of conveying such idea i gave him to believe i was wholly ignorant of how our people who were fighting for the cause should be dressed  it is not to be supposed that i was thoroughly cast down by thus being made prisoner for i knew before many hours had passed i should find some one who would believe my story at least so far as to give me an interview with the marquis and once i had repeated what morgan told me there could be no question but that my honesty would be established  therefore it was i walked on with my captors almost cheerfully and they who at first had watched me as a cat watches a mouse expecting i might make some attempt at escape began to treat me in a more decent fashion thereby causing me to believe they were beginning to suspect i had told somewhat of the truth  there is little need why i should go into detail concerning this part of my poor attempt at playing the spy for it had no other result than my own discomfort for the time being and served to show me if indeed i needed to be shown after all saul had done in the town of york that the lad who gives way to his temper whatever the situation acts foolishly and to his own harm  as i had guessed we were less than a mile from the american line when i was made prisoner and within a very short time my captors were halted by the outposts  he who acted as the leader of the party gave the countersign and straightway i was conducted into the village of canvas tents and shelters of brushwood until we were come to a marquee in front of which the american flag was floating and two soldiers stood on guard  here i was left seated on the ground under the care of one of the men who had captured me until a full hour passed and then to my great relief of mind and wondrous joy none other than my father came up welcoming me with all the love which i knew full well he had in his heart  it needed but few words to explain why i was come to williamsburg and then my business was speedily transacted  if it had not been my own father who conducted me i would have said i was being played upon for a simple when i stood before him whom they called the marquis general lafayette for he appeared to me no more than a boy hardly older than pierre laurens and because of not having yet breakfasted he was in partial undress therefore wore no insignia of rank  it was necessary my father prompt me before i found my tongue to repeat the message and i fancied the marquis himself must have understood somewhat of that which was in my mind for he took me by the hand kindly asking what it was i would say to him and but for the difference in the faces i might have said it was little frenchie with whom i was speaking  i contrived to gather my wits however in time to prevent myself from acting like a veritable simple and on the instant i announced that i had come from a jerseyman by the name of morgan who could not get out of the town of york without deserting from the british lines not only general lafayette himself but all others in the tent were eager to hear what i had to say  then it was and feeling by this time much more at ease i repeated all that lesson i had learned from pierre until having described the fortifications as they then existed and told of those which were evidently intended to be thrown up  i would i might say that the young french general praised me for my bravery in bringing the information that i was complimented by all the officers for having shown so much of courage as to walk that short distance from the town of york to williamsburg and that my father clasped me in his arms calling me a hero but i cannot tell such a story because nothing of the kind happened  it was as if all those men who were serving the colonies looked upon that which i had done as a simple and a natural act as if it required no more courage to set out from york than if i was to have gone from one end of the plantation to another  true it is the general thanked me for that which i told him but straightway the words were out of his mouth he turned to the officers nearabout and began discussing the news while one of them sat down at a table and attempted to draw the fortifications as i had told him they existed or were about to be built and no one gave any heed to me whatsoever save my father  and i must also confess that even he whom i loved so dearly did not spend overly much time in caressing me nor did he utter one word of praise it was to him that i had simply done what any lad of virginia should have done and he was satisfied rather than proud that i had acted the part  it is well you should return at once my lad and since i see no good reason why you should not do so i advise that you make your way around by our home so you may tell your mother what you have seen i sent a messenger to her yesterday but she will be pleased to get later information from the mouth of her own child if you are an hungered we can give you food  i was hungry but after having failed of receiving the reception accorded a hero and being treated as if i had done nothing of moment my folly got the best of me once more and instead of saying that it would refresh me to have food i declared there was nothing to prevent my setting out on the return journey at once  if i had counted that this might remind my father of his neglect to bestow praise then did i make a grievous mistake for he took me at my word without parley saying  very well my son perhaps it is as well that you should not linger here lest there be spies in camp who would recognize you when you reenter the town of york i will go with you as far as the outposts so you may have no difficulty in leaving the lines it needs not that i should remind you of your duty to virginia and urge that you continue as you have begun it would have pleased me far better were you in the ranks even though you served as a private rather than playing the part of spy but since it has been brought upon you by the force of circumstances we must accept the situation as it is and pray to the good god that you come to no harm  this last served better than any other words could have done to show me how foolish i had been to give way to irritation and disappointment because i had not been received as a hero when i had done nothing as yet to win a heros crown and thoroughly ashamed of myself i clasped my father around the neck kissing him again and again mentally asking his pardon for having been such a simple yet not daring to put the prayer into words lest he should come to learn that his son was so great a fool  the good man talked with me as he led the way toward the outposts which i must pass telling me of the great hopes in the breasts of the americans that cornwallis would speedily be overcome and otherwise discussing the affairs of the colonies rather than private matters  i now believe he did so because of not daring to give words to his affection for me lest he weaken my heart when he would have it stout at the time however it surprised me because he had ever been a most loving father who took pleasure in showing his love but i laid it all to the door of a soldiers anxiety at this time when there was so much of vital importance to the colonies at stake  within an hour from the time i first had speech with general lafayette i was alone on the road not that which led to the town of york but rather across the peninsula to the hamilton plantation and the dangerous journey which was to win me so many laurels was finished with no more peril nor more of adventure save when i had been accosted by the american scouts than if i had walked into my mothers drawing room at nightfall     chapter viii  the disappearance of saul   i had no difficulty in going from the american lines to the hamilton plantation i suppose that my lord cornwalliss desire to speedily fortify york town so he might the better be able to prevent the rebels from doing him harm was the reason why no scouting parties were met with and even though i had come upon a dozen redcoats there was little possibility harm would be done me unless peradventure they had been sent out with special orders to make me prisoner because of my having entered the town of york under false pretences  however i did not look forward to anything of that kind nor was there reason so to do it did not seem probable any of the kings officers were aware of what we lads and uncle rasmus were striving to do else had they made a descent upon us before i acted as messenger for the jerseyman  because of having had no sleep the night previous and being somewhat wearied with the tramp from the town of york my eyes were heavy when i set out for my home but the thought of seeing my mother once more of being able to explain to her exactly what we counted on doing together with the beauty of the morning when everything around me spoke of peace content and happiness rather than of war served to revive my spirits and my body until it was as though i had enjoyed a long period of repose  but for that which hung about my neck like a millstone meaning our having been forced to make a prisoner of horry sims i would have been radiantly happy on this morning as it was however i no sooner began to anticipate the pleasure of meeting my mother or attempted to enjoy the beauties of nature than i thought of that cowardly tory cur lying in the loft of old marys cabin where one or another of us must keep watch over him every hour of the day and night and if so be he should succeed in giving us the slip despite all our vigilance then would we become fugitives with all hope of regaining possession of silver heels dashed and considerably more than an even chance we might find lodgement in the british guardhouse  thus it was i journeyed on one moment buoyant with hope and the next cast down by fear of what the future might have in store for us who called ourselves minute boys hoping the day might come when we would be able to give good proof that we had a right to such a title  the journey came to an end finally as must all journeys in this world whether they bring us to a haven of rest or a sink of iniquity and then did i forget all things in the outside world that might give me pain or trouble in the pleasure i had with my dear mother telling what i had seen in the american camp repeating the words father had said to me or striving to make her believe it would be possible for saul and me to accomplish that which we had set before us at the same time i tried to keep in the background the dangers which must necessarily be encountered unless peradventure the americans made an immediate advance and were overwhelmingly successful  i might have saved my breath so far as striving to hide from the good woman who loved me so dearly the possible dangers in the path we had chosen she had pictured them all in her mind and i am bound to give her credit for not having magnified them in the lightest degree she viewed the situation as you might expect a soldiers wife would carefully weighing this possibility and that until she had come to have even a better knowledge of all which threatened than had we ourselves  it was however when i told her we had been forced to make a prisoner of horry sims that she grew white lipped pressing me suddenly to her arms as if imminent danger threatened and from that moment it was necessary i bring to bear upon her every argument at my command else would she have set her foot down flatly that i should not return to the town of york  i believe of a verity all my attempts at making her more friendly with our scheme which had been marred by the capture of the tory cur had been in vain but for the fact that i could plead the shame which would come upon me if i should abandon pierre saul or even uncle rasmus after having done my share toward luring them into a position of peril  she realized even better than i that it was my duty having set out upon the road with these companions and accompanied them thus far to bear my full share of all that might result as a consequence instead of demanding that i remain with her on the plantation she held me pressed closely to her bosom while the tears ran down her cheeks unrestrained until i was grown so fainthearted and so grieved because of having involuntarily caused her suffering that a feeling of timorousness began to creep over me  fortunately however i succeeded in calling back some portion of the courage which had fled before my mothers tears and realized that if i would do my full duty as a boy of virginia should toward the comrades with whom he had bound himself it was necessary i leave home without delay for verily i believe had i remained there until the next morning i could not have summoned up spirit enough to venture into that town of york where the kings soldiers like a pack of ravening wolves were denned up after having committed upon a defenceless people all the injury within their power  of the parting with my mother that noon i cannot speak even at this late day so painful was it i can see now her pale face as she stood on the veranda watching me walk away doing my best not to look back upon that mournful picture and yet turning my head again and again despite all efforts to the contrary  unkind though it may sound for me to say so i must confess to a feeling of actual relief when a turn of the road shut out from my view the house and the dear mournful figure on the threshold  once that had been blotted from my vision by distance i quickened my pace and with every yard traversed on the road to york did my courage revive until when i had arrived where it was necessary to put on an appearance of idle curiosity and total disregard as to the wasting of time i felt almost as if i could work out alone and unaided this plan which we had formed to outwit the officer who represented the king  it must seem strange to have one claim that at such a time when my lord cornwalliss army was penned up so thoroughly by the french fleet to the seaward and lafayettes forces to the landward that a lad like me could wander at will inside the encampment  soldiers not familiar with what was done in virginia at that day might say it would be an absolute impossibility for even a lad like myself to pass through the lines unchallenged because lord cornwallis knew well that a great number of us in virginia were those whom he called rebels and i was of sufficient age and intelligence to carry information to the americans  yet it is true that on this day i saw idlers from plantations on both the york and the james rivers lounging around the british outer works or passing the sentinels here and there along the line of entrenchments facing landward without being challenged or without hindrance in any form and i as a matter of course followed these curious ones who would with their own eyes measure the strength of the king as it was displayed in virginia  like them i entered the village with no one to say me nay because it did not seem prudent to go directly to old marys cabin i wandered around through the village gaping at this or that and once feasting my eyes with a view of silver heels as she stood at the stable line kneedeep in sweet straw munching her hay as contentedly as if she had been in her own box on the hamilton plantation  then i went my way to old marys cabin seeing the black wrinkled face of uncle rasmus at the window while i was yet some distance away  hearing my footsteps he looked up with a smile of pleasure and of welcome and i understood there was naught to hinder my entering therefore flung the door boldly open and walked in to find myself in the embrace of the old man who petted and fondled me as if i had been down into the very jaws of death and was come back only through my own brave exertions  it had ever been uncle rasmuss way to treat me as if i was a child and heretofore it had given me great annoyance that he should stroke my cheeks lovingly and croon about his bressed baby or brabe little man but now that i was in the enemys country where i might come to grief at any moment these evidences of affection were welcome nay i craved them so ardently as to remain really nestling in his arms until the old man tired of treating as a baby the lad who counted to call himself a minute boy of york town  then it was i asked concerning my comrades and uncle rasmus replied that pierre was in the loft above doing his share of guard duty and saul had gone away shortly after breakfast bent on seeking out his mare that he might feast his eyes upon her even as i had upon my own silver heels  just for an instant there came into my mind the fear that my cousin was forgetting himself by leaving little frenchie so long on duty but it was only a passing thought and i gave no further heed to his absence as i went up the ladder into the bare room festooned with cobwebs and lighted by a single square aperture at either end through which the breeze came without check  horry sims miserable tory that he was appeared to be having much the best of this imprisonment knowing that he could not escape save by making his way down through the scuttle and desiring to spare him all the pain that might be prudent our lads had left him unfettered and ungagged  he was sitting on the blanket which he had rolled up to form a cushion with his back against the side of the house near the chimney and appeared to be taking solid comfort although one might see by the expression on his face that the close confinement and the fear as to what might finally happen was telling upon him  on the contrary pierre was the one of that couple who appeared to be getting the worst of the business he was sitting on the bare puncheons near by the scuttle with his knees in his arms looking as weary as a lad well could look and i pitied the little fellow remembering what delights had been mine during what had been much the same as a vacation when i journeyed to the american lines and from there to the plantation  finding it hard work are you i asked crouching on the floor beside him and the dear little fellow with that bright smile of his shrugging his shoulders as if it was a matter of indifference said cheerily  it is not as lively here as i have known it in new orleans and there is but little with which to occupy ones attention but when saul has come back i count on going down to the river bank and having a swim if so be his majestys redcoated servants do not forbid such sport  there is no reason why you should not go now lad surely i can well afford to take your place after having wandered around the country to my hearts content  it is not fair that you should do guard duty after having just returned from a long tramp he replied with a bright winning smile how many hours did you sleep last night  i confess i had not realized that i might stand in need of slumber and would have put the lad off with an evasive reply but he persisted with his question until i was forced to admit that since leaving the town of york to carry the jerseymans message i had not closed my eyes in rest whereupon he insisted i go to the floor below and seek the repose which he claimed i so sorely needed  saul is certain to come back within a short time he said and then it will be for him to take my place here you are to sleep now to the end that if work of any kind be demanded of us this night you will be in condition to perform your share of it  there was no gainsaying a lad like pierre laurens it would have been much like resisting the entreaties of a girl friend to set ones face against that which he desired and i meekly obeyed him leaving in the loft the prisoner who looked fairly well contented with the situation and the jailor who appeared to be suffering from confinement  on the floor below uncle rasmus had already made up such a bed of blankets as was possible he having heard the conversation in the loft straightway i had stretched myself out on that poor apology for a couch my eyes were closed in slumber and i remained hour after hour in blissful unconsciousness of the world of war and of hate around me until i was brought back to this earth and all the disagreeable realities by the pressure of uncle rasmuss hand upon my cheek  what is it whats wanted i cried springing up and striving to brush the slumber from my eyes the cobwebs of sleep being so thick in my brain that for the instant i did not realize where i was  then i noted with no little of apprehension that the night had come already was the room so dark that save for the flickering of a few pine knots in the fireplace one could not distinguish surrounding objects and on fully recovering my senses i asked  did pierre laurens go out for a swim as he counted on doing  de po little french boy am held right here honey kase he couldnt leabe dat scoundrel ob a tory  but wheres saul i cried hasnt saul come in since he left this morning  its des dat whats aworryin ob me honey chile saul ogden done lef here arter we got trou breakfas an lowed hed loaf roun de town a couple ob hours i done heard him tell de little french boy dat hes gwine fo to be back here arter hed seen his mare an yet he ain shown up sence i tell you what it is honey ise gettin powful skeered bout dat cousin ob yourn it cant be hed stay all dis yere time knowin he was boun to habe an eye out on dat tory cur sos pierre could get a sniff ob fresh air  for an instant i stood irresolute looking about me as i tried to guess what could have prevented saul from keeping his word during those few seconds it did not come into my mind that aught of evil might have happened i only questioned what friend he could have met who thus delayed him or what pleasure he found which would keep him away  then like a flash of light came the thought that neither friend nor pleasure could have prevented saul from returning to his duty and i understood that one of two things must have happened he had either been arrested on some charge or another by the redcoated soldiers or had through his ill temper got into a brawl when he had been so grievously wounded that it was impossible for him to come back unaided  i wheeled about suddenly like one bereft of his senses and clambered up the shaky ladder as if my very life depended on my gaining the loft within the shortest possible space of time there where by reaching out his hand he could touch that tory sneak whom i longed to crush beneath my heel because he was causing us so much trouble having the same as thrust himself into our keeping as a prisoner sat little frenchie patient but nervous as i could guess by his movements  where is saul i demanded fiercely as if through some carelessness or inadvertence of pierre my cousin had come to grief and the little lad replied mournfully having lost so much of his spirit during the weary time of waiting that he could seemingly neither shrug his shoulders nor wave his hands  i wish i knew fitz but certain it is something serious must have happened to the boy else he would have been back as he agreed upon within two hours from the time of leaving  why did you not waken me that i might go out in search i demanded angrily as if still believing he was at fault  it seemed to me necessary you should regain all your strength that you might be able to meet the disaster which i feel is near upon us there have been times when i was tempted to call for uncle rasmus insisting he send you out at once but i was checked by the thought that you had already endured much of labor and should be allowed the slumber which was needed  nothing could be necessary at such a time as this save that i went out in search of my cousin i cried almost beside myself with grief and apprehension for there was no longer any doubt in my mind but that saul was either a prisoner in the hands of the redcoated soldiers or else lay somewhere in the village wounded grievously perhaps unto death  now that you have come i will search throughout this entire town and pierre sprang to his feet as if to descend the ladder whereupon i caught him frantically by the coat for at that instant a horrible dread seized upon me lest i be left alone with that tory villain and have so much of temptation that it would be impossible to keep my hands from him  why should we not both go i cried why is it necessary one stay here when uncle rasmus may stand guard at the foot of the ladder  now you are talking wildly suppose we both went out and horry sims hearing footsteps should go to one of the windows and cry for help how would it be possible for uncle rasmus old and crippled as he is to prevent the mischief  then we will gag the tory scoundrel and truss him up so he can neither move hand nor foot i cried is he to stand in the way of our searching for saul is he after having done us whatsoever mischief lay in his power to hold us back when perhaps the dear lad is needing us so sorely  dont gag me dont gag me horry cried frantically i promise to make no sound nor so much as lift a finger if you will leave me free but to have that gag in my mouth all night would be murder  and so it would pierre added emphatically i believe both of us ought to go in search of saul but this fellow tory though he be should not be forced to endure so much of suffering as would be his if you left him gagged and bound  what then will you do with him i asked speaking more like a mad man than a lad who counted it would be possible for him to prove that he might be of service to the cause through playing the part of minute boy surely we cant hoist uncle rasmus up here into the loft  no but we can take horry sims downstairs pierre replied quietly and i cried in alarm  take him to the lower floor where any one who passes may see him  there is no need to leave him in public view pierre replied we can bind him securely in one corner of the room at uncle rasmuss feet where the old negro can readily prevent him from making any outcry  but suppose one of the soldiers takes it into his head to enter  that has not happened thus far and we must take the chances that none will be so curious better that than put this fellow to torture  just then i believe of a verity it would have gladdened my heart to have seen horry sims suffering all the torments a human being can suffer but fortunately the little french lad had more good sense in his tiny body than had i in my lank carcass even though i towered head and shoulders above him and he literally forced me to fall into his way of thinking by bluntly declaring that he would not step outside the cabin door unless i displayed more of humanity  i would almost sooner agree to set the young tory free than venture out in a blind search for saul without having this little french comrade with me and therefore it was i bore my part in disposing of the prisoner as pierre had suggested  we bundled him down through the scuttle as if he had been a bale of merchandise rather than flesh and blood and then i warrant you but little time was spent in binding his hands and feet so securely that unaided he could not get free  how uncle rasmus may have viewed being left in the cabin to act the double part of jailor and helpless invalid i know not he had heard as a matter of course all our conversation in the loft above and when we came down with horry sims and began to tie his feet the old negro shoved his chair into one corner saying as he did so that we should put the fellow where he could have him under his hand then seating himself with a blanket over his knee which might also serve to cover horry in case visitors entered he was ready to do his share of the work  i was not satisfied to leave the two alone unless uncle rasmus was armed and would have set out in search of some weapon although i knew not where to procure one but that pierre said with something almost approaching impatience in his tone  are you so blind fitz hamilton that you cant see whether uncle rasmus is armed or not with that cane of his i dare venture to say he could strike a man dead with one blow while that is in his hand and horry lying at his feet the tory is completely at the old mans mercy  all this was true as i should have seen before pierre spoke and when we had the miserable cur of a prisoner disposed of in a corner of the room where the old negro could if need arose cover him with the blanket which was supposed to be needed by himself as an invalid it appeared to me we need not fear going about in the village while the cabin was unguarded save by uncle rasmus  it would not have been like the little french lad to linger many seconds after our preparation had been completed and immediately he satisfied himself that matters had been arranged to the best of our ability he opened the door going out into the night as he motioned for me to follow  it must have been that news had come into the town of york during the afternoon concerning a threatened advance of the americans for even though it was night the britishers were working at their fortifications having torches of pine knots stuck up here and there and it seemed as if every man of that army of seven thousand was using either the pick or the shovel or directing the movements of those who worked with their hands  can it be that our french general is advancing pierre whispered gleefully to me and because i wished it might be so it was in my mind almost a certainty that the americans were closing in on this town of york with the intent of giving battle to our enemies  we at once turned our steps toward the quarters of the rangers for there was good reason to believe that saul on leaving the cabin in the morning would have gone there first in the hope of getting a glimpse of his mare and as we came upon a group of soldiers who were at work upon one of the redoubts i barely smothered an exclamation of delight for there i saw morgan the jerseyman his coat off shoveling dirt as if his one desire on earth was to prevent the americans from entering york  so thick is my head that i would have gone directly toward him thinking only to tell of sauls disappearance and ask his advice concerning what we had best do but as i stepped forward pierre clutched me firmly by the arm and at the same instant i saw a warning look in morgans eyes as he recognized us  fortunate it was that i had sense enough to obey instantly both the look and the grasp on my arm otherwise had i betrayed him to his death and us lads to a prison  i was faint with the sickness of fear on realizing what might have been brought about by my stupidity but pierre led me straightaway in the direction we had been pursuing and before the dear lad could speak i said noting that we were beyond earshot of any of the kings soldiers  forgive me lad forgive me i came near to doing that which could never have been undone and remembering the terrible danger i was like to have placed you and morgan in it maybe that in the future i shall walk and act more as a thinking boy should  no harm has been done fitz and little frenchie caressed my coat sleeve as if it was he instead of me who had so nearly wrecked three lives so long as you didnt speak to morgan and no one could have noticed that you recognized him it is as if we hadnt seen the man  it was ever little frenchies way to do what he might to soothe the feelings of one who had gone wrong and flinging my arm above his neck regardless of whosoever might see i hugged him to my side as if he had been a sister  owing to the unusual activity all around us we were able to go at will throughout the village seemingly arousing no suspicions for hardly a man noticed us and we searched every foot of the encampment save as a matter of course the guardhouses or the buildings occupied by britishers until having satisfied ourselves that saul was not lying in some outoftheway place unable to move because of wounds  it must be that the britishers have made him a prisoner pierre said thoughtfully as we wandered down to the river bank where we could converse without fear of being overheard if he had provoked a quarrel with any of the soldiers or the lads who came from the plantations we should have found him ere this we may set it down as a fact that he is held in one of the guardhouses  then what is to be done i cried impatiently and to my surprise pierre replied calmly  nothing at least nothing now of ourselves we cannot hope to find him but must wait until we have speech with morgan he is the one of all others in this town of york who can help us  and we are shut out from him by the fear that we may betray an acquaintance i said bitterly whereupon pierre added speaking in a soothing tone  it is only for a few hours lad there is no question but that he will seek us out when the opportunity comes to learn if you succeeded in your mission or if any word was sent to him and we must wait  but in the meanwhile saul is lying in one of these wretched places a prisoner even as is horry sims in old marys cabin i cried bitterly  true fitz and we will hope that it is the worst which has befallen him but how are matters to be mended by us who are much the same as prisoners ourselves to go about making inquiries of any we chance to meet would be the same as begging that we be arrested on whatsoever charge he lies under it is what may be called the fortune of war and you and saul and i must show ourselves as minute boys should by accepting whatever comes with the knowledge that we are aiding the cause  valuable aid we have given the cause by coming into this town and looking at two horses which were stolen i cried savagely and pierre added again caressing my arm  dont forget that you succeeded in carrying a message which morgan could not have delivered save at the cost of destroying his usefulness as a spy  and yet that had nothing to do with sauls arrest if so be he is a prisoner  now you are unreasonable let us go back to the cabin and there wait until the jerseyman comes whether the time be long or short we by fretting and fuming cannot cut off a single minute if remaining idle seems hard remember fitz hamilton that by going ahead blindly we may make matters worse than they are now  of course i realized that all pierre had said was true no fellow could listen to the little lad when he was talking so earnestly and imploringly without understanding how much of sound sense was in that tiny body of his and for at least the tenth time since we set out from the hamilton plantation counting to call ourselves minute boys did i resolve that in the future i would never make protest at any command he might give but would fall in readily and cheerfully with every suggestion of his  he led me back to old marys cabin much as a nurse leads a petulant child and when we neared the door i was like to have forgotten sauls possible plight as the fear came over me that here might we have met with fresh disaster  it was a wondrous relief to enter the rude cabin and find uncle rasmus still seated in his invalids chair with horry sims lying at his feet and in my joy and relief i clasped both the old negros wrinkled hands so tightly that he cried out with pain  there was little need he should ask whether we had been successful in our search because we had returned as we departed but i could not refrain from acquainting him with our ill fortune by saying in a sorrowful tone  we have neither heard nor seen anything of the dear lad and it must be that the britishers are holding him prisoner  de lawds will be done honey de lawds will be done ef dat po chile saul hab fell inter de hans ob de britishers wese boun to set here sorrowin widout liftin a han to help him  uncle rasmus is saying much the same as i did fitz dear pierre interrupted it is the fortune of war and whatsoever comes to us while we are striving to play our part must be borne there is no reason why we should not hope for the best at least until the jerseyman comes as i feel positive he will at the first opportunity     chapter ix  suspense   pierre and i flung ourselves down at uncle rasmuss feet as if by such close companionship we could the better dull that deadly pain in our hearts or lessen the horrible suspense which was about us like a dark threatening cloud  we had no inclination for conversation because if we gave words to the fearful thoughts in our minds it was as if we were making of the possibility a reality therefore we lay on the puncheon planks alternating between faint hope and blackest despair feeling that there was one chance in mayhap a thousand that something had occurred to call the lad out of the village yet at the same time knowing that he must be in the hands of the enemy otherwise would we have received some token from him by this time  i said to myself again and again that if the redcoated gentry held him in their power a prisoner he would be treated with some fair consideration for these soldiers of the king were not red indians and would not proceed to extremities at least until after the semblance of a military trial  i could account for the dear lads absence only that by giving way to his ill temper he had unwittingly revealed the reason for being in the town of york and had been arrested as a spy that seemed the worst of the possibilities for surely if such was the case they could prove him guilty and i knew only too well the fate which would be his  on looking at the matter more hopefully i prayed that he might have gotten into a brawl with some of the soldiers and been carried to the guardhouse simply as a disturber of the peace in which case nothing more serious than his own distress of mind and discomfort of body would occur  it was horry sims who broke the long silence and on hearing the voice of that tory cur it was with difficulty i could prevent myself from leaping upon him choking from his worthless carcass the last breath of life because he was responsible for all our suffering at that moment  it seems to me that now is the time when you can afford to make with me some kind of a trade the young villain said struggling to rise to a sitting posture and before i could utter the words of wrath that arose within me pierre asked with that soft mild voice of his as if the idea of trading with the tory was agreeable  in what way would you have us bargain horry sims what have you to offer  you must be willing to admit that at some time in the future it will be necessary to set me free he began paving the way for that proposition which was coming and little frenchie said in a friendly tone  yes that is true unless before such time comes you make it necessary for us to take your life in order to protect ourselves  surely you would not kill me in cold blood when i stand ready to obey whatsoever command you may give  in that case we should hesitate before taking even such a worthless life as yours pierre replied and one might have thought from the tone of his voice that he was saying something which would be pleasing to the listener  then if it be true as you admit that the time must come when i am allowed to go free it seems to me you had better make a bargain now rather than be forced to let me go later and bear all the consequences of this highhanded proceeding of yours surely you must understand that my friends and my father has many nearabout the towns of james and york will take revenge because of what you have done to me suppose i agree to hold my peace forever regarding what you have done and in addition promise to go out and seek diligently for saul i can go where you dare not i can receive replies to my questions when those whom you approached would be dumb and may promise almost with certainty that before daylight saul ogden will be with you for if the britishers are holding him my people have influence enough with lord cornwallis to effect his release  you are forgetting horry sims that we have been forced to allow you to share too many secrets of ours pierre said mildly and the tory cur added eagerly  you have my word of honor that i will not so much as think of them after leaving this hovel whatsoever i may have heard or seen here is locked in my breast forever if so be you are minded to treat with me  such a proposition as you make might be heeded if he who suggested it was one who had any honor on which we could rely pierre said still speaking in a mild tone we know as well as you that instantly you were allowed to go free your feet would carry you to lord cornwalliss headquarters and there regardless of your socalled word of honor you would repeat everything you have heardmost likely very much you have imagined i am not willing to have dealings of any kind with a tory but it may be that fitz hamilton is more foolish and if he chooses to accept your bargain i shall hold my peace  i did not give the young tory time to ask my opinion while he and pierre had been talking the anger in my heart was nigh to stifling me for i feared that little frenchie might be inclined to put faith in the fellows word and on the instant i cried in a rage  trust you horry sims not for a single second after you were free to move about or to speak there is no oath which you tories could take that would bind you as against those who are risking their lives to free the colonies i would sooner throttle you this minute than trust one of the fair words you might speak  it must be that horry sims had fully believed the time was come when he could bargain with us to his own advantage for straightway i ceased speaking he flew into a rage the first real signs of anger he had shown since we made him prisoner and began to threaten as to what his people would do with us when my lord cornwallis had driven back the forces under general lafayette  he continued in this strain mayhap while one could have counted twenty and then pierre quietly laying his hand across the creatures mouth said with a laugh  you are putting too much dependence upon the future master sims when you reckon time by a victory to be gained by the britishers this particular portion of the kings army is in a small hole from which there can be no escape and within very many days you and your tory friends will be striving to curry favor with those whom you now call rebels  horry sims could make no reply to this remark for the very good reason that pierre held him dumb and again we fell into painful silence picturing in our minds the possible fate of saul until little frenchie said in a tone of hopefulness  why may we not rid ourselves of this fellow entirely while we hold him he is a menace and but for the necessity of keeping watch over the cur we would be at liberty to move around at will  but how can we rid ourselves of him i asked impatiently forgetting for the instant that this little lad from new orleans so gentle and so girlish in his ways was full of resources at such a time  it should not be difficult to smuggle him through the lines during the night and by carrying the fellow to general lafayettes army i have no doubt the officers would hold him fast for us because of understanding what might be the jerseymans fate if he was allowed to go free you would only be forced to tell your father the story fitz in order for him to guard the scoundrel as he would guard something very precious  on the instant my heart leaped with joy for verily did this plan seem to promise both success and relief and without looking ahead to the possibilities i said promptly as if it were in our power to do whatsoever we pleased  he shall be carried to williamsburg once there ill answer for it he has no chance to join his friends who claim to love the king so dearly  then pierre and i set about discussing the best course to pursue while leaving the town of york as if we would set off that very night when uncle rasmus put an end to the hoping and planning at least so far as the present was concerned by saying dreamily  ise lowin chillun dat you won fin it so terble easy to get out ob de lines dis yere night deres sumfin in de air dats trubblin marse cornwallis an you can be mighty sure dese yere sogers am keepin dere eyes wide open  surprised at thus learning that the old negro knew so much of what was going on outside i asked irritably why he had formed such an opinion  didn you tell me yoursef honey i ain lowin dat dese yere sogers would be shovelin dirt in de night less sumfin had come up sudden like des look out ob dis yere winder an see de torches all roun us how you low youse gwine to sneak out ob dis yere cabin wid de young tory tween you an get away widout anybodys askin questions  there was no need for me to do as uncle rasmus suggested while pierre and i had been searching for saul we had seen signs as i have already set down of unusual activity in every direction and i realized that we could not hope to make our way through the lines unnoticed while as it seemed to me every member of cornwalliss army was astir  uncle rasmus is right pierre said mournfully and i was a fool not to have remembered what we have just seen there is no sense in our talking of leaving town at least until the britishers have quieted down we must carry the tory into the loft again and say to ourselves that we are held prisoners in the village of york even as he is in this cabin  why take the trouble to carry him into the loft i asked fretfully angry because it had been shown me beyond a shadow of doubt that the plan i leaped at so eagerly was an impossibility  because when morning comes no one may say how many redcoated soldiers will be here hunting for us if saul has been arrested then are we under suspicion  and if they come to search for us there is no more assurance of our remaining hidden with this tory in the loft than if he remained here in the room  we will take him there nevertheless pierre said in a tone so decided that i could not have contradicted him even though i had made ready a good argument for so doing and without delay the little lad from new orleans set about acting on his own suggestion  it was not a simple task which we had before us for horry sims bound hand and foot was as unwieldy as a bundle of merchandise and in addition he fought as well as he might to prevent us from forcing him up the shaky ladder  not until i had cuffed him soundly promising a more severe punishment in case he continued to resist did the lad give over the useless struggle and after considerable labor pierre and i contrived to hoist him to the loft above  it was when we had finally succeeded and were seated on the puncheon planks near the scuttle resting from our exertions that uncle rasmus said speaking sufficiently loud for us to hear him while he yet remained in his chair near the window  ise lowin chillun dat you bes stay right whar you are an de ole man will keep an eye out here sos dere wont any ob dese yere britishers sneak in widout our knowin it if de man from jersey comes erlong ise boun to gib you notice so try to get your forty winks ob sleep while deres a chance  it seemed to me like veriest folly to talk of sleeping while our hearts were so heavy with grief and danger seemingly closing in around us yet when pierre acted on uncle rasmuss advice by throwing himself down on the puncheon planks by the side of horry sims where he could have due warning if that young scoundrel attempted any mischief i followed his example with the tory between us we two lads lay there on the hard bed both i doubt not thinking with tears in our hearts of sauls possible fate and both within a short time journeying over into dreamland despite all there was in the situation to prop our eyes wide open  when next i became conscious of my surroundings it was possible to see the faint grey light of coming dawn through the narrow apertures which served as windows and i sprang to my feet quickly almost frightened because i had given myself up to slumber for so long a time  scrambling down the shaky ladder as if time was most precious i made my way to the room below where i found uncle rasmus sitting as when i had last seen him with a blanket drawn over his knees and his eyes fastened upon the moving figures of the soldiers outside  why did you let us sleep uncle rasmus i demanded we should have remained awake so that you might have an opportunity to rest  ole bones don need so much ob de bed as young ones does honey an ise no good cept to set right here an watch don you fret bout your uncle rasmus kase hell look out for hissef all right  but it seems selfish for us to have slept while you remained awake  now youse frettin bout nuffin chile when deres plenty ob real trubble to take up your min  what has happened i asked anxiously thinking for the instant that the old negro had seen tokens of impending danger  deres sumfin goin on in dis yere town honey as is pas my understandin dese yere sogers has been workin all night an deyre still at it as ef de ole man from down below was arter em  i dont see that we need fret very much if the britishers have grown frightened i said with a laugh and uncle rasmus replied  it looks to me honey as if dey counted dere was gwine to be a battle roun here mighty soon an ef anyting ob dat kine does happen ise askin mysef how wese comin out ob it wese a good deal like brer rabbit when de fox an de wil cat was fightin to see which one would hab him for breakfas whicheber way it turned he was boun to be eat up an it kinder looks to me as ef wed be in de same fix ef our folks an de britishers got to shootin off dere guns while we was in dis yere cabin  i stood silent and motionless gazing at the old man with my mouth wide open like a simple as this possibility of a new danger came upon me as a matter of course i had believed there would be a battle between the two armies but that we might be held in the cabin exposed to shot and bombs from both friend and foe was something to cause the blood to run cold in ones veins  it was well for me that just at the instant came a change in the situation else might i have given proof of the timorousness which was in my heart i was yet looking stupidly at uncle rasmus when the door suddenly opened as i turned to see who was the intruder an exclamation of joy and relief burst from my lips for it was none other than morgan and i made sure that now was come the moment when we would have some information concerning saul  yes i have been working all night in the trenches as if my greatest desire in life was to hold the americans in check he said as he sank down on the floor like one on the verge of exhaustion when he saw that i was taking note of the stains of toil upon him  what about saul i cried forgetting that we had had no opportunity of warning this friendly spy that our comrade had disappeared  saul is he not with you  he went out from this house yesterday morning and has not returned pierre and i were searching for him when we came across you i then might have made trouble for all of us but for little frenchie who was quickwitted enough to see that you feared lest we might speak to you  your comrade has disappeared morgan said musingly and seemingly forgetting his weariness of body he rose to his feet like one who suddenly remembers that the time for action has come  we thought you might know somewhat concerning him i added stupidly for by the surprise and even the fear exhibited by this man i might have known beyond a peradventure that he was all ignorant of what had occurred  is there a possibility he might have gone home simply to please himself morgan asked after a brief pause and i replied emphatically knowing full well that whatever might be the faults of my cousin he would not leave us in ignorance concerning his whereabouts if he had set off solely for pleasure  it is positive he would not have gone away of his own accord without having told us  then it stands me in hand to find out what has become of the lad if by chance he has been taken under suspicion of being a spy then is my shrift like to be short for within the past twelve hours it has become well nigh impossible for any one to make his way through the lines  what has caused such sudden caution pierre asked as he descended the ladder having been awakened most like by the sound of our voices  word has been brought in that lafayettes army is being reinforced by men from the north it was said last night that another fleet has appeared off the capes that there is like to be fighting both on the sea and on the land and general cornwallis has come to understand better than ever before the necessity of keeping his situation a secret in other words he has locked the stable door after the horse has been stolen for there is nothing new we could carry to our people even though it were possible for us to go and come at will  do you think a battle may be near at hand i asked and morgan replied confidently  i am not well skilled in war but would be dumb indeed if i did not understand that before a battle between the two armies can take place this village will be besieged cornwallis is preparing for such possibility else why is he fortifying this unimportant point so carefully it cannot be carried by direct assault therefore are we like to be shut up in here until the britishers are starved into subjection unless perchance the fleet which has just come off the capes proves to be english and succeeds in driving the french away  is there any reason why fitz and i should not show ourselves around the village this morning pierre asked suddenly as if some new thought had come into his mind and morgan replied  you may do as you will lad so that you are careful not to arouse suspicion and above all give no heed to me if we come within sight of each other if it should be that saul has been taken as a spy i am thinking you lads will speedily find your way into the guardhouse and it matters not whether you are taken while on the outside or here in the cabin  then master morgan opened the door as if to go out and i would have detained him by clutching nervously at his arm but he shook me off as he said  i must strive to learn somewhat of the situation because just now a grain or two more of knowledge may save our lives tonight if not before and in case the three of us are allowed to remain at liberty i will try to have speech with you again  he was gone before i could make further protest and after closing the door i turned to face pierre and uncle rasmus  our company of minute boys seems to be of great assistance to the cause i said bitterly for with morgans words there had come into my heart the certainty that death stood very near instead of showing that we could play the part of men we have simply come into this town of york and put a halter around the neck of that honest man from jersey for had we remained at home without dreaming of accomplishing the impossible in the way of winning glory he would have deserted from the british army in order to carry the information to general lafayette and thus be out of danger  one would suppose to hear you talk fitz hamilton that the end had comethat we were doomed beyond possibility of escape  and how else can you picture it i asked angrily with saul arrested as a spy we are certain of sharing the same fate even though you may account for his absence in some other way it seems positive we are to be shut up here with the enemy while our friends are striving to kill all within the entrenchments if that does not warrant my belief that we are standing very close to death i would like to know how much more proof may be needed  we are yet alive pierre said softly and with a shrug of the shoulders and as yet at liberty so far as this cabin is concerned i fail to understand why we may not yet prove ourselves worthy of being called minute boys and succeed in doing something which shall win for us credit if not honor from those who are struggling against the king  it angered me that that little french lad should be hopeful at a time when clouds of danger pressed so thickly and so closely about us and i turned away from him impatiently looking out of the window where could be seen the laborers in the trenches squads of men marching here and there and officers visiting this scene of activity and that but all working with one common aim which was the oppression of our people  whether pierre was as unconcerned as he would have it appear i cannot say but if he had put on a mask then was he playing his part well for he went here and there with a smiling face as he made ready our small store of food for the morning meal and actually spoke in a cheery tone when he announced that our provisions were well nigh exhausted  i allow that we can satisfy our hunger this noon if indeed we have any desire to eat at that time but we will go supperless to bed unless some means for provisioning the cabin can be devised  i could not believe we had eaten all that store of provisions which we brought from the hamilton plantation until i went to the cupboard and there saw that pierre had spoken truly even within bounds for if we ate our fill on this morning the noonday meal would be slight indeed  when i turned from this dismal inspection pierre was carrying up the ladder to the loft a plentiful supply of cold boiled ham and fried hominy seemingly a larger portion than he had set aside for our own breakfast and i asked angrily if he counted on giving that tory sneak more than we ourselves could indulge in whereupon he said gravely  if any go hungry it must not be the prisoner we are holding him here and it is for our honor that he be not allowed to suffer  it is for our own safety that he be kept on short allowance i cried how do you allow we can add to our store now that it is no longer possible according to morgans story for us to make our way through the lines  it makes no difference how we can add to the store or whether we spend this day without breaking our fast the tory prisoner is to be fed and i shall see to it that so long as we have a morsel in the cupboard so long shall the greater portion of it be his  i had never heard pierre laurens speak so decidedly and with such an assumption of authority as at this time and surprise silenced me that the little lad should have taken it upon himself to say this thing should or that thing should not be when without having actually done so in words i claimed to be the leader of the company  pierre took care to feed horry sims before he served out any food for uncle rasmus and me and when we sat on the floor near the window breaking our fast my heart smote me as i took note that he had given both to the old negro and me a portion twice as large as that which he reserved for himself  the lad was ready to sacrifice his own need to our pleasure and i would have forced upon him some portion of the provisions which he had given me but that he resolutely refused to take it saying he was not hungry that the news brought by morgan had driven all thoughts of food from his mind and such other excuses which i knew had been invented simply to force me to take more than my share  fortunately for my peace of mind even at this late day i refused to eat more than did he and the keenness of my anger was not yet dulled when i carried the remainder of the portion allotted me to the cupboard saying in what i intended should be a jovial tone  the knowledge that your stomach is set against food has weakened my appetite and perhaps it will be as well for we have the more when the time comes for serving dinner  the old negro insisted that both pierre and i should go through the town to put ourselves in the way of learning whether any further information had come in from the outside and declaring that he would take care of horry sims providing we brought him down on the floor once more  i would have refused to act upon this suggestion but it seemed to please pierre and he at once set about getting the tory cur where uncle rasmus could overlook him therefore was i forced to lend a hand  am i to be left here trussed up like a chicken ready for the roasting horry sims asked angrily when we had put him once more in the corner of the room without taking undue care as to the handling  your stomach is full except for your liberty are you better off than either pierre or i and you may lie there thanking your stars that matters are no worse for you i cried whereupon little frenchie as if fearing i might abuse the prisoner of which he was so careful opened the door and literally thrust me out  when we were come near to my lord cornwalliss headquarters i noted with surprise that a goodly number of the soldiers together with a large sprinkling of officers were pressing on toward the waters edge and it was no more than natural pierre and i should follow the throng excited as we were by seeing the privates throw down shovel or pick without permission to chase at the heels of their superiors  before we were come to the dock it was possible to hear from the distance a dull boom as if many miles away a heavy cannon had been discharged and then there came another and another and i heard those redcoated men nearest me say gleefully  admiral graves is stirring up the frogeaters we may count it as certain that these two rivers will no longer be blockaded by frenchmen  then i remembered what morgan had said and understood that the fighting for the possession of this town of york had already begun on the sea that the british fleet had come down to drive away the vessels under command of count de grasse once more i grew timorous with understanding that if the englishmen should be victorious in this naval battle which i doubted not was close at hand then would it be possible for them to land troops on the river of york or of james at their pleasure until our forces at williamsburg were outnumbered ten or twenty to one  the same thought was evidently in pierres mind and he also must have been fearing that the english sailors might prove superior to the french seamen for he said in a whisper drawing me closely to him by clutching tightly at my arm  my lord cornwallis must be mighty uneasy just about this time for unless the british fleet can drive away the french vessels then is he left to the mercy of our people who are coming down from the north to join general lafayette  ay but if so be the english succeed then is general lafayettes force at their mercy  ay lad and it may be a tossup at all events i have it in mind that whatsoever is going on at sea just now decides the fate of this portion of the kings troops even though the frenchmen do no more than hold their own and prevent the britishers from driving them out of chesapeake bay then must the day speedily come when my lord cornwallis will be crying for quarter  with all the fortifications that have been thrown up around this town of york it strikes me he may hold out many a long hour before being forced to show the white flag i said bitterly and the little french lad added cheerily  you forget that your people under the command of my countryman can work as well if not better with pick and shovel than have those redcoated servants of the king and i make no doubt but that there will be as strong lines of entrenchments opposing my lord cornwallis as he has thrown up for his protection  and in the meantime we shall be between the two or what is the same thing exposed to the fire of our own people and taking our chances of a stray ball from the redoubt here near the point i said as my heart shriveled once more under the influence of fear     chapter x  news of saul   pierre laurens and i might have stood on the river bank and argued as to the future until the crack of doom without its affecting matters in any way or without our being the wiser save that we watched what was happening around us for luckily no person may look into the future  we were so excited by the distant sounds of the battle which was raging between our friends in the french fleet and those whom his majesty had sent to whip us into submission that for the time being all thoughts of saul had completely gone out of my mind it was as if the lad did not exist until mayhap two hours had passed when pierre bethought himself that it was our duty to go back to old marys cabin in order to acquaint uncle rasmus with what was going on and then i spoke my cousins name reproaching myself because i had thus seemingly neglected him  you need not be so bitter against yourself fitz hamilton little frenchie said with a shrug of the shoulders it seems certain that we of ourselves can gain no information whatsoever concerning saul ogden else would we have come upon him ere this we must content ourselves in patience so far as may be believing that the jerseyman will sooner or later come upon the truth  and what then i interrupted fiercely  then we shall do all within our power to aid the lad if he be alive and keep ever in mind in case he has gone into the other world that he went because of striving to do whatsoever he might for the cause  i believe we could have walked through the village of york again and again talking loudly on the most disloyal topics and yet no one would have given heed to us so intent were all upon that distant booming which told of a struggle that must decide the fate of those who held the town of york while they themselves were much the same as prisoners  it was some such thought which caused me to say with a smile and as if there was more of courage in my heart than really existed that lord cornwallis was much like pierre and me he had taken this village of ours and set himself down to keep it after which general lafayette had come up closing him in and holding him fast we on our side had taken horry sims a prisoner and were striving to hold him while the kings soldiers were much the same as depriving us of our liberty now that they no longer allowed us to make our way through the lines  ill agree that the two situations are alike up to a certain point pierre said grimly but the end is to be much different my lord cornwallis will be beaten while im counting that we shall come off victors through the aid of those who are battling for the cause and therefore will we laugh best because we laugh last  a dearer truer more cheery comrade than pierre laurens never lived surely i had good proof of it that day when he heartened me with his light words and his promises concerning the future until i was almost come to believe we were on the high road to success even though there remained in the cupboard of old marys cabin no more than food enough to serve for another meal and we were unable to make our way to the hamilton plantation where we might have revelled in plenty  when we saw uncle rasmus once more it was as if we had not stirred hand or foot since we left him as horry simss guardian  the black wrinkled face could be seen through the window as we approached and so far as being able to read an expression of either hope or despair upon his countenance one might as well have gazed at a graven image  pierre lost no time in explaining to uncle rasmus the moaning of those dull yet heavy reports which could be heard from the distance and when he was done with the story as we had heard it from the britishers the old negro said placidly as if the matter did not affect him in the slightest  ise lowin chillun dat deres boun to be a heap ob fightin roun dis yere town fore de britishers get what am comin to em  and we are like to have as much in the way of danger as if we were serving in the trenches i added curious to learn how the possibility of being under the fire of our friends might affect the old man  ise lowin dat youse right honey was the quiet reply ginal washington aint gwine fo to set down up norf while he knows wese needin him here kase hes a genman ob virginia an dey allers tends to dere duty course wese boun to stand our end ob it when de shot does begin to fly but bress you honey how many dat you know an i know am gwine to do de same an whats good enuf for dem ain any worse for us  surely with such companions as pierre and uncle rasmus a decent fellow could not long indulge in gloomy possibilities of the future and for at least the twentieth time since we left my home did i resolve that i would strive to imitate them in their calm faith as to what the coming days might bring and their general disregard to bodily discomfort or injury so that they might be able to do something however slight to aid the cause  then of course we discussed this possible battle which was going on at sea speculating as to what the outcome might be if the french beat off the enemy and also what might occur if the english were victorious for you must remember that while waiting further news from the jerseyman we had nothing better with which to occupy our time  although we talked long and earnestly going over all the possibilities horry sims did not venture to raise his voice and this surprised me somewhat causing suspicions to arise lest the tory cur had in mind some plan for escape or that he knew more than did we although that seemed impossible regarding sauls whereabouts  on that day because of lack of provisions we decided that there was really no need of dinner and deferred the meal until night the prisoner as a matter of course sharing our fast although i doubt not that pierre would have insisted on his feasting while we went hungry had there been more than provisions enough to provide a single fair allowance for the four of us  it was dull work sitting in old marys cabin waiting for the coming of the jerseyman although we knew full well that he might not be able to pay us a visit within eight and forty hours but it was in pierres mind that we had best remain there where he could come upon us at a moments notice rather than walk around the village now it seemed certain we could get no information regarding saul  i hardly remember how that long day did pass i know full well however that it seemed as if more than a week elapsed between sunrise and sunset i can even at this moment recall the fierce joy which was mine when just as the shadows of night were beginning to fall the door of the cabin was opened softly and that man whom we had been waiting for so eagerly came in  i could hardly wait until he had closed the door behind him before i asked impatiently with mingled hope and despair in my tones  have you heard aught concerning saul  when the reply came i leaped to my feet excitedly rushing toward the man as if to clasp him in my arms for i had not dared to hope he would bring positive news  saul ogden is confined in that guardhouse where so i am told the widow marshall formerly lived do you remember a small onestoried log building that stands perhaps two hundred paces in the rear of the church  yes yes i know it well i cried eagerly although not being really certain as to which of the houses the widow marshall had formerly lived in what is the charge against him  that i havent been able to determine but feel quite positive it is nothing very serious else would he be under stricter guard most like he and some of the tory villagers got into a brawl  how is he guarded pierre asked and i understood that even then the dear lad was casting about in his mind for some plan which might promise success in our efforts to release him  there is but a single sentinel in front of the building if saul was charged with being a spy he would be confined in the basement of that stone house overlooking the wateri know not who owned it before the british occupation spies are more closely guarded while your cousin shares the quarters of such soldiers as are punished for slight misdemeanors  then it may be possible that we can aid him to escape i cried breathlessly and to my surprise master morgan said emphatically  it would be unwise to make any move in such a direction lest suspicion be aroused regarding you and me the lad is in no danger and i dare venture to say more comfortably situated than are you leave him alone do not even loiter around the building in the hope of getting a glimpse of him and you may be certain nothing of harm will come through the britishers just at this time it is well to let sleeping dogs lie  i cried out against what thus seemed to be an abandonment of our comrade and stupidly insisted that it was our duty to do all we could to release him from his prison regardless of what might come to ourselves whereupon little frenchie reminded me in that silken voice of his that we had no right even though the peril was greater to run the risk of bringing suspicion upon morgan whose life would most like pay the penalty if it was known that he had any connection however slight with those who favored the cause  we argued the matter back and forth half an hour or more pierre and morgan against me until finally i was brought to a sense of my duty was made to understand that in this supreme effort of the colonists to throw off the yoke of the king the liberty or even the life of one or a dozen such lads as us should count as nothing that if by going down to his death saul might avert suspicion from morgan thereby leaving him where there was a possibility he could aid the cause then should a boy be proud to die  very well i yield you have shown me why i should desert my cousin and i am ready to do it now perhaps you can say how we may replenish our store of provisions for we are about to eat the last morsel of food  i was angered because of having been beaten in the argument and because even pierre sided against saul as it seemed to me therefore spoke hotly and in what i counted should be a scornful tone but to my deep surprise morgan said in a tone of satisfaction  like to be hungry are you well matters couldnt have turned out better for me i didnt dare dream you would be driven by necessity to do that which i have in mind  so it seems fortunate to you that we shall not be able to break our fast tomorrow morning i cried hotly and the jerseyman replied with a laugh  ay lad so it does i am not claiming that it will be impossible for you to do as i desire but by really being hungry you can the better act that part which i had come up here to persuade you was your duty  what is it you would have us do sir pierre interrupted as if it irritated him because we spent so many words before coming to the meat of the matter  if two boys and an old slave are the same as starving surely there isnt an officer under cornwallis who would not grant them permission to go fishing in two or three hours they might be able to get enough to fill their stomachs many times over i believe you have only to present yourselves to the officer of the day tomorrow explaining the situation and asking permission to go out in a boat  all these words simply formed a riddle i did not have the sense to understand just at the time owing to my impatience that the jerseyman had something back of thisthat it would serve his purpose for us to be on the river tomorrow morning but dear little pierre was not needing many explanations before he could come to the root of the matter and he asked quietly  if it should be that we got permission to go fishing where think you we could make the biggest catch  two miles or more below gloucester point morgan replied  having gone so far as that what would you advise  that you keep reasonably near the shore and if a man wearing a bit of green in his hat came near to the waters edge put in where you might have speech with him  what speech  remember lads these words despite all the work cornwallis is doing in the way of fortifying the town there are indications that he is preparing to retreat by way of gloucester if the english fleet fails to bring succor now let me hear you say that twice for the wording is most important  pierre did as he was commanded never missing a word or tone and when he had finished to the jerseymans satisfaction i asked how it was known that a man would approach the boat  i saw him on the shore this afternoon his being there is much the same as an intimation that he is waiting for some word i doubt not that seeing two boys in a boat he will come near the water to give you an opportunity of proving if you have been sent by me there is a possibility he may be prevented from coming or that he will not understand you might be serving me of all that we must take our chances and since you are in such sore need of food the attempt to deliver my message will cause you little or no additional labor  it is not the labor that would stop us pierre said hotly it is needed only that you point out how we can be of service and nothing else is of importance  i know that lad right well do i know it from what little i have seen of you since we met go to the officer of the day early in the morning or to whomsoever wearing a sword you can come at most handily tell the truth so far as may be safe and humbly beg permission to go fishing for the time being put from your minds all thoughts of saul ogden difficult though that may be for i assure you he is in no danger and enjoying more of comfort than it is possible for you to enjoy here in this cabin while you stand guard over a tory prisoner  i would have forced morgan to explain more regarding this man whom he thought we might possibly meet on the gloucester shore for i was eager to understand how the fellow had come there and what cause he had for believing he might be seen by the jerseyman but our visitor cut me short by saying that now his business had been transacted there was no reason why he should remain longer and great need for him to hasten away  immediately we were alone pierre set out the last of our store of provisions dividing the food equally between us four counting the prisoner as a member of the company and when we had eaten the frugal meal which was in quantity no more than enough to make plain the fact that we were hungry little frenchie led me into the open air making no explanation to uncle rasmus regarding his movements  where would you go i asked when the door was closed upon us so that those inside the cabin might not hear what was said and the dear little french lad whispered in my ear while caressing the sleeve of my coat  i would not have you believe fitz hamilton that i am so cold blooded as it appeared when i agreed with the jerseyman that we would make no attempt at getting word to saul i am burning to let the lad know we stand ready at the first opportunity to give him aid and to that end would walk down past the house where we are told he is imprisoned  but what about the danger we may be bringing upon morgan by thus interfering when he has advised that we remain quietly with uncle rasmus i cried and pierre replied softly  can you not see how lame his argument was that he himself might be drawn into trouble if we were suspected he has visited us twice in the cabin and both times secretly it is to be supposed he took good care no one should see him therefore how may it be said if we run our noses into danger that he has had any part in it  would you set out with me now to do whatsoever we might toward releasing saul for verily pierre laurens he may be released if simply held prisoner in that house belonging to the widow marshall because it is as crazy a building as the one we have just left  i am not saying i would do aught toward releasing him this very night for that could not be other than dangerous no matter for what slight misdemeanor he may have been arrested once he has made his escape the hueandcry will be raised what i have in mind is simply to let the lad know we are watching over him and stand ready to do all within our power when the proper time comes  verily pierre was wise beyond his years it had not occurred to me that morgan had some particular reason for keeping us closely housed but now it was as if i understood all his purpose he counted on our being where he could lay his hand on us at any moment when it might be necessary we should act in his behalf therefore advised that we leave saul out of the question for the time being  pierre had apparently agreed with the jerseyman while at the same time it was in his mind to do that which we were setting out to accomplish and i had no scruples about following him for ponder over the matter as i might i failed to see how anything suspicious on our part could bring trouble or danger to the spy or in any way menace the cause  it was more than possible we might run our own noses into danger and suffer thereby but we alone would be called on to pay the penalty  i led the way through the village to the widow marshalls meeting here and there a single soldier or the redcoated gentry in squads none of whom gave any particular heed to us because there were other lads then ourselves in this village of york whose parents had not seen fit to run away when the britishers took possession  as we made a detour around the building i said to pierre taking good care not to point lest i attract attention  yonder is the house where the soldier stands in front of the door do you see that the only bars to the windows are puncheon planks if a lad was so minded and no one approached the rear of the building during a certain length of time he could dig his way through that chimney of sticks and mud until he was come into the fireplace  all this as a matter of course pierre had noticed and he also must have seen as did i that our hope of showing ourselves to saul had been vain for as i have said the windows were closed with planks whosoever was held prisoner inside could not get a glimpse of the outer world but must remain in darkness all the while  we walked by this apology for a guardhouse slowly not daring to halt lest some redcoat take heed that we were noting the place more carefully than lads of the village would be likely to do when we were come nearly to the river front we wheeled about retracing our steps so far as to be able to pass the building on the other side but at no point could we see an opportunity for warning my cousin that we were near at hand  we might as well have staid inside the cabin i said in a tone of despondency as we turned our faces toward where we knew uncle rasmus awaited us this is the first time pierre that one of your plans has come to naught and both you and i should have had wit enough to realize that if the building had been turned into a guardhouse the windows would be barricaded in some way to prevent the escape of prisoners  the plan has not come to naught before we left the cabin i had no idea where the house was located but now you have pointed it out i would be able if the time was ripe and you not with me to find the place i am counting  pierre did not finish the sentence for at that moment we came face to face with abel hunt a dissolute fellow seventeen or eighteen years old who lived in a mean hovel with his meaner parents near to horry simss home and one who would follow in the footsteps of horry simss father so far as having a tory leaning was concerned  it was so dark that i did not see the fellow until we were close upon him otherwise would i have made every effort to avoid a meeting for i had no doubt that he seeing us in york would immediately ask himself why we who favored the cause were there then might he straightway set about striving to learn what was our business in the village  again and this came into my mind like a flash of light he might be there searching for horry when the lad failed to return home his parents would as a matter of course send here there and everywhere in search of him and this fellow abel hunt would have been one of the first whom master sims would have called on because having much the same as supplied the hunt family with food he could demand their service whenever they were required  looking over what i have here set down it would seem as if i was making it appear that pierre and i stood motionless several seconds in front of abel hunt whereas all these thoughts had come into my mind in a twinkling even as i crowded little frenchie into the roadway with the faint hope that we might pass hunt and not be recognized  in this i was unsuccessful for even as i would have moved out of his path the fellow seized me by the arm as if he was my equal and said with a coarse laugh  well how comes it that one of the hamiltons who claim to be redhot rebels is loitering around the british encampment have you changed coats lately master fitz  i am wearing the same coat of buff and blue that i stood ready to put on when we heard the news from boston i suppose if there be any color to yours it is red unless peradventure you could find more money in the pockets of a garment of different hue  this last i said because it was well known two years before that both abel and his father were willing to sell their services to whig or tory but could find none foolish enough to buy them therefore dependent upon master sims as they were for their daily bread fell into line as lovers of the king  hunt gave no heed to me when i thus reminded him that he was willing to sell his opinions but abruptly demanded why i was in york and where i counted on going  it is true that i might have told the fellow it was none of his business and refused to hold converse with him as i surely would have done had the danger not been so great if i passed him with an angry word it was absolutely certain he would follow to learn where i went and failing in discovering that might give information that the son of captain hamilton of the american army was loitering around york whereupon i would find myself in that same guardhouse where saul was confined  the only course as it seemed to me and i was forced to decide on the instant was to speak to the fellow fairly and much though i disliked to do so strive to throw him off the scent  therefore it was i said forcing myself to speak in a fairly friendly tone  pierre and i came into york yesterday to see the soldiers for never before have i been in a military encampment we had no difficulty in entering the lines but it was quite another matter when we would go out it seems as if there must have been some sudden change in the situation that lord cornwallis should decide not only to prevent visitors from arriving but also from departing when they desired to go home  and what have you lads been doing since the time when you found it impossible to pass the sentinels abel hunt asked suspiciously still holding me by the arm while the fact that i continued to answer him in a friendly manner must have been proof that i was afraid of him and he so understood it as i fancied from the tone in which he spoke  never before had he dared to accost me other than in the most civil manner with his hat in his hand now he demanded an answer as if he was my superior  we have done the best we might pierre answered most like fearing i would make an intemperate reply it is not easy to find food among strangers and as for a shelter we long since gave up all hope of that therefore are spending the night on our feet as you see  do you count on walking around till morning hunt demanded  what else can we do i asked laughingly  have you no friends here in the village  none who can give us shelter i replied whereupon the fellow fell silent for an instant and then suddenly wheeling me about with a force that caused me to wince with pain asked abruptly  when last did you see horry sims  i know full well that a gentleman should never tell a lie and have ever contended that under ordinary circumstances it is not only wicked but vile to do so in this case however i knew it would cost pierre and me our liberty perhaps our lives if we held only to the truth therefore i replied as if striving to awaken memories  i believe it was on the morning the britishers seized the horses of the hamilton plantation i saw him on the road at that time  and you can make no guess as to where he may be now  why should we waste our time making such foolish guesses as that pierre demanded as if suddenly grown angry horry sims as you well know is no friend either to fitz hamilton or me although so far as i am concerned he has no reason to be an enemy but because he and fitz are at swords points over politics do i believe i should side with him whom i call my friend  meaning that you deny knowing about where horry may be now abel hunt cried in a threatening tone and pierre straightening himself up to show that he was not afraid of the bully replied in that silky tone of his  meaning to say that that is what i would have you understand master abel hunt  surely in making such answer pierre escaped telling a downright lie for he spoke only the truth  then striving to show myself somewhat at ease in the company of this fellow with whom i had never previously associated i asked him in turn what he was doing and where he counted on spending the night  he gave no heed to my first question but replied to the second by saying  i allow ill stay with you lads till sunrise its a bit lonesome loafing around here alone and like you i know of no place where i can find a bed well hang together as neighbors should  well do nothing of the kind abel hunt i cried hotly i claim the right to choose my own friends  oh you do eh the fellow cried with a coarse laugh well perhaps in this case you havent got any rights at least before allowing it i want to know why you are here and how you happen to be wandering around the camp of an enemy for surely you rebels count the kings soldiers as enemies  i understood on the instant that i had made a mistake in thus speaking angrily but it was too late to make amends as i thought and would have moved on but that pierre said just as abel hunt barred my way by stepping in front of me  i see no reason fitz why even though you may not be friendly with this lad he should not remain with us at least until morning i can well fancy that if he like you and me has no place in which to lay his head this night companionship of any kind would be very sweet at least i know it is with me and with your permission shall welcome him  you will because you dont dare do different hunt cried triumphantly and pierre said with a note of sharpness in his tones  since that is your belief master hunt we will prove to you the contrary and pierre ruffling like a pigeon strode off with a great assumption of dignity i as a matter of course following  when we came upon abel hunt we were going directly toward old marys cabin but now pierre turned at the next corner walking slowly as if simply eager to pass the time and headed in the direction of the river while i kept close by his side mentally bewailing the little lads unlucky desire to learn the location of the guardhouse in which saul was confined  it was possible to see out of the tail of my eye even though i had not heard his footsteps that abel hunt was following less than half a dozen paces behind us and a great fear came into my heart for now i knew he was convinced we had had some hand in the disappearance of horry sims and would act as our shadow in the hope of coming at the secret of the torys whereabouts  there was little chance he would give us an opportunity of slipping into old marys cabin unobserved and i pictured to myself the alarm and distress of uncle rasmus as the hours went by and we failed to put in an appearance  i had come to understand that we must walk the streets of york during all the hours of darkness and what was of far more importance must hold back from performing that task which the jerseyman had set us  there was little hope we would be able to set off in a boat alone and it was quite positive we would not dare do so while hunt was holding us under his eye therefore had we missed an opportunity of serving the cause as well as paved the way perhaps for our own arrest as spies  i turned the matter over and over in my mind as i walked by pierres side in silence asking myself whether this dissolute fellow could gain speech with any of the kings officers and as i asked the question i could answer it full well for he had only to whisper the fact that he could give information as to spies and even my lord cornwallis himself would listen to him  we had come to grief as it seemed to me and what presented itself to my mind as the most painful of all the sorry business was that we had been brought to such a pass by a worthless ignorant lout whom i would not have allowed to linger even in the hamilton stables     chapter xi  a desperate venture   as pierre and i walked aimlessly to and fro without other purpose than to convince abel hunt we were really without a shelter and not daring to hold converse one with another lest he should overhear the bitter thought was in my mind that uncle rasmus must perforce remain in old marys cabin standing guard over the prisoner  i tried to remember how much water we had left in the cabin and finally came to the conclusion that there was less than a quart in the bucket when i last quenched my thirst therefore neither the old negro nor the tory prisoner would have a bit to eat or a sup to drink until we had succeeded in throwing abel hunt off our track  as a matter of course i understood that morgan the jerseyman would visit the cabin late in the evening in order to learn whether we had delivered the message with which he had charged us but although i could find so much of trouble in the future i failed of guessing that we might be forced to remain away from the cabin a full four and twenty hours  it seemed to me positive that long before such time had elapsed abel hunt would weary of acting as our shadow but certain it was that until we had tired him out or something more promising attracted his attention we must keep our distance from uncle rasmus and his prisoner  we had been walking to and fro mayhap ten minutes with the fellow close at our heels and then quickening his pace he came up to my side as he said in a surly tone  i do not believe you are in this village without shelter for the night unless i mistake not your father owns one or more houses here and why should you be forced to walk around it is because you are not willing for me to know where you are stopping which means that there is some of your rebel mischief afoot causing you to fear i may work you harm  it concerns me very little abel hunt what you believe i replied sharply and as for my intent to work mischief it is a dream born in your own evil head  why do you not go to one of your fathers houses he demanded and i replied striving to curb my anger which rose hot against the masterful tone he had dared use to me  it would seem that you have a better knowledge of my fathers property than myself if indeed he does own any houses in york then is it most likely they have been taken possession of by the kings soldiers for my lord cornwallis is not so kindly disposed toward us whom he calls rebels as toward you tories who claim to love the king doing so simply because you hope to profit thereby in the way of money or of safety for your worthless necks  then i pressed forward more quickly to prevent the fellow from walking so close by my side and whether it was chance or because pierre so directed our steps i cannot say the fact is however that we were speedily come out on the river front directly opposite gloucester point and here as if he was legweary little frenchie threw himself on the ground within twenty paces of the waters edge  are you minded to stop here lad i asked in a low tone and he replied with what sounded to me much like an odd inflection of the voice  i have walked around so long fitz that it seems impossible to take another step since we must pass the time in some way twixt now and sunrise why not let it be at this place where we can stretch out at full length and mayhap sleep  thinking you would tire me out eh abel hunt cried he having as a matter of course been so close to our heels that it was possible for him to hear the lightest word  it makes little difference whether we tire you out or you remain near by so that you keep at a respectful distance it is not your following which annoys me but your striving to hug so closely  perhaps i am not good enough for such as you hunt cried angrily and now it was that i ceased striving to hold my temper in check replying in quite as hot a tone as the question had been asked  you have hit exactly upon the truth abel hunt and it is no news to you for from the time i can remember i have ever striven to give you a wide berth because of your breeding  before this war is over it may be that you fitzroy hamilton will regret that you were not bred in different fashion the people of virginia are not all alike and many will hold accountable those who have brought the war into our borders  it was useless to bandy words with the fellow as i understood even though my anger was so great that it would have soothed me somewhat to give him a plain statement of the position he occupied in virginia but i held my peace as i threw myself down by the side of little frenchie counting that the lad would chide me for having had speech with abel hunt instead of so doing he remained silent his head pillowed on his arm as he looked across the river toward the twinkling lights on gloucester point where a portion of lord cornwalliss army was encamped and straightway there came into my mind the thought that the dear lad was striving to cook up some plan which might work to our advantage  it is true that his last scheme had brought us into sore trouble but that was no proof he could not in the future as he had in the past contrive something to our benefit i made no attempt to enter into conversation with him but was content to lie there watching  abel hunt stood shifting uneasily from one foot to the other half a dozen paces distant as if deliberating whether he would have further speech with me on the subject of breeding and i fancied perhaps because i hoped it might be so that he was eager to turn his attention to something more diverting than acting as a shadow to pierre and me  as the time wore on however i began to doubt the correctness of my guess for hunt in turn threw himself down on the ground at full length as if to rest and was seemingly encamped there for the night  when i would have whispered to pierre counting on asking him if we had not best try to escape from the fellow by the quickness of our heels the little lad motioned for me to remain quiet and because of past experience i obeyed him on the instant  now and then a soldier bent on some errand or a sentinel on duty passed by but gave no heed none save abel hunt in all that town of york appeared to fancy that it might be worth while to watch us  then after it seemed as if a full night had passed i heard the sentries call the hour of midnight we must have been there on the river bank not less than three hours and now it was being thus warned of the passage of time that abel hunt began to grow uneasy  watching him out of the tail of my eyes as i lay silent and motionless by pierres side i saw the fellow raise himself on his elbow and look steadily at both us lads as if striving to make out whether we might have fallen asleep and i began to breathe heavily as does one who slumbers soundly whereupon pierre who must also have been taking note of hunts movements followed my example  then the fellow rose to his feet came softly beside us and bent over striving to get a view of our faces even though the night was dark and all the while we gave him fair token of being wrapped in the unconsciousness of slumber  he stood over us a full two minutes striving to make out to his entire satisfaction whether we were asleep or awake and then evidently having come to the conclusion that we were indeed in dreamland he stole softly away  raising my head ever so slightly i noted that he took the direction which would lead him near to my lord cornwalliss headquarters and for the first time since we had come upon the knave did i grow really timorous it needed not any very quickwitted lad to understand what would be the result if even such a dissolute fellow as abel hunt should give information that the son of a wellknown rebel was loitering around the village after nightfall claiming to have no place where he could find shelter  i believe he is going directly to headquarters to make report concerning us i whispered in pierres ear taking good care meanwhile not to move my body lest peradventure hunt might look back and discover that we were not asleep  well there is nothing we can do to prevent him if he be so disposed little frenchie replied indifferently and i exclaimed in surprise  one would suppose that it concerned you very little whereas im not so certain but that the end of it may be a halter for both of us  it really does concern me very little pierre said decidedly i can do nothing to prevent it and cannot afford to spend my time looking for danger in the future because we have that task to do which must be performed even though a dozen like abel hunt were standing ready to accuse us of being spies  what do you mean by that i cried what business have we on hand so urgent  to carry the message with which the jerseyman entrusted us  but that is impossible now hunt had found us out  why do you say that how is it that the meeting with such as abel hunt can prevent us from doing the work of minute boys when it lays at our hand  but how will you leave this town of york when we go to ask permission to take a boat for the purpose of fishing you can depend upon it he will be near at hand and if he has not already done so will then reveal all he knows concerning me  suppose we dont give him that opportunity pierre said thoughtfully suppose we neglect to ask permission from any one to go out to get fish enough to prevent ourselves from starving  how then will you go surely you are not so venturesome as to take to the water on a course to the right of gloucester point when by so doing we must pass the kings vessels the charon is anchored directly on the course we would need to pursue in order to carry out the instructions which have been given  and she would still be there if we waited until daylight and then asked permission from some of these swaggering officers of the king who have no love for any one save themselves  i was mystified by pierres words although surely by this time i should have come to understand that his odd speech betokened the perfecting of a plan and i remained silent as if believing he would make sport of me until two or three minutes had elapsed when abel hunt could no longer be seen in the gloom  then it was that little frenchie suddenly stood upright and pointing to a skiff hauled up on the shore not more than thirty feet from where he lay asked sharply  have you the courage fitz hamilton to embark with me in yonder craft and go down to the gloucester shore where we may remain hidden amid the foliage until it is sufficiently light for us to make out whether any one comes looking for a messenger from the jerseyman  meaning to brave the britishers i cried in something very like alarm  meaning to carry the message which it is necessary should be delivered and without heed whatsoever to these gentry who wear red coats  i have the courage pierre i said after a time of hesitation but have we the right to desert uncle rasmus while he must for his own sake hold horry sims a prisoner and when he has nothing whatsoever to eat or drink in the cabin surely it would be deserting him for us to take boat now and leave the village if peradventure we can do so for there are an hundred chances against our being able to return and only one in our favor it is the same as abandoning uncle rasmus  and if it were abandoning him and saul and every one whom we know yet would i say it was our duty to go because the jerseyman expecting his message to be delivered will give no further heed to sending it into the american lines  although pierres words had fired me and it was possible at any time for the lad to arouse all my enthusiasm and all my bravery when he spoke as he had a moment previous i understood that it was a most dangerous venture which he proposed such as might be tried twenty times over without success  mark you in order to gain the gloucester shore at the point near where the jerseyman claimed we would find someone awaiting us we must sail in our skiff without a pass from my lord cornwallis within hailing distance of the charon or of the guadaloupe both of which vessels lay where their guns could be brought to bear either on york or gloucester and it did not seem to me within the range of possibilities that we could pass either craft without being discovered by the sentries who would undoubtedly order us to come alongside  even though we were minded to be so reckless as to take the chances of disobeying an order it could avail us nothing for pursuit would be given immediately and how might we hope to escape from a vessel of wars boat manned most like by a dozen men we being only two lads not overly well skilled in rowing  i was turning all this over in my mind and becoming more and more convinced each instant that it was the wildest scheme pierre had ever proposed when he turned upon me sharply and asked with a note of anger in his tone  are you afraid to make the venture  there is no lad no nor no man either who shall say i am afraid to do this or that i cried hotly i dare do what any other lad may  then come with me and before daybreak we will be hidden on the gloucester shore  before the day breaks you will be a prisoner on board either the guadaloupe or the charon unless one of the smaller vessels chances to make the capture i said and yet knowing that such must be the case i am minded to follow so you may have fair opportunity of proving that this will turn out even more to our disadvantage than did your plan of getting sight of saul ogden to hearten him and instead come across abel hunt  it is not well fitz that you should harp upon a single failure pierre said softly and on the instant i regretted having spoken there was not in my mind any hope we might be able to aid the lad but i thought by chance he would see us if we passed his prison and know we had not forgotten him if i had asked you to go out for a stroll because i was weary with remaining in the cabin so long you would have followed quite as readily and then should we have come upon abel hunt even as we did  forgive me pierre forgive me i cried remorsefully lead the way and i will go with you readily even though i claim it is a most desperate venture but promise faithfully not to throw it in your teeth however sore the failure may be  the little french lad was not inclined to waste words after i had promised to accompany him but set off at a rapid pace toward where the skiff was lying and i followed having vividly in mind the fact that we were leaving uncle rasmus to what might be a most cruel fate at the same time believing we had deserted saul entirely for there was not in my mind any hope whatsoever we could succeed in reentering the town of york now that the britishers were keeping such sharp watch  even though fortune should favor us in the most remarkable degree we surely would not be tempted to come back to this fortified village during the hours of daylight therefore were we shutting ourselves out until full four and twenty hours passed during which time how much of disaster might have come upon those whom we had the same as abandoned  it was much the same as folly for me to hark back in my mind to all the dangers which might come upon us for i had agreed to follow the lad wheresoever he might lead and for me to dwell upon the probable danger could serve no other end than that of making me timorous therefore it was i strove earnestly to put from my mind everything save the old thought that i would do all within my power to help him carry out his purpose  the lad had not set out toward the boat until the sentry who had been pacing to and fro near us turned to go to the other end of his beat and when we were come to the craft there were none within sight so far as i could make out  she was a light skiff perhaps one of the smallest that could have been found on the shore and had friends been making arrangements for us to do this very work they could not have laid the tools more conveniently at hand for there were two pairs of oars in the craft and it only needed we should shove her ten or twelve paces before she was water borne  i followed pierre over the gunwale kicking at the bank as i did so with sufficient force to send her rocking like an eggshell out into the current  the night was not so dark but that we could see the black tracery of the english ships as they lay at anchor guarding both encampments and unless the sentries on board these vessels of the king were asleep or blind they could not fail of seeing us however wide a detour we might make  i fully expected to hear one of the sentinels on the shore ordering us to come back and show a permit for being aboard at such an hour but no one hailed and we set the skiffs bow on a direct course to that part of the gloucester shore which we hoped to gain giving no heed to his majestys vessels in the way  we cannot hope to pass them without being discovered i said in a low tone as i settled back at the oars putting into them every ounce of strength i could summon  it may be they will let us go on after we have explained our purpose or so much of it as we may be pleased to give pierre said hopefully but even if they turn us back we shall be no worse off than before and will have the satisfaction of knowing that we strove to our utmost to do as the jerseyman desired  we shall be no worse off unless we are sent to share sauls imprisonment in the guardhouse  then i bent my back yet more vigorously at the oars if that could be possible the labor serving in some slight degree to prevent me from dwelling upon the disagreeable possibilities  our course brought us within mayhap an hundred yards of the charons stern and before we were on a line with her came that hail which i had feared to hear  cease rowing  do as they bid fitz it is our only hope pierre whispered and i obeyed him  come alongside and show your pass the voice demanded and i could hear the footfalls of the sentry as he came from amidships aft and leaned over the rail that he might see us more clearly  we have no pass sir pierre said meekly we have been sent over to gloucester with a message from one officer to another on what i count may be private business  come alongside and show the message the same voice demanded  then did i believe that little frenchie was at the end of his rope but instead of showing any confusion or fear he replied cheerily  it is no more than word of mouth that the major of colonel tarletons legion come into york for a supper  the sentry or whoever it might be that had hailed us hung in the wind a moment as if undecided whether to give further orders and then said grudgingly not being minded as i fancied to disgruntle any officers of my lord cornwalliss command  go your way then but make certain to come directly back as soon as the message has been delivered  you can count on our getting into york again as soon as we may pierre replied laughingly and added by whispering to me now lad pull the best you know how and the danger has passed  it was as he said it could only have been blind luck which stationed a credulous and goodnatured sentry of the charon at that particular moment for nineteen men out of twenty would have done their whole duty which was to bring us alongside and report the matter to the officer of the deck  we were not disposed to grumble because the fellow had not done his duty however and when we were beyond earshot i said warningly to the little french lad  you have squeaked out of a mighty small hole pierre but do not let it encourage you overly much for it is not within the bounds of reason that we can take such chances again and have everything turn favorable for us  we wont count on those chances that are in the future fitz hamilton pierre replied cheerily but will hark back on this one remembering that we got thus far on our journey even though we may be turned about within the next five minutes  there was little likelihood we would find any obstacle in the way from this on if so be we landed at a respectful distance from the encampment the vessels in the stream between gloucester and york were evidently supposed by the commanderinchief to be sufficient guard for the waterways and so far as i had been able to learn no small boats patrolled the river  nor did we meet with any the way was open before us and ere yet there were tokens in the eastern sky of the coming of a new day we had pulled the skiff up amid the bushes more than two miles beyond gloucester point  it begins now to look as though we should succeed in delivering the message which the jerseyman wanted sent into the american lines and if that can be done we need concern ourselves no further regarding the outcome for it matters little what happens to two lads like you and me pierre said  i could agree with the first part of the proposition but was not sufficiently stouthearted to say with truth that i was indifferent as to what might befall me because however great a love i had for the cause my affection for fitzroy hamilton and his safe being was much stronger  until the sun had risen we remained within the screen of foliage resting from our labor at the oars but straightway day had fully dawned pierre laid his plans for coming upon this man whom the jerseyman believed would be looking for a messenger by stationing me a quarter of a mile up the bank while he took post about the same distance below  now it is that we must take some chances little frenchie said when we were about to go to our posts of duty it may be that the first who appears will be a tory and we have no means of determining his politics if i see a person who appears by his movements to be watching for some one from the york shore then shall i run the risk of letting him know we are lately come from the village  i understood he would have me do the same and walked slowly along the shore keeping within the line of foliage and thinking meanwhile that as soon as this task had been finished if indeed it ever was we might with good cause seek for food from some plantation nearby for my stomach was crying out loudly that it was time to break fast  well to make what may seem an overly long story as short as possible i will content myself by saying that we two lads remained sometimes out in full view and again amid the foliage where we were partially screened until a good two hours had passed then there came into my view a man with a bit of green in his hat clad somewhat after the fashion of a virginia planter who moved cautiously not seeing me until he was where it would be possible to have a view of york village when he seated himself upon the ground as if on watch  i made no delay in going toward him and fancied he looked more than a little concerned that i should have appeared so suddenly all of which went to strengthen my belief that this was the man whom we were seeking therefore without juggling words i asked him  do you await some messenger from the other shore sir  he looked me over from head to toe before answering and then replied by asking a question  is there any good reason why it concerns you young master if i so wait here  ay sir that it does since i with my comrade who is on watch lower down the shore am come to find some one who awaits a message or we may say who is eager for news  who are you  the son of alexander hamilton whose plantation lies within the bounds of the town of james but who himself is in the american army  did any one send you here  yes we were asked to show ourselves in a boat off the shore but inasmuch as we were forced to sneak out of york it did not seem safe we should make overly much of an exhibition of ourselves  who sent you  tell me first from whom you are expecting a message and then i will answer the question  do you know aught of a man by the name of morgan  then it was that without replying i raised my voice calling pierre by name for now was i positive we had hit upon the man whom the spy would have us see and when little frenchie had replied i explained to the stranger that it was my comrade to whom the message had been delivered and i believed he should have the credit of repeating it ten minutes later the man was scurrying across country at his best speed without having uttered no word of thanks or praise for what we had done no sooner did pierre give that message which the jerseyman had entrusted him with and declared that we had no other information than the fellow wheeled quickly about like a fox who has got the scent of dogs and straightway we were alone looking blankly into each others faces asking mentally whether it might not be possible we had given the jerseymans information to another for it did not seem within the range of possibilities that one of our way of thinking would have received such news and never given sign or word of acknowledgment  i fancy he has only in mind to save his own skin and believes that this shore in the rear of a british encampment is not the safest place in the world for one of his politics pierre said musingly after a brief time of silence we were not told how this man would prove himself to be the one we were sent in search of therefore it cannot be set down to our discredit if we have fumbled the job  and what now i asked moodily almost persuaded because of the movements of the stranger that we had advertised the fact of our serving a spy and the stranger had gone in search of those who would arrest us  we can do no less than stay here until another night has come and before sunset it should be possible to devise some means of passing the english sentries just now however i am inclined to believe we would do well to set out in search of something to eat do you know any of the planters nearabout  not within a dozen miles or more it is quite certain however that many of them nearabout gloucester are tories while others would remain neither for king nor for colony yet i suppose we must take our chances unless we are willing to make breakfast dinner and supper of this pure fresh air  we will make our way to the negro quarters on some plantation pierre said quickly when it comes to trusting a stranger i can put more faith in a black face than a white one  having thus spoken the lad started inland walking swiftly and as if he had both course and destination marked out plainly before him     chapter xii  sauls opportunity   it was destined that we should approach neither white man nor negro in quest of food on this day however severe might be the pangs of hunger for little frenchie had hardly more than began a blind tramp across the country trusting that fortune would bring him to the destination desired when we were startled i should say alarmed by the report of a cannon which rang out startlingly clear on the morning air  as a matter of course we were brought to a sudden halt but before either of us could speak boom boom boom came from the direction of york and with the report of the guns we could see heavy smoke rolling up from the village telling of burned powder  what can it mean i cried fancying like a simple for the moment that this cannonading had somewhat to do with us and pierre quickwitted as ever cried joyously as he turned his face shoreward once more  our people are advancing upon york and the kings soldiers are warning them to keep back  he ran at racing speed through the brush i following as best i might at his heels and all the while came that dull roar of cannon intermingled now and then with sharp crackling noises which i understood to be the rattle of musketry  before we had gained the river bank it was positive our forces had come within touch of the enemy and i who as has already been seen was wholly ignorant of military matters believed the americans were forcing the britishers to a battle  no sooner had we arrived where an uninterrupted view of the river could be had than we saw half a dozen vessels with as many barges coming down the stream as if from the direction of williamsburg and favored by the wind were shaping their course directly toward the gloucester shore on that side the point opposite where we were  then it was that the guns of gloucester joined with those of york and as these heavy pieces were discharged it seemed to me that the very ground trembled while over all hung smoke from the burning powder until it was as if a heavy cloud had suddenly gathered shutting out the light of the sun  this fleet which was coming down the river apparently giving no heed to the kings ships that lay in the stream was hardly more than two miles away and as we lads gazed at the vessels breathlessly trembling with excitement i fancied i could see the uniform of our virginia militia then my heart sank within me for both the guadaloupe and the charon were slipping their cables that they might swing around in such position as to deliver broadsides upon those who were advancing so boldly  there is no good reason why i should not set down now the facts instead of waiting until we came to learn of them later  this fleet which was coming down the york river was manned by a french legion by french marines and by a brigade of virginia militia under general weeden the whole under command of a french officer they had been sent to lay siege to the british encampment at gloucester for our general washington was not minded any of the soldiers under command of lord cornwallis should make their escape now that he held them as one might say in the hollow of his hand  although we could not see anything in the rear of york village we knew full well because of the incessant cannonading that our people must be advancing by land as well as by water and the one question in our minds was whether a battle might be fought that very day for then as can readily be understood we had no idea that a regular siege was to be begun before york  it was when the british vessels slipped their moorings to pour a broadside into the little fleet of americans that pierre laurens saw clear before him the plan which we should follow and running with all speed toward where the skiff had been hidden in the foliage he shouted to me  make haste fitz make haste now is the time when we can gain the village with but little danger of attracting unpleasant notice for while the britishers have their hands full with trying to hold our people back two lads like us may slip in without heed from friend or foe  but why shall we strive to enter york i cried growing timorous once more if there is to be a battle it were safer we stayed here rather than took our chances of being killed by cannon ball or musketshot from our own people  it is not allowed that we shall stay here fitz hamilton pierre cried almost angrily do you forget that uncle rasmus with that tory prisoner of his yet remains in york awaiting our coming and needing us most sorely even though it were certain we would be shot immediately after gaining old marys cabin then are we bound to keep on are we to stay here simply to insure our own safety when saul is in the britishers guardhouse exposed to even as much danger as we would be with uncle rasmus  it was not needed the lad should say more in order to recall me to a sense of duty a red flush of shame came over my face as i realized that i would have played the part of a coward forgetting that there were in york those who needed me and from that instant pierre had no reason to complain because i moved too slowly or failed to display an equal amount of enthusiasm with him  immediately the skiff was water borne we lost no time in setting off on what might prove to be a perilous passage and yet there was none of danger whatsoever in it as we soon came to know  the men on the british ships had sufficient to occupy their attention without giving heed to two lads who pulled against the current making a detour of a mile or more for they were serving their guns with all diligence hoping to check the advance of those rebels who so lacked in reverence to the king and his commands that they made their appearance in warlike array without first having asked permission  the roar of the cannon both from the ships and from my lord cornwalliss encampment was almost deafening and as we tugged at the oars straining every muscle in order to take advantage of each moment of time it seemed to me as if the waters of the river were dashed here and there into waves by the concussions  without losing stroke or ceasing to exert ourselves to the utmost we kept our eyes fixed upon the scene before us and again and again without being aware that i had uttered a cry i shouted aloud in joy and in pride at seeing that little fleet of small craft moving steadily on toward its destination regardless of the heavy shot which were being poured in upon them  so far as we could make out not a british ball hit the mark it is very likely some of the missiles found their way among our people but no severe damage was done else we should have observed it the fleet would have been thrown into confusion had one of the craft been seriously disabled or turned back if they suffered too heavily instead of which however they continued on as i have said seemingly indifferent to the efforts of the enemy  it was a sight well calculated to stir the blood of a boy from virginia and my excitement my admiration for the coolness of our people and the determination shown where the britishers were doing their best to work destruction fired my heart until it was with difficulty i could continue my share of the work at pulling the skiff  unless you can look at what is going on around you and row at the best of your strength at the same time then it is better you close your eyes pierre said sharply when i missed a stroke and thereby nearly threw him from the thwart  i could not have taken my eyes from that which thrilled every nerve in my body but true it is i did succeed in holding to my work at least to such extent that pierre no longer found cause for fault with me and by the time we had reached the bank of the river almost at the same point from which we had embarked the night before the fleet had so far closed in with the land that the kings men did not dare fire upon it from the ships lest they do more damage to their own people on gloucester point then to impudent rebels who had the effrontery to disturb the servants of his majesty  the cannonading from the town still continued now dying away to a single shot every moment or two and again roaring in thunderous notes as battery after battery discharged all its cannon  these people were not firing upon the vessels near by gloucester but straightway up the river and therefore it was we knew our people were coming over the land in considerable force giving no more token of an inclination to halt because of this summons by heavy missiles than had those who manned the fleet  the water front of the village was much the same as deserted when the bow of our skiff grounded on the shore i was too deeply excited to give particular heed to everything within my range of vision but it was to me as if no man stood near at hand to observe our landing and on comparing notes with pierre afterward i learned that he was of the belief that we had come ashore into this encampment of seven thousand soldiers without having been observed  as we made our way up into the village we found that all the troops were in front of us having manned the outermost entrenchments we passed my lord cornwalliss headquarters to find it apparently deserted at the stable lines of the rangers not a single horse stood and my heart went heavy as lead for i realized that poor little silverheels with a redfaced redcoated britisher upon her back was most likely well toward the front where she stood a good chance of being disabled if not killed for by this time pierre and i understood because of the roar of guns in the distance that our people were not remaining silent under this iron hail which the enemy were sending among them  if they keep this up ten minutes longer we shall have no trouble whatsoever in making our way to old marys cabin i cried almost gleefully forgetting in this my moment of triumph when i was pluming myself with having accomplished something heroic although i had simply taken advantage of an opportunity that men a short distance away were lying mangled and in the agonies of death  we can do better than that lad pierre cried catching me by the shoulder as if a sudden thought had just come into his mind look about you as we run and if so be your eyes light upon a pick or an axe seize upon it  to what end i asked panting because of the swift pace which my comrade had kept are you counting on taking part in the battle for then it was i had no doubt but that our people had set about measuring strength with my lord cornwalliss army  yes well fight a battle on our own account and the result shall be the release of saul from the guardhouse im allowing that the sentries are not giving any great attention to prisoners just at this moment and if those who should be outside the prison have pressed toward the front to see what may be going on our chance has come  it did not need that the dear lad should go into the details of what he would do i realized on the instant that even though we were within the enemys encampment there was a possibility we might work our will and no time was wasted  it was reasonable to suppose that the sentries here there and everywhere throughout the village would be pressing toward the front from motives of curiosity if nothing else feeling thoroughly well convinced that no harm could come upon them from the rear  fortune so far favored me as we run that i was speedily armed with an axe which had been left near by a pile of fuel and before we had traveled twenty yards further pierre came upon a pick therefore it was we had all the weapons we needed for an attack upon the guardhouse if so be little frenchie had the same aim in mind which had come to me that is to say to force an entrance through the chimney into the fireplace  then we were come to that house in which the jerseyman had told me our comrade was confined and i thickheaded as usual would have begun an attack upon the chimney without delay for we had approached the building from the rear but before i could strike the first blow little frenchie grasped me by the arm as he whispered warningly  would you take the risk of spoiling everything by going to work blindly we must first learn if there be sentries on the other side  then leaving me standing motionless and silent covered with confusion because of having shown myself such a simple he went cautiously around the house moving with as much care and deliberation as if having full knowledge that a squad or more of redcoats were on guard and i awaited his return my heart thumping so violently that it was as if the pulsations vied in volume of sound with the reports of the cannon  when next i saw pierre he approached from the opposite side of the house thus showing that he had made a complete circuit of the place and the expression on his face told as clearly as words could have done that we might set about our task without delay for there were none near at hand to stay us  without waiting for him to speak i struck my axe into the structure of sticks and clay with such force that it was buried to the head and i could not release the tool until little frenchie had aided by tearing away some of the fabric with his pick  haste is like to make waste pierre reminded me in a half whisper unless we get about this work with somewhat of system we shall make but little headway and no one can say how soon the sentries may remember that it is their duty to stay here on guard instead of watching the advance of the rebels  i would have been a dull lad indeed had i not come by this time to understand that it was pierre laurens who should take the lead when he and i were working together therefore i stood back leaving him to begin the task and striking with my axe when he directed me so to do  before we had succeeded in cutting a hole as large as a mans hand i heard a voice from the inside which i believed to be sauls crying excitedly  who are you that are striving to enter there should be a sentinel just outside the door and unless you take due care he will give an alarm  saul saul its pierre and fitz i cried no longer able to restrain myself and little frenchie clapped his hand over my mouth on the instant saying angrily  is it not enough that you have opportunity to work your will even here in the midst of the enemys encampment but that you must raise your voice to give notice of what you would do it matters little whether saul knows it is us who are here or that he waits until we have effected an entrance  while he spoke pierre was working industriously having taken his hand from my mouth after leaving it there sufficiently long to give token that he intended it for a reproof and from that moment until sounds from the inside told that whoever was held prisoner had been on his part aiding in the work i held my peace watching little frenchies every movement determining never again until we were out of this village would i raise my voice until he had given permission  whether we worked there at tearing a hole through the chimney five minutes or thirty i have no idea around us yet roared the cannon telling that the american forces were still advancing and the britishers striving to hold them back ever present in my mind was the knowledge that at any moment the guard might come up and take us into custody  illustration the release of saul ogden  one can well understand in what a tumult was my brain and how like a flood in springtime the blood leaped through my veins i was like as one held in the grip of a raging fever until from out that aperture which we had made in the flimsy chimney i saw saul ogden looking considerably the worse for his short imprisonment come crawling until it was possible for me to clasp him in my arms where for an instant i held him fast tears of gratitude rolling down my cheeks because of having been permitted thus to have taken some little part in the dear lads release  there were other prisoners than saul in the guardhouse and as can be supposed they were not backward in taking advantage of the opportunity to make their escape from imprisonment even though they were redcoats but as the first soldier came on the heels of saul pierre raising his pick threateningly ordered the man to stop  remain where you are or your death will pay the penalty he cried and there was that in his tones which told it would not be safe to disobey him  if you are willing to let one out why not another the britisher asked an expression of perplexity coming over his bloated red face which gave token that he had been brought into the guardhouse through drunkenness  because i dont intend it shall be within your power to work us harm  why should i work you harm the halfdrunken soldier asked as he lay on his belly in the aperture looking up at the small lad  you are a british soldier who has come here to work the kings will on us of virginia and we are minded to make our escape before you can atone for your misdeeds by making us prisoners pierre cried hotly  i have no mind to take anybody prisoner be he rebel or whatsoeer you will for now the fight is going on and by joining my troop this little slip of mine which landed me in the guardhouse is like to be forgiven if not forgotten  stay where you are until we get well away for we have been taught not to put overly much faith in what you men who wear red coats may say pierre cried and at the same time he motioned for saul and me to go our way which we did without delay knowing the lad would follow close at our heels  saul had kept a tight grip on my hand from the moment he came into the open air and we two ran side by side thus yoked together by token of friendship on the alert for the first show of a red coat in our path  it seemed to me that we might have raced around and around that village until we were spent with the exertion and never have come upon one of the kings men for they rushed into the outer works at the first alarm officers soldiers campfollowers and even the sentries all of them most like believing it would only be necessary for them to give token of being ready for battle in order to make the americans turn tail in terror  surely this time they were making a grievous mistake for the fire from the front was continued with vigor as i understood full well before we were a dozen yards from the guardhouse for then a cannon ball came so near to me that i could feel the wind of it and i started back in surprise as if having supposed that our people had been firing blank cartridges  saul laughed at my show of fear and asked as though he found something comical in the situation  did you think that amid all this noise there were no shots flying  to tell the truth saul ogden i havent had time to think since the cannonading began then pierre and i were on the gloucester shore having made up our minds it would be useless to try to get into york before another night had come when we found it might be possible as has been proven such a fever of excitement seized upon me that i have had no clear knowledge of what has been going on  it seems that you knew sufficient to understand the moment had come when you might set me free the lad said in a tone of exultation and i determined that the credit should go where it belonged replied promptly  it was not me saul ogden who was quickwitted enough to think that we might find the guardhouse without sentries around it pierre laurens is the one to whom your release is due and save for him i dare venture to say at this moment i would be with you inside the widow marshalls house with redcoated sentinels standing guard over me  why how what has happened since i have been shut up yonder  it was no time for story telling just then as saul must have understood for the first cannon ball which had reminded me that there was danger in the air and that danger coming from the ranks of our own army was followed by another and another until while we ran it seemed as if we were actually being pursued by these missilesas if there was a force in the air to guide them out of a direct course to where they might work destruction  by this time pierre had overtaken us for the lad could ever run more swiftly than either saul or i and seizing me by the arm as if i was a child who needed guidance shouted in a tone of triumph even amid all that peril  if any one had told us when abel hunt was following so close at our heels that we might have worked this trick it would have seemed like a fairy tale and yet we have come through thus far in safety with every chance of gaining old marys cabin unmolested  if so be we get in the path of one of these messengers i said motioning toward a cannon ball which was ploughing up the earth not twenty yards away then shall we find that we have been molested for all time  if we have worked our will in this encampment of my lord cornwalliss we two lads alone then i predict that we shall come through in safety at least so far as this work is concerned what may happen before the battle is ended i care not so that we have kept faith with those who waited for us  it can thus be seen that pierre quickwitted and versed in military matters though he was believed as did i that this cannonading betokened a regular battle whereas as we afterward came to know it was simply the investment of york the beginning of a regular siege  there is no good reason why i should use many words in telling of that flight across the village although again and again were we in danger of death from the missiles sent by the americans even though i might make an interesting story of that which we saw and feared but it is enough that we were finally arrived at our destination  i who at the end of the race was leading the way dashed into the cabin without realizing the alarm that i might thus cause uncle rasmus but i understood instantly i was inside that it would have been better had i entered in a more seemly fashion for the old negro leaped to his feet his black face grey with the pallor of fear believing from my sudden noisy entering that the enemy had come to work him harm  because of the dim light in the cabin it was a dozen seconds before he could distinguish our faces and then while we three stood in front of him he sank back in the chair where he had so long played the part of invalid trembling in every limb as he said in a quavering voice  bress de lawd bress de lawd for all his mercies here am de chillun come back when i neber expected to see dere faces agin  saul in his delight clasped the old man around the neck hugging him as affectionately as though he had been of the same color and of the same blood but pierre cautious and thoughtful as ever instead of spending his time calming uncle rasmus when there was no real need of doing so began looking around to find horry sims  even though a battle might be raging on the outside it was yet of vital importance to us that the tory be held prisoner because his escape might mean our death if so be the fortunes of war allowed the britishers a breathing spell  pierre ran hurriedly to the corner of the room where we had last seen the tory cur lying and an exclamation of dismay burst from his lips for the lad was not there hearing the cry i ran toward him whereupon he turned to uncle rasmus asking sharply  where is he has he given us the slip who has been here since we went away  de sims boy am safe honey uncle rasmus replied as saul released his hold on the old mans neck i clare for it i done got scared kase you didn come back an lowed it wouldnt do no ways to keep dat young snake whar he could kick up a row ef any ob de kings sogers come in so i done put him away honey i done put him away  put him away uncle rasmus i cried in alarm do you mean to say that you killed horry sims  kill him chile sure not what for i kill him  but where is he pierre demanded and i understood from the quick nervous tones that he had been equally alarmed with me by the old mans words  for reply uncle rasmus went to that end of the room near the fireplace where he raised a short length of the flooring and there we who gathered around in breathless anxiety saw horry sims lying upon the earth bound as we had left him in a narrow space between the puncheons which had evidently at some time been hollowed out as an apology for a storeroom  how did you get him down there uncle rasmus i cried for i had not believed the old man sufficiently strong to perform such a task  i done roll him ober chile i done roll him ober don you see honey i didn dare keep him whar de sogers might see him so ise boun to get him out ob sight id seen dat yere hole befo an sence de shootin begun i low he was mighty glad to be under cover  cant you take me out of here horry asked imploringly ive been tied up so long that my legs and arms are numb and aching i promise not to open my mouth and to do whatsoever you say if these ropes can be taken off for ever so short a time  thats what they shall be pierre said quickly we have no desire to cause you suffering horry sims and never counted on being forced to remain away so long but matters couldnt have been changed for of course we must think of our own safety before consulting your comfort now however you will have a chance to move around  as he spoke so pierre did and when i would have argued with him that it was unsafe to let the tory lad have the freedom of the cabin even while all of us were there to guard him he shut me up in short order by declaring that unless we were disposed to give the prisoner something like fair treatment he would insist on setting him free altogether  and when abel hunt has found us out as i believe of a verity he will then horry is on exhibition where that meddlesome fellow may see him i cried hotly but pierre giving no heed to my words released the tory from his bonds     chapter xiii  the siege   for some moments after pierre released horry sims from the bonds which had held him so securely the tory was literally unable to move hand or foot thus giving good proof of the suffering which must have been his while he lay beneath the puncheon planks of the floor powerless to command his body save in the way of breathing  after having chafed his limbs until the circulation of blood was partially restored the prisoner limped over into the corner where pierre and i had left him when we set out upon that stroll which resulted so differently from our expectations and there he crouched upon the floor as if intent on showing us that he would remain a willing captive as a matter of fact i believe the lad was more terrified by the cannonading which yet continued and seemingly shook the very ground beneath our feet than he was by the knowledge that we held him in our power  and it was terrifying whether for tory or whig far more so than if we had been in the open where it might be possible to see all that was going on or if we were taking part with the troops but to remain shut up in the cabin not knowing how near death might be to us and fearing each instant lest our frail shelter should be torn to splinters by a cannon ball was something that got on ones nerves more i dare venture to say than any other danger  during the first two or three minutes after the excitement of meeting with uncle rasmus had died away there were times when it seemed well nigh impossible for me to so far control myself as to remain indoors it was as if i must go out as if i must face that danger which seemed so imminent as if i could not meet death while being all ignorant of how it might come to me  it was well perhaps that pierre started a conversation by asking uncle rasmus how he had passed the hours of our absence and i believe little frenchie did this rather in order to take our minds from what was going on around us than because he really desired information  the old negro told us in his peculiar way of awaiting our coming with whatsoever of patience he could summon believing each instant we would enter and then as the hours wore on fear as was quite natural took possession of him he could not imagine any combination of circumstances which would keep us abroad so long save we had fallen into the hands of the enemy most like arrested as spies before morning came he was convinced that such must have been the case and the only hope he had of learning what had befallen us was in the coming of morgan but there was a fear that he might have been taken in our company and would therefore share our fate  i done got terribly flustered up chillun an dats a fac kase i counted i wasn eber gwine to see youse any mo dere was one spell jes fore daybreak when i got it inter my min dat dere was nuffin lef fo de ole nigger to do but skitter out ob dis yere village an it was mighty uncertain whether he could get out ob it or not  in that case what did you count on doing with horry sims pierre asked  i done made up my min to leabe him sittin up in de chair by de winder kase i couldn take him wid me an it wouldnt hab done no how to let him go gallivantin roun from one ob dese yere ossifers to de odder tellin em what had happened to him  then the old man painted with painful vividness the hunger and thirst which had come upon him with the morning after he had decided it would be impossible for him to make his way through the lines he repeated what horry sims had said while begging for food or for water and added with an odd grimace  i clare for it chillun i got right mixey wid horry eben ef he is a tory kase de lad was sumfin to talk wid an i was carried away wid fear till it seemed as ef i was boun to keep my tongue runnin else id gone crazy  you didnt get so mixey with him uncle rasmus but that you finally dumped him under the floor pierre added with a laugh and the old man chuckled as he replied  i done tell you how dat was honey de mixier i got wid him de more afraid i growed bout his gibin me de slip or in case any ob de kings sogers come in an was curious to know what i had covered up wid de blanket it seemed like i couldn bear de sight ob de boy an yet i wanted to keep talkin wid him all de time i done splained dat dere wasn anyting to eat or drink in de house an dat wed hab to go hungry an thirsty till de genman from jersey come to look arter us den dere come inter my min dat yere hole in de floor what ole mary dug sos to keep de milk an de butter fresh an how your uncle rasmus did toddle roun gettin de chile inter it i ain half so shaky as ise been tryin to make out since we come here to york but it seemed like my backbone wasn stiff enuf for de job id tackled when i got hol ob horry sims an he tried to hang back howsomeever he got in dar an i covered de plank ober an den i went back to de winder an i mourned an i mourned an i mourned for my chillun what i lowed was in de hans ob de britishers  then the old man as if overcome by the remembrance of his suffering gave way to tearless grief when he trembled like one in an ague fit covering his face with his wrinkled hands and rocking his body to and fro until i perforce knelt by the chair to soothe him  again did little frenchie come to the relief of us all by changing the subject of the conversation once more and this time he called upon saul to explain how it was he had been taken prisoner and confined in the guardhouse  strange though it may seem i had had no curiosity concerning this matter from the time we set him free perhaps because there was so much of excitement and confusion everywhere around but now i turned from uncle rasmus to gaze at my cousin eagerly so impatient to hear his story that i could hardly control myself until he was ready to begin  of course i knew you would insist on being told of all that happened he said gravely hesitating now and then in his speech and the thought that i must confess my folly caused me greater pain i believe than did the knowledge of being held prisoner in that guardhouse with half a dozen halfdrunken soldiers as companions it was a case of giving way to my temper and the sooner i admit the fact the better perhaps i shall feel  with whom did you quarrel i asked curiously surprised by the possibility that any british soldier should have condescended to squabble with a country lad  with abel hunt saul replied and pierre and i leaped to our feet as if moved by a powerful spring  abel hunt and that scoundrel had followed us knowing what he did about saul without saying anything whatsoever concerning the lad but striving to find where we were lodged so he might work yet further mischief  as this came into my mind i realized that the danger which menaced us was greater than i feared for abel hunt having met saul and compassed his imprisonment knew also that we were in the village it was not within the bounds of probability that he could even guess of our visit to the gloucester shore but he would spare no labor to lay us by the heels as spies he had shown himself deep that villain hunt deeper than i ever believed was possible for until this instant i had set him down as one almost lacking in mental ability  tell us how the quarrel came about pierre said quickly we also have seen somewhat of this abel hunt and it may be we need to know more about him without loss of time in order to protect ourselves if indeed there be any protection for us in this british camp  you have had to do with abel hunt saul cried in astonishment does he know that you two lads are here  that he does i replied he followed us until midnight after we told him we had no shelter and were forced to sleep out of doors if we slept at all  did he tell you of meeting me  never a word and it is that very thing which troubles me pierre cried more excited than i had ever yet seen him he knew that if he said aught against you or confessed to having had a hand in making you a prisoner there would be no possible chance of our confiding in him or be frightened into telling that which he sought to learn now go on with the story lad and quick  there is not much more to tell when i say that i met with abel hunt we came together nearabout the quarters of the rangers where i stood hoping to get a glimpse of the mare and daring to take me by the arm as if he were my equal he demanded to know what i did there in the british camp then it was i forgot myself allowing my temper to get the best of me and instead of speaking him fairly because of the circumstances i threatened he should be flogged by one of my uncles negroes in the slave quarters for daring to thus accost me it stands to reason that i realize now how foolish was this course for i might have put him off or answered his question after my own fashion and later when there were not so many kings lovers around i could have had him punished but instead i lost control of myself as i have said and i believe my actions pleased the scoundrel he taunted me with being a rebel and otherwise strove to set yet further flame to my anger until forgetting all else having lost to mind the danger in which you lads would be placed i struck at the fellow knocking him down much to my satisfaction  in a twinkling he had me by the legs while yet lying upon the ground and cried out for the guard declaring he was being murdered and otherwise making as much disturbance as half a dozen could have made if they were being whipped to death then as a matter of course the guard came up abel hunt who seemed to be on a friendly footing with some of the redcoats explained that i a rebel had attempted to win him over to the side of the whigs and failing had set upon him with intent to kill  there was little need for him to have made so many charges against me the fact that i had been so bold as to make a disturbance nearabout the quarters of the high and mighty officers of my lord cornwallis was in itself enough to warrant me lodgings in the guardhouse and before many seconds had passed i was thrust into that filthy place where i was fed on bread with now and then a slice of bacon and no more than half enough of the river water to quench my thirst  i knew full well that you lads would leave no stone unturned until you had learned of my whereabouts and i was also well convinced you could do nothing whatsoever to aid me therefore it was i strove to remain in that horrible place content and succeeded in a measure until the cannon began to roar when i cried aloud with joy for i believed our people were giving battle to cornwalliss army although how that might advantage me unless they gained such a victory as to take all the redcoats prisoners i could not have said  when you struck the first blow against the chimney of the house i knew as well as if i had seen your dear faces that you fitz and you pierre were there taking advantage of the cannonading to rescue me but even as i rejoiced i mourned because of believing you would speedily be made prisoners like myself it never came into my mind that the redcoats would leave even the prisons without a guard in order to man the entrenchments there is no more to be said for you know the rest and now i am asking what about abel hunt  the question which saul asked was in pierres mind as well as mine for now did it seem as if our end was near at hand there was no probability he could effect anything now while the britishers were striving to beat back our people but as soon as the firing ceased and by this time we had come to understand that it was not a battle which was being fought but an attempt on the part of the britishers to prevent our forces from gaining a foothold near the towni say when the firing ceased and the officers were at liberty to take heed to their own affairs in the encampment what might it not be possible for abel hunt to accomplish  he knew that saul was here that he was my cousin and most like that the horses on the hamilton plantation had been seized therefore would have been even more dull than i fancied if he failed to put together the story in such a manner as to convince himself that both pierre and i were in york for some purpose other than that of curiosity  in fact if he should tell no more than he already knew without attempting to add to the story in any way that officer who listened to him could and with good reason have set it down as a fact that we had remained in the village to act the part of spies after which straightway every building in the village would be searched  all of us even if we take horry sims might make our escape by the river while the cannonading continues i cried eagerly having but the one idea of making our escape without loss of time we had no difficulty either in coming here or tearing away the chimney of the guardhouse therefore does it stand to reason we can get to the river bank without being seen the skiff still remains where we left her i have no doubt and by moving quickly we may be out of this trap and at our home in james town within two hours  why are you so eager to leave york pierre asked in a peculiar tone and i failing wholly to understand what the little french lad was driving at replied promptly  because of the danger we incur by remaining here  and was it not you fitz hamilton who counted that we should call ourselves minute boys with the idea that at some time perhaps we could enlist more in our ranks until we had formed a company  well and what if i did propose such a foolish thing  you have allowed it to be understood among us that you considered yourself bound to perform the part of a minute boy  and what then i cried angrily  why then at some time in the future it might be said that you lads from virginia made bold talk as to what you would do as minute boys and began the work but when danger menaced you turned tail to take refuge under your mothers apron how would such a story as that match with what is already well known the lads of new york of boston and of other places have done for the cause had they banded themselves together as you and saul and i agreed to do and then shown the white feather it would have been known throughout all the thirteen colonies by this time and yet we of virginia must be the first to act the cowardly part  if pierre had taken a horsewhip to me he could not have cut the flesh more deeply than he cut my heart by these words when i proposed to make our way out of york going to my own home there was no thought in my mind that the act could in any way have the appearance of cowardice it was simply before me that with abel hunt ready to give information and we shut up where a search of half an hour must surely reveal our whereabouts it was simply our duty to go away if so be that were possible  now however after the little french lad had spoken i would have stood in that village baring my breast to all those lovers of the king allowing them to do whatsoever they might with my body rather than take the first step toward escaping and pierre must have seen by the expression on my face somewhat of that which was in my heart for coming up to me closely and caressing my arm in that old familiar manner he said soothingly  i did not count to give you pain fitz hamilton but only said that which was in my mind with the idea of preventing you from carrying out any plan that might cause you deepest pain in the future far be it from me to accuse you of being cowardly for i have seen you advance when you were afraid to do so and he who can control himself under such circumstances may be counted a brave lad  while we had been talking the cannonading ceased gradually until by the time pierre was done with his efforts to soothe me comparative silence prevailed straightway we lads forgot all else in the desire to know what had been done whether our people had retreated or if the britishers had fallen back and i was on the point of proposing that i go out to get an idea of the situation when the door suddenly opened and to our great surprise and delight the jerseyman flung himself headlong into the room as if he had run until so exhausted that he could no longer remain on his feet  we closed the door behind him speedily as you can well imagine and then barricaded it to the best of our ability after which we darkened the windows with blankets lest some curiously inclined soldier might pass that way and see who was our visitor  we had no water with which to refresh him therefore it was we could only wait until he was in a measure revived for strong though the man had appeared to be now was he apparently on the verge of exhaustion his face was powderstained as if he had been doing full share in holding back our people and his clothing torn and rent showing token of some desperate struggle  not until four or five minutes had elapsed during which we knelt by the side of the man unable to give him any aid did he recover some portion of his strength and then he said speaking indistinctly because of his heavy breathing  there is nothing to cause alarm the enemy have not discovered who i am but yet would i hide myself here with the hope of being able to make my way through the lines this night  but with whom have you been fighting i cried pointing to his trousers which literally hung in rags  that was done in the trenches when seeing as i believed an opportunity to get into our lines and having as companion only a wounded britisher i strove to make my escape but he suspecting what i would do grappled with me the fellow had more strength than i gave him credit for because he held me in good play and before i succeeded in overcoming him there were so many redcoats around that i dare not make the attempt  then he knows that you are a spy and will give information to cornwallis i exclaimed my voice trembling with excitement and the jerseyman replied gravely  he may have suspected and probably did but never can he carry information to any officer  then it was i understood the man was dead but whether killed by the jerseyman or by his wounds i knew not nor did i dare make inquiries  why did you come in such hot haste pierre asked anxiously you must have run at full speed from the farthermost outworks  so i did lad two of us were sent to headquarters to bring up some horses and i outstripping the fellow who went with me decided on making my way here believing now the village is so closely besieged that i would not have another opportunity of getting through the lines  but what about the morrow after you are missed or tonight when you fail to answer to the roll call  they may say of me what they please so that i remain here hidden until midnight when i shall take my life in my hands counting not the cost of the venture if i may finish the work in this town of york which i began so long ago  i could not then understand why it was morgan spoke as if this might be his last opportunity to desert from the british lines but all of us soon came to have a very good idea as to the reason when he explained what had happened  and now instead of endeavoring to set down the matter in his words and lest i should make a mistake in repeating them let me write here that which i read in plain print some time after the colonies had won their freedom from the king it was written by one who strove to tell all that had happened without taking either the whig or tory side and so far as i have been able to learn is true concerning what took place in that village of york up to the close of this day of which i am writing  cornwallis with the main division of his army occupied york town the main body of his troops were encamped on the open ground in the rear of the town lieutenantcolonel dundas who did good service at james town occupied gloucester with about seven hundred men and was joined by lieutenantcolonel tarleton and his men shortly before the siege began  the combined armies of the americans about twelve thousand strong left williamsburg by different roads and marched toward york town the french legion a squadron of french marines and a brigade of virginia militiamen were sent to invest gloucester while the remainder of the forces kept on toward the british encampment on their approach the british left their fieldworks and withdrew to those near the town the american light infantry and a considerable body of french troops were ordered to take possession of these abandoned works and serve as a covering party for the troops while digging trenches and casting up breastworks cannonading of the town and one or two sorties occurred during the day  colonel alexander scammel officer of the day while reconnoitering near the fusileers redoubt situated on the river bank at the mouth of a stream on the extreme left was surprised by two or three hessian horsemen he surrendered but they shot him and left him for dead  when the place was completely invested by the allied armies their lines extended in a semicircle at a distance of nearly two miles from the british works each wing resting on the york river the french troops occupied the left the americans the right while count de grasse with his fleet remained in lynn haven bay to beat off any naval force which might come to the aid of cornwallis  on the extreme left of the besieging army were the west india regiments under st simon next to them were the french light infantry regiments the french artillery and the quarters of the two chiefs occupied the center on the right across a marsh were the american artillery under general knox the virginian maryland and pennsylvania troops under general steuben the new york rhode island and new jersey troops with sappers and miners under general james clinton the light infantry under lafayette and the virginia militia under governor nelson the quarters of general lincoln were on the banks of wormeleys creek on the extreme right  all this as i have said was told us by morgan while he lay on the floor of old marys cabin but i dared not trust my memory to make an attempt at repeating his words therefore it is i have copied it from the printed account although by so doing have seemed to advance the time by giving the position of the besieging army for they did not occupy the quarters as here set down until the following day  now we understood else had we been thickheaded indeed that york was to be besieged to the end that none of my lord cornwalliss force might escape and how many days must pass before the proud britisher would be willing to surrender no man could say  these facts caused me no little anxiety of mind and i saw plainly by the expression on pierres face that he was deeply disturbed as indeed he had good reason to be all us lads even though we were not experienced in warfare knew that during the time of siege it would be next to impossible for any person to make his way into the american camp from the village because the outer works would be heavily manned night and day and every redcoated soldier be on the alert to prevent information being carried to the socalled rebels  in the meantime we must hide in the besieged town holding our prisoner with us but now that the british army was drawn more closely together and we as a matter of course more nearly surrounded by the soldiers did it seem a matter of impossibility we could remain undiscovered any very great length of time  in addition to this danger which it seemed to me was so great as to overshadow all else was the fact that while we were in hiding we must contrive in some way to supply ourselves with food and how might that be done save at the expense of revealing the fact that old marys cabin had other occupants than the decrepit negro and a lad who had come to care for him  before the siege was begun it needed but little proof to convince the kings officers that whosoever was charged with being a spy was guilty and now that the village was invested with the americans pressing hotly for every advantage the lightest whisper would be sufficient to bring one who had spoken or moved indiscreetly to the gallows  as i brooded over these things it seemed to me as if we were already within the shadow of the valley of death with no way of escape save over the dark river into the beyond  certain it is that even morgan shared in the forebodings which i have here set down otherwise he would not have taken the chances of remaining hidden in the cabin until midnight and propose then to venture his life as the price of being discovered while striving to creep through the lines  he himself had said that this was the last opportunity poor though it might prove to get word to our people and he must also have realized all the dangers that would menace us when another day was come and the kings soldiers settled themselves down to the task of holding their enemy in check  that which made the situation seem to me more painful more intolerable was the fact that there was no longer any possibility we could be of service to the cause by thus remaining in york yet we were bound to stay for the very good reason that there was no hope of getting away  i could not bring myself to believe we had accomplished aught of good by coming into this village of york it seemed to me matters would have been better for all concerned had we remained on the hamilton plantation and yet master morgan was so kind as to say before that day had come to a close that when he had speech with any of our generals he should take good care to give us due praise for what we had done  even though it had been nothing more than carrying the message to williamsburg and repeating my words to the man on the gloucester shore then would you lads have good reason to be proud the jerseyman said when i asked petulantly what we who called ourselves minute boys had done deserving of praise without you i should have been forced to leave the lines some time ago and thanks to your being here it is now possible for me to give accurate information as to all the defenses  that is providing you get through the lines alive saul said grimly and the jerseyman added  i count on getting through with sufficient of life remaining to be able to tell my story but if peradventure i am shot this side the entrenchments then i conjure you lads as you love your country to risk everything you hold most dear in the effort to communicate with our people value your lives as nothing the greatest suffering you can endure as a pleasure so that you may be able before another day has come to a close to describe in detail that which you have seen     chapter xiv  an ugly situation   after morgan had finished telling us what would be our duty in case he gave up his life while trying to get through the lines then came a discussion as to how it would be possible for us to procure food  with abel hunt at liberty roaming around the village seeking us out and most like counting to denounce us as rebels it was in the highest degree dangerous for any member of our company to venture forth from the cabin lest we come upon that fellow whom i doubted not was bent solely on doing us a harm  why he should have turned his attention to such end i cannot well say save it might be that he fancied it was the best way to curry favor with the british officers neither saul nor i had done anything to make of the fellow an enemy it is true we did not associate with him and i question whether that could have rankled in his breast because he knew full well that lads of our standing would not stoop to such a thing  however it might be certain it was as i set it down in my own mind that after we had met him the night before he would leave no stone unturned to bring us into trouble and it would not be a difficult matter for him to learn from some of the tory citizens of york who yet remained in the village which of the buildings were owned by my father  having come to know that this cabin belonged to the hamilton plantation there was every reason to believe hunt would watch it closely therefore for any one of us three lads to venture out even though we might be starving would be much the same as advertising him of our whereabouts  certain it was that the jerseyman could not aid us in this extremity for he must remain even more closely hidden than we lest he be prevented from making the desperate attempt he counted on as soon as night had come  i see no other course than for pierre laurens to set his wits at work striving to find some way out of this trouble i said after we had talked together as you might say at random without having arrived at any definite conclusion since we came into this village of york pierre has shown himself ready of thought and has pulled us out of more than one hole if he cannot devise some means to procure food save at the expense of bringing abel hunt down upon us then will i say it is useless to attempt it but that we must either starve or take the poor chances of trying to follow master morgan through the lines which would be much the same as death  but why should we be so certain this cabin is likely to be watched saul asked in a tone of irritation why may we not say to ourselves in good truth that after you and pierre met abel hunt  who is it calls on abel hunt a familiar voice from the outside cried causing the blood to run chill in my veins and almost at the same instant the door was burst open the flimsy barriers we had set against it being of no avail as opposed to the strength of him who threw all his strength upon it  we sat there like statues and i dare say fear was written on every face even on that of the jerseymans when abel hunt in his bullying way strode into the center of the room and stood there gazing around at us as if to say we were at his mercy and would obey his lightest word because we dared not do otherwise  as for myself i was literally paralyzed with fear that man who could do us more mischief in this town of york than any other had found out our hiding place and what was even worse had seen in our midst as if taking council with us a british soldier for master morgan still retained so much of his uniform that it might be readily distinguishable  my limbs trembled as if i was suffering from an attack of the palsy and in my great terror i saw no way to counteract this last stroke of misfortune i could bring to mind no act of ours which would tend to relieve us from the danger that menaced and i might almost fancy that at his heels he had brought a squad of redcoated soldiers to carry us off to prison from which we would emerge only to stand under the gallows  involuntarily i glanced toward pierre for the little french lad had ever shown himself of such ready wit that in time of great danger all my hopes were centered in him and again did i have cause for fear the lad keeping his eyes fixed upon abel hunt that he might watch his every movement as a cat watches the movements of a mouse with which she is playing was slowly yet surely moving around the room toward the door and in my folly i said to myself that we were in such desperate straits that pierre laurens was not only willing but striving to give us the slip  although knowing him so well i imagined that he like me was well nigh overcome with terror and intent only on saving his own skin without giving heed to whatsoever might come upon his companions  during a single instant my eyes fell upon the jerseyman and i saw what i fancied was already pictured plainly on my own face until he like me had a glimpse of pierre then it was as if a wave of satisfaction and approbation passed over his features whereupon he turned to abel hunt who still stood in the center of the room grinning in triumph at each of us in turn and began to engage him in conversation  it seemed to me that the jerseyman uttered the words of a foolish person when he said to the grinning fellow who was burning to humiliate and bring us to our death  there is no good reason hunt for such i gather to be your name why you should not sit down let us discuss the situation i admit that you have caught us foul but there is no need to hasten affairs and we may as well speak of the matter among ourselves while there is yet time for i am of the belief that it may be mended  youll mend nothing with me you renegade britisher abel hunt snarled i looked to find a nest of rebels here but didnt count they would be harboring a traitor such as you give token of being  why should you call me a traitor the jerseyman asked calmly and much to my astonishment yet even at that moment when i was both terrified and perplexed i noted that he gave more heed to pierre laurens than to the man with whom he was talking  why should i not give you the name of traitor abel growled you still wear part of the kings uniform and it must be you have turned against him else why do i find you consorting with rebels  it may be i am striving to lead them from the error of their ways master morgan said with a smile and then it was i saw uncle rasmus pulling his chair forward at the same time shaking his fist at horry sims in token that he should remain in the corner  dont think to blind my eyes hunt screamed dont fancy that soft words will butter any parsnips with me ive got you all under my thumb now and count on keeping you there  all of which you know to be a lie the jerseyman said still speaking quietly but fixing the fellow with his eye as if to hold closely his attention  as a matter of course these words were amply sufficient to arouse hunt to the highest pitch of anger and on the instant he seemed to give no heed to any save the one who had insulted him  you shall live to repent those words and die regretting them he snarled  why dont you cause me now singlehanded to regret them morgan asked threateningly rising to his feet as he spoke as if expecting an attack and abel hunt literally shrieked in his anger  because there is no need why i should spend my strength on one who lays so near the gallows as do you i count on turning you over to those officers of the king who will deal out such justice as you have earned instead of spending my time flogging a traitor who deserves more the halter  now it was when it seemed to me as if master morgan was trying to provoke a roughandtumble fight that i began thickhead though i was to have an inkling that some plan which had been concerted without the aid of words was on foot for as soon as abel gave way to anger old rasmus moved his chair yet further forward until it stood as a barricade in front of the door while pierre held in his hands by one leg a stool handling it as if it were a weapon  if you have aught against me and are not a coward you will try it out now and here instead of hiding yourself behind the skirts of the kings soldiers the jerseyman cried as if he no longer held control over his temper and at the same time he advanced a step toward hunt as if to grapple with him  the cowardly fellow fell back before morgan but dared not take his eyes from the jerseyman because of fearing that a blow might be delivered back back slowly pace by pace he retreated morgan advancing with clenched fist and then against uncle rasmuss chair the fellow came at full force half toppling over  then it was that i understood all the scheme understood why uncle rasmus had moved where he did and why the jerseyman strove to provoke hunt to anger for pierre raised the stool which he had been swinging to and fro in his hands and brought it down upon the scoundrels head with such force that he was nigh knocked to the floor  if little frenchie had been able to get in a direct blow i have no doubt it would have settled matters on the instant for i could see even in the gloom that the lad was putting all his strength to the effort and counted on taking human life if by so doing he could the better relieve us from the difficulty into which we had fallen  as it was unfortunately pierres arm glanced across the back of uncle rasmuss chair and the blow was robbed of half its force it was sufficient however to partially daze abel hunt and before he could recover either his senses or his footing morgan was upon him like a wildcat clutching both hands around the fellows throat to prevent any outcry while the two came down upon the puncheon planks with a thud that shook the building  on the instant and without giving any heed to the struggling men uncle rasmus sprang with the agility of a boy to the corner where horry sims stood as if ready to leap forward to abel hunts aid and there the old negro with his cane upraised held the tory lad where he neither dared lift a hand or open his mouth  at the same instant little frenchie sprang toward the door replacing and mending so far as possible the barriers which had been torn away and otherwise doing what he might to put it in such shape that it would resist at least for a short time the efforts of any who might try to enter  meanwhile saul and i stood as if dazed looking down upon the floor where master morgan and abel hunt were struggling most desperately rolling here and there with such swiftness of movement that had we been armed with the best of weapons it would have been impossible for us to have struck a blow in defence of the jerseyman save at great risk of hitting him instead of our enemy  i did succeed after mayhap a full minute had passed in gathering my wits sufficiently to seize upon a stick of firewood which was lying at one side of the fireplace and then i went toward the combatants watching the opportunity to strike a blow in master morgans defence so great was the rage within my heart that i sincerely hoped i might bring the oaken stick down upon abel hunts head with such force as to kill him on the instant  at almost the precise moment when the jerseyman leaped upon abel hunt the british cannon were discharged and from then on until long after the struggle had come to an end was the firing kept up on both sides with such violence and volume of sound that however much of a disturbance we might have made in the cabin or however near the britishers had approached to the building no token of our movements could have been heard otherwise certain it is to me that we would have brought the enemy down upon us for the tumult inside old marys cabin was indeed great  how long the struggle between the two men continued i had no means of knowing my blood was as one would say so boiling in my veins that i saw nothing but red before me and was conscious of but the one desire to kill the scoundrel who without reason had sought to hunt us down  therefore it was i could not have told whether i sprang here and there in the effort to strike a deadly blow five minutes or half an hour and something very like disappointment came over me when master morgan concluded the fight without aid from any of us  his grip upon abel hunts throat was so firm that the fellows eyes were literally starting from their sockets when he had been choked into insensibility and his tongue hung out of his mouth seemingly a fingers length  the jerseyman although victor had not come out of the fight unharmed he was bleeding from a cut on the face his shirt had been torn from his body until he was near naked and so severe had been his exertions that when hunt finally sank back upon the puncheons like one dead master morgan could only with difficulty move to his knees panting and with the perspiration running down his face in tiny streams  how long saul and i stood gaping openmouthed at the apparently dead man and nearly exhausted spy i dare not venture to say neither of us thought we had any part to play now that the battle was at an end but not so with pierre laurens he dear lad ever on watch and ever ready to take advantage of the first opportunity understood that abel hunt had only been choked into unconsciousness and that it was necessary we set about so fettering him that the battle could not be continued when his senses returned  pierre seized upon the blanket which had fallen from uncle rasmuss knees when he set about making his way toward the door to offer his body as a living barricade and tore it into strips until he had an apology for a rope sufficient to have tied two men and began dextrously binding hunts feet and arms  his action caused me to bestir myself and i began to fashion a gag for the fellows mouth knowing full well that we could not frighten him into silence as we had frightened horry sims  the jerseyman recovered from his exertions before little frenchie and i had finished our task and then he took from my hand the stout billet of wood which i was wrapping with strips torn from the blanket as he said  i am not minded to have the blood of this fellow on my head yet perhaps it would be better for all concerned if we shut off his wind for so long a time that it could never be recovered again for he is like to be a millstone around your neck lad and may yet succeed in working his purpose killing one in cold blood even though it be for the cause is more than i am willing to undertake  but he must be gagged i cried thinking that master morgan was growing softhearted and might waste too much time in mourning over his victim  let not your heart be troubled as to that lad the jerseyman said grimly to thrust this gag into the fellows mouth just now would be indeed the same as cutting his throat we must wait until he is well nigh conscious of his surroundings and then bind it in place so securely that he cannot work loose from it  then it was while morgan knelt by abel hunts side awaiting the proper moment to deprive him of all power of speech that i realized what we had done i speedily understood that this victory of ours was the same as a disaster for how could we unable to procure food or water save at great risk care for two prisoners and at the same time the thought came into my mind like a red light of warning that the companionship of abel hunt would embolden horry sims and mayhap make of him something more than the coward he had thus far shown himself  even though we should be able to feed these prisoners yet must we hold them here in the midst of the british camp where the least accident would bring the soldiers in upon us and it did not at that moment seem to me possible we could keep the two fellows in the loft any length of time without in some way betraying the secret  what about the tory lad master morgan asked while he yet awaited the proper time for thrusting the gag into hunts mouth  we are forced to hold him as a matter of course the question in my mind as you spoke was how we might care for two prisoners while we ourselves are in much the same situation save than we are at liberty to move about inside this cabin  there are many things lad which seem impossible while they are yet in the future but when the moment for action comes the way is made plain and we succeed where failure appeared certain  not understanding fully the meaning of what the jerseyman said i did not extract much of comfort from his words but stood looking down upon abel hunt who was now beginning to breathe heavily like one who snores in his sleep until pierre aroused me by saying  we shall be forced to put both prisoners into the loft as a matter of course and may as well get horry sims there now for stowing abel hunt away will be considerable of a task  despite the roar of great guns from the outside the tory lad heard what little frenchie said and straightway set about begging us not to put a gag in his mouth vowing by this and by that which he held most sacred that he would make no outcry  at first it seemed to me absolutely necessary for our own safety that we deprive him of the power to raise an alarm but pierre who had already thought over all the possibilities of the situation said  we will put abel hunt one side of the scuttle and horry sims the other whoever is on guard must sit by the side of the tory lad and if so be he gives any token of crying out then shall the gag go in and remain there  do you count on making the same bargain with abel hunt i asked scornfully for my blood was yet so heated that i could have no feeling of tenderness or of mercy toward those two who had forced us to encounter such peril  he must take his dose little frenchie said from between his clenched teeth and i was really pleased even while standing there facing death to see that the french lads anger could be aroused  without loss of time we drove horry sims up the ladder and when he was in the loft pierre and i fettered him securely with strips of blanket threatening him with the gag if he moved a hands breadth in either direction  then we went to the floor below ready to do our share in hoisting into his atticprison the scoundrel who would have denounced us as spies  the jerseyman had already put the gag in hunts mouth and when we came down he was telling the fellow what he might expect if any resistance was offered  here is a pistol with mayhap a dozen charges of powder and ball master morgan said as he drew from his ragged trousers a weapon and a small package which i knew contained ammunition whichever of you lads stands guard over the prisoner and close watch must be kept night and day if you would preserve your lives will have by him every moment this pistol ready loaded and primed at the first sign of an attempt to escape or to give an alarm which you see abel hunt display put the weapon to his head and blow his brains out regardless of everything even though there might be a squad of soldiers standing beneath the scuttle for his life must be as of no value if you would hope to come out from this british nest with whole skins  then looking at hunt who perforce lay there motionless and silent the jerseyman repeated to him very much the same as he had said to us assuring the fellow over and over again that if the britishers should come to his aid or if it was discovered either through his exertions or by accident that he lay there a prisoner we lads were bound to kill him because of what he could tell to our disadvantage  i have seen a wildcat held helpless in a trap and there was much of his look about abel hunts face as he glared at pierre and me unable to stir even a finger while master morgan was threatening  it seemed as though the fellow must have realized that we would have no compunction about taking his life in cold blood if so be he stood between us and liberty yet was he like the wildcat ready and willing to struggle to the very last even though the odds were so heavy against him and when we strove to carry him into the loft he did his best to prevent it although both hands and feet were bound securely  it was not until we had made a rope of the second blanket thus depriving ourselves of even the apology for a bed and tied it around his body hoisting him as we would a bale of cotton that it was possible to get the fellow through the scuttle  with two of us pulling from above and the others shoving him up from below we finally succeeded in landing him on the puncheon planks rolling the fellow over until he was at such a distance from the opening in the floor that he could not well spy upon those who were below  all the while fortunately for us the cannonading continued therefore we were at liberty to work as we would regardless of making a noise and well it was for had we stood in danger from eavesdroppers then must all of us have been in the guardhouse within five minutes after the fight between master morgan and abel hunt began  it was with a sense of greatest relief that i stood near the edge of the scuttle wiping the perspiration from my face when finally we had got the scoundrelly cur where we wanted him and then the satisfaction which should have been mine because of having thus far succeeded in holding our own was entirely wiped out by thoughts of the future strive as i might i could not prevent my mind from going ahead of time and picturing what must finally be our fate  that we could hold these two tories securely for a day mayhap eight and forty hours i had little doubt but it was the same as a proven fact in my mind that within a short time must the britishers learn all the secret and lay us under the most terrible of all military charges  it was as if master morgan understood that if we were given much time for thought there was fear of our growing timorous for no sooner had we disposed of abel hunt than he called for all to come to the floor below where he could have speech with us saying at the same time that the prisoners could effect nothing toward their release even though it were possible for them to cry out because while the cannon were roaring and one could hear the crackle of musketry from seemingly every point the strongest lunged man who ever lived could not have made his voice heard an hundred paces away  it has come time for me to take leave of you lads the jerseyman said much to my surprise and i interrupted him by crying out for it was to my mind as if the moment he departed we were standing in even more imminent danger of death than we did at that instant  i thought you were not counting to make the venture until midnight i cried  that was in my mind lad when matters were quiet here within the entrenchments but from the sounds of conflict it would seem as if the britishers had all they could attend to without looking after a man here or there i count on making my way very near the outer works where i shall await an opportunity of slipping through the lines  think you it will be possible to do so pierre asked thoughtfully and the jerseyman replied without a tremor in his voice  i am of the mind lad that the odds are strongly against it and yet must the venture be made i have the hope that if death comes to me you may have knowledge regarding it so that that which i have failed in may be carried on by one of you it is not a time to think of taking precautions to save our own lives but rather to try how we may so sacrifice them that by our dying we shall have benefitted the cause  even while he was speaking in such a strain as to bring tears to the eyes of us all little frenchie ever realizing what should be done was unbarring the door and when he had finished the task the jerseyman went out without so much as turning to look at us never a word did he speak but went quickly into the open air as if eager to rid himself of our company  only those who have been in a like situation can understand our feelings at this moment when we were left alone and knew that the man who stood our friend had gone most like to his death  we remained silent and motionless not daring to gaze at each other much like a band of mourners who have gathered around the lifeless body of a dear friend and so we would have stood there until all the courage oozed out from our hearts had it not been for dear little frenchie himself quite as brave a man and as good a patriot as the one who had just left us  regardless of the sorrow in his own heart and of the forebodings which i knew must be his he put on a cheerful face saying as he righted uncle rasmuss chair which had been overturned during the struggle  there is no good reason why we should stand around here like a company of soreheads for there is work in abundance to be done we must have food and now would seem to be the time to procure it when the britishers have all on their hands to which they can attend  for my part i have no desire for food i cried almost irritated because he had brought up the matter at such a time when it was as if we had taken leave of an old friend it seems to me as if i should never be hungry again  but yet you will be fitz hamilton and that before this nightfall even though we were inclined to starve ourselves thinking it might benefit the cause we have two prisoners to look after and now that we have no longer reason to fear a meeting with abel hunt what prevents us from going through the encampment  it seems to me that at such a time the britishers would be overcautious and insist on knowing why we lads roamed around instead of offering our services to those in the entrenchments saul said gloomily and i was much of his mind but when little frenchie has once set out on a road it is most difficult to turn him back and now in answer to our suggestions he insisted that we must make an effort to procure provisions whatever short of actual death might stand in the way  i am willing now as i was then to confess freely that i was afraid to step outside old marys cabin for any purpose whatsoever the struggle with abel hunt and the departure of the jerseyman when it seemed certain he had gone out only to be killed had brought to the surface all my cowardice but when i said as much in plain words little frenchie laughed me to scorn declaring he knew me better than i knew myself and that it needed only for me to stand face to face with imminent danger in order to give token of bravery  then surely now should be the time when i showed myself a hero i replied with a laugh that had in it little of mirth for verily are we face to face with as many dangers as the most gluttonous swashbuckler could desire  come with me and we will find more pierre said with a laugh as he opened the door and for the life of me i could not have refused to follow the lad even my knees bent beneath me as i crossed the threshold     chapter xv  foraging   sorely afraid though i was to go out of the cabin lest i find myself a prisoner on the charge of being a spy no danger however great could have prevented me from following little frenchie when he thus led the way  i was so timorous at that moment as to be irritated and it would have done me a world of good could i have taken the little lad by the shoulders and shaken him severely because of thus venturing forth when he might have remained in hiding a few hours longer without suffering overly much from lack of food  once in the open air however i the same as forgot that i was fainthearted because of the scene which was presented looking northward we could see closely surrounding us hardly more than a cannonshot away our people who had come to capture cornwallis and his men and in so doing were preparing a way for our escape if so be we lived long enough to take advantage of the opportunity which they were counting on offering  it was a sight well calculated to warm even the most timorous heart that vast army pressing forward as if certain of victory and holding the enemy on this peninsula from whence he could not escape even by water for at lynn haven bay lay the french ships ready to intercept any flight  we of virginia had remained so long under the heel of the invader with only now and then a glimpse of small detachments of our soldiers that it seemed for the moment almost incredible that there could be so many men ready to sacrifice their lives in the effort to free the colonies from the yoke of oppression which bore so heavily upon them  looking gloucester way by which i mean gazing across the encampment of those who held our village of york in a wavering grasp we could see that the redcoats had not only withdrawn from the outermost works but appeared to be massed together close within the limits of the village as if for mutual protection and little pierre ever quick to see and keen to understand what he saw said to me in a tone of triumph as he laid his hand on my shoulder  look yonder see the redcoats huddling together like a lot of rats in a trap and verily they are trapped now for so long as the french vessels remain inside the capes so long are they shut in here at the mercy of those brave fellows who have drawn the net around them  then it was that i began to question if cornwallis was indeed in such close quarters in the river lay as i have already said the guadaloupe and the charon and in addition were a number of other large vessels the names of which i do not remember  i asked myself whether by making a brave attempt they might not force their way past the french fleet and thus escape by the sea  there is no chance they will try anything of the kind pierre said when i suggested that mayhap our people did not hold the british in such a firm grasp look more closely at the ships and you will see that but two of them are armed for war the others being only transports what chance would all of them have against a single frigate no no fitz hamilton cornwallis knows only too well that he is in a tight place but he is not such a fool as to make so desperate a venture here he has taken his stand and here he must remain until having beaten off our people or made up his mind to surrender  i wish it might be possible for me to paint a picture of the british encampment surrounded by our brave americans as pierre laurens and i saw it that afternoon when the shades of night were gathering points of lights betokening campfires or torches set up in the entrenchments that the troops might be able to strengthen their defences twinkled in every direction then was a zone of darkness lying between the enemys works and our forces after which came again a circle of twinkling lights that seemed to shine out in a most friendly fashion as if telling us lads to be of good cheer for kindly aid was nigh at hand  now and then would come a great flash of fire followed by a heavy booming noise as one army or the other sent a shot across the lines to show that all were on the alert and again we could hear in this direction or that the sharp crackle of musketry which caused us to start forward toward the sound believing a battle had begun during all the time we were besieged in the village of york did it appear to me certain the two armies would come together immediately in a handtohand grapple and many times did i believe the end was nigh at hand although never were both forces in their entirety engaged in conflict  not until night had fully come did pierre and i cease to gaze around us at the same time exulting and despairing allowing our eyes to rest longest on the encampment of our friends and then it was that the little french lad brought me to a realization of the task before us by saying laughingly  we ventured out to forage not to watch the two armies and i am of the opinion that we had best get about our work else will saul and uncle rasmus believe we have been taken prisoners that cousin of yours is none too patient under the best of circumstances and i can fancy how he is raving at this moment because of being forced to stay in the loft guarding the prisoners while the old negro remains at the window watching for our return  it was one thing to say we would forage and quite another to do it there were provisions in abundance in the british camp but no possibility that we lads could come upon them either by begging or by stealing while our only chance lay in finding some of the villagers who were able and willing to minister to hungry boys without questioning whether they were for the king or the colonies  left to my own devices i should have returned to old marys cabin declaring it was impossible to get that which we needed but pierre was not minded to confess himself beaten and proposed that we present ourselves boldly at a dwelling mayhap an hundred yards away which we knew was yet occupied by its owners  i tried to dissuade him from such a course insisting that most like the people were tories else they would not have remained to be shut up in this beleaguered village but he only shrugged his shoulders and waved his hands in that peculiar fashion of his as he said in what he counted should be a careless tone  it is better fitz hamilton that we are held in the guardhouse even under the charge of being spies than that we starve to death as you must admit there is danger unless we speedily find provisions let the people in yonder dwelling be tories or whigs i question whether they could get the ear of any british officer within a very short time and if we find that they are inclined to do us harm it is only a case of taking to our heels besides i am of the mind that those who were rank tories yesterday are standing undecided today until they shall see which side wins the victory that they may put on the proper coat  then without waiting to learn whether i agreed with him the lad led me forward by the arm with such a tight grip that i could not escape him save by a downright struggle and knocked boldly at the door of the dwelling  it was opened by an old man whom i believed i had seen more than once since we had come to this village of york in converse with some of the redcoated officers and even then i strove to pull pierre back that we might make our escape in the darkness  with a strength such as i had not believed was his he held me by his side as he said to this man who might prove to be our bitterest foe  we are lads who came down from the hamilton plantation to look after an old negro who was too feeble to leave his quarters here and now are we shut in with nothing to eat and no way of getting provisions save by begging we ate our last morsel of food yesterday and have come here believing you would give from your store rather than sit down at table knowing there were those near you dying from starvation  you dont appear to be very near death just now the man said gruffly as he came nearer to peer into our faces so you belong on the hamilton plantation do you  yes sir  and when captain hamilton went north to join the rebel forces he left an old negro in this village did he  it is not to my mind certain that uncle rasmus was here when captain hamilton went away but i know only too well he is now in this village and in need of food  i dont claim to know very much of military movements the man said grimly having satisfied his curiosity regarding our personal appearance but it seems to me you might have waited a little with the belief that the rebels are bound to make their way inside those lines whatever my lord cornwallis may do in opposition  it is painful waiting even for a short time when ones empty stomach reproaches him little frenchie said with a shrug of his shoulders and the man stood irresolute while i might have counted ten after which he wheeled about suddenly and entered the house saying as he did so  wait until i come  you may be certain we waited although i had many misgivings as to whether the return would be to our advantage or to our sorrow for there was a possibility he might hold us until he could send word to some of the britishers telling them who we were and much of this fear i whispered in pierres ear whereupon he said cheerily shrugging his shoulders and waving his hands  i cannot believe any in this village would be so unwise just at this time as to take advantage of our helplessness save it might be such cattle as abel hunt for even the dullest must understand that our friends are like to have the upper hands before this affair is finished and he who sent two lads to their death might himself suffer in like fashion when the americans held possession of this town of york as they are certain to do before many days have passed  whether the man to whom we had appealed was at heart a friend to the colonies or if he was prompted as pierre had suggested i cannot say but this much i do know that he brought us in a bag near to half a bushel of corn meal and with it a large ham saying as he laid the provisions on the threshold  to these you are welcome lad whether you be for the colonies or for the king but i am asking that you do not come to me again with stories of your hunger for my larder is not so well filled that i can share it with any outside my own family lest we ourselves come to want before it is settled as to who shall be master in the village  pierre thanked the man in a manner which would have been impossible for me tonguetied as i always am at such a time and then gathering up the bag and the ham hastily we went with all speed toward old marys cabin mentally hugging ourselves because we had succeeded so well when there seemed little possibility aught of good would come from our foraging  no sooner had we opened the door of the hovel and spoken to uncle rasmus when saul cried impatiently from the scuttle above  there is no good reason why you should loiter around the encampment when i alone am left in charge of the prisoners could you not understand that i ought to be relieved after so long a watch  we understand nothing save that it was necessary we bring back food pierre said laughingly giving no further heed to sauls impatience  the lad would have set about building a fire that we might cook the meat but uncle rasmus eagerly prevented him from so doing declaring that such task belonged to him and pierre with a laugh which had in it much of content gave way before the old negro and at once took up the bucket running out of the cabin to get a supply of water  heard you aught of the jerseyman saul cried from above and i replied that there was little chance we could have had word concerning him  if morgan had been able to slip through the lines then would there have come to us no token whatsoever and if peradventure the enemy shot him while he was trying to make his escape then again must we have remained in ignorance for at such a time when many thousand men were facing each other striving their utmost to kill or wound the life of one be he soldier or spy would appear of but little importance  ise boun to believe honey dat he got trou all right uncle rasmus said as he busied himself with preparations for the supper which we needed so sorely dat ere jerseyman is mighty spry ise tellin you an ef he could hang roun here wid de britishers keepin his eye open ebery time dey jumped ise lowin hes gwine to make a small job ob gettin out ob dis yere place  if its such a simple matter why dont we try it ourselves saul cried and started with surprise for that very thought had been in my mind during the last five minutes  so far as our being able to work benefit to the cause was concerned we might as well have been on the hamilton plantation and there i most ardently wished we were it would be impossible and most like unnecessary for us to get word of importance to our people no matter how many risks we ran and i was of the mind that it was useless to take any chances for surely the americans being so near could keep themselves well informed of all that went forward in the encampment  pierre came back with the water uncle rasmus made a pudding of the corn meal and toasted slices of the ham before the fire saul came down from the loft leaving the prisoners alone when the food was thus prepared and we three lads and the old negro enjoyed that meal surrounded though we were by enemies more keenly than i ever remember of pleasuring myself in a like fashion  when our own hunger had been appeased we set about feeding the prisoners and this task in case of horry sims was a simple one for we dared set his hands free that he might wait upon himself but when it came to abel hunt it was a horse of an entirely different color  we ran no little risk even in removing the gag from his mouth and i firmly believe but for the fact of pierres standing over him with the loaded pistol which the jerseyman had left for our use threatening to shoot with intent to kill if he uttered the slightest sound the fellow would have striven to give an alarm  it was some minutes before he could work his jaws so cramped were they from being held fixed in one position since we had made him prisoner and then instead of eating although i knew full well he must be hungry he set about threatening us with what he would do when he was at liberty striving to impress upon us that we could not hold him in the loft many days without attracting some attention from the britishers  i am well known inside these lines he snarled and had been intrusted with important business so that if i fail to present myself at headquarters within a reasonable time search will be made for me you can guess what must be your plight once a squad of soldiers enters this cabin to set me free  im thinking abel hunt pierre replied softly that the britishers have got as much on their heads as can well be attended to just now without troubling their minds regarding you dont expect a squad of redcoats to come here on your behalf very soon and in fact i would advise you to give over thinking of such a thing for there is every indication my lord cornwallis will be too deeply occupied with the american army to give heed to tories however important they may believe their business to be  abel continued to threaten declaring he would send us to the gallows before many days had passed if we failed to release him and he went on in such strain until even pierre lost his temper and roughly told him that unless he made ready for eating he would get no food until next morning whereupon the fellow opened his mouth obediently much like a calf  mine was the disagreeable task to feed him and it may be i thrust the pudding into his mouth with unnecessary force but certain it is i was in no wise tender with the scoundrel for i knew to a certainty that if the tables were turned and we in his power we might hold ourselves fortunate indeed if we were given the slightest morsel to eat  that night we lads took turns standing guard in the loft each remaining on duty two hours although as saul said if we had been willing to cause horry sims suffering all of us might by gagging him have taken the rest which we needed i am not sorry that we failed of following my cousins suggestion for since that day i have come to know from painful experience how much suffering may be caused by a gag firmly fixed between ones jaws  there is no good reason why i should strive to set down all the doings of each day while it seemed to me much as if our people were making slow progress in this work of capturing my lord cornwallis  having been so successful in our first attempt at foraging we went almost boldly around the village when our store of provisions ran low begging at this house or at that without questioning whether the occupants might be for the king or for the colony receiving sometimes with a generous hand and then again in niggardly manner at least enough of food to keep us alive although i am free to confess that never once from the day the jerseyman left us until i was home again on the plantation did i feel as though my stomach was well filled  instead of striving to tell what we lads did which is of little consequence compared with what was going on around us i had best hold this poor apology for a story to the movements of those brave fellows who had come down from the north to rid our colony of virginia from redcoated invaders  during all the while whether by day or by night one of us three lads remained in the loft doing guard duty while the other two if by any fortunate chance we had a small store of provisions on hand were at liberty to watch our people it can well be understood how greedily we gazed out upon that army which we counted friendly watching for the least change of position and even questioning with impatience how long it would be before the end came  it was as if the britishers gave no heed whatsoever to anything save their own defense and i question whether we lads might not have boldly presented ourselves to the quartermaster begging for food and receiving it instead of striving as we did to keep ourselves from their particular notice  we could see day after day our people bringing up heavy guns digging ditches which pierre called parallels meaning embankments thrown up to protect the advance of a besieging army and otherwise seemingly making preparations to fall upon the enemy in overwhelming force  i remember well on going out early one morning after it seemed to me that we had been shut up in this town of york weeks and weeks instead of only a few days and seeing much to my surprise a parallel or embankment not more than five or six hundred yards from the outermost of the british works which had been completed during the hours of darkness with a great joy in my heart i ran into the cabin to make known the welcome news for surely did it seem as if the american army had taken their first step toward entering the village  we expected each moment to hear sounds of conflict those who were not on duty in the loft remained out of doors watching the soldiers in the distance and greatly disappointed were we when night came and nothing decisive so far as we could see had been done  next day pierre pointed out to me as he and i stood overlooking the american lines that two or three redoubts were being thrown up and batteries placed in position then came that for which we had been hoping and prayingthe sounds of conflict  it was in the afternoon that our people opened fire upon the enemy with great vigor and until the end came the earth trembled continuously beneath the heavy detonations while the smoke of the burning powder hung over us until our throats were parched and smarting  it is impossible for me to set down of my own knowledge all that was done during this seemingly long time by the britishers for i saw only a portion of the movements often the clouds of smoke prevented me from seeing friend or foe and again when came this change of position or that countermarching i failed to understand the meaning therefore it is that again shall i make my story more plain by setting down the words of another which i have seen on a printed sheet  illustration a general discharge  was commenced by the americans  the evening of the sixth was very dark and stormy and under cover of the gloom the first parallel was commenced within six hundred yards of cornwalliss works parallel is a technical term applied to trenches and embankments dug and thrown up as a protection to besiegers against the guns of a fort in this way the assailants may approach a fortification and construct batteries within short gunshot of the works of the beleaguered and be well protected in their labors  general lincoln commanded the troops detailed for this service so silently and so earnestly did they labor that they were not discerned by the british sentinels and before daylight the trenches were sufficiently complete to shield the laborers from the guns of the enemy on the afternoon of the ninth several batteries and redoubts were completed and a general discharge of twentyfour and eighteenpounders was commenced by the americans on the right  this cannonade was kept up without intermission during the night and early next morning the french opened their batteries upon the enemy for nearly eight hours there was an incessant roar of cannon and mortars and hundreds of bombs and round shot were poured upon the british works so tremendous was the bombardment that the besieged soon withdrew their cannon from the embrasures and fired very few shots in return at evening redhot cannon balls were hurled from the french battery on the extreme left at the guadaloupe and charon  the guadaloupe was driven from her post while the charon and three large transports were burned  the night was starry and mild and invited to repose but the besiegers rested not and york town presented a scene of terrible grandeur such as is seldom witnessed by the eye of man  from the bank of the river i had a fine view of the splendid conflagration the ships were enwrapped in a torrent of fire which spread with vivid brightness among the combustible rigging and ran with amazing rapidity to the tops of the several masts while all around was thunder and lightning from our numerous cannon and mortars and in the darkness presented one of the most sublime and magnificent spectacles that can be imagined  some of our shells overreaching the town were seen to fall in the river and bursting threw up a column of water like the spouting of a monster of the deep all night long the allies kept up a cannonade and early the next morning another british transport was set in flames by a fiery ball and consumed  during the night of the eleventh the besiegers commenced a second parallel between two and three hundred yards from the british works the three succeeding days were devoted to the completion of this line of trenches during which time the enemy opened new embrasures in positions from which their fire was far more effective than at first  two redoubts on the left of the besieged and advanced three hundred yards in front of the british works flanked the second parallel and greatly annoyed the men in the trenches preparations were made on the fourteenth to carry them both by storm  to excite a spirit of emulation the reduction of one was committed to the american light infantry under lafayette the other to a detachment of french grenadiers and chasseurs commanded by the baron de viomenil a brave and experienced officer  toward evening the two detachments marched to the assault colonel alexander hamilton who had commanded a battery of light artillery during this campaign led the advance corps of the americans assisted by colonel gimat lafayettes aide while colonel laurens with eighty men turned the redoubt in order to intercept the retreat of the garrison  at a given signal the troops rushed furiously to the charge without firing a gun the van being led by captain aaron ogden over the abattis and palisades they leaped and with such vehemence and rapidity assaulted and entered the works that their loss was inconsiderable one sergeant and eight privates were killed seven officers and twentyfive noncommissioned officers and privates were wounded major campbell who commanded the redoubt and some inferior officers with seventeen privates were made prisoners eight privates of the garrison were killed in the assault but not one was injured after the surrender  the redoubt stormed by the french was garrisoned by a greater force and was not so easily overcome it was defended by a lieutenantcolonel and one hundred and fifty men after a combat of nearly half an hour the redoubt was surrendered eighteen of the garrison were killed and fortytwo were made prisoners the french lost in killed and wounded about one hundred men  during the night of the fourteenth these redoubts were included in the second parallel and by five oclock the next afternoon some howitzers which had been placed in them were opened upon the british works  the situation of cornwallis was now becoming dangerous beleaguered on all sides by a superior force his strongest defenses crumbling or passing into the possession of the besiegers and no tidings from general clinton to encourage him the british commander was filled with the gloomiest apprehensions  knowing that the town would be untenable when the second parallel should be completed he sent out a detachment under lieutenantcolonel abercrombie to make a sortie against the two almost completed batteries guarded by french troops they made a furious assault at about four oclock in the morning and were successful but the guards at the trenches soon drove the assailants back and their enterprise was fruitless of advantage  cornwallis confident that he could not maintain his position determined to make a desperate effort at flight his plan was to leave the sick and his baggage behind cross over to gloucester and with his detachment there disperse the french troops mount his infantry on horses taken from the dukes legion and others that might be seized in the neighborhood by rapid marches gain the forks of the rappahannock and the potomac and forcing his way through maryland pennsylvania and new jersey form a junction with the army in new york  this was a most hazardous undertaking but his only alternative was flight or capture boats were accordingly prepared and at ten oclock on the evening of the sixteenth a portion of his troops were conveyed across to gloucester so secretly was the whole movement performed that the patriots did not perceive it and had not a power mightier than man interposed an obstacle cornwalliss desperate plan might have been successfully accomplished  the first body of troops had scarcely reached gloucester point when a storm of wind and rain almost as sudden and fierce as a summer tornado made the passage of the river too hazardous to be again attempted the storm continued with unabated violence until morning and cornwallis was obliged to abandon his design the troops were brought back without much loss and now the last ray of hope began to fade from the vision of the earl     chapter xvi  preparations for flight   there is little of particular interest that can be told concerning ourselves during that time of happenings which i have just set down in the words of another when our people were showing themselves such able soldiers  when the fighting was hottest at least two of us lads were out of doors where we could see what was going on and regarding not the bullets or cannon balls that came our way in our eagerness to watch for some advantage which might be gained by the americans  it was for us a time of constant anxiety we had the prisoners to guard and had we not been forced to take abel hunt as we did then might it have been a simple matter for we could frighten horry sims into submission but this hulking dissolute fellow as ready to fight as he was to eat regardless of whether he faced friend or foe was smarting under the sense of being held captive by lads and we knew only too well that he would struggle to his utmost to set himself free that he might denounce us as spies which he could well do after knowing what he must have known regarding the jerseyman  while i was on duty in the loft i stood at one of the small apertures or the other gazing out oftentimes hearing the shrieking of a bomb as it came within what seemed to be a very short distance of the building but ever keeping a watchful eye on abel hunt  at such times as i was off duty and not obliged to go with pierre foraging for he was the only one of us three who could successfully conduct such expeditions i was lounging around the outside of the building saddened when our people slackened fire lest they should be wavering in the attempt to overcome cornwallis and again exulting when the big guns boomed their notes of defiance until it was as if the very air vibrated with the detonations  although we were so fearsome that hunt might succeed in making his escape at least four times in every four and twenty hours were we forced in humanitys name to take the gag from his mouth that he might get relief for his jaws  the fellow begged again and again that we would relieve him from his bonds so he might walk around promising to be as obedient to our orders as was horry sims but i knew him too well to put any trust in his words  now and then we released his feet and again gave him free use of one arm at a time in other words we did all we might to relieve the pain of his position without running too much risk on our part  on that day when the french and the american troops attacked the redoubts on either side the village i thought we had come to our last hour on earth so thickly did the shots from the american redoubt directly in front of the lines which were sent to cover the assault i have already described strike roundabout old marys cabin it seemed certain we must be sent into the beyond by those who would lend us every aid within their power  it was when a solid shot struck the corner of the cabin near to the ridgepole just above where abel hunt lay and plowed its way through the solid logs tearing them aside as a child might shatter a lot of jackstraws that i believed we were soon to meet our death hunt must have been of the same opinion for he begged like a cur when pierre and i went up shortly afterward for us to keep the gag from his mouth declaring that we were striving to compass his death by leaving him in such a place  but for pierre laurens i believe we would have abandoned the prisoners and taking uncle rasmus with us fled down to the bank of the river immediately in the rear of the captured redoubt where several of the villagers were gathered in abject terror thinking only to shield themselves from the iron hail which came into and across the encampment with the fury of a summer tempest  it was not possible for us to go an hundred yards in either direction from the cabin without coming upon wounded or dead and so accustomed did we become within a very short time to such horrible scenes that they ceased to terrify us save when as happened more than once a soldier was shot down within a stones throw of our hiding place even then it was to us nothing so very terrible save that it served to point out the peril in which we were placed  we had long since ceased to depend upon the citizens of york for food but went boldly up to the quartermasters department when rations were being served and only once were we turned away emptyhanded  i would not have it understood that during the siege we were living on the fat of the land we had sufficient with which to partially allay our hunger and took good care that the prisoners should not suffer from lack of food even though we ourselves might be forced to fast  once during these times of excitement a bomb struck that portion of the cabin which had already been shattered and on the instant the dry timbers were in a flame fortunately however we had a full bucket of water in the house and by aid of this with what could hurriedly be brought from the well near at hand we succeeded in extinguishing the fire before it gained headway  if that had happened in the night then had we all been burned to death saul said thoughtfully and pierre laughed him to scorn as he replied  if so be we lads havent sense enough to go out of doors when the heat inside becomes too great then of a verity do we deserve to be burnt alive no danger which may come to us from our people can cause me to grumble for it is all in the way of teaching the kings soldiers a lesson and my life counts for nothing  i believe we had all come to cheapen the value of a human life by this time having seen so many of the redcoated soldiers shot down until we were come to this village of york i had shuddered at the very thought of shedding blood but now so hardened was i become to such scenes that i gave no heed to those who fell within view of the cabin nor did i hold my own life as of great importance even to myself  he who has followed thus far my attempt to tell the story of what certain lads who called themselves minute boys of york town did during this time of the siege must strive to picture for himself our goingsin and comingsout while we were thus tied to old marys cabin they must see in their minds eye pierre and i foraging or mentally be with us when we divided our scanty store of food giving to the helpless ones in the loft more than we took ourselves for i cannot set all this down so that another may see it clearly without using so many words that the most patient reader would turn aside from the pages wearied  therefore it is that i shall come directly to that evening so near the end of the siege when my lord cornwallis attempted to turn tail leaving the sick and wounded behind him as he strove to gain a shelter in new york  that forenoon pierre and i had gone to the commissarys quarters when the rations were dealt out and stood in line to receive our share for during the past few days there had been no question as to giving us a certain amount of food we were most likely looked upon as village lads and by this time my lord cornwallis had been forced to feed the citizens of york from the army stores he having seized from those who had an abundance everything that might serve to satisfy hunger  even i thickheaded and dull of vision as i am understood on this morning that some change was near at hand the redcoats were moving here and there hurriedly like bees whose hive has been disturbed there was a great gathering of horses nearby the river bank and among them to my grief and anxiety was my own colt silver heels baggage wagons were being drawn down to the shore and officers rode to and fro in hot haste seemingly giving little heed as to what might be going on in the fortifications  half the buildings in the town had been taken possession of that they might be used as hospitals for the poor wretches who had been wounded and as we passed them on our way to the commissarys quarters i noted that the surgeons were going from one to another as if having but little time to spend the british fire had slackened although the americans continued to pour shot and bombs into the town in a halfhearted way and one might almost have supposed they were getting short of ammunition  something of importance is going on here i said decidedly when pierre and i having received what was supposed to be our proper amount of rations had set off as if to return to the cabin do you note that baggage is being carried to the river and the horses are tethered there have you seen how hurriedly the surgeons were moving about giving but scant heed to those who need their services most  all that i have seen pierre replied gravely and it would seem to me that the riddle may easily be read even by you who claim to have no knowledge of military matters  what do you mean i cried sharply what is it you read in this movement except perhaps that cornwallis is making ready for another sortie  would he make ready for a sortie by moving his baggage to the river by gathering the horses there pierre cried speaking incautiously loud and then lowering his voice to a whisper as he realized that the words might carry far even despite the roaring of the american guns if it was in his mind to strike a blow at our people would he be overhauling his baggage would not the horses be taken near to the front where they might be used  what is it you mean i cried impatiently not in the mood to wait until pierre had gotten ready to repeat after his own fashion that which was in his mind  do you remember that the jerseyman said my lord cornwallis was making ready to run away  like a flash it came upon me i remembered all that morgan had said and as it came to my mind everything unusual around me had its meaning as plain as the sun at noontime  at last this general of the king who had boasted that he would come down and drive all the rebels out from virginia regardless of what that french boy lafayette might do was making ready to run awayto run away from those american soldiers whom the britishers did not believe could fight although certain it is they had good proof of it at bunker hill in the colony of massachusetts and were they not getting more proof now was there a redcoat in all our village of york who had not come to realize and would be willing to admit that the socalled rebels who fought under every disadvantage and bore patiently every suffering could stand at their guns as bravely as any who wore his majestys uniform  it was a moment when i was more proud than i have ever since been in my life proud of my people not of myself and with the pride came a feeling of sad disappointment because i had not been able to contribute anything to this downfall of the swaggering britishers i had hoped we might enroll a full company of minute boys who despite their age would earn the right to serve as soldiers and yet had i accomplished nothing save coming into this village in the vain hope of being able to regain possession of my horse remaining here almost as much of a prisoner as either abel hunt or horry sims  the news was too good to be kept to myself and regarding not pierres movements i ran at full speed back to old marys cabin shouting as i burst through the door  the britishers are getting ready to run away cornwallis has grown frightened and is giving up the fight  how know you that saul cried sharply seizing me by the shoulder as if forcing me to give proof and at the same instant i heard the prisoners in the loft stirring as if in fear while horry sims asked although knowing full well his companion could not answer a question  do you believe it possible my lord cornwallis would really run away  he is getting ready to run away i shouted triumphantly even now the baggage is being carried to the river bank all the spare horses are tethered there and save for the few soldiers who are left in the works there is no further heed being given to what our people are doing  bress de lawd bress de lawd uncle rasmus cried in a fever of ecstasy ise done been certain ole marse would help dribe de redcoats out ob virginia but i neber dreamed deyd get so scared as to run away bress de lawd bress de lawd  when pierre joined us and we were given over to joy and triumph there suddenly came into my mind the thought that if my lord cornwallis did beat a retreat speedily and was not overtaken by our people then was silver heels lost to me forever he could only leave the village of york by crossing over to gloucester and making hurried marches toward the potomac river and under such circumstances i knew that my dear little silver heels could not hold out as would the seasoned steeds of the troopers she would be left by the roadside crippled mayhap and linger there until she died  dearly though i loved the cause or thought i did i was almost unwilling to pay such a price for victory as that this colt of mine which had been carefully tended since she left her mother should be abused as i knew she would be in event of a hurried retreat and when pierre asked in surprise what had happened to cast such a veil of gloom over my face i gave words to the fear in my mind whereupon he said soothingly caressing my arm as was his wont for the dear lad understood how near to my heart was that same little silver heels  there are others nearabout fitz hamilton who can also make a hurried march and who knew the country better than do these under my lord cornwalliss command do you believe our people will remain idle and let this army which they have much the same as gotten under their thumbs slip away  but the britishers will have the start of them before they know what has been done give cornwallis twelve hours advantage and traveling light as i doubt not he intends to do there is every chance he can make good his escape  but he will not have twelve hours the start pierre cried sharply do you count that we who call ourselves minute boys will linger here one moment after those redcoats have set off for the gloucester shore do you fancy we will have no part to play the moment the troops have been withdrawn from the fortifications so that a fellow may cross the lines without bringing down a shower of bullets upon him each of us three will set out at full speed regardless of the danger for our own friends may fire upon us ignorant of our intentions we must get word to the american forces before the last of my lord cornwalliss army has passed out of gloucester  but how shall we know when the britishers have been drawn from the fortifications  by watching them lad pierre cried eagerly by watching them do you count that from this moment on we shall do anything save watch them i would almost be willing to let abel hunt go free so we might be unhampered for while the redcoats are getting ready to retreat they will give little heed to any information such as he can give them but it may be well to hold him until nightfall and then the three of us each going in a different direction must keep sharp watch over all that is being done ready to make a break for our lines at the first moment we are certain the enemy has fled  the lads tone equally with his words was well calculated to stir the blood and as i saw in the future a possibility that silver heels might yet be reclaimed by me i ceased to mourn her as being lost forever but gave all my thoughts to the triumph which awaited our people  we were talking loudly having ceased to be cautious in speech because the roar of the guns drowned all other sounds and were giving noisy voice to our joy when uncle rasmus suddenly cried from his seat at the window where he had stood watch so to speak all the dreary time we had been in the besieged village  hol on dar chillun hol on dar here comes a crowd ob redcoats  coming for us saul cried nervously and i am ashamed to say that the suggestion caused my knees to tremble even though had i stopped to reflect upon the matter i would have understood that at such a time as this when he was in sore straits my lord cornwallis would not trouble himself about three boys and an old negro who were where they could not do him harm however much they so desired  as a matter of course we crowded to the window near where uncle rasmus sat and there saw a group of nine men powderstained and evidently wearied from work in the trenches halt within less than twenty yards of the cabin door where they threw themselves down upon the ground evidently for no other purpose than to gain a needed rest  it is nothing pierre said again quickly reading the signs these men are becoming discouraged most like having an inkling of what their officers count on doing and have deliberately come out of the trenches without permission to take such ease as can be found today for a redcoat in the town of york  we watched the men curiously and for my part with a certain sense of exultation because i fancied they knew the fate which was in store for them they were all armed fully accoutered and should have been at their posts as i understood  after their arrival we talked more guardedly but not the less triumphantly regarding what we would do and little frenchie explained how one of us might cross the lines at this point the second at another and the third elsewhere so there might be no delay in getting news to an officer of our army immediately we were positive cornwallis had drawn off his forces  we ceased to pay any particular heed to these idle soldiers who were neglecting their duty until there came to our ears shrieks of agony like to chill the blood in ones veins followed by groans and moans from that group of idlers  we soon came to understand that a shot from the american lines had just missed crashing into old marys cabin at the very point where we were gathered and plowed its way through that little company of men maiming or killing every one  it was a gruesome sight from which i turned with my hands over my ears that i might neither see nor hear and trembling in every limb with sheer pity though these who had been thus suddenly hurled into eternity would have killed me without wincing  i had believed i was hardened to scenes of war familiarity with suffering with wounds and death such as we had had around us all these days prevented me from giving away to feelings of pity but now was i shocked even as if this was the first shedding of human blood i had ever seen  it was pierre laurens who aroused me from the stupor of horror by shaking my arm as he said stoutly  come lad with me we must not miss such an opportunity  opportunity for what i cried neither turning nor taking my hands from my ears save sufficiently to hear his voice  here is a chance for us to arm ourselves these soldiers who were killed and seemingly there are only two alive although they are much the same as dying were fully accoutered and we must have so many of their muskets and so much of their ammunition as will serve if it should become necessary to protect ourselves  why have we need to protect ourselves now that the britishers are turning tail i asked in dull surprise but i took my hands from my ears and wheeled about knowing that if little frenchie commanded me to do this or that i would obey if it lay within my power  when the redcoats begin their retreat our time of danger has passed i believe the lad said speaking gravely and clutching me by the arm to insure my close attention you can see that these soldiers who have just met their death threw off all restraint were insubordinate believing the end near at hand and if such be the case at this early hour what may happen when the main body of the troops have embarked for gloucester point we must hold ourselves at liberty to carry the news to our people at the earliest possible moment and that can best be done by getting in shape to defend ourselves it is as if heaven itself had sent us these weapons and we would be little less than idiots if we failed to take advantage of that which has come at such a seasonable time  i did not believe pierre was in the right when he said we might be able to defend ourselves i had in mind that instantly the retreat was begun all the redcoated men would hasten upon the heels of their comrades lest they be left behind but fortunately as i came to understand later i did not protest against following pierre out of the cabin although my stomach revolted when we were come to that scene of slaughter  by this time only one of the men was yet alive and he so far gone into the beyond that it was a question whether he remained conscious of his surroundings  the squad had thrown their muskets down in a pile near where they were lounging and i picked up four of the weapons hurrying back to the cabin with them hoping that while i was gone pierre would set about obtaining the ammunition for my heart grew faint as i thought of meddling with those lifeless bodies for the purpose of taking away that which was upon them  put dem under de floor honey whar i stowed horry sims uncle rasmus said as he raised the puncheon plank  so stupid was i even then that i mentally laughed at the idea of taking such precautions when the end had come so near that it was almost as if we were within speaking distance of our friends but i did as the old negro suggested and went back for another load although why it should have been in my mind that we might need more than sufficient to arm ourselves i cannot well explain  when i returned to that scene of carnage pierre had already gathered a goodly assortment of accouterments from those men whose bodies had not been mangled for even he shrank from dyeing his hands with blood  well in short we gathered all the weapons ammunition and accouterments that could be come at handily depositing our burdens beneath the puncheon planks where were the muskets and when the task was finished i turned upon little frenchie feeling almost angry because of having been engaged in such gruesome work as i said  so far as we ourselves are concerned it has been labor lost to bring these things here if so be i am making my way across the lines tonight to carry the tidings that cornwallis has fled i shall travel without encumbrance even the jerseymans pistol will be useless while no enemy remains in the rear  all that is very well little frenchie said with a shrug of the shoulders but before the last of the army has gone muskets may serve us in good stead and even though the need does not arise it is better we should be prepared than taken at a disadvantage which might cost our people dearly  the sudden taking off of so many men directly before our eyes and the knowledge that if the cannon ball had inclined ever so slightly toward the east we instead of them would have gone out from this world forever served not to dampen our joy and triumph but to cast a veil over it as you might say so that we spoke in whispers and did not indulge in mirth but carried ourselves much as people do in the presence of the dead  there was no good reason why all of us lads should linger in the cabin and every cause for us to go forth to keep an eye over the enemy therefore when i said that it stood us in hand to know what was going on even at the expense of losing our breakfast which was not yet cooked pierre seemingly having grown careless insisted that saul should come with us  while our people are working their guns so lively there is no danger those fellows in the loft can make themselves heard and even though they did cry for help i do not believe any of the kings troops would spend time to go to their assistance therefore we will leave them as they are  this did not seem to me consistent with little pierres caution when he gathered up the muskets insisting on taking twice as many as we could use but i held my peace because as i have already set down again and again he had shown himself so much the better lad than i under such circumstances that it was not for me to say him yea or nay     chapter xvii  our blunder   when we went out of old marys cabin leaving the two prisoners unguarded in the loft and uncle rasmus who could not be depended upon in case either of the fellows should succeed in working himself free on the floor below it came into my mind just for an instant that we had no warrant for being so careless yet while the booming of the american cannon was roaring in my ears and the britishers moving to and fro like ants whose nests have been disturbed giving little or no heed to the defense then did i comfort myself with the belief that nothing of harm could come to us  it was in my mind that the hour of our danger had passed and now it was only a question of a short time before our troubles would be over and we in the midst of our friends  then as we walked slowly and unmolested through the encampment seeing on every hand signs and tokens of preparations for flight on the part of the enemy was i yet further convinced that we need not fret ourselves regarding the future save so far as silver heels and sauls mare were concerned i yet had hope that it might be possible to regain possession of our pets as a matter of course there was no idea in my mind that we would be able to do it before cornwalliss army had begun to retreat but i said again and again to myself that if we lads carried the news of the evacuation speedily to our people then would they set off in such hot pursuit that there were many chances i might have silver heels with me but little the worse for her experience in the british army  so thoroughly well satisfied was i that this struggle had come to an end that the britishers were willing to acknowledge themselves beaten and now were only striving to prevent themselves from being taken prisoners that i gave little heed to anything save the hope of being able by the aid of our friends in the american army to regain possession of the dear little colt i even put from my mind as if they did not exist those two scoundrels in the loft of old marys cabin saying to myself that they could do us no harm even though they were set at liberty this very moment because my lord cornwallis had on his mind more important matters than the taking into custody of three boys who might be charged with being spies by a dissolute fellow who could produce no evidence save his own word  we lads spent the entire day roaming here and there throughout the encampment without hindrance and i had even grown so bold that i went up to silver heels while she was tethered on the bank of the river caressing her silky nose as she whinnied with delight at being with me once more  keep up your courage my dear little silver heels i whispered in her ear as if it were possible she could understand me you may have a hard time during the next four and twenty hours but no longer for then i promise you we two shall be on our way to the plantation once there we need have no fear that you will again be disturbed by the redcoats for our general washington of virginia is nigh upon the point of driving the last servant of the king out of this colony  never a man interfered while i was caressing silver heels but little frenchie speedily began to drag me away whispering sharply in my ears  dont get the idea into your mind fitz hamilton that all the danger is passed and strive not to grow reckless in your hour of triumph for this army will not move until after dark and twixt now and then the redcoated soldiers have it within their power to do you a deal of mischief  i was near to laughing at these words of caution thinking how completely the tables were turned between us when it was him who seemingly had grown timorous and i showed myself the venturesome one  saul apparently gave no heed to overcautiousness or impudence but wandered here and there with his hands in his coatpockets as if he was an honored guest and i could well fancy that the lad much the same as forgot all the fears which beset him a short time before  we noted with glee the fact that the britishers were gathering all the boats that could be come at and even from gloucester point did they send over barges and skiffs until the river front was completely lined with small craft  the afternoon was not yet more than half spent before baggage wagons were being loaded into the larger boats i saw more than one officer carrying his belongings down to the river to stow them in this or that craft instead of trusting a soldier to perform the labor as would have been done had matters not been so pressing and if each man who wore a red coat was not looking forward with somewhat of fear to the possibility that the retreating army might be choked before it had gotten well on its way toward new york  as the day drew nearer to a close i became painfully nervous fearing lest something even at this last hour should prevent my lord cornwallis from carrying out his plans and seeing the expression of trouble on my face understanding perhaps from that which was in his own mind little frenchie whispered to me in a tone of encouragement  dont fret yourself fitz hamilton fearing lest the redcoats will not carry out the manoeuvre they only await the coming of night when it will be possible to steal across the river without being seen by our people and then you may set it down as a fact that all these valiant soldiers of the king will make every effort to get out of the way of that french boy who as my lord cornwallis has said is striving to play war with a handful of rebels  then there is in your mind no question but that the retreat is much the same as begun i asked wanting to hear him confirm that which was in my mind  i can see no evidence of their failing to go on as they have begun the lad replied cheerily and added as he dropped his voice to a whisper the one chance which may work against us is that my lord cornwallis will take some steps to prevent any of the people in the village from carrying word regarding his movements to the americans therefore let us get into some place of hiding where we may watch all that goes on here about the river bank without presenting ourselves to the eyes of the redcoats  hardly more than fifty yards from where we were then standing were the ruins of a house which had been literally torn into fragments by shot from the american lines under these splintered and partiallyburned timbers would it be possible for us to find a fairly good hiding place unless peradventure strict search might be made which was not probable because so far as we knew the redcoats had no reason to suspect us as being other than lads whose parents so loved the king that they had been willing to remain in the village of york even during the siege  saul was not at first inclined to go into hiding when pierre told him what we would do he declared that it was putting ourselves to useless trouble for these gentry who wore red coats no longer had the time nor the inclination to concern themselves about us but when little frenchie explained that we might in some way be prevented from carrying early news of the retreat to the american lines then my cousin followed unwillingly mayhap still he kept at our heels until we had wriggled our way beneath the shattered timbers to where it was possible to have a fairly good view of the river  it was not until we had snugly stowed ourselves into this place that i began to realize how great was the danger which menaced our people had the range so well that the buildings roundabout this place were torn and wrecked while now and then a shot came unpleasantly near and i saw two men killed while they were striving to get one of the heavy baggage wagons on board a barge  then i realized that it was more than possible we might never come out from beneath these timbers alive because of having been killed by our own friends the triumph which had been mine was sadly marred by the timorousness which came over me as i understood that death might be nearer at hand than when we were in old marys cabin with abel hunt roaming around the village in search of us  not for anything i owned of worldly goods would i have allowed pierre to know that which was in my mind i strove manfully to drive out the fear by saying to myself that while we remained in the village of york exposed to the fire of our friends we were as safe in one place as another and if it was written we should die that day then did it make little difference what precautions might have been taken  when the sun had set the activity of the redcoats was redoubled in the twilight we who were hiding beneath the ruins could see the officers as they went to and fro hurriedly and hear their sharp words of command or of reproof as they chided this man or that with lingering or strove to incite a squad into more rapid movement  now was my heart beating so loudly and so violently that it was as if even the enemy on the river bank must hear it for i realized that the supreme moment for us of virginia had come and could conjure up nothing which might prevent the britishers from carrying out their plans  i ceased to think of uncle rasmus who had been alone in the cabin all day and gave no heed whatsoever to those scoundrels in the loft forgot all else save the fact that the moment was fast approaching when i would be on my way to the american lines with the most welcome news ever carried by a lad of virginia  it was not until nigh to ten oclock as nearly as i could judge of the flight of time that we saw the first of the boats loaded with men push off heading for gloucester point  the retreat had begun barge after barge skiff after skiff and craft of every kind all heavily laden with soldiers or with baggage set off from the shore while as far back from the river as governor nelsons house where my lord cornwallis had his headquarters the men were massed awaiting their turn  now has come the time fitz when we must make ready for a swift journey little frenchie whispered as if counting it a long distance from old marys cabin to the outposts of the american lines whereas it was within less than half a cannonshot every minute is precious now and i am counting that we should be ready to set off on the instant the men have been called in from the outer works  what preparations have we to make i asked in surprise  have you forgotten uncle rasmus and the prisoners  i count that they are yet in old marys cabin and there they may remain until our people have entered the village i replied indifferently  but none of them have broken their fast this day and those fellows in the loft have had nothing whatsoever of drink  well what then i asked irritably neither have we lads had anything to eat and save that it is possible for us to drink our fill i see not that we are any better off than they  but we must not have ever on our consciences the knowledge that we doomed two human beings to starvation  surely there is no danger of their dying twixt now and tomorrow and by that time our people will be here  as to that you cannot say fitz hamilton true it is the enemy is retreating but the night is half spent and it may be that the last of the troops will not have gone over much before daylight then our army is like to set out in pursuit and i am minded to go with it whereas matters be arranged properly at the cabin we are confined here in the village with no opportunity of showing ourselves as minute boys among real soldiers  i had almost forgotten that we decided to call ourselves minute boys there had been so much of pain fear and hope during the past four and twenty hours that all else had gone from my mind save the fact that the britishers were much the same as whipped and that it might be possible for me to regain possession of silver heels  when however pierre thus reminded me that we might even at this eleventh hour do something toward showing ourselves worthy of being called minute boys although we really accomplished nothing more then was i fired with the same desire that was in his mind  although as i have said many times i had little knowledge of military matters it appeared to me that as soon as it was learned the redcoats had crossed over to gloucester our people would by using the boats and vessels which were lying in the stream twixt york and williamsburg cross directly over to the other shore without coming down through the village for thus they might circle around the advance of the retreating foe  in the meanwhile both encampments would be in the hands of such tories as had remained throughout the siege and most like a certain number of camp followers would linger behind  what can be done with uncle rasmus i asked anxiously fearing lest it might be necessary we take him with us and thus have a drag on our movements for the old man could not travel very swiftly but little frenchie had the matter already mapped out in his mind as i might have understood and replied  it has been decided that you shall go on a westerly course while carrying word across the lines and therefore it is i propose you take uncle rasmus with you once beyond the enemys works where there is no danger either tory or camp follower can molest him set the old fellows face toward the hamilton plantation and let him plod his way on alone for there is naught of danger on that road  but the prisoners i asked  they must be set free else will it become our duty to remain here instead of joining in the pursuit  when do you count that should be done i asked and much to my surprise little frenchie replied thoughtfully  there is no reason why we should not begin at once and every inducement for us to have our preparations made for a quick departure from the town suppose you go back and attend to it within the hour we must be on our way for when those boatmen who have just put off come back and take on another cargo then is the retreat much the same as accomplished for by that time every soldier from the works roundabout will be called in  because of the past when pierre had shown himself so quickwitted and having such a good idea of military matters i made no protest against his proposition but stood ready to obey implicitly any orders he might give therefore i asked how he had it in his mind we should release the prisoners for i was not burning to go into the loft and set abel hunt free because of knowing that the first of us lads with whom that scoundrel came in contact when he was at liberty to use his hands would suffer most severely  pierre had it all planned out and as i believed in a most skillful manner he proposed that after uncle rasmus had left the building and had gotten say twenty or thirty yards on his road toward the hamilton plantation i should bring horry sims down to the lower floor and there set him free with instructions for him to remain where he was a certain length of time after which he was to go up and release abel hunt  before this could be done i ought to be well toward the enemys outer works where i was to remain in hiding until all the britishers had left their posts this would give me the advantage of starting instantly the works were abandoned and even before the last of the army had embarked therefore was it reasonable to suppose i might gain speech with some of the officers of our army while there was yet time to draw the nets around the fleeing redcoats  i will go whenever you shall say the word was my reply after little frenchie had explained thoroughly the plan but what is saul to do in the meanwhile  i am counting that when you start for old marys cabin he shall set off further to the eastward where he will remain hidden as i propose you are to do until the works have been abandoned  and you yourself pierre  i am counting to wait here only until i see the boatmen return from the gloucester shore to take on another cargo and then i shall follow your example giving no heed however to either you or saul but bending all my energies toward getting within the lines of our people with as little loss of time as may be  after this there was nothing for me to say unless peradventure i had some fault to find with the plan and i lingered only to press each of my comrades by the hand as i whispered  god grant that we minute boys of york town as from this instant we will call ourselves may be able to do that thing tonight which will result in the capture of lord cornwallis and all his troops  then i crept out from the shattered timbers not taking overly great care to avoid making a noise for there were none who would pay particular attention to me at that time and once free of the ruins i walked without undue haste in the direction of old marys cabin knowing that i had ample time to do all which was set me before the way into the american lines would be opened  when i entered the cabin uncle rasmus was seated by the window as he ever had been since we came into this place of refuge patiently waiting for our coming and surely the old mans heart must have been tried during that long long day when we failed to give any token of our whereabouts for he had good reason to fear because of our continued absence that some trouble had overtaken us yet there was never a word of repining or reproach upon his lips when i showed myself  bress de lawd honey bress de lawd dat youse come back whars de odder chillun  i speedily made the old man acquainted with all that was going on but did not tell him what it was proposed he and i should do for luckily i realized that abel hunts ears were open and if i should advertise all our proposed movements there might possibly be a chance of his overtaking us to wreak revenge before our task could be finished  therefore it was i told the old man only that the british army was retreating and made an overly long story because he could not refrain from crying out in his joy now and again and insisted on hearing all the little details concerning the movements of the soldiers  but the story was told finally however and then i led the old man out of the cabin he following me obediently never asking where we were going and when we had come to a ruined building mayhap fifty yards distant from old marys cabin i halted explained what we would do saying that he should stay there while i went back and released the prisoners  for the first time in my life uncle rasmus set his face against that which i would do he declared that pierre was in the wrong when he would handle the tories so tenderly that our first and only thought should be of our own safety and no heed be given to the sufferings of those who would have sent us to the gallows  i was not able to argue successfully with the old negro because there was in my mind much the same thought as in his yet did i know that the fellows must be set free since it was a portion of pierres plan i had promised him it should be done and if i failed in my part of the work then might all the rest go awry it was to my mind a question of doing exactly as the little lad had planned or else let him understand that i was set against a certain portion of it  all this i said to uncle rasmus striving to make him understand clearly why i must go on even though it was against my inclination and when i was finally come to an end the old man said in a tone of resignation  well honey ise lowin youse gwine to do jes as dat yere little french boy says but ise tellin you chile dat de only way to treat dese yere tories is de way you treat a rattlesnake an dat is to get em on de end ob a split stick an leabe em dere widout worryin yo head ef deys habin it comfortable or not  ill go back and do as ive promised uncle rasmus you stay here and in five minutes i shall return unless something unfortunate happens  keep your eye mighty sharp on dat abel hunt chile don let him get de best ob you no how kase hes slippery an like de rattler hes gwine to strike when you ain lookin for it  im not counting on having any trouble whatsoever with abel uncle rasmus horry sims is to do that part of it as i have told you  then i went hurriedly away feeling ill at ease on this errand of mercy because of the old negros insistence that it was dangerous and bordered on folly to set loose such as abel hunt when we had him trussed up where it was not possible for him to do any mischief  i hastened back to old marys cabin and halting not on the floor below went directly into the loft where cutting the bonds that held horry simss feet i ordered him to follow me down the ladder at that moment i would had it not been for uncle rasmuss warning have taken the gag from abel hunts mouth that he might be saved just so many more moments of suffering but having in mind all the old negro had advanced as an argument against showing such mercy i withheld my hand and horry sims followed me in surprise and bewilderment at this sudden change in affairs as obediently as a well whipped cur would have done  it had been pierres command that i bring the tory lad down to the floor below there set him free and then make my escape but because of the doubts in my heart i exceeded little frenchies instructions by leading him some distance say an hundred feet from the cabin before telling him what were my intentions  you are to go back now and release abel hunt i said after having explained to him as much as i thought necessary although i took care to have the lad understand that his british friends were retreating  and after that has been done horry asked as if counting that he must continue to obey me however the circumstances might be changed  when you have released abel you may go whithersoever you please  and do you count that the time will never come fitzroy hamilton when i can repay you saul ogden and that french boy for what you have done the young tory cried as soon as i had removed the bonds from his hands his courage reviving immediately he was free of limb and the anger which he had been bottling up while he was helpless pouring from his mouth in a torrent of words as he threatened this that and the other which should come to me and mine  i have no care as to what you can do horry sims i said holding him by the shoulder so he should not be able to leave until i had given him due warning remember you this that the next time you come across my path with any intent of evil or with any token that you would raise your hand against me from that moment what you have already suffered as a prisoner will be as nothing compared with the punishment we lads will deal out now that your friends the britishers are being driven from the soil of virginia your fangs are gone if you have any commonsense in that tory head of yours you will keep a still tongue and never raise your hand against any of the people in this colony  then i released the cur and watched for an instant to see that he went straight back toward the cabin after which i turned about to rejoin uncle rasmus and at that instant it was as if all nature had suddenly been convulsed  because of my excitement and owing to the fact that i was so intent upon that which was to be done i had given no heed to the tokens in the sky and the clouds may have been gathering half an hour or more without my knowledge certain it is however that on the instant and suddenly as the lightnings flash came the roar of a tempest that shook the halfruined houses nearabout until the last timbers were overthrown and i was forced to exert all my strength in order to stand against that furious blast then came peal upon peal of thunder which drowned the roaring of the guns for our people were yet firing upon the doomed village in order to show the britishers that they were on the alert  the vibration of the thunder had hardly died away when the lightning flashed great sheets of flame across the eastern sky illumining the river whereon boats were plying to and fro and showing clear as in a mirror the redcoats massed upon the banks awaiting their turn to go across to gloucester point  after that came a downpour of water when the wind drove the raindrops in solid sheets as you might say which stung ones face like thousands of needles the roaring of thunder for after the first outburst of the tempest it seemed to be almost continuous the blinding flashes of light together with the deluge of water all served to confuse one and i believe i stood there struggling against the elements to hold my footing a full minute before gathering my wits sufficiently to turn about in order to rejoin uncle rasmus  for de lawds sake honey am de earth turnin upside down the old man cried when i came to where he stood exposed to all the fury of the tempest for he dared not remain amid the ruins of the building where great timbers were being flung about by the wind like straws whats ginral cornwallis gone done to bring on dis yere terble racket  i have released the tories uncle rasmus i shouted forced to speak close in his ear else he could not have heard me why should we not push on even as pierre has planned for us to do  was you gwine to tell our people dat de britishers were takin to dere heels for gloucester point uncle rasmus asked as if having forgotten all that i had told him  of course that is the story why else should it be necessary for us to make such haste  den stay whar you are honey deres gwine to be no retreatin dis yere night  what do you mean i asked in bewilderment almost fancying the old man had taken leave of his senses we saw a portion of the army go across  ise lowin all dat honey but yer uncle rasmus am tellin yer dat dere wont any odder britishers go ober dis yere night ise libed right erlong dis riber all my life an i knows dere ain de bigges skiff eber was built dat could make a landin on de gloucester shore sence dis yere storm got up ginral cornwallis am boun to put an end to dat ere fun ob his kase he cant get across honey ise tellin yer he cant get across not till dis yere racket done died away an den deres boun fo to be a ragin torrent  it was not until several moments had passed that i realized the truth of all uncle rasmus had said then was borne in upon me the memory of what i had seen in ordinary hurricanes when the river had been lashed into a fury by the wind and the ablest boatmen along the shore dare not put out for i venture to say there is no other body of water in this country so quickly changed to a boiling flood or so dangerous to cross as that portion of the york river which turns around gloucester point  while i stood there in painful indecision tears of disappointment rolling down my cheeks because at the very moment our time of triumph was apparently come it was turned aside by the elements themselves i saw as the electric flashes lighted up the sky even more brilliantly than before two forms come out of old marys cabin and set off in the direction of governor nelsons house where my lord cornwallis made his headquarters  there go abel hunt and horry sims i cried bitterly the tempest is as nothing to them so that they may lodge a charge against us as being spies to the end that we may come to the gallows here in this village of york  hab dey done gone out ob de cabin honey uncle rasmus cried and when i repeated again that which i had seen the old man said as he held my head down to his mouth that no word might be swept aside by the furious blast  youse boun to go back honey boun to go back inter de house kase when de mornin comes youse gwine to be in a pickle wid abel hunt an horry sims gallivantin roun tryin to lay you by de heels go back in dar fore dey comes dis yere way  but why should we go there uncle rasmus i cried angrily why shut ourselves up in a trap where the britishers may lay hands on us whenever they may be so disposed  youse gwine back dar honey kase dere ain any odder place in dis yere village deres no show ob gettin trou de lines now chile an what youse needin is dem yere guns what we done hid under de floor  youre crazy uncle rasmus youre crazy to think we three lads may stand up against all these britishers and now indeed did i lose my temper but uncle rasmus still holding my head where he could make certain every word he spoke might be heard by me said earnestly  tell me whars you gwine to go honey ef you don hide yoursef in ole marys cabin does you count on bein run roun dis yere village when de sun comes up like a fox wid a houn at his tail ef de britishers hab begun to get across to gloucester point deres a chance deyll keep at it when de riber quiets down an all you chilluns needin to do is keep whar you can hol your own get back inter de cabin honey  then it was that uncle rasmus took me by the arm with a strength which i never suspected was in his frail body and although i struggled not he literally dragged me through that howling raging tempest to the hovel which i thought i had left never to return and we two entered the water running in streams from our garments as we stood in the middle of the floor silent and motionless each striving most like to decide what should next be done     chapter xviii  trapped   uncle rasmus and i were still standing on the puncheon floor in the darkness of old marys cabin when the door was suddenly thrown open and in came pierre and saul bringing with them such an onrush of water as the rain swept through the opening that it seemed as if the hovel must soon be flooded  thank heaven you did not start as i counted on pierre cried in a tone of relief as he set about barricading the door to keep out the elements and i cried bitterly remembering that if i had heeded uncle rasmuss advice we would not be in such great peril  the storm came in time to prevent us from making an effort to get through the lines but not sufficiently soon to stop us from setting loose that miserable scoundrel abel hunt and the sneak horry sims  what saul cried in a tone of mingled surprise and dismay are they at liberty  surely they are for i obeyed pierres orders to the letter despite all uncle rasmus could say against it the old man has more sense in his black head than we for he declared that such scoundrels should be treated like rattlers and no heed given to their possible sufferings  then are we undone saul cried helplessly the retreat has been prevented by this tempest for no boat can live on the river while the storm rages as it does and we know without being told that cornwallis will not attempt to send more troops across at least until another night has come in the meanwhile abel hunt and horry sims will have laid us by the heels as they have threatened to do it is only a matter of accusing us of striving to get across the lines to tell our people what has been done when lord cornwallis will make certain we come to a speedy end  i believe even little frenchie was daunted for the moment as he came to realize what our blunder for it was not less might mean but he strove manfully to repress any show of fear as he said in what he counted should be a cheery tone  i dare venture to say that neither redcoat nor tory will go abroad this night while the storm is so furious therefore we had best make ourselves as comfortable as possible and he set about kindling a fire for surely it was needed that we might dry our clothing which had been thoroughly saturated  we will take our comfort for the last time saul said bitterly as he threw himself down upon the floor like one from whom all hope has fled and uncle rasmus for the first time since we had left the hamilton plantation seeming to count himself as one of us lads said in a tone of deepest satisfaction  ef its de las time honey well make it mighty oncomfortable for whoever comes to drive us off kase wese inside our own fortifications an ise lowin dat ef de americans keep it up as lively tomorrow as dey did dis yere day den can we hol de fort quite a spell afore dey work dere will  it was this remark which showed pierre laurens the single ray of light remaining for us and ceasing his task of building the fire he sprang excitedly to his feet as he cried joyously  uncle rasmus is right cornwallis has begun to retreat and sent a portion of his troops to the other shore now hes weaker than before and if we can hold our own in this cabin four and twenty hours then is there good reason to believe the americans will have possession of york town if we made a blunder in freeing the prisoners it was not so great as that which my lord cornwallis has made because of not first looking at the signs of the weather before he began to move his forces when day breaks our people must see what has been done and seeing will strive to take every advantage we will hold this fort and it must be that some power beyond that of earth paved the way for our safety else had we not been provided with weapons and ammunition through the death of the redcoats who were shirking their duty we may hold quite a force of the enemy for a considerable time  how long can you hold your own in this miserable hovel with two of three hundred britishers surrounding it saul cried and pierre added yet more cheerily  do you believe for an instant saul ogden that while matters are so bad with him general cornwallis will call off three or four hundred soldiers to obey the behest of such as abel hunt even though he may believe all that scoundrel can tell him he has other fish to fry than that of capturing three boys and a negro i tell you lads we are not beaten yet for within four and twenty hours there will be a wondrous change come over this village of york and even though the britishers may not have been taken our forces seeing the advantage that can be gained will advance their earthworks when theres a chance we shall be able to get word to them  this caused me to have what for the instant i believed to be a brilliant thought and straightway i cried out  why is not now the time when we might have speech with our people while the tempest rages as it does i dare venture to say it will be possible to cross the british lines  less possible than if the moon was shining the redcoats will be in their works and along the intrenchments to screen themselves from the storm instead of moving around and therefore you have no chance of making your way across it would be death to attempt it  and it is very near like death to stay here  in this cabin we may die fighting as minute boys should which to my mind is far better than being killed like rats in a ditch as would be the fate of him who attempted now to cross the lines the redcoats in yonder fortifications are not fools every man jack of them understands that this attempted retreat is a failure and must of a necessity be yet more keenly on the alert therefore i say you had best have tried to get across the lines this morning in the light of day than just now when cornwalliss troops are smarting under what is very much like signal defeat  i was silenced if not convinced by what pierre had said yet did not resign myself to the inevitable as a lad of virginia should have done  instead of accepting the consequences of our blunder with cheerful face as pierre and uncle rasmus were doing i threw myself down by the side of saul in sulky humor never offering to lend a hand toward putting the cabin in a state of defense until the old negro and little frenchie had worked desperately ten minutes or more after the fire was kindled to barricade the door  then it was i grew ashamed of myself realized what a miserable part i was playing i who had conceived the idea of forming a company of minute boys with the thought that i might stand at their head and springing up i joined pierre and uncle rasmus until saul in turn taking shame did his part  first we tore from the floor of the loft the heavy puncheon planks which were laid across the beams but not fastened in place and with them as props and bars fastened the door that the side of the building itself would yield to pressure from without before would that barrier strengthened as we had succeeded in strengthening it  then we fastened planks across the windows forced to tie them in place with strips which formed the bonds that held abel hunt and horry sims helpless for we had nothing else with which to work and after all that had been done we made a rude platform just beneath where the roof of the building had been torn away by a cannon ball so that one of us could stand sentinel watching the approach of the enemy and give due warning of his coming  this done we took from beneath the floor the muskets loaded each and portioned out the cartridges fairly giving to every one his share after which at pierres suggestion we made a hearty meal of the last fragments of food in our possession  when my stomach was fairly well filled then did there come back to me that courage under which i should never have lost hope  there was no token that the storm might be losing its force in fact it seemed to me as if it increased momentarily if indeed such could be the case when the wind was raging the rain falling and the thunder pealing as i had never heard or seen it before  it was almost as if we were in a ship at sea so violently did old marys cabin rock to and fro under that mighty blast and there were many times before the coming of morning when i really believed the hovel would be rent asunder by the wind and we deprived of this seemingly our last opportunity to sell our lives at somewhat of a fair price  when we had made ready our defense so far as was possible and had satisfied our hunger uncle rasmus would have it that we lads should lie down to sleep trusting him to stand guard over us but never one among our company was willing to act upon the suggestion for what fellow could have slept with the elements raging and roaring without while he knew full well what must be before him when the sun rose again  it was not even possible for us to seek repose but all three paced to and fro from one end of the small room to the other as if by thus remaining in motion we could the better hold in check our fears and our forebodings  before we were aware that the new day was breaking it was possible to hear dimly as though far away in the distance the roar of the american cannon drowned at times by the howling of the hurricane and pierre cried as if those detonations were promises of safety for us  could anything be working more to our advantage lad it must be that our people understand somewhat of that which was done last night for they are sending their iron messengers into this village with more of fury and determination than since the siege began  i failed to understand how it could advantage us greatly even though our people made a direct assault as i said to pierre but the lad could not well answer me and i understood when he held his peace that he had simply cried out in the hope of heartening us  then i listened intently for noises from the outside and unable to distinguish between the roar of the cannon and the pealing of the thunder proposed that i be the first to go on watch in the loft above for i was burning to be able to see something other than the four walls of that miserable hovel  no one said me nay and with two of the loaded muskets so that i might be able to shoot twice in rapid succession if need arose i clambered up the ladder into the attic where abel hunt and horry sims had spent so many and such painful hours  it was not yet sunrise but the light of the coming day was sufficient to enable me to see surrounding objects and yet i could perceive no change in the disposition of the british troops  overhead the clouds were rolling swiftly in token that the terrific tempest had wellnigh spent its force and i said to myself that when the rain ceased to fall in such torrents then would abel hunt and horry sims present themselves knowing full well where we would take refuge in event of having failed to make our way outside the lines  the hurricane ceased almost as quickly as it had begun it was as if the rising sun stilled the wind and caused the rain to cease for within half an hour as i now remember all nature was at peace but man was yet struggling and with desperation to kill his brother  never had the guns within our lines been served so rapidly never was cannonading continued so long nor had such great destruction followed as a result  while yet i stood looking out i had a view of our governor nelsons mansion which cornwallis had taken possession of and speedily saw that the americans must be using it as a target for in as many seconds a dozen balls struck the building or passed close to it and i could well fancy that governor nelson himself must be directing or agreeing to the destruction of his own beautiful home for i had learned during my visit to williamsburg when i went out to aid the jerseyman that the governor himself was leading the virginia militia  when the first ball struck that stone mansion tearing away the walls until two of the upper windows were made into one i saw the redcoated officers pour out like wasps from their nests and scatter in every direction at which sight i laughed aloud in my glee rejoicing that the enemy were finding themselves in quite as disagreeable a situation as we lads who were waiting with as much of courage as we could command for the coming of those soldiers who would drag us off to the gallows most like without even the formality of a trial because affairs had come to such a dangerous pitch with my lord cornwallis  i believe the day was no more than an hour old and the fire from the american guns had not slackened but continued to do quite as much execution as when i first took my post that i saw in the distance coming toward us but unattended those two scoundrels who were bent upon our destruction  leaning over so that my voice might carry the better to the floor below i cried  here come abel hunt and horry sims  how many redcoats have they with them saul asked  they are alone but carry muskets  then it was pierre shouted triumphantly  it is as i told you my lord cornwallis has other fish to fry than the taking into custody of three boys who may or may not be spies but who can do him no harm at this late day those scoundrels may tell their story wheresoever they please in this village of york but no one will give heed to them while our people are making matters so hot  i could not quite agree with little frenchie in this because of believing that the curs might find here and there among the privates one who would like nothing better in the way of pleasure than the smoking out of a rebel and i strained my eyes in every direction that i might have ample warning of the approach of the soldiers yet none appeared  those who were in the fortifications had quite as much on their hands as could be attended to just then if they would preserve their lives while those off duty were by no means inclined to come within the line of fire i also understood that there must be considerable of confusion arising from the fact that a portion of the army and a goodly part of the baggage was already on the gloucester side  while believing that an attack would not be made upon us by considerable numbers i grew brave at seeing only hunt and horry coming toward the cabin and hailed them by shouting  i am giving fair warning that if either of you come a dozen paces nearer we shall fire  the two halted and abel hunt cried derisively pointing out to horry sims my head which appeared above the splintered timbers of the roof  there is one of the rebels who has come to the end of his rope and before this day closes we will see him dancing on nothing  to this i made no reply and before the scoundrel had ceased speaking pierre laurens was at my side resting his musket upon one of the logs in order the better to take aim  are you going to shoot them down without warning i cried in what was very like alarm and he replied in a matteroffact tone  you have already given sufficient warning and if i can drop either of them now we shall have one the less to fight  he discharged his musket as he ceased speaking and the ball missing the target passed so close to abel hunts head that the fellow leaped back at least six paces and then wheeling about ran like a frightened rabbit followed by horry until the two were beyond musketshot when they halted as if to take counsel  after mayhap a full minute they went away in the direction of the westerly redoubt and we stood there speculating as to what might be their purpose in thus seemingly abandoning the attack before it was really made when they reappeared leading five soldiers and then did i understand that that which i feared had come to pass most like by representing to these redcoats that a bit of sport could be had by smoking out four rebels they succeeded in persuading some of the more dissolute ones to join them and now was our moment of trial come  now we shall have a taste of their metal and they shall know what we can do pierre said grimly his lips tightly shut and an expression on his face such as i have never seen him wear the time has come fitz for you and me to go to the floor below  why should not one of us stay here to keep watch i asked impatient in my nervous fear  because he who stands in this place offers too fair a target for yonder rebel hunters and i am not counting they shall draw virginia blood until we have left our mark upon some of their scurvy bodies  i was not pleased at the idea of stationing all our force at one point for surely it seemed necessary those who were defending the cabin should know what was going on outside but pierre was so insistent and so commanding in his tone that even though it was his blunder which had thus trapped us i could not disobey  there were loopholes in plenty for us four and we counted uncle rasmus among our number between the puncheon planks which had been tied at the windows and even twixt the logs of the building itself we could thrust the muzzles of our muskets and when pierre who took command of the company without question had stationed us to his satisfaction he said as he walked once around the room like a general surveying his troops  do not fire until the enemy are so near that you can make certain of hitting the target and then shoot to do harm we are trapped here and will pay the forfeit if we fall into the hands of yonder men and lads for there will be no question of military trial or even of reporting our capture to lord cornwallis remember that our lives depend upon your aim  it so chanced that pierre himself was the first to open the battle if such it could be called abel hunt walked side by side with the soldiers as they advanced at easy pace but i noted that horry sims hung back as if he had no stomach for such work as was evidently before him and when the company were come within mayhap fifty paces pierre shouted shrilly  halt where you are or we shall fire and there is little chance of a bullets going amiss at such close range  just for an instant i fancied the redcoats wavered and certain it is abel hunt nimbly sprang back behind the man at whose side he had been walking but the soldiers themselves kept on and before i could have counted five little frenchie fired  one of the britishers plunged forward and then sprawled out on the ground looking there like a clot of blood because of the color of his uniform the other four continued at a steady pace when i fired wounding one of them in the leg so sorely that he was fain to turn tail and beat a retreat for the redoubt  this last shot brought all the wouldbe rebel hunters to a halt and i had taken up my second musket counting to send another ball among them when they wheeled suddenly about while pierre clutching me by the shoulder said hurriedly  do not shoot a man in the back thus far we have but defended ourselves and will not shed blood needlessly it may be they have got a full dose and we are done with them for the time being  don let dat idee run away wid you chile uncle rasmus cried in quavering tones once a britisher hab done trapped sich as we hes boun to keep up de sport  i myself believed uncle rasmus spoke the truth for it did not seem possible these soldiers of the king would allow themselves to be beaten off so suddenly more particularly since one of their number lay at full length on the ground in front of us apparently unable to move  pierre and i reloaded the muskets which had been discharged and then during ten minutes or more we stood with our eyes glued to the crevices between the puncheon planks watching for the next token of danger while all around the cannon of the americans roared and thundered sending across the village balls and flaming bombs until it was as if we had above our heads a veritable roof of flying deadly missiles  when mayhap ten minutes had passed we received good proof that uncle rasmus was in the right for then from out the redoubt came a squad of redcoats no less than twenty i should say and tailing on behind them seemingly not eager to occupy any post of danger were abel hunt and horry sims  it looks to me as if our race was wellnigh run saul said grimly and even in that time of deadly peril did my heart go out in rejoicing toward the lad whose courage revived at seemingly the very moment when his doom was sealed  this last force of the enemy was not disposed to venture as carelessly as had the first for while they were yet a musketshot distant they separated into three squads two of which made a wide detour around both ends of the cabin taking good care meanwhile to keep out of range and the third halted in their tracks evidently waiting until their comrades had taken up such positions as had previously been decided upon  they are going around to the back of the cabin and most like count on attacking us through the roof for it must be plain to them even at such a distance that the hovel has been shattered by cannon balls pierre said and i leaped toward the ladder whereupon he sprang after me counting on pulling me back as he said almost angrily  that is my place fitz hamilton it was i who caused us to be trapped by advising that the prisoners be set free at such an early hour and i am the one who shall go into the loft  because it is a place of greater danger i cried still swarming up the shaky bars of wood which were nailed across the side of the building and when i was come to what was left of the floor above i threatened to throw pierre down if he attempted to join me  i have shown the white feather more than once since we have been in this town of york and now am i determined to prove whether i be a coward or no i cried shrilly hardly knowing what i said for the imminence of the danger had stirred me into a fever and once more in my life did i see a reddish hue before my eyes while my one desire was to kill those who counted on speedily overcoming us you are needed below pierre where some execution may be done and i shall take my stand here  even while speaking could i hear sounds from the rear of the cabin as if the soldiers were piling up timbers or something of that sort to make their way to the roof and although it was borne in upon me clearly that within a few seconds most like i would be struggling hand to hand with men who had been trained in the art of warfare yet i set it down as true that never did there come into my heart the slightest idea of wavering or of fear yet that may not be put to my credit for as i said before the fever of battle had seized upon me and i burned to see the first redcoated scoundrel show himself at the aperture in the roof that i might send a bullet into his worthless carcass  suddenly and so far as i could judge before those in the rear had been able to gain a position on the roof fire was opened upon us from the front and on the instant it was returned by our lads with such spirit that at once dense clouds of smoke from burning powder came up through the scuttle parching my throat and rendering it difficult for me to keep my eyes free from the blinding tears of irritation which filled them  i was yet saying to myself that the britishers had not succeeded in gaining a foothold upon the roof when suddenly i saw the muzzle of a musket through the crevices of the logs where as yet the timbers remained intact and immediately came the report of a weapon as a bullet whistled past my cheek cutting the lightest furrow in the skin and causing the blood to flow as if i had been grievously wounded  i had yet sufficient of sense remaining to understand that by staying longer in the loft if they were counting on shooting at me through the crevices of the logs i would sacrifice my life without being able to make any reprisals and stopping only long enough to fire in the direction where i had seen the musket i dropped to the floor below explaining hurriedly to pierre why i had seemingly retreated  it is all over with us the dear lad said and would have examined the wound on my face no less than a dozen more men have come from the redoubt and we can only sell our lives as dearly as possible  then it was the fever of battle so far left me that there was room in my heart for fear and while taking my stand by the side of the other lads believing firmly that within the next few minutes i should be dead or wounded unto death i contrived to hold command over my knees so no one might see i had again grown cowardly  then it was when all of us were as you might say resigned to death that we suddenly heard the parley sounded by drums all along the lines and straightway those redcoats who were facing us counting to hound us to death wheeled about making for the redoubt while we stood looking at each other in bewilderment until pierre shouted at the full strength of his lungs  a parley a parley my lord cornwallis has sounded the parley which means that he is ready to surrender he who came to drive us from off the soil of virginia is now wanting to make terms with the rebels  it was indeed as the lad had said from the moment the drums were heard all fighting ceased and where had been such a tumult and a roaring as drowned all other sounds silence fell  it was like some work of magic those who had been thirsting for each others blood threw down their arms men no longer shouted in anger never a weapon was discharged and in both the armies every one seemingly stood silent and motionless awaiting the result of this flourish of drums  there is no good reason why i should continue this story of the minute boys of york town for there can be no doubt but that every one who reads what i have written knows full well all that happened there on the york river from the time parley was sounded until the vast army of redcoats were held prisoners in the hands of the rebels  in writing the closing lines let me set down that which happened some time after my lord cornwallis surrendered lest he who has read thus far may think i am taking too much credit to my comrades and myself by calling ourselves minute boys  no less a soldier than general lafayette himself told us four for we insisted on having uncle rasmus with us when an orderly came to say that the young french general would speak with those who had befriended the jerseymaneven general lafayette himself told us that we had done in coming to the town of york that which advantaged the cause and asked what should be given us by way of reward  then it was that pierre speaking to him in his native tongue told how we lads would have formed a company of minute boys but for the fact that we were shut up in the town of york and asked that we be allowed despite our age to enroll ourselves as soldiers under his command  this prayer he readily granted claiming that he was pleased to do so and from then on we served as real soldiers although as you know full well the war was nigh to being ended  it was general lafayette who reclaimed for saul and me our horses when after the surrender i rode out with my father to see my dear mother silver heels was the beast that carried me and from that day to this we have never been parted although she is getting now so far along in years that i fear death may soon step in and do that which the britishers failed of doing                                       it is to be regretted that he who set down the movements of those lads who took upon themselves the name of minute boys despite the smallness of their numbers did not tell what part they played in the surrender of cornwallis which must have been a magnificent military spectacle and because he has brought his story to an end without giving any of the details it seems well to set down here that which has been written concerning it by the historian fiske  the combination against cornwallis had been completed and day by day the lines were drawn more closely about the doomed army yorktown was invested and on the 6th of october the first parallel was opened by general lincoln on the 14th the second parallel within three hundred yards of the enemys works was opened by steuben on the night of the 14th alexander hamilton and the baron de viomenil carried two of the british redoubts by storm on the next night the british made a gallant but fruitless sortie by noon of the 16th their works were fast crumbling to pieces under the fire of seventy cannon on the 17ththe fourth anniversary of burgoynes surrendercornwallis hoisted the white flag  the terms of the surrender were like those of lincolns at charleston the british army became prisoners of war subject to the ordinary rules of exchange the only delicate question related to the american loyalists in the army whom cornwallis felt it was wrong to leave in the lurch this point was neatly disposed of by allowing him to send a ship to sir henry clinton with news of the catastrophe and to embark in it such troops as he might think proper to send to new york and no questions asked  on a little matter of etiquette the americans were more exacting the practice of playing the enemys tunes had always been cherished as an inalienable prerogative of british soldiery and at the surrender of charleston in token of humiliation general lincolns army had been expressly forbidden to play any but an american tune colonel laurens who conducted the negotiations directed that lord cornwalliss sword should be received by general lincoln and that the army on marching out to lay down its arms should play a british or a german air  there was no help for it and on the 19th of october cornwalliss army 7247 in number with 840 cannon marched out with colors furled and cased while the band played a quaint old english melody of which the significant title was the world turned upside down  on the very same day that cornwallis surrendered sir henry clinton having received naval reinforcements sailed from new york with twentyfive shipsoftheline and ten frigates and 7000 of his best troops five days brought him to the mouth of the chesapeake where he learned that he was too late as had been the case four years before when he tried to relieve burgoyne a fortnight earlier this force could hardly have failed to alter the result for the fleet was strong enough to dispute with grasse the control over the coast   the end
