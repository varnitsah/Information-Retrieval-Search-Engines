itself but forms the second volume in a line issued under the general title the second rover boys series for young americans  as mentioned in several volumes of the first series this line was started a number of years ago with the publication of the rover boys at school on the ocean and in the jungle in those volumes my young readers were introduced to dick tom and sam rover  the volumes of the first series related the adventures of the three rover boys while attending putnam hall military academy brill college and while on numerous outings  these rover boys were of course growing steadily older they met three young ladies in whom they became intensely interested and after becoming established in business three happy marriages followed presently dick rover was blessed with a son and a daughter as was also his brother sam while the funloving tom became the proud father of twin boys who were as full of spirit as their parent had ever been at first the boys were kept at home but then it was thought best to send them to a boarding school  at colby hall the young rovers made a host of friends and also some enemies they had to work hard over their studies but they had a thoroughly good time  in the present volume the boys are still at colby hall but presently the scene is shifted to snowshoe island where the lads go for a short hunting season how they ran into a most unusual mystery and helped an old lumberman to establish his claim to the island i will leave the pages which follow to relate  in conclusion i wish to thank my numerous readers for the many kind things they have said about these rover boys books and especially about the initial volume in the second series i trust that all my readers will like jack andy and randy and fred as much as they did dick tom and sam rover    affectionately and sincerely yours   edward stratemeyer     contents   chapter                                      page          i  fun on the ice                       1        ii

strap cried fred rover as he bent down to adjust the loosened bit of leather  hurry up fred we dont want to stand here all day sang out his cousin andy gaily  thats it i want to win this race broke in randy rover andys twin brother  now remember the race is to be to the old white pine and back announced the starter every contestant has got to touch the tree before he starts to come back otherwise hell be counted out  you ought to have a pistol to start us with came from jack rover  i guess my old locomotive whistle will do for that answered frank newberry he paused to look at the line of skaters now then everybody on the job and a loud whistle rent the air  instantly there was a scurry of skates and off the line started across clearwater lake to where a blasted pine tree reared its naked trunk against the skyline  it was a saturday afternoon in early winter and the cadets of colby hall military academy were out in force to enjoy themselves on the smooth ice of the lake near which the school was located the cadets had been amusing themselves in various ways playing tag and hockey and in snapping the whip as it is called when gif garrison at the head of the athletic association had suggested a race  we might as well find out who is the best skater in the school gif had said  right you are had come from his particular chum spouter powell let us get up a race by all means  with so many cadets who could skate well it was an easy matter to arrange for the contest to make the matter more interesting one of the hall professors mr brice said he would give some prizes to the pupils coming in first second and third  ill give a fine book of adventures to the first cadet and also books to the others mr brice announced he was still a young man and in hearty sympathy with everything in the way of outdoor sports  among those to enter the contest were jack rover and his three cousins fred andy and randy all were provided with hockey skates and each felt confident of making a good record for himself yet they all knew that the school boasted of some fine skaters one lad in particular dan soppinger having won several contests on the ice in years gone by  weve got our work cut out for us cried fred rover as he skated beside jack  save your wind fred answered his cousin briefly  believe me this is going to be some race came from randy who was on the other side of jack with his twin brother next to him  i dont care who wins so long as im not last responded his twin merrily  over twenty cadets had started in the contest and soon the line which had been fairly even for a few seconds after the whistle had sounded began to take on a straggly appearance as some skaters forged ahead and others fell behind  dont give up everybody keep in the race until the finish cried professor brice encouragingly remember a race isnt over until the end is reached  thus encouraged those who were in the rear did their best to overtake those ahead but gradually the skaters divided into three groups eight in the lead six but a short distance behind them and the others several yards further to the rear  in the front group were jack and his cousin randy while fred and andy were less than ten feet behind  the distance across clearwater lake was about half a mile but the blasted pine tree was located some distance down the shore so that the race would be close to a mile and a half in length  spouter powell was in the lead when the first group of skaters came up to the pine tree dan soppinger was close behind him with jack and randy following behind randy came walt baxter another cadet who skated remarkably well the others of the first group were gradually dropping back to the second contingent spouter powell touched the tree with his finger tips and was followed almost immediately by dan soppinger as they turned to go back to the starting point they were followed by jack and randy  hi you fellows what do you mean by skating so quick piped out andy rover gaily  well leave the tree to you andy shouted his twin  i dont think well win but anyway we wont be last came from fred as he and andy touched the tree  well we cant have everything in this world was the philosophic reply from the other rover boy  it could be seen that the race had now narrowed down to the five who were in the lead of these spouter powell and dan soppinger were less than two feet apart while only a yard to the rear came jack randy and walt baxter  go it randy sang out andy as he dropped still further behind go it i know you can win  keep it up jack yelled fred who being the smallest of the four rovers found it impossible to keep up the pace dont let spouter and dan hold you back  there were numerous cries of encouragement for all of the skaters as they swept forward toward the starting point here a line had been drawn on the ice and the cadets stood at either end some with their watches in their hands to time the winners  ill bet dan soppinger wins cried one of the cadets hes the best skater on the lake  well spouter powell is a good skater too returned another  huh whats the matter with the rover boys burst out a third cadet roundfaced and remarkably fatso fat in fact that he had not dreamed of participating in the contest  i dont know much about how they can skate was the reply they werent here last winter you remember  yes i know that answered fatty hendry  here they come  by this time the skaters were half way on the return from the blasted pine spouter powell and dan soppinger were still in the lead but walt baxter was crawling up steadily while jack and randy were close behind  say this is going to be a neckandneck race cried one of the cadets ned lowe by name he had wanted to race himself but knew that his skates were too dull for that purpose  stand back give them plenty of room exclaimed professor brice and he took measures to clear the cadets away from the finishing line  quite a crowd had assembled to witness the contest not only cadets but also some folks from the neighboring town of haven point and also a number of young ladies from clearwater hall a seminary located some distance away  the skaters had still a distance of several hundred yards to cover when it was seen that spouter powell was gradually falling behind then jack rover forged forward followed by his cousin randy  the rovers are crawling up  see jack rover and his cousin randy and dan soppinger and walt baxter are all in a line  this certainly is one close race  the excitement increased as the racers drew closer to the finishing line walt baxter was panting painfully showing that he had used up almost every ounce of his strength  oh dear i do hope the rovers come in ahead whispered one girl skater to another she was a tall girl remarkably good looking and dressed in a suit of brown with furs  so do i hope the rover boys win ruth answered her girl companion now that my cousin dick has fallen behind  its too bad may that your cousin dick couldnt have kept up answered ruth stevenson  closer and closer to the finishing line crept the four leading skaters jack and randy in the middle with dan soppinger on their left and walt baxter on their right now spouter powell had fallen back to the second group of racers  here they come  its dan soppingers race  not much here comes walt baxter gee see him strike out  its the rovers who are coming to the front exclaimed ned lowe  i knew they couldnt hold those rover boys back was frank newberrys comment now then boys for a final dash he shouted  all four of the leading contestants were bending forward and striking out as powerfully as possible their arms swinging from side to side like pendulums and their skates ringing clearly on the smooth ice  for an instant all were in a line then by a tremendous effort walter baxter forged a foot ahead but almost instantly dan soppinger overtook the other cadet an instant later randy rover came up beside the others followed by his cousin jack  the finishing line was now less than fifty yards away and the crowd was yelling all sorts of words of encouragement and cheering wildly even the girls and older folks present being much excited then of a sudden an exclamation of wonder rent the air  look at that will you did you ever see such striking out in your life  hes coming forward like a cannon ball  these exclamations had been brought forth by the sudden change of tactics on the part of jack rover coming back from the blasted pine he had managed to hang close to his opponents but without using up all his reserve force now he let out for all he was worth as he afterwards declared and with strokes that could hardly be seen for their rapidity he forged in front of soppinger and baxter  its jack rovers race  look look here comes his cousin randy yelled ned lowe  no use in talkingyou cant hold those rover boys back was fatty hendrys comment  what the cadets had said was true following the extraordinary spurt made by jack randy let himself out and in a twinkling had passed baxter then he found himself neckandneck with dan soppinger who was struggling with might and main to catch up to jack just two feet ahead  make room for the winners  jack rover wins the race  yes and randy rover is second  who takes third place  soppinger i guess  no i think walt baxter was a little ahead of him  nonsense it was a tie between them  three cheers for the rover boys shouted ned lowe and many cadets joined in the cheering  jack and randy were quickly surrounded by many of their chums and congratulated on their success  it was a tie race between soppinger and baxter announced professor brice and that being so i will give each of them a third prize and with this those two contestants had to be contented  you made that race in record time jack announced gif garrison it is better time by twelve seconds than was ever made before on this lake  well where do i come in demanded randy  you broke the record by ten seconds was the reply and believe me thats some stunt  i guess i was beaten fairly announced dan soppinger a little ruefully so there is no use of complaining  oh it was a fair and square race sure enough answered walt baxter all the same if my skates had been just a little sharper i think i might have won he added a little wistfully  well i am glad the honors stay in our family anyhow announced fred as he skated up followed by andy  and first and second prizes too cried his cousin that ought to be enough to hold the other fellows for awhile  jack and randy were both panting from their exertions but their faces showed their satisfaction and especially did jack look his pleasure when he happened to glance beyond the crowd of cadets and saw ruth stevenson waving her hand toward him beside ruth was may powell who waved gaily to all of the rovers  fine race boys fine race was fatty hendrys comment just the same none of you would have been in it for a minute if i had entered and at this joke there was a general laugh  say fatty you should have gone into it just to lose flesh was andys dry comment if you tried real hard you might lose a pound a mile and at this there was another laugh  the crowd began to gather around jack and randy and the others who had won the race and many wanted to shake hands with the oldest rover boy even some of the town folks skated up and they were followed by some of the girls from clearwater hall  i say boys this may not be safe cried professor brice suddenly when the crowd on the ice had become unusually thick this ice isnt as strong as it might be  yes and with fatty in the crowd began andy rover then of a sudden he stopped short because an ominous crack was heard followed by several other cracks  the ice is breaking  skate away everybody or well go down  instantly there was a commotion and all of the skaters tried to break away from the spot where the crowd had congregated the confusion was tremendous and in the mixup six or eight persons including ruth stevenson and may powell were thrown down then came another crack and it looked as if in another instant the ice would give way completely and precipitate the whole crowd into the cold waters of the lake     chapter ii  something about the rover boys   it was a time of extreme peril and it is doubtful if any one realized that more than did jack rover he too had been thrown down and across his legs was sprawled the heavy form of fatty hendry it was the toppling over of the fat youth which had caused one of the cracks which were now so numerous in the ice  hi get off of me yelled jack and managed to pull one of his legs free and with this he pushed the fat youth to one side  help help were going down came in a scream from may powell  the ice had become depressed where she and ruth stevenson stood and both were already in a half inch of water  scatter everybody scatter cried professor brice and then rushed to one side to rescue several little boys and girls  come on jack weve got to help those girls cried randy and caught his cousin by the arm thus assisting him to his feet then off the pair skated with andy and fred behind them all bent on going to the assistance of the girls from clearwater hall  now i know quite well that to the readers of the former volumes in these two rover boys series all of the rovers both old and young will need no introduction but for the benefit of those who have not perused any of the previous volumes in this line a few words concerning our characters will not be amiss  in my first volume entitled the rover boys at school i told how three brothers dick tom and sam rover had been sent off to putnam hall military academy where they made a host of friends including a manly and straightforward cadet named lawrence colby from putnam hall the rovers were sent to brill college and after leaving that institution of learning they went into business in wall street new york city where they organized the rover company of which dick was now president tom secretary and sam treasurer  while at putnam hall the three rovers had become acquainted with three charming girls dora stanhope and her cousins nellie and grace laning this acquaintance had ripened into loving intimacy and when dick went into business he had made dora stanhope his lifelong partner a short while after this tom married nellie laning and sam married grace  when first married dick and his beautiful wife dora had begun housekeeping in a small apartment but a few years later the three brothers had purchased a plot of ground on riverside drive overlooking the hudson river and there they had built three handsome houses dick living in the middle house and tom on one side and sam on the other  before the young people had moved into the new homes dick and dora became the proud parents of a little son who was named john after mr laning the son was followed by a daughter martha so named after her great aunt martha of valley brook farm where the older boys had spent many of their youthful days little jack as he was called was a bright lad with many of the qualities which had made his father so well liked and so successful in life  about the time jacks sister martha was born tom and nellie rover came forward with twin boys one of whom they named anderson after his grandfather and the other randolph after uncle randolph of valley brook farm andy and randy as they were always called for short were exceedingly clever and active lads in this particular being a second edition of their father andy was usually saying things that were more or less funny and randy thought that playing some trick was the finest thing in the world  you cant find fault with those kids tom dick rover said more than once they are chips off the old block  well i suppose they are tom rover would reply with a twinkle in his eye but if they never do anything that is really mean or harmful i wont care  about the same time the twins were born sam and grace rover came along with a beautiful little girl whom they named mary after mrs laning then a year later the girl was followed by a sturdy little boy who was christened fred after sam rovers old school chum fred garrison  living so close togetherthe three stone mansions on riverside drive were connectedthe younger generation of rover boys as well as the girls were brought up very much like one big family the winters were spent in new york city while during the summer the young folks were generally bundled off to valley brook farm where their grandfather anderson rover still resided with his brother randolph and wife martha  at first both the girls and the boys had been sent to private schools in the metropolis but the boys showed such a propensity for cutting up as dick rover expressed it that the fathers were compelled to hold a consultation  the best thing we can do is to send them to some strict boarding school was dick rovers comment and in this the brothers agreed  some time before their old school chum lawrence colby who had since become a colonel in the state militia had opened a military academy which he called colby hall the place was gaining an enviable reputation as a firstclass institution of learning being modeled after putnam hall which in its day had been run somewhat on the lines of west point  well send them to colby hall had been the decision of the older rovers and to that place jack andy and randy and fred had gone as related in detail in the volume entitled the rover boys at colby hall  the military school presided over by colonel colby was located about half a mile from the town of haven point on clearwater lake a beautiful sheet of water about two miles long and half a mile wide at the head of the lake was the rick rack river running down from the hills and woods beyond the school consisted of a large stone building shaped somewhat in the form of a cross the upper portion facing the river it was three stories in height and contained not only the classrooms and the mess hall but also the dormitories and private rooms for the scholars to one side was a brick building which at one time had been a private dwelling but which was now occupied by colonel colby and his family and some of the professors on the opposite side was a new and uptodate gymnasium down at the waters edge were a number of small buildings used as boathouses and bathhouses behind the hall were a stable and a barn and also a garage and still further back there were a large vegetable garden and numerous farm fields  on their arrival at colby hall the rover boys had found several of their friends awaiting them one of these was dick powell the son of songbird powell a former schoolmate of their fathers a fellow who was usually called spouter because of his fondness for making speeches another lad was gifford garrison usually called gif for short who was at the head of the school athletics gif was the son of fred garrison after whom fred rover had been named  they also made friends of a number of others some of whom we have already met these included walter baxter the son of dan baxter who in years gone by had been an enemy to the older rovers but who had long since reformed  before coming to colby hall jack rover had had a quarrel in new york with a tall dudish youth named napoleon martell and this had almost led to a fight nappy martell as he was usually called by his cronies was a pupil at the military academy and soon he and his crony a big overgrown bully named slogwell brown did what they could to make life miserable for all of the rovers but in one of their dirty tricks they overreached themselves and as a consequence they had been exposed and sent away from the institution of learning for the time being  but they are coming back walt baxter had told the rover boys and they say when they do they will make it hot for you  well when slugger and nappy return we will be ready for them had been jack rovers reply  and the next time we wont be as easy on them as we were before fred had added  all of the cadets formed a battalion of several companies commanded by one of the older cadets major ralph mason the rovers took to the military drill and general exercises readily and soon learned how to march and how to handle a gun they enjoyed drilling very muchin fact they enjoyed it more than they did studying although all of them were good scholars  as has been stated colby hall was located about half a mile out of haven point on the other side of the town was located clearwater hall a boarding school for girls during a panic in a moving picture theater in the town jack and his cousins had become acquainted with a number of these girls including ruth stevenson and may powell after that the four boys had taken four of the girls rowing on the lake and on other outings and through this had become quite well acquainted with a number of the clearwater hall pupils jack was particularly interested in ruth stevenson and thought her a very beautiful and entertaining young lady the others did not seem to have any particular preference although fred was often seen to side up to may powell the entertaining cousin of spouter  and now having introduced these young ladies in a proper manner let us return to them at the time when they were struggling on the ice and in the midst of the frightened crowd rushing hither and thither striving to save itself from being immersed in the icy waters of the lake  oh oh what shall we do cried may in terror as she clung to her companions arm  come on well have to skate away from here burst out ruth come let us see if we cant get to shore and she started off her companion still clinging to her  in the meanwhile jack and randy were skating as fast as possible in the direction where they had seen the two girls but now a crowd of cadets and town folks swept in front of them and the next instant randy was hurled flat on his back and went spinning across the smooth ice  by this time one of the spots on the lake had broken through and the water was rapidly rising all around it and covering the sinking surface men women and children mingled with the cadets and hurried in all directions but most of them toward the shore  come on weve got to help those girls somehow panted jack as he skated over to where randy had been flung he assisted his cousin to his feet just as fred and andy flashed up  the girls dont you see them over there they are going down yelled fred  yes i see them come on answered jack  as tired as he was because of the race the oldest rover struck out with all the vigor he could muster soon he found himself sloshing through water that was several inches deep the next moment he stood beside the two girls who had become almost too frightened to move  come on dont stand here he called catching ruth by the arm  he looked back and saw that fred and the others were close behind him and that fred already had hold of may then he started off up the lake  oh jack hadnt we better head for the shore gasped the frightened girl  no there is too much of a crowd in that direction already he answered quickly if they dont look out theyll all go in come on the best thing to do is to get out where there isnt anybody  he skated on allowing the girl to rest on his arm as he did so soon they seemed to be out of the danger zone and then he looked back  the sight that met his gaze filled him with new alarm fred had been skating with may close beside him but their feet had caught in one of the new cracks and both of them had gone down headlong andy and randy had been close behind and now they too went sprawling while the ice cracked ominously as if ready to let them down into the water at any instant     chapter iii  out of peril   oh look may and fred have both gone down cried ruth  yes and there go andy and randy over them exclaimed jack  and look jack the ice is cracking everywhere continued the frightened girl she clutched his arm and looked appealingly into his face oh what shall we do  spread out you fellows spread out yelled the oldest rover boy spread out dont keep together  his cry was heard and an instant later andy commenced to roll over on the ice in one direction while his twin rolled in another in the meantime fred had managed to scramble to his feet and now he pulled up may  come on well soon be out of danger encouraged the youngest rover and striking out he pulled may behind him the girl being too excited to skate  in less than a minute the danger so far as it concerned the rovers and the two girls from clearwater hall was past all reached a point where the ice was perfectly firm here ruth speedily gained her selfpossession but may continued to cling closely to freds arm  im going to see how they are making out in front of the boathouse cried randy some of the skaters must have gotten in  im with you returned his twin he looked back at his cousins i suppose you will look after the girls  sure answered jack quickly go ahead  i dont suppose we can be of any assistance down there came from fred  i dont think so fred there is too much of a crowd as it is they will simply be in one anothers way  oh oh suppose some one should be drowned moaned may  let us hope for the best answered jack he did not want to add to the girls fright yet he was decidedly anxious over the outcome of the unexpected catastrophe  they skated toward the shore at a point between colby hall and the town and then they worked their way along shore up to the vicinity of the military academy here men and cadets were rushing hither and thither some with planks and others with ropes  six of the cadets broke through announced spouter powell as he came up to learn if his cousin was safe  they are all out arent they questioned jack quickly  yes but there may have been others that went under the ice professor brice and mr crews are going to make a thorough search crews was the gymnastic instructor  the excitement continued for fully half an hour by that time it was ascertained that every one had gotten off of the ice or out of the water in safety those who had gone down were rushed to shelter so that they might not catch cold gradually the crowd dispersed and then professor brice had danger signs placed at various points on the ice so that there should not be a repetition of the accident  the thing would not have occurred had not the entire crowd happened to congregate around the winners of the skating race explained professor brice to colonel colby  you think the ice is thick enough for any ordinary crowd questioned the master of the school anxiously  yes sir you can test it for yourself  well we must be more careful in the future mr brice we dont want any of our cadets drowned  we wont have any such crowd again if i can avoid it was the reply  its all nonsense to have such races anyway it encourages too much rowdyism was the comment of asa lemm one of the language professors lemm was the least liked of all the teachers at the hall he did not believe in a boys having any fun but expected the cadets to spend their entire time in studying he had once been fairly wealthy and the loss of his money had made him sourminded and disagreeable  i cannot agree with that opinion returned colonel colby coldly the boys must have some exercise and to be out in the fresh air is a very good thing for them they will study so much the better for it  maybe but i doubt it answered asa lemm shortly you let a boy go out and carouse around and the first thing you know he wont care for anything else and he strode away with his chin held high in the air and his lips tightly compressed he was a man of very positive ideas which he tried at every opportunity to impress upon others  arent your feet wet questioned jack suddenly as he looked down at the skating shoes worn by ruth and may  well they are rather damp answered ruth  mine are both wet and cold said may i shouldnt mind it if i could dry them off and warm them somewhere  come on up to the hall went on jack im sure they will let you dry them in front of the open fire in the big livingroom  oh jack we dont want to go there in such a crowd of cadets  dont worry about the cadets put in fred  when they arrived at the livingroom of the military academy they found it practically deserted the great majority of the cadets being at the lake front or in the big boathouse where a pot stove was kept going for the benefit of the skaters  my but this is a cozy place remarked ruth after she had become comfortably settled in a big armchair with her feet resting close to the blaze  i wish i was a cadet here sighed may its more fun being a boy than being a girl  how do you know you never were a boy returned fred with a grin  i know just the same may answered im sure you boys have a much better time of it than we girls  this started quite an argument in which all of the young people including spouter joined in the midst of the talk andy and randy came in having been told where the others had gone  its all over and everybody is safe announced randy  and the only thing lost so far as we can find out was fattys skating cap put in andy  well if thats all we can chip in and buy him another cap remarked jack and at this there was a short laugh now that the peril was a thing of the past all felt greatly relieved and their manner showed it  jack and fred had the pleasure of skating all the way to clearwater hall with ruth and may during that time the young folks grew quite confidential  why dont you get your sister martha to come to clearwater hall said ruth to jack im sure id like very much to meet her  yes and why not have your sister mary come too added may to fred  say thats a great idea burst out jack  lets put it up to the folks at home without delay added his cousin but they might not like to leave the private school they are now attending he continued his face falling  thats true for they are getting along very nicely said jack just the same we can put it up to the folks at home and let them know all about what a nice place clearwater hall isand what awfully nice girls there are here and at this latter remark ruth and may blushed  i sent a letter to mary a year or two ago said may but at that time i wasnt here i think ill send her another letter  do by all means returned fred quickly and let her know all about how nice a place it is that may help  it would be a fine thing if they were at this schoolit would give us more chances to call here remarked jack to ruth  last week i met cousin dick in town said may and he was telling me how that slugger brown and nappy martell had left the hall he said the pair were terribly down on all you rovers  yes they were very much enraged over the way we exposed them answered fred  they deserved to be exposed cried ruth the idea of their shooting two of mr lacys valuable cows and then trying to prove that you did it it was shameful  well their folks had to pay lacy for the cows answered jack  and then to think how they tampered with the chains on that lumber raft so that the raft went to pieces in that storm on the lake added may oh i think they must be very wicked boys  they are certainly no angels  jack if they should come back to colby hall wont you be afraid that they will try to do something more to get you into trouble  more than likely they will but i am not afraid of them  we intend to keep our eyes wide open and if slugger or nappy try any funny work well jump on em like a ton of bricks added fred  then the subject was changed and a few minutes later the cadets bid the girls goodbye promising to see them again if possible in the near future  ill tell you what jack they are a pair of mighty fine girls was freds comment as he and his cousin skated back in the direction of the military academy  i agree with you fred  i wish we could persuade martha and mary to go to clearwater hall went on the youngest rover boy wistfully id like first rate to have em get better acquainted with may and get acquainted with the other girls there  well have to be careful how we write home about it cautioned his cousin if we arent theyll think we want them to come just on account of ruth and may and then theyll tease the life out of us  oh sure well be careful just the same it would be a fine boarding school for them i dont think much of that fashionable private school where they are now going most of the girls there think more of how they are dressed and what dances they are learning than anything else  by the way do you think spouter knows more about what slugger and nappy intend to do than he told  what do you mean  why perhaps he heard something but didnt want to tell all of it for fear of alarming us  i dont think spouter would do that he knows well enough that we arent afraid of that pair  just the same fred if they do come back well have to keep our eyes wide open for they surely will do their best to put one over on us and any fellows who would be mean enough to do what they have done wouldnt hesitate to do worse  i cant understand why colonel colby is going to let them come back at all  oh i suppose he feels that he ought to give them at least one more chance he probably remembers how dan baxter acted toward our fathers and the colonel himself as well as their chums and how baxter afterwards reformed  yes that may be true but when one fellow like walt baxters father reforms a dozen others remain as bad as ever or grow worse to my mind there isnt much in the way of reform in slugger browns makeup or in nappy martell either  oh i agree with you there slugger brown is nothing short of a brute and nappy martell is as sly and vicious as any fellow i ever ran up against well certainly have to watch them when they get back here     chapter iv  out hunting   after the excitement attending the skating races matters moved along quietly at colby hall for several days the rover boys as was their custom paid close attention to their studies  weve got to make a record for ourselves was the way jack put it if we dont our folks may take it in their heads to send us to some other boarding school thinking colonel colby is too easy with us  and to take jack away from this vicinity when he is getting so sweet on ruth steven began randy when he was cut short by a book flung by his cousin landing on his shoulder  you cut out that talk randy cried jack  lets talk about the weather murmured andy who had passed to the window say fellows do you know i think its going to snow  hurrah that means some fun snowballing cried fred  the snow came down all that night and in the morning covered the ground to the depth of several inches a great many of the cadets rushed out in glee and half a dozen impromptu snowballing matches were soon in progress  it was almost time to go in for the morning session when several of the cadets noticed a figure huddled up in a slouch hat and a heavy overcoat coming up from behind the hall toward a side door  here comes bob nixon yelled one of the cadets mentioning the name of colonel colbys chauffeur lets give him a volley  right you are exclaimed andy gleefully  stop cant you see commenced jack but before he could finish his sentence both andy and randy had let drive at the advancing figure one snowball took the man in the shoulder and the other landed just below his left ear  here here what do you mean by such proceedings cried the attacked individual in great wrath and then as he held up his head and pushed back his slouch hat all saw that it was asa lemm  great watermelons groaned andy i thought sure it was nixon  i knew it wasnt and thats why i tried to stop you said jack  say hes some mad whispered randy as the language teacher strode toward them i wonder what hell do  how dare you boys attack me roared asa lemm as he shook his fist at the crowd how dare you do it  it was all a mistake mr lemm said randy meekly  we didnt know it was youreally we didnt came from andy we thought it was bob nixon he likes to snowball with us  i do not believe a word of it cried the irate instructor how many of you threw at me he questioned glaring at the crowd  to this there was no immediate answer and then randy stepped forward  i did for one he said  and so did i came from his twin  anybody else  no we were the only ones professor answered randy and i hope you will overlook it this time he continued we did not know it was you  both of you report to me after school this afternoon said the instructor harshly and then without another word he turned and tramped off into the hall  now we are in for it andy was randys dismal comment  oh well he cant do any more than kill us was the lighthearted reply of the other  do you want to be killed andy quizzed jack  i know what hell do was randys comment hell keep us both in and give us extra lessons to learn and in this surmise the funloving rover boy was correct for their rashness in snowballing the teacher they were made to stay in after school for two afternoons and in addition had two extra pages of latin to translate  hes a lemon if ever there was one was what andy said after his punishment had come to an end oh wouldnt i just like to get square with him  well have to think something up andy answered his twin  following the first fall of snow came another but then the sun came out brightly packing down the snow so that sleighing became quite popular  if we only had a big sleigh up here we could go and get the girls from clearwater hall and give them a ride said fred one day to jack  i was thinking we might hire a big sleigh in town some saturday afternoon and do just that answered his cousin ill look into it the first chance i get  fred and jack had not forgotten the sport they had had earlier in the season when they had gone out with frank newberry and some others on a hunt for rabbits and other small game  the hunting season is still open fred said jack one day what do you say if we ask colonel colby for permission to go out  suits me answered his cousin quickly  do you think andy and randy would like to go too  more than likely they have been wanting to go ever since we brought down that game  when the subject was mentioned to the twins they quickly agreed that it would be a fine thing if they could all obtain permission to go on a hunting trip the coming saturday colonel colby was appealed to without delay  well boys i have no objection to your going out he said i know you all understand the use of firearms and i know also that your fathers loved to go out in their day and hunt and i did a little bit in that line myself and he smiled faintly but i want you to be very careful in what you shoot at and do your level best to keep out of trouble of all kinds and he looked at jack and fred as he uttered the latter words  getting into trouble before colonel colby wasnt our fault answered jack quickly  i know that  by the way colonel colby if it isnt asking too much would you mind letting us know if slugger brown and nappy martell are really going to return here questioned fred  they have asked for permission to come backat least their parents have asked for themand i have the matter under consideration answered the master of the hall he gazed questioningly at the rovers i meant to mention this subject to you and i am glad you have brought it up in one way i dont feel like having them here but in another way i should like to give them another chance in case they feel like turning over a new leaf and making a fresh start what do you boys think of it  for a moment all of the rover boys were silent looking at each other questioningly then the others showed that they expected jack to speak  well if you want my candid opinion its just this colonel colby said the oldest rover boy earnestly personally i would much prefer to have brown and martell stay away from colby hall but if you think they ought to be given another chance to make good here why i am sure im not going to stand in their way just the same if they do come here im going to watch them pretty closely so that they wont be able to play any more of their dirty tricks  i shall not blame you for watching them rover after what happened to you and your cousin fred it is no more than right that you should be on your guard yet i trust that you will give brown and martell a chance to prove themselves provided they really do want to turn over a new leaf and make amends for what has happened  oh well give them plenty of chances to make good if it is in them wont we and jack turned to his cousins  sure came in a chorus  then that is settled and i am glad of it now you have my permission to go on your hunting trip and i trust you will bring down all the small game you desire but as i said before be very careful so far i have allowed all of my pupils to go out hunting whenever they have so desired and without any accidents happening i dont want to break that record and with these words the master of the hall dismissed them  this conversation took place on thursday evening and all day friday the boys were anxiously looking forward to the proposed outing and wondering what the weather would prove to be they obtained permission to take two small rifles and two doublebarreled shotguns belonging to the institution and these they cleaned and oiled so that they would be in prime condition  saturday morning dawned bright and clear and the four rovers obtained their breakfast as early as the rules of the school permitted then with game bags and guns slung over their shoulders they set out on their skates up the lake shore and then along the rick rack river the wind of the day previous having cleared large portions of the ice of snow  come on lets have a race cried andy gleefully had he not been on his skates he would have attempted a handspring in the exuberance of his spirits  no racing today warned jack you save your breath andy we expect to skate and tramp a good many miles today before we get back to the school  all right just as you say answered his cousin and then he began some horseplay with fred which came to a sudden end when the youngest rover tripped him up and sent him plunging into a snowbank on the side of the narrow stream  now let up i tell you warned jack you never want to try any horseplay when you are tramping or skating along with a loaded gun its too dangerous remember what colonel colby said and then andy sobered down a little  all too soon for the boys the skating on the river came to an end beyond the stream was little better than a rocky watercourse now thickly covered with ice and snow  why cant we leave our skates here until we come back suggested randy  we could if we were sure we were going to return this way answered jack but we had better take them along for we may return to the hall by an entirely different route well place our skates in our game bags for the present and this advice was followed  after this the rover boys trudged along through the woods bordering the stream soon they came upon some rabbit tracks and less than a minute later jack suddenly raised his doublebarreled shotgun and blazed away  hurrah youve got him cried fred and all of the boys rushed forward to where the game laya big fat rabbit  say jack youre the lucky one cried andy now you know what you promised he added  all rightits your turn now to have the shotgun answered his cousin for that was the bargain which had been made ill carry the rifle  on and on went the young hunters getting deeper and deeper into the woods here they managed to stir up more game and andy had the pleasure of bringing down the second rabbit while the others laid low several squirrels  this is pretty rough ground around here remarked jack after they had wound in and out around some exceedingly rough rocks and through some thick underbrush  we had better keep close to this stream was randys suggestion if we dont we may become hopelessly lost in these woods  huh i guess we could find our way out sooner or later retorted his twin to andy getting lost in the woods would seem nothing more than a big joke  the young hunters continued to advance and during the course of the next hour brought down several more rabbits and also another squirrel then just as andy had handed back one of the shotguns to jack and the weapon had been reloaded they heard a strange noise coming from back of some bushes not a great distance away  now what do you suppose that is whispered fred  i think i know fred was jacks reply and if i am right get ready to fire as soon as i do  the two boys with the shotguns went in advance and soon reached a point where they could look beyond the bushes then came a sudden whirr and up into the air went a small flock of pheasants  bang bang rang out jacks fowling piece and bang bang came the report of freds firearm  the strange whirring continued but then three of the birds were seen to drop to the ground one dead and the other two seriously wounded  hurrah weve got three of them cried fred excitedly and then ran forward to quickly put the wounded birds out of their misery  say thats some luck exclaimed randy if i  randy stopped short and so did some of the others who had started to speak a strange sound from a distance had reached their ears  help help came in a low cry help for heavens sake somebody come and help me     chapter v  uncle barney stevenson   what is that  its somebody calling for help  its a mans voice and he must be in pretty bad shape to call like that burst out jack  hello there yelled randy where are you  here under the fallen tree came in a faint cry help me quick  i think the cry came from that direction said andy pointing with his hand  and i think it came from over there added his twin pointing off at a right angle to the first direction given  i think andy is right exclaimed jack anyway he and i can go off in that direction while you randy and fred can see if you can locate him over yonder  neither of the boys had been exactly right in locating the cry for assistance which had come from a point about midway between the two places suggested but it was jack who saw a large fallen tree from a distance and ran quickly toward it yelling for all of the others to do likewise  the sight which met their gaze filled them with a pity and a strong desire to be of assistance there in the snow lay an elderly man clad in the garb of a hunter or lumberman with a shotgun and a wellworn game bag beside him over the mans legs and one outstretched arm rested the upper portion of a large pine tree which had evidently crashed down because of the weight of snow upon it but a short time before the man lay on his chest and it was all he could do to raise his head to cry for aid  say this is tough exclaimed andy as he reached the spot what can we do to help him  weve got to pry up that tree somehow answered jack  come on let us see if we cant lift it exclaimed randy and took hold of one of the numerous branches  the others did the same and all pulled upon the tree with their utmost strength yet it was too heavy for them and could scarcely be budged  weve got to get some kind of pry and pry it up announced jack i wish we had brought a hatchet along i meant to bring one so that we could make firewood but i forgot it  help me help me moaned the man dont leave me here pinned down like this and then he seemed to faint  alarmed by the condition of the sufferer the boys ran around the spot looking for something which might aid them in releasing the man they found several flat stones and then discovered a sapling which they succeeded in pulling up by the roots piling up the flat stones close to the fallen tree they placed the sapling upon them using it as a lever and by this means jack and the twins managed to raise the fallen pine just high enough to allow fred to haul the hurt man from under it then they let the pine slip back to its original position  looks to me as if he might have his two legs broken and maybe his arm announced jack after they had placed the man on his back with his head raised on some pine boughs stripped from the trees the sufferers eyes were closed and he breathed heavily  we ought to get a doctor for him just as soon as possible said randy but where to go for one excepting back to haven point i dont know  while the young hunters were wondering what they had better do the man slowly opened his eyes and gave a gasp  help me please help me he cried feebly  dont excite yourself youre all right now answered jack kindly take it easy well do what we can for you  the man had closed his eyes again but now he opened them and tried to look around him  you got me clear of the fallen tree did you he murmured good i was afraid id have to stay there until i froze to death  how about it can you use your left arm questioned jack  i dont know i guess so answered the man and then tried to raise the arm in question he held it up for a few seconds but then let it drop heavily by his side  its pretty well lamed i reckon he said you see i had it right under one of the tree limbs  what about your legs can you move them at all went on the oldest rover boy he did not have the heart to mention that the mans lower limbs might be broken  feebly the man raised up first one leg and then the other the limbs had not been broken but they were much bruised and swollen and the movements caused the sufferer to give a groan  im afraid im done up so far as walking is concerned he said dolefully you see im getting old he went on if i was a younger man maybe this wouldnt affect me quite so much but as it is he shook his head dismally  i guess you had better let us carry you out of the woods said jack you cant walk and you certainly cant stay here alone  do you know where the nearest house is located questioned randy  let me see the man mused for a moment shutting his eyes while he did so unless im greatly mistaken bill hobson lives on the edge of the woods just to the north of this spot  is he a farmer questioned fred  no hes a lumberman like myself was the reply the man looked from one to another of the youths may i ask who you are  were the rover boys answered the oldest of the four i am jack rover and these are my cousins fred andy and randy  glad to know you boys and doubly glad to think you were up in this section of the woods just when i had this accident i shant forget your kindness my name is stevenson but most all the folks that know me call me uncle barney i take it from your uniforms that you belong at colby hall  we do answered andy  i dont belong in this neighborhood i just came over early this morning to see what the hunting looked like around here my home is on snowshoe island in the middle of lake monona about ten miles north of here  i think you had better rest on some of these pine boughs while some of us try to locate the bill hobson you mentioned said jack can you point out the general direction of his place  its up along this mountain stream and barney stevenson indicated the rick rack river you just follow that watercourse for about a quarter of a mile and im pretty sure youll come to it  well if youre sure its along this stream we might as well try to get you there first as last announced randy he turned to his cousins why cant we take turns in carrying him either on our backs or on a litter  i think we had better try to make some sort of litter of pine boughs answered jack it will be much easier for the four of us to do the carrying than for one  ive got a hatchet in my game bag and you can cut some pine boughs with that and you will find some cord in my game bag too  how did the accident happen if i may ask questioned randy while jack began to trim several large boughs from the fallen pine  it came quickern lightning was the old lumbermans answer i had just spotted a fine fat rabbit and was taking aim when without warning the tree gave a sudden snap like the report of a gun and down it came right on top of me of course i tried to jump out of the way but my foot caught on a tree root or a rock or something and down i went and the next minute the tree came down on top of me right across my legs and my left arm like when you found me i tried to pull myself loose but my legs and my arm seemed to be wedged down between the tree and some stones and i couldnt budge nary a one of em  i guess you can be thankful that you didnt break your arm or your legs  i suppose thats true my boy just the same i suppose this will lay me up for a week or two and maybe longer answered barney stevenson dubiously  having cut several pine boughs that looked as if they might answer the purpose the four boys lost no time in twisting them together and then tying them into a rude litter across this they laid additional pine boughs and upon these placed the form of the hurt man when they moved him he shut his teeth hard evidently to keep from crying out with pain  i know it must hurt you mr stevenson said jack kindly well be just as careful as possible  i know youll be my lads i suppose i ought to have a doctor but if i can get to bill hobsons cabin i guess ill be all right bill will most likely have some liniment and that will fix me up  with the old lumberman resting on the litter and the four youths carrying this as carefully as possible the party made its way along the rick rack river which at this point was little better than a mountain torrent they had considerable difficulty in climbing over the rocks and in making their way through the heavy brushwood but finally they came out to a cleared space beyond which there were only scattered patches of trees  i see some smoke cried fred presently  that must be the smoke from bill hobsons place announced the old lumberman and then he closed his eyes once more and lay back on the litter for the pain he was suffering was great  keeping on in the direction where they had seen the smoke they soon came in sight of a fairly large cabin with a leanto attached they marched up to the place and jack rapped upon the door which was opened a moment later by a burly man well along in years  what do you want began the man and then looked past jack to the litter and the old lumberman lying on it whats this why its uncle barney i declare whats happened  i got hurt by a falling tree bill was the reply and if it hadnt been for these cadets i might be layin down in the woods yet  he is quite a bit hurt explained jack you had better let us carry him in and place him on a couch or a bed of some kind  surest thing you know young man answered bill hobson fetch him right in and he turned to make a bunk ready for the sufferer  fortunately the cabin was well warmed so that as soon as they had barney stevenson safe inside they lost no time in taking off some of his clothing and examining his hurts the other old lumberman assisted by jack did this and hobson examined the condition of his friend with care  i cant see that anything is broken he announced but those bruises are pretty bad i think ill bathe em with hot water and then put on some liniment and bind em up  i guess ill have to stay right where i am for a spell bill said the hurt man  thats what uncle barney and youre welcome to stay as long as you please announced the owner of the cabin the boys had brought along the old lumbermans game bag and shotgun  bill hobson wanted to know the particulars of the affair and the rover boys related how they had come up into the woods to hunt and heard barney stevensons cries for assistance and how they had liberated him and brought him along on the litter  im very thankful indeed to you said barney stevenson and his face showed his gratitude if i can ever do you boys a good turn believe me ill do it  didnt you say you lived on snowshoe island queried jack  yes  ive heard of the place but i dont know exactly where it is located or why they call it snowshoe island  its a big island located almost in the middle of lake monona answered the old lumberman i own the place and its called snowshoe island because some years ago a number of indians lived on it and made their living by making snowshoes the indians are all gone now  i guess uncle barney youve lived on that island a good number of years put in bill hobson  twelve years coming this christmas was the reply i went there the day after my wife was buried and the old lumbermans face clouded as if the memory of what had happened was still bitter  do you do any lumbering there questioned randy more to change the subject than for any other reason  oh yes i do quite some lumbering during the season i have a firm in the city that sends up there every year for all the stuff i cut at this time of year i like to go out hunting its the one sport that i thoroughly enjoy and i reckon you boys enjoy it too or you wouldnt be out with your guns  yes we like to go hunting once in a while  well now listen to me boys you saved my life out there in the woods and if i was real well off id try to reward you for it but as it is  we dont want any reward broke in jack quickly  i know you dontyoure not that kind and im not going to offend you by offering it just the same if you ever feel like coming over to snowshoe island and paying me a visit ill treat you as well as i know how  maybe we might be able to go over there and do some hunting some time suggested andy  yes you come over some time and stay a few days or a week with me and ill give you the best time hunting i can answered barney stevenson  by the way mr stevenson said jack curiously do you know a mr frederic stevenson jack had learned from ruth that that was her fathers name  at this unexpected question the old lumberman opened wide his eyes and glared at the young cadet  yes i know himvery well he growled but i dont want to hear anything about himnot a word is he a friend of yours  he is the father of one of the young ladies who is a pupil at clearwater hall  oh i see humph well i dont want to hear anything about fred stevenson and if you want to be friends with me you neednt mention his name to me again went on the old lumberman much to the surprise of the rover boys     chapter vi  deep in the woods   what do you suppose was the reason that old lumberman didnt want to hear mr stevensons name mentioned questioned randy of jack about half an hour later when the four cadets were tramping through the woods again to resume their hunting  im sure i dont know randy was the slow reply evidently he was very bitter over something  having the same name it looks to me as if this uncle barney as they call him might be some relative of ruths family said fred  more than likely  maybe hes some castoff relation who got into trouble with them and then took himself off to that snowshoe island was freds comment  id have asked him some more questions if he hadnt acted so ugly about it went on jack  yes but he seemed to be a very nice sort of man otherwise put in andy quickly  i agree with you there jack gave a little sigh there must be some mystery to it  why dont you ask ruth about it some time  i will when i get a good chance to do it of course if its some sort of family affair im not going to butt in  before the rover boys had left the cabin of bill hobson they had been assured by old uncle barney that he was feeling fairly comfortable and that the owner of the place would look after him until he recovered barney stevenson had mentioned snowshoe island several times and had told the boys again that he was sorry he could not reward them for coming to his assistance but that if they ever cared to visit his island he would do his best to make them feel at home and show them where the best hunting in that vicinity was to be had he had also mentioned the fact that there was a vacant cabin close to his own on the island and that they would be welcome to camp out there at any time they chose to do so  id like to visit his place some time said fred just to see how the old fellow lives ill bet hes got quite a comfortable outfit there  he may live in very queer style returned randy according to what he says and what that bill hobson told me he must be a good deal of a hermit  maybe he committed some sort of crime and the other stevensons cast him off suggested andy  oh i cant think that he didnt look to be a criminal returned jack dont you remember what he said about taking up his residence on the island after his wife died maybe that loss made him feel as if he didnt want to mingle with the rest of the world  the boys talked the matter over for some time but could reach no conclusion whatever regarding the way the old lumberman had acted when frederic stevensons name had been mentioned then however they stirred up some more squirrels and rabbits and in the excitement of the chase that subject for the time being was forgotten  they had brought a lunch with them and at noon they found a convenient spot and there built a small campfire over which they made themselves a can of hot chocolate and this with some sandwiches and some doughnuts constituted the repast andy wanted to take time to clean a couple of the squirrels and cook them but jack and the others were afraid this would take too long and so the idea had to be abandoned  gee but this tramping through the woods gives a fellow an appetite cried andy after he had eaten his second sandwich and his third doughnut i could eat a whole rabbit or a squirrel myself and then feeling in fine fettle he proceeded to pull himself up on a nearby tree limb and skin the cat as it is called by acrobatic boys  you look out young man that you dont tumble down on your head warned jack this ground around here is frozen pretty hard  if i tumble i know where ill land cried andy gleefully and swinging himself back and forth on the tree limb he suddenly let go and came down straight on jacks shoulders both went down in the snow and there rolled over and over each trying to get the better of the other then fred commenced to snowball the fallen pair and randy joined in and a moment later there began a snowball fight on the part of all four which lasted about ten minutes  cease firing cried fred at last as he dug some of the snow out of his left ear if this is going to be a snowballing contest all right but i thought we were out to do some hunting  fred surrenders and the war is over cried jack  hoist the milkblue flag and call it off burst out andy gleefully throw the snowballs into the icecream freezer and season to taste  after that the four young hunters packed up their belongings and saw to it that the campfire was completely extinguished then they continued on their tramp in the vicinity of the rick rack river  im getting tired of hanging around this watercourse said fred finally i believe the reports of our guns have driven all the remaining game away why cant we strike off into the woods yonder and come in on the other side of haven point  they noted the position of the sun with care and then struck off at right angles to the river soon they found themselves going up hill and presently struck a lumbermans trail leading down in the direction of the town here however after two hours of hunting they failed to find any game whatever  we didnt improve things by coming over here grumbled andy  now i guess we had better be thinking of getting back to the school said jack as he consulted his watch they had been told that they must return in time for the evening meal  all right im ready to go came from fred gosh i wish i had a horse to ride or something the many miles of tramping had wearied him greatly  my left foot is beginning to hurt me a little put in randy i slipped on the rocks this morning when we were carrying that old uncle barney i didnt think much of it at the time but now its growing quite lame  you can walk on it cant you questioned jack anxiously  oh yes i can walk but i cant go any too fastor any too far either  the boys had done their best to keep track of where they were going and now they turned in what they thought was the direction of haven point but as my young readers may have heard it is an easy matter to lose ones sense of direction in the woods and before they knew it they found themselves in a locality that was entirely strange to them  we dont seem to be getting much closer to town announced fred presently i dont see a farmhouse of any sort in sight  they had gone but a short distance when they stirred up several more rabbits and had the pleasure of bringing two of the creatures down then they came to a small clearing and beyond this some farm fields  now we must be getting to somewhere announced randy and a few minutes later a turn of the road brought them in sight of a farmhouse here they saw a farmer coming from a cowshed with a pail of foaming milk and accosted him  sure youre on the road to haven point answered the farmer in reply to their question its about two miles and a half from here but do you want to go to the point or to colby hall he went on noticing their uniforms  we want to get to the halland by as short a route as possible answered jack  then the best thing you lads can do is to come right through my lane here and go across the back field then you will come out on the road that runs from the hall to carwell i guess you know that  oh yes we know that road returned randy  the cadets thanked the farmer for his information and lost no time in following his directions soon they came out on the other highway and then started forward as rapidly as their somewhat weary legs would permit  when they reached the vicinity of colby hall jack found by again consulting his watch that they were almost threequarters of an hour late  lets see if we cant slide in without any of the teachers seeing us suggested andy  oh i dont know that weve got to do that andy returned jack we havent done anything wrong  well we are late and you know some of the teachers wont stand for that  we had permission to go hunting and we couldnt help it getting lost up there in the woods answered his twin  they were just about to enter one of the side doors of the hall when it was flung open and they found themselves confronted by one of the younger teachers accompanied by professor lemm they stepped to one side to let the teachers pass  yes as i remarked before tompkins unless you have strict discipline in that class asa lemm was saying when of a sudden he happened to glance at the cadets and recognized the rovers what are you doing here where have you been he demanded coming to an abrupt halt  weve been out hunting sir answered jack  hunting eh and as was usual with him asa lemm drew down the corners of his mouth  we had permission from colonel colby to go put in randy  ah well in that case asa lemm paused for a moment did he say you could stay out as late as this he added suddenly  we had permission to stay out until supper time answered jack  dont you know it is an hour after that time now rover  threequarters of an hour professor we might have been on time only my cousin here slipped on the rocks and hurt his ankle and that has delayed us a little  humph always some excuse you boys have got to learn to be on time youll never get through life unless you are punctual i shall mention the fact of your being late to colonel colby now go in at once and if you are too late to get anything to eat it will be your own fault and thus speaking asa lemm moved on with the other teacher  oh but hes the sourest old lemon that ever grew was andys comment  you never said anything truer than that andy answered his twin     chapter vii  an unexpected meeting   say fellows did you ever hear this song  it was ned lowe who spoke he sat in one of the rooms belonging to the rovers on his knee rested a mandolin which he had been strumming furiously for the past ten minutes  sure weve heard it ned cried andy what is it  for gracious sake ned why dont you let up cried fred who was in the next room trying his best to study how in the world is a fellow going to do an example in algebra with you singing about good times on the old plantation  that is right ned why dont you sing about good times in the classroom when asa lemm is there  gee christopher whats the use of your throwing cold water on this camp meeting came from walt baxter who sat on the edge of the bed munching an apple  really its a shame the way you young gentlemen attempt to choke off neds efforts to please this congregation exclaimed spouter powell who sat in an easy chair with his feet resting on the edge of a chiffonier now when a mans soul is overflowing with harmony and beautiful thoughts are coursing through his cranium and he is doing his utmost to bring pleasure  wow spouter is at it again somebody choke him off cried randy and catching up a pillow he threw it at the head of the cadet who loved to make long speeches  say fellows why wont some of you let me get a word in edgeways came from dan soppinger who stood with his back against the door leading to the hall ive been wanting to ask you a question for the last ten minutes who of you can tell me the names of the fifth tenth and fifteenth presidents of our country  oh baby wailed andy throwing up his hands in comic despair dan is worse than either spouter or ned  i thought you were going to put a padlock on that question box of yours dan remarked fred  ill bet there isnt one of you can answer my question retorted dan soppinger  sure i can answer it returned andy readily what was that question who was the first laundryman in chicago  no i said who were the fifth the tenth and the fifteenth  oh i remember nowthe fifth tenth and fifteenth discoverers of the north pole thats easy dan the fifth was julius cæsar the tenth benjamin frank  see here i didnt say a word about the north pole discoverers ejaculated the human question box i said the fifth tenth and fifteenth  men to find out how to manufacture oleomargarine out of pure butter finished andy now thats a purely scientific problem dan not an ordinary question you want to take three pounds of oleomargarine and divide them by two pounds of unadulterated butter then  for gracious sake has that boy gone crazy cried dan soppinger in despair i come over here and ask an ordinary question in history  how do we know its an ordinary question in history broke in randy the five ten and fifteen sounds like a problem in higher arithmetic  say dan just forgive me for what i said and ill send you the answer day after yesterday on a postal card announced andy mournfully and ill prepay the postage too now be a good boy son and run along and maybe some time papa will buy you a lemon stick and at this remark there was a general laugh in the midst of which dan soppinger threw up his hands turned and left the room  it was several days after the hunting expedition and the rover boys had settled down once more to their studies this was the off hour in the evening and as was usual a number of their friends had dropped in to see them  only three weeks more to the winter holidays announced gif presently what are you fellows going to do with yours  we havent decided yet gif any further than that were going home answered jack  if you feel like it you had better come and pay me a visit i know my folks would be only too glad to have you  and wed be glad to have you come down to new york and stay with us gif was the reply  during the days that had gone by since the hunt the rover boys had had several little differences with professor lemm the teacher had spoken to colonel colby about their coming in late but the master of the hall had passed this matter over as being of no importance somewhat to asa lemms chagrin  oh how i love that man had been andys comment  the weather had remained clear but on thursday of that week came another fall of snow and by friday this was in good condition for sleighing  i wonder if we cant get up a sleighing party for saturday afternoon and take out some of the girls from clearwater hall said jack  we ought to be able to get some sort of boxsled down at the haven point livery stable answered randy suppose we call the liveryman up on the phone and see what he has to say and then call up the girls  this was done without delay and as a result it was arranged that the liveryman should call at the school early saturday afternoon for the four boys and some of their chums bringing with him a large boxsled drawn by four horses then the boys were to get the girls and all were to take a ride until the supper hour it was arranged that the four rovers should go on the ride and also spouter powell gif garrison fatty hendry and some others  of course fatty we really ought to make you pay double price remarked andy to the fat boy when the arrangements were being made  nothing doing grunted fatty i dont weigh a bit more than spouter or gif  oh no not at allonly about sixty pounds more remarked gif  some of the girls attending clearwater hall had stated that they wished to do a little shopping in haven point before going on the ride and so all had promised to meet the boys in front of the moving picture theater which was a resort wellknown to all of them  now if the weather only remains good we ought to have a peach of a time announced randy after all the arrangements had been settled  the weather remained good and promptly on time the liveryman drove up to the entrance of the hall with his big boxsled which he had filled with straw and robes into the sled piled the boys fatty hendry perching himself up on the front seat beside the driver  some of the lads had provided themselves with tin horns and they set off on the trip with a grand flourish a number of the cadets left behind gazing after them wistfully but these lads were not utterly disconsolate for the reason that skating and coasting were now both very good around the school  the horses pulling the boxsled were fine animals and in a short space of time they jangled merrily into haven point the boys blowing their horns loudly to attract attention  in the meantime ruth stevenson and may powell accompanied by alice strobell annie larkins and some of their chums from clearwater hall had arrived in the town and gone to several of the stores on various errands then a few minutes before the time appointed for meeting the cadets they hurried over in the direction of the moving picture theater  several of the girls went into a drugstore close to the theater leaving ruth and may standing on the sidewalk looking at the various gaudy billboards which were displayed there the girls were discussing the picture of a wellknown movingpicture actress when suddenly ruth felt some one touch her arm turning she found herself confronted by a tall heavyset youth rather loudly dressed and accompanied by another boy wearing a fur cap and furlined overcoat  excuse me but this is miss ruth stevenson i believe said the big youth with a broad smile on his coarse face  ruth was not at all pleased by being thus addressed for she had recognized the fellow as slugger brown and also recognized nappy martell nappy raised his cap and bowed pleasantly both to her and to may  we just got back to haven point said slugger brown smoothly been away a short while you know  and we thought we would go into the movies before going back to school put in nappy martell were you going in too if you were lets go in together ill get the tickets and he opened his coat to thrust his fingers into his vest pocket and bring forth a small roll of bills  thank you we are not going into the theater answered may stiffly she did not like either slugger or nappy and was sorry the pair had shown themselves  how about it broke out slugger taking hold of ruths arm in a decidedly familiar way lets go in youve got time enough  thank you but we have something else to do mr brown responded ruth icily  you cant do much outside on a cold day like this went on the bully come on inim sure its nice and warm in there and theyve got some dandy pictures come ahead  sure broke out nappy ill get the tickets and he took several steps toward the ticket booth  thank you but i said i didnt want to go with you said may quite loudly and with flashing eyes  we pick our company when we go anywhere added ruth giving slugger brown a look which would almost have annihilated any ordinary boy but the bully was proof against anything of that sort  oh you neednt get on your high horse about it ruth stevenson he sneered some day maybe youll be glad to go to a show with me  if you wont go i guess there are other girls just as good and maybe better added nappy martell not knowing what else to say  it was at this moment that the big boxsled containing the cadets hove into sight with a flourish the driver drew up to the curb with the boys tooting loudly on their tin horns but this salute came to a sudden end when the lads caught sight of their former schoolmates  look whos here will you ejaculated randy  slugger brown and nappy martell murmured fred  say they are talking to ruth and may broke in andy  to all this jack said nothing but he lost no time in leaping to the pavement and walking up to the girls who came forward to greet him  oh im so glad you got here exclaimed ruth in a low voice and she looked at jack appealingly and then let her eyes rove in the direction of the bully and his crony  those boys are just too horrid for anything murmured may by way of explanation  what did they do demanded spouter of his cousin he having quickly followed jack from the sled  they almost insisted upon it that we accompany them into the movies  why they hardly know you  thats true dick and i think it was awful of them the way they came up  that brown boy caught me by the arm and he had no right to do that said ruth to jack i dont want a thing to do with him  you get into the sled girls and well tend to brown and martell announced spouter and the tone of his voice showed his anger  the girls did as bidden being assisted by the others and in the meantime the remaining girls came from the store and also got into the sled spouter and jack strode across the pavement and caught slugger brown and nappy martell just as they were on the point of dropping their tickets into the ticket box  come here a minute i want to talk to you said spouter catching martell by the arm  and i want to talk to you added jack as he detained slugger brown  i wont talk to you retorted nappy martell and tried to pass  yes you will answered spouter you listen to me nappy after this you leave my cousin may powell alone if you dont youll have an account to settle with me  and you leave both of those girls alone said jack to slugger brown miss stevenson doesnt want anything to do with you now you mind what im telling you or youll get into trouble the first thing you return to the hall  oh say rover you make me tired sneered the bully glaring at jack im not going to try to take your girl away from you there are plenty of better girls around haven point you go about your business and leave me alone and thus speaking slugger brown passed into the movingpicture theater followed a moment later by nappy martell the two others watched them out of sight and then looked at each other knowingly  one fine pair believe me was spouters comment  im mighty sorry colonel colby allowed them to return to the hall answered jack im afraid it spells just one thingtrouble     chapter viii  the sleighing party   what did you say to those horrid young men asked may after jack and spouter had returned to the boxsled and the driver had picked up the reins and started through the main street of haven point  oh we told them to mind their own business after this answered jack  and if they dont you let me know and well attend to them said spouter to his cousin  its too bad jack they came back to colby hall remarked ruth  right you are but colonel colby wanted to give them another chance he asked us about it and we didnt want to stand in the way of slugger and nappy turning over a new leaf  hi theresomebody start a song cried andy who caught a few words of what was said and thought the occasion was getting too serious  thats the talk exclaimed alice strobell  what shall we sing questioned annie larkins  oh sing something that we all know came from jennie mason she too had seen slugger and nappy but had refused to recognize them remembering well the trouble she and ida brierley had had with the pair when all had gone out on the lake in a motorboat the particulars of which were given in the volume preceding this  soon the happy young folks were singing one familiar song after another and shouting and tooting the tin horns in great glee in the meanwhile the turnout had left the vicinity of haven point and was moving swiftly along in the direction of one of the neighboring towns  oh isnt this too lovely for anything exclaimed may as one of the songs came to an end i never felt better in my life  if i felt any better id have to call in the doctor announced andy with a sudden sober look on his face and at this little sally all the girls giggled  they were soon passing close to a stone wall and from this some of the boys scooped handfuls of snow with which they began to pelt each other then they attempted to wash the faces of some of the girls and a great commotion ensued  hi you be careful back there cautioned the driver first thing you know somebody will get pushed out  oh that will never happen cried gif but he had scarcely spoken when there came a wild yell from two of the cadets in the back of the boxsled and the next moment randy was seen to turn over and pitch out into the snow  stop the sleigh stop the sleigh yelled andy one man overboard and no lifeline handy  oh dear do you think he is hurt questioned may anxiously  he looks it answered her cousin look out or youll get hit for scarcely had randy landed in the snow than he picked himself up and began to make snowballs which he sent after the sled in rapid succession in the meantime the driver had brought the turnout to a halt  stop that randy warned jack you might hit some of the girls  no more such horseplay announced gif its too dangerous and besides that some of the girls might get hurt you fellows have got to act like gentlemen ahem and gif straightened himself up in imitation of asa lemm  please teacher cant we act like ladies piped out andy in a thin effeminate voice  youll remain after school for that rover and recite one hundred lines of cæsar backward commanded gif  you bet your pink necktie ill be backward about reciting the hundred lines murmured the funloving boy  the cadets had already arranged it between themselves to stop at a town about twelve miles away there all hands trooped into a candy store to regale themselves with dainty sandwiches and hot chocolate some of the boys also obtained boxes of candy and also some popcorn and peanuts as well as apples and these were passed around  so far jack had had no opportunity to speak to ruth in private but while the others were still at the little tables in the rear of the candy shop he motioned to her and the pair walked toward the front  i want to ask you about the man we rescued in the woods ruth he said probably you know him his name is stevenson although he said he was usually called uncle barney by all who knew him  why can that be possible exclaimed the girl in astonishment uncle barney stevenson why didnt you tell me this before  ill tell you why he answered i was afraid that possibly it might create some sort of scene by the way this barney stevenson acted i knew there was something wrong between him and your folks when i mentioned your fathers name he said he didnt want to hear anything about himnot a word  poor old man i am so sorry for him and ruths manner showed that she spoke the truth  why doesnt he want to hear from your father but excuse me ruthmaybe that is a private matter  i dont know that it is so very private jack and anyway id like you to know the truthotherwise you might get a wrong impressionif you heard the story from outsiders in a nutshell the matter is this some years ago my father and his uncle barney were connected with a certain manufacturing company in which both held a considerable interest the company went to pieces and my father and uncle barney both lost their money but my father had other interests which were distantly connected with this company and in some manner poor old uncle barney who was not much of a business man even though he was a lumberman got it into his head that my father had in some manner gotten the best of him because my father had money and he had not then in the midst of this trouble uncle barneys wife died my father was away in the west at the time with my mother and could not get back in time for the funeral this made uncle barney more bitter than ever and he refused to listen to any explanations my folks might make he had made some sort of deal to get possession of snowshoe island in lake monona and he retired to the island and became almost a hermit  yes he told us he lived on the island and he invited us to come over there and he would show us some good hunting i suppose it must be quite a place  my father has tried several times to patch up matters with old uncle barney but he will not listen to any explanations he is rather queer at times and i suppose he has it strongly fixed in his mind that my father is in some manner responsible for his poverty and that we think ourselves too hightoned to have anything to do with him when as a matter of fact my folks would be very much pleased to have the old man become friends and live with them  why doesnt your father send him a letter if he wont listen to his talk  he has tried that and mother has written old uncle barney some letters too during the last six or eight years but he is very peculiar and the letters come back unopened  and you really feel that you would like to be on good terms with him  yes jack my folks would give a good deal to smooth the whole matter over but instead of becoming reconciled to the situation old uncle barney apparently is becoming more bitter as time goes by  if you and your folks feel that way about it id like very much to meet the old man again and have a talk with him of course he told me that he never wanted to hear your fathers name mentioned but if i got a good chance i might be able to get him to open up and tell me his side of the story and after he had done that he might be more willing to listen to what i had to say  oh jack if you ever do get the chance try to talk to him by all means and do what you can to impress it on his mind that my father had nothing to do with the loss of his money and that my folks would have gone to mrs stevensons funeral had they been able to do so and tell him too that my father and my mother and also myself would be very glad to become friends once more and that our house will be open to him at any time  the others of the sleighing party were now coming up so there was no chance of saying anything further regarding the strange affair  lets return to haven point by some other route suggested spouter  well have to ask the driver about the roads first said gif  the driver had gone out to look after his horses when questioned he stated that they might return by a roundabout way through the village of neckbury but that it might take half an hour or so longer  oh i guess weve got time enough said fred consulting his watch the girls havent got to get back to clearwater hall until supper time and we can get from one school to the other in a jiffy in the sleigh  the liveryman was anxious to please the boys and girls being desirous of getting more business from them in the future and he readily agreed to take them home by the way of neckbury and he also agreed to get them back by the required time  once more all bundled into the turnout and then with a crack of the whip and a loud tooting of the horns they started on the return  another song now cried andy and commenced one of the ditties which at that time was popular at colby hall in this the girls joined most of them having heard it and thus the crowd continued to enjoy themselves  so far they had met but few turnouts on the road but now they found that the other route toward haven point was more popular and they passed several farm sleds and also a number of cutters and even two automobiles the latter ploughing along through the snow using their heavy chains for that purpose  they were soon mounting a small hill and the driver allowed the horses to drop to a walk from the top of the hill they could see for many miles around with farms dotting one side of the roadway and the other sloping down gradually toward the distant lake  im afraid were going to be a little late after all announced gif as he looked at his timepiece youll have to shake it up a bit old man he added to the driver  oh ill get you there in timedont worry was the ready reply and then the driver cracked his whip and sent his horses down the other side of the hill at a good rate of speed  about half way down the long hill there was a turn to the right here on the outer edge of the road was a gully which the wind of the day previous had partly filled with snow just before this bend was gained those in the boxsled heard the toot of an automobile horn  somebody coming up the hill said fatty hendry who had resumed his seat beside the driver  confound em and ive got to take the outside of the turn muttered the liveryman  better be carefulits none too wide along here cautioned the fat youth  the driver was already reining in his steeds but the slope was considerable and it was hard to hold them back the boxsled struck the rear horses in the flanks and away they went as fast as ever crowding the horses in front and urging them onward also then the oncoming automobile hove in sight and passed so closely that the driver of the boxsled had to pull still further over to the edge of the highway  look out where youre going yelled jack  i told you to be careful commenced fatty and then clutched at the high seat of the boxsled  there was a wild scream of alarm and a general confusion among all the young people as the back end of the boxsled slewed around one corner went down into the gully and an instant later the boxsled stood up on its side and girls and cadets went floundering forth into the snow     chapter ix  a mishap on the road   gracious where are we going  get off my head randy  say spouter dont sit down on ruth that way  hi stop the horses somebody screamed fred and then he leaped up and clung to the partly overturned boxsled while gif and another cadet did the same  the driver had sensed the coming of the accident and when the boxsled went over to one side he had leaped to the other now he was standing in the snow with the reins still in his hands and doing his best to quiet the somewhat frightened steeds which were plunging into each other in anything but an orderly fashion  down in the gully the girls and the cadets were having an exciting time of it some of the party had plunged almost head first into the snow  come on boys help the girls all you can came from jack as he managed though not without considerable effort to bring ruth to her feet  fred and randy were already assisting may to arise and soon the other girls and boys were doing what they could to scramble through the deep snow toward the highway here there was a slippery slope of several feet  jack was the first boy up and randy came behind him then while the two rovers assisted by spouter held fast to each other they pulled up one girl after another in the meanwhile the other cadets made something of a chain and soon all stood at the spot where the boxsled had overturned  all here queried gif  i guess so answered spouter knocking some snow from his cap  the driver of the boxsled assisted by several of the cadets had managed to quiet the horses some of which were inclined to bolt the boxsled was all right and the boys picked up what they could of the dry straw and also shook out and replaced the robes  oh my what a dreadful experience remarked annie larkins  oh i dont know that it was so very dreadful returned ruth no one was hurt  but we might have been added jennie mason  oh i thought it was fun laughed ruth  it was the fault of that auto grumbled the liveryman thinking he had to defend himself he crowded me too close to the edge of the gully  thats just what he did cried fatty the fellow who was driving that car ought to be arrested  did you get his number fatty questioned fred  get his number i didnt have time to get anything he just slid by and the next thing i knew i was turning a somersault in the air and diving right down into the bottom of that hole and at this remark the other cadets had to smile  the cadets assisted the girls back into the boxsled and then they moved off once more jack and gif both cautioning the driver to be careful  now that the danger was past the young folks soon recovered from their scare and then to put all in a better humor andy started another school song in which all joined lustily thus they soon rolled into town and a little later came up to the entrance of the clearwater grounds  ive had a perfectly splendid time in spite of that little mishap declared ruth as she bid jack goodbye  we couldnt have had a nicer afternoon said may you can come around with your boxsled just as often as you please and she smiled mischievously in a way that set freds heart to bounding  as it was growing late the boys had scant time in which to bid the girls goodbye soon they were on the way to colby hall and they told the driver to hurry as much as possible  if were late and asa lemm finds it out hell certainly punish us in some way was randys comment  well were in luck for once announced gif i heard old lemon say that he was going away right after lunch and wouldnt be back until tomorrow  it seems to me he has been spending quite some time away lately remarked spouter not but what im perfectly willing that he should absent himself at every possible opportunity the institution of learning can very well dispense with the services of such an individual as professor asa lemm  a little longwinded spouter but you hit the nail on the head answered fred old lemon could quit for good and i doubt if any of us would shed a tear  although the cadets were half an hour late neither colonel colby nor any of the professors who saw them found any fault and for this they were thankful  as soon as he had an opportunity to do so jack told his cousins about what ruth had said regarding old barney stevenson they listened to his recital with keen interest  he certainly must be a queer stick was randys comment just the same id like to go to snowshoe island and visit him  yes and try the hunting around that neighborhood added fred according to what that bill hobson said uncle barney as they call him must be quite a hunter as well as a lumberman  id like to have the chance to talk with him resumed jack from the way ruth spoke im quite sure her folks are very much put out over the way he is acting  ill tell you what put in andy were going to have an extra long christmas holiday and we might get a chance to go over to snowshoe island hunting at that time  how do you know the holiday is going to be extra long queried fred  i heard professor brice saying so it seems they have got to fix some part of the heating plant which is pretty well worn out and the furnace man said it would take longer than at first expected so instead of closing up for ten days or two weeks at christmas they are going to shut down for about three weeks  three weeks that will give us a nice holiday at home and give us a chance for an outing in the bargain cried jack  late that evening slugger brown and nappy martell put in an appearance and were closeted with colonel colby for the best part of half an hour what was said by the master of colby hall the other cadets did not learn but the two new arrivals looked exceedingly meek when they went up to their former rooms on the following day they met the rovers but paid no attention whatever to them  maybe they are going to give us the cold shoulder remarked fred  well that wont hurt me answered jack  several days went by and the rover boys applied themselves closely to their studies realizing that before long the examinations previous to the christmas holidays would take place they did very well in their recitations and got along nicely with all the professors except asa lemm  there is no use of talkingi cant get along with that man said andy one afternoon he was almost in despair if i hadnt just shut my mouth hard when old lemon lectured me there would have been an explosion and id have told him just exactly what i think of himand it wouldnt have been anything that he would want to hear  gif was telling me that lemm is getting more and more anxious about some of that money he lost years ago  maybe he thought he saw a chance of getting it back and now it is slipping away from him again and that is making him more sour than ever suggested randy  i dont care what is making him so sourhe neednt take it out of me retorted his twin  there had been another slight fall of snow and on thursday afternoon the cadets of colby hall organized a grand snowball match a fort was built on the top of a little hill in the vicinity and one crowd of cadets defended this while the others made an attack the school flag was hoisted over the fort and the battle raged furiously for over an hour major ralph mason was in charge of the fort defenders while the rover boys along with half of the school cadets composed the attacking party the fort was captured only after a terrific bombardment with snowballs and it was jack who had the pleasure of hauling down the flag  some fight that remarked fred after the contest was over  almost like a real battle said randy just look at my left ear will you and he pointed to that member which was much swollen got hit there twicewith regular soakers too  well thats part of the game randy remarked jack he had been hit half a dozen times but had not minded it in the least  on the following afternoon the rover boys visited a long hill in that vicinity which a number of the cadets were using for coasting purposes with money sent to them by jacks father they had purchased a fine bobsled and on this they took numerous rides along with several of their chums  there were two ways of going down the hill one was in the direction of haven point and the other wound around a second smaller hill and ended in the pasture lot of an old farmer this farmer was an irishman named mike otoole a pleasant enough individual who had often given the boys rides on his farm wagon and who was not averse to selling them fruit and also milk when they desired it he was such a goodnatured old man that very few of the cadets ever thought to molest his orchard  say ive got an idea cried andy suddenly when he and the other rovers were riding down into otooles pasture lets go down and have a look at the old mans goats and he winked knowingly at his twin  otoole had once lived in the city and there had been the proud possessor of several goats which he had used in one of the public parks where they were attached to little wagons in which the children could ride for ten cents per person otoole had brought his goats to the farm with him and treated them with as much affection as if they were members of his family  what have you go up your sleeve andy questioned fred as they got off the bobsled and dragged it behind them toward mike otooles house the old irish farmer and his wife lived alone having no children and no hired help  oh i thought we might hire a goat or two to pull the bobsled was the easy answer  to pull the bobsled  to be sure if those goats can pull wagons they can certainly pull sleds too then i thought if we could get the goats to pull us all the way to colby hall it wouldnt be any more than fair to take the goats in out of the cold and treat em nicely  oh i see cried randy who was listening to his twins talk for instance we might take the goats into the hall and up to professor lemms room eh  youve caught the idea randy what do you think of it  fine couldnt be better chuckled the other  whats this talk about taking otooles goats to colby hall demanded jack  oh we were thinking professor lemm would like to see the goats  the oldest rover boy looked stern for an instant but then his mouth relaxed and he broke into a broad grin  of course well have to be careful how we get the goats into the hall he began  hurrah i knew it would hit you just right jack cried andy slapping his cousin on the shoulder just you waitwell make old lemon sit up and take notice this time  but mums the wordremember that cautioned randy if he ever caught us wellgoodnight     chapter x  something about two goats   the four rover boys were almost up to mike otooles place when suddenly jack caught andy by the shoulder  wait a minute he exclaimed  whats wrong now demanded the funloving youth  ive just been thinking andy if we take those goats into the hall and get into any kind of trouble professor lemm will find it an easy matter to learn who got the goats from otoole  thats right too broke in fred in dismay  maybe we can get the goats on the sly suggested randy  i think that would be the better way to do it answered jack we can leave a note behind stating that the goats will be returned and we can also pay otoole something for using his animals  the boys talked the matter over for several minutes and then it was decided that andy and randy should go ahead and reconnoitre this they did and were gone for about ten minutes  the coast is clear so far as we can see announced randy mike otoole and his wife are both in the kitchen of the farmhouse preparing supper  and where are the goats questioned fred quickly  he keeps them in a little shed off of his barn come on ill show you returned randy  the other cadets followed him and they soon reached the place he had mentioned here otoole kept six goats and they were found finishing up some food he had evidently given them a short while before  two of the billy goats were quite large one possessing a very fine pair of horns this one the boys knew was called patrick the other large goat went by the name of dan  here is the harness said andy bringing it from some pegs on which it was hanging well have to do the best we can about hitching em up  while the others were doing this jack tore a page from a notebook he carried and on this in a large disguised hand he wrote the following       dear mr otoole       we have taken the privilege of using two of your goats until      tomorrow they will be safely returned to you  i think we ought to pay him for the use of the animals said jack a little money will make him feel a great deal better  lets pin two dollars to the note suggested fred and this was done by jack and the note placed where the irish farmer would be sure to find it when he came again to tend to his animals  it was an easy matter for the four boys to get the goats out of the shed and then they led them to a spot behind some trees where the animals were hitched to the bobsled soon they started on the way to colby hall  now that weve got possession of the goats how do you fellows expect to work this stunt demanded fred as they brought the two goats down to a walk  ill tell you one thing declared jack if you want to play this trick without the whole school knowing it you had better reach colby hall by the lane that comes up behind the barn  just what i was thinking of doing answered andy i thought maybe we could stable them in that little toolhouse in the cornfield until we had a chance to get em into the hall  thats the talk cried randy of course well have to watch our chance and not make a mess of it  the two billy goats had often been harnessed together so they got along quite amiably on the trip to the military academy they were strong animals and consequently the boys reached the field behind the barn in ample time to unhitch the goats and place them in the toolhouse that had been mentioned then they hurried around to the garage where they were allowed to store their bobsled and after that lost no time in getting ready for the evening parade and drill  directly after supper was over the rovers took spouter gif and fatty hendry aside and told them of what was in the wind  oh say thats great cried fatty let me have a hand in it wont you he had had a quarrel with asa lemm a few days before and was as sore as any of the other cadets  you ought to let us all have a hand in that andy put in spouter i believe every one of us feels the same way when it comes to old lemon he may have a vast amount of learning stored in his cranium but his font of the milk of human kindness is completely dried up were he to realize or have the least conception  cut it spouter interposed gif we agree with youasa lemm is the lemon of all lemons and i for one would like to teach him some kind of lesson  the matter was talked over for some time and as a result a number of other cadets including walt baxter ned lowe and dan soppinger were let into the secret  some of you will have to keep tab on lemm while others see if the coast is clear during the time we are trying to get the goats upstairs announced randy  i dont think well have an easy time getting two animals to old lemons room remarked fred however well get em up there somehow  dan soppinger was detailed to locate and watch asa lemm and he soon came back and reported that the professor was sitting in a corner of the school library making notes from several volumes  well you watch him dan said jack and if he starts to come upstairs you let us know at once and to this soppinger agreed  after the supper hour the cadets had their usual studying to do and then came another hour for recreation previous to retiring  now is our time said andy as he threw aside his books and leaped to his feet come on everybody on the job  the lads had already figured out how they expected to get the goats up to asa lemms room in the extreme rear of the school building was located an outside fireescape leading from the third and second floors to the ground at each floor there was a large doorway with a bolt on the inside in order to induce the goats to mount the steps of the fireescape the boys had provided themselves with some vegetables purloined from the kitchen storeroom leaving the others to watch on the fireescape and in the upper hallway of the school the rovers went out to the toolhouse and released the two goats  now then patrick and dan be good said randy patting the animals on the neck and then he handed each of them a small carrot  with more vegetables displayed close in front of them the two billy goats mounted the fireescape quite nimbly being rewarded with something more to eat when they stood on the landing in front of the door leading into the upper hallway  now if they only dont take it into their heads to let out a loud ba when they get into the hall said fred anxiously  well feed them something returned jack that will be sure to keep them quiet and he passed over some bits of celery he had in his pocket  a cautious rap on the iron door and it was unbolted by walt baxter who had been assigned to that duty  how about itis the coast clear whispered andy anxiously  i think so but wait a minute and ill make sure whispered walt in return  soon he came back with word from fatty and ned that the rear hall of the school was practically deserted ned had already tried several keys in the door to asa lemms apartment and unlocked it  it was by sheer good luck that the boys managed unobserved to get the two goats into the school through two hallways and at last into the room of the hated professor  on one side of the professors bedroom there was a large clothing closet and in this the two goats were placed  now well take off their harness said jack there is no use in getting that snarled up or damaged  im going to fix up some new harness for them announced randy come on andy  his twin understood and while the others remained on guard in the hallway randy and andy lost no time in decorating the two goats with various articles of professor lemms wearing apparel they buttoned a coat around each goat like a blanket and got a bright green sweater over one goats head and around his neck then they found a number of used neckties in a chiffonier and these were tied on the goats legs and horns  they sure do look like some goats now cried andy gaily then the animals were shoved back into the closet and the door closed  is the coast still clear asked randy as they came out of the bedroom  it is but i dont think lemm will stay downstairs much longer answered jack  will you fellows come down again ive got another idea burst out randy come onquick  not knowing what was in the wind the others followed him through the hallway and down the fireescape once more then he led them to a place behind the garage here were a number of flat boxes which in the springtime had been used for raising plants these boxes had had a small amount of water in them and were now filled with thin sheets of ice  lets take a few of those sheets of ice upstairs said randy theyll fit in very nicely between the sheets on old lemons bed  all of the others caught at the suggestion with avidity and in a very few minutes each of the boys was mounting the fireescape once again this time with a large sheet of ice not unlike a heavy pane of glass under his arm  ive got a scheme suggested andy with a broad grin well place three of the sheets of ice in his bed under the sheet and the others on the floor here right in front of the door then hell have a chance to slide into the room  wow and maybe it wont be some slide chuckled walt baxter  the sheets of ice were soon placed in the bed and covered with some of the bedspreads and the others were disposed on the hardwood floor directly in front of the door inside the room then the cadets turned out the lights locked the door as before and hurried away  it was less than five minutes later when dan soppinger came rushing upstairs whistling in a peculiar manner this was a signal that danger was at hand  he just put the books away and hes gathering up his papers announced dan i think hell be upstairs in a few minutes more  all right dan were ready for him announced randy now then fellows if there isnt some fun when asa lemm enters his room then i miss my guess  the joke that was to come off seemed to be too good to keep and as a consequence after a hurried consultation about a dozen other cadets were let into the secret all watched eagerly for the coming of professor lemm and there was a low whistle of warning went from room to room when the hated teacher was seen to be mounting the stairs  as was quite usual with him asa lemm was not in good humor he had been hunting up a number of references in the library without his usual success  this job of teaching is getting worse and worse he grumbled to himself its too bad that ive got to waste my time on these boys if i could only get back some of that money i lost i wouldnt spend another hour over this tiresome task and he heaved a deep sigh the loss of his little fortune was the one great sore spot with him  he came swinging through the hall with long rapid strides and as he did so the rovers and their friends watched him from various doorways and side halls they saw him unlock his door and throw it open the next instant came a sudden yell of alarm and then a tremendous bump asa lemms feet had struck the sheets of ice on the floor and they had gone out from under him very suddenly letting him down flat on his back  hi hi whats the meaning of this spluttered the teacher and then as his hand struck the icy coldness of what was beneath him he gave another cry ice what does this mean can the water pipes have burst and flooded the room  not without difficulty he managed to regain his feet and then started to walk to where he could turn on the lights but again he slipped and this time he came up against a small table piled high with books and sent this over with a crash  gee hes sure enjoying himself chuckled andy  come on fellows lets see what all the noise is about exclaimed jack in a loud voice something dreadful must be going on in professor lemms room  whats the matteris somebody getting killed called out randy  it isnt a fire is it broke in walt baxter catching the cue  sounds to me as if somebody was pulling the school down was spouters contribution  everybody to the rescue yelled ned lowe  these cries combined with the noise which was coming from asa lemms apartment caused such a commotion that soon fully a score of other cadets showed themselves in the hallway  whats the matter questioned slugger brown who had just been on the point of retiring and who was in his pajamas and slippers  something going on in professor lemms room answered nappy martell who had been with him and who was similarly attired  by this time professor lemm had managed to regain his feet a second time but the broken sheets of ice were now all over the floor of his room and just as he managed to turn on the lights he slipped once more this time sending a chair spinning against the closet door  its iceits ice and nothing else he ejaculated as he gazed in wonder at the floor now how did that come here i dont see any broken water pipe then of a sudden his face took on a dark look its those boysconfound them if i can catch them ill make them suffer for this     chapter xi  the joke on asa lemm   lets go in and see whats the matter with the poor man suggested andy  thats rightmaybe hes got a fit  something has happened to professor lemm yelled one of the other cadets  by this time the commotion had attracted the attention of nearly everybody in the school and teachers and cadets came running from all directions and even some of the hired help from the kitchen came up the back stairs wondering what had gone wrong then the bunch of boys led by the rovers suddenly threw open the door which led to asa lemms room it was at this instant that the astonished and bewildered professor was making his way toward the closet door a strange thumping had reached his ears  i knew itits some of those boys and more than likely one of them got locked into the closet by his fellows ill soon find out who he is and make him tell me who is responsible for this outrage  the door had been locked by randy but the key was in it and readily turned then professor lemm flung the door open viciously  you rascals ill teach you to play tricks on me he began as in the somewhat dim light he made out what he thought were the forms of two crouching boys then he let out a sudden yell of alarm as one of the crouching figures launched itself forward at him the figure was that of patrick the larger of the goats  bewildered by the confinement and not at all liking the way in which he had been dressed up the big billy goat hurled himself straight at the teacher he struck asa lemm fairly and squarely in the stomach bowling him over as if he were a tenpin then he made another leap and landed on the top of the bed where he gazed around not knowing which way to turn next  oh my look at what professor lemm has in his room piped up andy  asa lemm had rolled over and was now trying to get up but just as he raised himself on his hands and knees he struck some of the sliding sheets of ice and down he went once more this time directly in front of the other goat which promptly proceeded to leap on top of him  hi get off of me you rascal spluttered the professor and thrashed around wildly get off of me who are you anyway and then as he got a better sight of the animal which at that moment leaped up on the bed beside his mate he turned and sat up in amazement  a goat two goats how did they get here  what do you know about this professor lemm is keeping goats in his room cried jack  these and a score of other cries rent the air while all the cadets crowded into the doorway of the room to see what was going on in the bunch of boys were slugger brown and nappy martell and it must be confessed that these two unworthies were enjoying the scene quite as much as anybody  ill fix some of you for this roared asa lemm as he struggled to his feet slipping around and clutching the end of his bed as he did so ill have some of you suspended where is colonel colby send for colonel colby at once  evidently patrick the larger goat did not like the looks of the irate teacher who was now shaking his fists at the grinning cadets suddenly the goat made another leap this time striking asa lemm in the shoulder and once more the professor went down this time with his feet sliding directly under the bed so that he became somewhat wedged in from his waist down then the goat made another leap and charged toward the door to the hallway  look out warned jack and was just in time to push fred out of danger then the goat made a rush and the next minute came full tilt into slugger brown sending the bully crashing into those behind him the second goat also leaped from the bed and made for the doorway hitting martell as he passed  look out for the batteringram  this is only a battering goatbut its just as bad yelled andy go it goat go it he added gleefully  both goats did go it they raced through the hallway knocking down cadets right and left one younger boy named stowell but who was always called codfish by the others because of his unusually broad mouth was attacked at the head of the stairs and sent hurtling down to the bottom  oh oh im killed he has knocked me to pieces yelled codfish  with the two goats racing around the school the excitement increased but gradually the goats were driven by the rovers to a lower hallway and then toward a side door which jack and fred lost no time in opening  get them out of here as quick as you can we dont want them to be captured whispered jack to his cousins we dont want old lemon to know they are mike otooles animals  stop those goats i dont want them to get away yelled asa lemm from the upper hallway but the goats were already outside  oh gee we forgot one thingi mean several things gasped andy the goats are dressed up in old lemons clothes  gracious why didnt we think of that gasped randy we cant let em run away with all that stuff  ill go after them and see if i can stop them said jack  want me to go with you questioned walt  if you will walt maybe it will take two of us to manage the goats and then jack and walt hurried off and the others returned to see what would happen next  fortunately for the boys who had gone after them the goats did not run very far jack had a few more vegetables left in his pocket and with these in his hand he walked cautiously up to the animals which had run down to a corner of the campus  hurrah ive got one of them cried the rover boy presently as he caught patrick by the horns now walt see if you can hold the other and well take these things off of them  now that they were once more in the open air the goats appeared to be quite docile and consequently the two cadets had little difficulty in disrobing them  why dont you return the goats to otoole while you are at it suggested walt after the wearing apparel had been placed in a small bundle  id do it if i had their harness walt  want me to go back for it  if you will  all right ill do it and give me that bundle ill smuggle it into the school somehow and watch my chance to leave it in old lemons room evidently the son of dan baxter was as bold as his father had ever been before him  so it was arranged and a minute later walt disappeared into the school building he was gone the best part of five minutes and then came running across the school campus carrying the goats harness under his sweater  gee but they are having a peach of a time in the school he announced asa lemm is quarreling with colonel colby who came over from his rooms he wants to have half the school arrested on account of the goats and the ice  what did you do with the bundle  oh saythat was easy all the crowd were around old lemon and the colonel discussing the matter so i slipped behind them and threw the bundle in the corner of lemons room  the two rovers lost no time in placing a little of the harness on the goatsjust sufficient to drive them  now you neednt go with me walt unless you want to i can get these goats to otooles alone  oh id just as lief keep you company answered the other cheerfully  urging the two goats before them the pair made off down the hill in the direction of the otoole farm the animals seemed to know the way home and kept up a brisk pace  now then we had better go a bit slow announced jack when they came in sight of the buildings maybe otoole has discovered the absence of the goats and is on the watch for us  this warning however was unnecessary for the old irish farmer and his wife had retired for the night doing this without being aware of what had taken place among their live stock  illustration the goat came full tilt into slugger brown  page 111  cautiously the two cadets opened the goat stable and led the animals inside then while walt lit a couple of matches jack managed to place the goats where they had been before and also put the harness away  i dont think ill leave that note or the money either he said maybe it will be as well if otoole never knows that the goats were out i dont think the experience did them any harm if it did we can settle with otoole later and he pocketed the note he had previously written and also the money then the two cadets lost no time in hurrying back to colby hall  in the meantime what walt had said about the commotion going on at the school was true  i tell you sir its a perfect outrage bawled asa lemm at the top of his lungs an outrage sir and i demand satisfaction  please do not become so excited professor responded colonel colby we must try to get at the bottom of this matter you say there is ice on the floor of your room  yes sir a perfect pond of ice  did somebody flood your floor and then freeze it questioned the master of the hall in wonder  i dont know how it was done but it was done and i nearly broke my neck the minute i entered the room it was disgraceful i never saw anything to equal it and asa lemms face was fairly purple with rage  and what about those goats  they were locked up in my closet and dressed up in some clothingmy clothing i suppose  then when they ran out of the building they must have taken your clothing with them  more than likely oh its shameful and the irate professor shook his fists in his rage  where are the goats now  i dont know and i dont care  one of those goats knocked me flat growled slugger brown  yes and he biffed me one too came from nappy martell  let us go and make an investigation professor lemm remarked colonel colby i will accompany you to your room for they were now near the stairway which the goats had descended  the pair proceeded to the apartment followed by some of the other teachers and nearly all of the cadets by this time much of the ice on the floor had melted forming little pools of muddy water  we had better have this cleaned up at once said colonel colby and turned to one of the teachers order some of the hired help up here please and the teacher hurried off to execute the errand  while colonel colby was looking at the ice and the water asa lemm chanced to glance in a corner then he strode forward and caught up the bundle walt baxter had flung there  what is that questioned the master of the hall and then as the professor undid the bundle he continued is that your clothing  ii think it is faltered asa lemm yes sir  did they undress the animals before they let them go queried the master of the school and if the truth must be told he had all he could do to keep a straight face he could not help but remember some of the pranks he had played himself while a cadet at putnam hall  i dont know anything about this colonel colby but these are my things and catching up the bundle asa lemm flung it into the clothing closet he continued to storm around demanding that some of the boys be punished for what had occurred while this was going on two of the hired help came up from the kitchen with pails and mops and presently succeeded in cleaning up the floor two rugs which had been lying there were taken away to be dried  i think we had better let this matter rest until morning said colonel colby finally it is too late to start an investigation now i wish all of you to retire at once he commanded to the amused cadets  some one is going to suffer for this growled asa lemm  i shall do what i can for you professor announced the master of the hall and then he moved away scattering the cadets before him  most of the boys retired to their rooms smiling broadly to themselves for nearly all of them had enjoyed the joke greatly  but it isnt over yet whispered andy to his immediate friends there is more to come just watch and see     chapter xii  in colonel colbys office   as soon as jack and walt returned to colby hall they hurried up to the rooms occupied by the rover boys they found jacks cousins present and also gif spouter and several others  we had the best luck ever declared jack and related how they had managed to get the goats back to mike otooles stable without the irish farmer being aware of what had happened  say thats fine burst out andy  we want to be on the watch remarked randy old lemon will be going to bed pretty soon and we want to find out just how comfortable he finds his bed and he grinned  word had been passed around to about a dozen of the cadets and as soon as the school had quieted down and the others had retired to their rooms these cadets came forth into the halls on tiptoes and made their way noiselessly in the direction of the apartment occupied by asa lemm  hes arranging that clothing in his closet announced andy after peering through the keyhole in the door hes partly undressed so i guess hell go to bed pretty soon  there was a short silence and then the boys heard the bed creak as professor lemm got into it an instant later came a cry of rage  whats this more ice i declare the bed is sopping wet oh those young rascals for asa lemm had thrown himself down beneath the spread under which had been placed several sheets of thin ice a large portion of the ice had melted and the sheets were as wet as they were cold as a consequence his pajamas were pretty well soaked and he shivered as he threw the covers back and bounced to his feet  hes enjoying it all right enough whispered andy  hang those boys roared the irate teacher oh what i wouldnt do to them if i had them here he hopped around the room first on one foot and then on the other shivering as he did so as was usual the steam throughout the building had been turned off some time before so that the apartment was quite cold  we had better scatter warned jack he may open the door at any instant and find us here  right you are answered randy and then unable to resist the temptation he bent down and shouted through the keyhole pleasant dreams professor i hope you enjoyed the icewater  then all of the cadets fled to their rooms and in less than five minutes each of them was undressed and safe in bed  if ever there was an angry man it was asa lemm at that particular moment he had to change all his night clothing and then don a bathrobe and slippers and go down below once more and get some of the hired help to clean up his room and take away the wet mattress of his bed a dry mattress was substituted from a vacant bedroom but it was all of half an hour before this work was accomplished and in the meantime the professor stormed around threatening about everything he could imagine  ill have the law on them ill have every one of them locked up he said to colonel colby its an outrage that i should be treated in this fashion  it is certainly a most unpleasant occurrence professor agreed the master of the hall but boys will be boysyou know that as well as i do i can remember when i went to school i loved to play practical jokes and they were not always kindly jokes either but as for having these boys arrested or anything of that sort that i think would be going too far we can punish them enough right herethat is provided we can find out who they are  i dont believe in such jokes  neither do inow that i have grown older but i did believe in them when i was a boy  the trouble with this school is the discipline is not strict enough snapped asa lemm if we are not more strict the cadets will degenerate into nothing but rowdies and hoodlums  i think i am the best judge of how discipline should be maintained in this institution responded colonel colby with dignity i will take this matter up in the morning and do my best to sift it to the bottom now i think we had better retire as it is growing late and thereupon he returned to his own rooms  i think that was the best joke we ever played remarked andy when he and the other rovers were dressing on the following morning  it sure did count one against old lemon chuckled randy  yes and to think the way slugger and nappy were knocked over by the goats too broke in fred  ill bet theyre mad over that observed jack more than likely it will make them take a hand in assisting lemm to find out who was guilty well have to be on our guard against them  did anybody see you making off with the goats queried randy suddenly  i dont think so answered jack but in this surmise he was mistaken one cadet had seen walt baxter hurrying from the school with goats harness under his sweater and this youth had from a safe distance watched jack and walt place some of the harness on the goats and drive them off in the direction of mike otooles farm  this cadet was codfish who was always sneaking around trying to pick up information that did not rightly belong to him  ha ha said the little sneak to himself after walt and jack had disappeared now i know who was responsible for bringing those goats into the school  at first the sneak thought he would report the matter to either asa lemm or colonel colby but as he was not in particularly good favor with the professor on whom the joke had been played he thought it might be as well for him to wait and think the matter over  maybe i had better tell slugger and nappy first and see what theyve got to say about it he reasoned he went to the bully and his crony with everything  he dressed early and then went over to nappys room where he found the cronies together just as he had surmised they were talking over the affair of the night before and wondering who could be guilty  ive got some news announced codfish  what news demanded nappy  its very important went on the little cadet if i tell you will you promise not to give me away  is it about last nights affair cod demanded slugger quickly  now look here slugger you promised not to call me cod any more pleaded the sneak  all right henry that was merely a slip of the tongue returned the bully goodnaturedly he knew exactly how to handle such a fellow as stowell now tell us what youve got on your mind  will you promise not to give me away  sure came from both of the others promptly  well then i know who brought those two goats into the school last night announced codfish proudly and thereupon being urged to do so by the others he told of what he had seen  i knew the rovers were mixed up in that cried slugger  and ive noticed that walt baxter has been training with them more than likely it was the work of the whole rover crowd announced nappy  dont you think we ought to let colonel colby know about this questioned codfish anxiously it was his delight to get other cadets into trouble and see them suffer but he always wanted to keep his own actions dark for fear his schoolmates might turn on him and start in to square up  of course we ought to let colonel colby know about thisand professor lemm too answered nappy the question is how can we do it without getting mixed up in it ourselves  we might send a note to colonel colby suggested the sneak  the matter was talked over for several minutes and then it was decided that two notes should be written and one delivered to colonel colby and the other to asa lemm  who is going to write the notes questioned codfish  you can do that henry said the bully quickly he had not forgotten how the anonymous letter he had once sent out had been traced back to him in spite of the disguised handwriting  oh i couldnt do that answered stowell in alarm and he shook his head vigorously  yes you can broke in nappy and thereupon somewhat against his will codfish penned the two notes in as much of a disguised hand as was possible for him  but im not going to deliver the notes he warned feebly you two have got to do that much  all right we will answered slugger he turned to his crony you slip one of them under professor lemms door and ill place the other on colonel colbys desk  all right but be careful  bet your life  asa lemm was just finishing his morning toilet and grumbling over the happenings of the night when he chanced to glance toward the door of his room and at that moment saw a letter thrust under it he stared for an instant in amazement and then rushed forward and threw the door wide open but his movement quick as it was came too late for nappy martell had already slipped around a corner and made his escape taking up the letter the professor read the contents with great interest the communication ran as follows       dear professor lemm       if you want to know more about the trouble last night ask john      rover and walter baxter they had the two billy goats i think you      will find that all of the rovers and the boys who go with them were      in this joke       yours respectfully       one who knows  so thats who is guilty muttered the teacher after reading the letter a second time the rovers eh i might have known it because of the trouble i have had with them in the classroom and i remember now that i have also had trouble with that baxter boy i must see colonel colby about this at once  the professor hurried downstairs and found that colonel colby had entered his office but a few minutes before and was perusing the communication left there secretly by slugger brown  i have found out who was guilty last night snapped asa lemm as he flourished the letter in his hand  did you receive an anonymous communication demanded the master of the hall  i did sir but what makes you ask that question  i have such a communication myself and colonel colby indicated the epistle  we must punish those rascals sir  first i want to find out if there is any truth in these letters answered colonel colby very frequently anonymous communications cannot be relied upon  oh i havent the least doubt but what rover and baxter are guilty exclaimed asa lemm quickly ive had trouble in the classroom with them and also with the other rovers i should not be surprised if the whole crowd had something to do with it  i will send for rover and baxter  it must be confessed that jack was somewhat surprised when one of the assistants came to him and told him he was wanted immediately in the office  gee this looks bad cried randy  want any of us to go with you questioned fred quickly  no i can face the music alone answered the oldest rover boy  he arrived at the office just as another assistant was bringing in walt baxter the two exchanged glances but said nothing but the glance given walt meant keep mum and the other understood and nodded slightly  so here you are eh cried asa lemm before colonel colby had a chance to say a word i thought id catch you  excuse me professor lemm but i wish you would allow me to conduct this examination put in colonel colby a trifle stiffly if the truth must be told the overbearing manner of the teacher was not any more to the liking of the master of the hall than it was to the cadets yet asa lemm had come well recommended and colonel colby did not wish to pass hasty judgment on him  yes sir returned the professor but please remember i have suffered greatly and i demand satisfaction  i have sent for you cadets in order to clear up the affair that happened last night began colonel colby ignoring asa lemms last remark i have been given to understand that you were the two to bring those goats into the hall am i right  i did not bring the goats into the hall returned walt baxter promptly just the same i guess im as guilty as anybody he added quickly not wishing to shirk responsibility  i was one of the cadets who brought the goats into the hall colonel colby answered jack promptly  baxter did not assist in bringing them into the hall  no sir  but you were not alone rover  no sir  who was with you in this escapade  i prefer not to answer that question colonel colby  make him answer make him answer stormed asa lemm you young rascal ill teach you to play tricks on me and he shook his fist in jacks face  professor lemm ill thank you to be less violent interrupted colonel colby this examination must be held in an orderly fashion you say you were not alone rover will you tell me how many were mixed up in this affair  jack thought for a moment do you mean the whole happening in professor lemms room  yes  oh there were eight or ten of usmaybe more of course some had more to do with it than others responded jack  eight or ten of you gasped asa lemm as many as that and his face showed his surprise he had imagined that possibly only the rover boys and walt baxter were guilty  are you quite sure you dont want to mention any names rover asked colonel colby again  no colonel and if you were in my position i do not think you would want to mention any of them either added jack looking the master of the hall squarely in the eyes  we wont discuss that side of the question colonel colby turned to walt baxter how about you do you care to say who was mixed up in this affair  no sir was the prompt response  make them tell make them tell exclaimed asa lemm punish them severely put them in the guardhouse on bread and water until they are willing to divulge the names of all the rascals who were mixed up in these outrageous proceedings  i am not going to make them tell if they wont do it on their own account was colonel colbys answer as a cadet at putnam hall he had never had any use for a tale bearer  then ill take the law in my own hands cried asa lemm vindictively ill go down to haven point and make a complaint and have them both arrested     chapter xiii  asa lemm is dismissed   while the examination of jack and walt was taking place in the office the other rovers and their chums held a meeting in randys room  what do you suppose this meanscalling jack and walt down to the colonels office remarked fred anxiously he had just been informed by dan soppinger about walt  it was jack and walt who took those goats back maybe somebody spotted them suggested spouter  the discussion lasted for some minutes and grew quite warm and then andy leaped up  i know what im going to do he said im going below and try to find out just what it means  and so am i added fred and randy quickly  well all stand by him announced spouter of course you fellows brought the goats here but i think we had as much to do with the rest of it as any of you  andy hurried off and lost no time in making his way to the door of colonel colbys private office the door had been left slightly ajar so it was an easy matter for him to take in most of what was said  gracious this certainly is growing serious he murmured to himself when asa lemm made the declaration that he would go down to haven point and have jack and walt arrested i guess i had better let the others know about it and he scurried upstairs again  oh andy do you suppose old lemon will really have them locked up questioned fred anxiously after being told of what was taking place below  i dont think he would dare to do it announced spouter  i move we all go down and take a hand in this cried gif there is no fairness in letting jack and walt suffer for what we did  several other cadets had drifted in those who had either been on the watch while the joke was being prepared or who had assisted in placing the sheets of ice on the floor and in the bed and all agreed that the crowd had better stand together when it came to acknowledging what had been done  forward march cried gif who as a leader in athletics took it upon himself to manage the affair come on nowand no shirking  braced up by numbers all of the cadets fell in readily with this plan and as a consequence there were ten boys led by gif and the rovers who marched down to the office  well enter by column of twos announced gif march in in regular military fashion he added and then knocked upon the office door  colonel colby was doing what he could to question jack and walt on one hand while trying to make asa lemm keep quiet on the other when the others arrived the master of the hall was having no easy time of it because professor lemm seemed to be growing more and more excited  ill have the law on them i tell you he cried they ought to go to states prison for this  please be quiet just a minute professor remonstrated colonel colby then came the knock on the door and the colonel flung it open not at all pleased over the interruption  whawhat does this mean gasped asa lemm as he saw the double row of cadets filing in  colonel colby we have come to report announced gif saluting  please allow me to be the spokesman gif pleaded randy stepping to the front and then before his school chum could speak he continued colonel colby we have come to give ourselves up  give yourselves up what do you mean rover  we were all in this lark together sir  and if there is to be any punishment we want to stand for our share of it added andy  i think we rover boys were more to blame than the others put in fred  you see professor lemm is down on us and we thought we had to do something to get square andy endeavored to explain  he doesnt treat us fairly in the classroom cried spouter  if he wasnt here wed get along without any trouble whatever piped up a voice in the rear  it must be confessed that the sudden entrance of the ten cadets and what they had to say concerning the joke that had been played somewhat stumped the master of the hall as for asa lemm for the moment he was dumbfounded but then his natural antipathy to boys asserted itself and he glared at them viciously  so you were all in it eh he snarled i might have known as much you are all a pack of rowdies you are not fit to associate with respectable people  professor lemm i do not wish you to address our cadets in such a manner said colonel colby sternly these young gentlemen are not rowdies even though they have played a joke which was not particularly nice i do not uphold them in the least in what they have done but at the same time i cannot help but remember that they are only boys and that boys are sometimes very thoughtless  thoughtless they think too much i tell you sir they are a pack of rowdies and unless you punish them and punish them severely i shall take the matter in my own hands and have them arrested  if you do anything of that sort professor lemm we will have to dispense with your services in this school announced colonel colby flatly he was growing weary of the irate teachers manner  a strenuous half hour followed everybody present forgetting all about roll call and breakfast colonel colby did what he could in questioning all of the cadets regarding the occurrences of the night before but was continually interrupted by the unreasonable teacher finally he could stand it no longer and turned to the professor with all the dignity he could command  professor lemm i have stood enough he said in a cold hard voice which instantly commanded attention i want no more such language from you you may go to your breakfast and i will conduct this examination alone and will see you about it before we begin the days session in the school and in the meantime allow me to impress upon you that it is all nonsense to talk about having any of these boys arrested they have done nothing that warrants arrest and if you attempt anything of that sort you will not only make yourself ridiculous but you might place yourself open to a suit for damages now please leave this office  ill see about this ill see about this snapped the unreasonable teacher and left the office in anything but a dignified fashion  as soon as professor lemm had gone the master of the hall questioned the boys closely concerning not only the affair of the night before but also about the troubles they had had with the teacher both in the classroom and elsewhere this was the first time the boys had had a chance to get one in on old lemon as andy afterwards declared and they did not mince matters in telling of the many trials and tribulations which asa lemm had caused them it is barely possible that some of the complaints were overdrawn yet there was such a unanimity of opinion concerning professor lemms harshness that colonel colby was quite impressed  now i want to ask you boys a question and i want you to answer it honestly said colonel colby toward the close of the examination would you have played such a trick as this upon any of the other professors  i wouldnt answered randy quickly  nor i came from fred and andy  id never dream of playing such a trick on anybody but a man like professor lemm announced jack the others also agreed that it was not likely any such joke would have been played on anybody else in the hall  then evidently none of you likes professor lemm said colonel colby slowly  to this there was no reply but the look on the faces of the various cadets showed the master of the hall that he had struck the truth  now im going to ask you boys another question he went on after a pause and there was a faint smile on his face when he spoke dont you think you ought to be punished for what you have done  for a moment there was another silence then jack spoke up  in one way yes sir but in another no he replied professor lemm treated us very unjustly in the classroom in making us stay in and making us do extra lessons and we didnt know of any other way to get square with him  looks to me as if we got our punishment before we played the joke said andy and this reply made some of the cadets grin  colonel colby looked out of the window which faced the snowcovered campus although the boys did not know it he hardly knew what to say or do he realized that he could not pass over the occurrence without punishing the lads and yet he could see their point of viewthat asa lemm had been the first at fault in not treating them fairly during classes  order has got to be maintained in this school he said finally as he faced them if we did not have order the whole institution would go to pieces that is my first point my second is that two wrongs have never yet made a right and instead of taking matters into your own hands as you did after having trouble with professor lemm you should have come to me and told me what was wrong  i shall take this matter up later after i have had an opportunity to make further inquiries concerning your conduct in the meantime you may go to breakfast and then to your classes and thus he dismissed them  of course as soon as the boys were by themselves they began to discuss the situation from every possible angle several wanted to know how it was that the master of the hall had learned that jack and walt were guilty  somebody sent colonel colby a note about us i saw it on his desk answered jack  yes and asa lemm had another note just like it added walt some sneak in this school must have watched us and then sent the notes  much to the cadets relief they did not see asa lemm in the messroom nor did the language teacher show himself during the morning session  perhaps hes having another talk with colonel colby suggested fred  the youngest rover was right the unreasonable teacher was closeted with the master of the hall for over an hour and during that time much of what had been told by the cadets was threshed over asa lemm was as unreasonable as ever and finally colonel colby lost all patience with him  i am afraid professor lemm that you are not suited to be a teacher in this institution he said your actions here show that you are very irritable and unreasonable after you left this office i questioned all of those cadets closely and all had practically the same story to tell namely that you had required more than was fair of them in your classes and that on the slightest pretext you had punished them by making them stay in and do extra lessons i went into many of the details and i am convinced that in a good proportion of the cases the students were right and you were wrong now i regret this very much because i realize that  sir i dont want to be talked to in this fashion cried asa lemm bridling up i was not in the wrong at all those boys are regular imps they dont know how to treat a teacher decently i wont stand for their nonsense i want them severely punished or else  wait a moment professor lemm interrupted the colonel rising and facing him sternly i said i was sorry and i am but i feel that you are not the man to teach in this institution and consequently i must ask you for your resignation i will pay you your salary up to the first of next month and you can leave this school just as soon as you desire  whawhat this to me ejaculated the professor in consternation  yes sir you can draw your pay and if you wish you can leave this morning  butbutthis is outrageous i wont stand it i was hired for the school year  you wereon condition that your services were entirely satisfactory to me they are not satisfactory and consequently i am giving you this opportunity to resign  if i have to leave ill have those boys arrested stormed asa lemm  i dont think id be so foolish if i were in your place professor what they did was nothing but a foolish schoolboy joke and they did that simply to get square with you for your unreasonable conduct toward them i think the best you can do is to drop the matter if you insist on dragging this affair before the public perhaps the boys and i myself will have something to say that you will not care to hear  well seewell see cried asa lemm shaking his head and with his eyes blazing wrathfully well see about this and thus speaking he stamped away     chapter xiv  overhearing a plot   professor lemm has left colby hall  what do you mean jack left the hall for good  yes randy  who told you that questioned fred eagerly  i just got it from professor brice he said that old lemon resigned took his pay and left yesterday afternoon while we were in classes  hurrah thats the best news ive heard in a year of sundays cried andy gone for good just think of it and in high spirits he began to do a jig and ended with a handspring across the room landing with a violent thump on the bed  hi you andy remonstrated jack just because you are happy is no reason you should bust up my sleeping place  wow i feel fine enough to do almost anything returned the funloving rover just to think of it we wont be worried by asa lemm any more  dont you be too sure of that went on his cousin asa lemm is gone it is true but we may hear from him nevertheless when he went away he was an angry as ever so professor brice said  as was usual the rovers had congregated in their rooms along with several of their chums outside it was snowing once again the soft particles whirling in all directions and clinging fast to the window panes it was the off hour of the afternoon but none of the lads had cared to go outside or even visit the school library  the news that asa lemm had left the hall was true following his heated interview with colonel colby he had written out his resignation accepted his pay for the month packed his baggage and left the school never to return only several of the teachers and the man who had driven him away had seen him go and this was as colonel colby wished it for he was afraid that if the cadets were present at the disliked teachers departure they would make some sort of demonstration against him  strange as it may seem colonel colby had said nothing further about punishing the cadets evidently he had taken their word for it that they would not have played the trick on any other teacher in the school and possibly he remembered what andy had said to the effect that the boys had been punished beforehand for what had been done a few of the lads were afraid that the matter might be taken up later but the majority had reached the conclusion that they would hear no more concerning it  its too bad its snowing said jack after he and the others had tired of speaking about the departed teacher i had an idea we would be able to get in some fine skating before we left for the christmas holidays  the rover boys had not forgotten the fact that both asa lemm and colonel colby had received notes concerning the joke that had been played they remembered well how slugger brown as related in a previous volume had sent an anonymous communication to elias lacy accusing them of having shot the old farmers cows  if slugger was mean enough to send that letter hed be mean enough to send these notes was the way jack put it  i wish we could see one or both of the letters remarked randy we could very quickly tell if they were in sluggers handwriting or nappys either  oh you can bet theyd disguise their handwriting as much as possible said fred  the snow continued the next day and it was so windy and unpleasant outdoors that the battalion had to dispense with its outdoor parade and spend that time in a drill in the gymnasium after this was over the rovers and some of their chums amused themselves on the bars swinging rings and with the exercising machines the gymnasium afforded  the boys were doing all sorts of stunts when suddenly fred called randy to one side  come on with me he said in a low voice i think ive discovered something  his manner showed that he had something unusual on his mind and randy lost no time in doing as was bidden the two cousins hurried to a corner of the gymnasium and then fred led the way up a narrow stairway which opened up on the second floor of the building a place which was heated but seldom used by the majority of the cadets it was used more as a storeroom and contained a lot of disused gymnasium paraphernalia and boxes and barrels  whats going on up here questioned randy when his cousin placed a hand over his mouth  i just saw slugger and nappy come up here with codfish whispered fred and those three wouldnt come to such an outoftheway place if there wasnt something in the wind  youre right there fred was the equally low reply when those three get together on the sly there is generally something brewing  before emerging on the second floor of the gymnasium they looked around cautiously at the far end near a steam radiator they saw slugger and nappy seated on a couple of boxes while codfish rested on the top of an old nail keg the two older boys were puffing away at cigarettes something that was against the school rules  might as well have a cigarette henry slugger was saying goodnaturedly and at the same time holding out a box  ii dont think i will answered codfish  oh go ahead it will make a man of you put in nappy and somewhat against his will the small cadet took a cigarette and lit it  while this was going on fred and randy had managed to step from the top of the stairs to where a number of boxes were piled up they moved along cautiously and soon got to within a few feet of where the other three cadets were seated without being noticed  now then lets come to business remarked slugger after puffing away at a cigarette for a moment he blew a cloud of smoke to the ceiling i think now is a dandy time to get square with those rovers  but you want to be carefulthey are awful sly said codfish  i think you are mistaken henry they didnt find out about those notes and the bully chuckled  just the same slug i think we ought to take cods advice and be careful broke in nappy lighting a fresh cigarette i have a hunch that the rovers are watching us like a cat watches mice  maybe they are but i guess we know how to fool them went on the bully swaggeringly and now is just our chance to get them into a hole  explain please  its just like this nappy of course they havent admitted it but you know just as well as i do that colonel colby must have punished them pretty severely for the trick they played on lemm what he did to them we dont know but probably he has given em some extra lessons to do and maybe hes punished em in other ways  oh sure he must have punished them somehow  i havent seen any of them going down to town since it happened put in codfish maybe colonel colby made them promise to stay within bounds  perhaps well as i was saying being punished they of course are pretty sore on the colonel now then if we can only play some dirty trick on colonel colby and make it appear as if the rovers and their crowd did it theyll sure get into hot water over it  im willing to do anything to square up with those fellows grumbled nappy he paused for a moment to puff away at his cigarette what do you propose doing  that of course is something well have to figure out well want to be careful so as not to get our own fingers burnt  ill tell you what you might do broke in codfish eagerly you might drop ashes all over colonel colbys office and his bedroom and then leave some of the ashes in a box in the rovers rooms and somebody might say something about having seen jack rover getting the ashes from the boilerroom  thats good as far as it goes henry but it isnt quite strong enough returned slugger we ought to do something that will make colonel colby hopping mad  ill tell you what lets do broke out nappy well use the ashes and well use some other things too i was down past the kitchen a while ago and i heard one of the cooks complaining about some of the canned tomatoes which were all spoiled and he was going to throw out now suppose we use some of those spoiled tomatoes with the ashes and maybe a quart or two of ink how about it  great exclaimed slugger ashes ink and decayed tomatoes will make one fine combination believe me  oh you want to be very careful remarked codfish his voice shaking a little the ink will be sure to spoil some things not to mention the bad tomatoes  well we want to spoil something returned slugger we want to get colonel colby real mad maybe then hell send the rovers home  how soon do you suppose we can play this joke questioned nappy while slugger lit a fresh cigarette  perhaps we can play it very soon well have to watch our chance was the answer slugger held out his box of cigarettes to codfish here henry have another  nnno ththank you stammered the sneak ii dodont care to smoke any more itit makes my head dizzy  oh youll soon get over that come on be a real man and smoke up urged slugger and much against his will poor codfish lit a second cigarette he having dropped the other behind the nail keg  this talk was followed by an animated discussion between slugger and nappy as to just how the proposed trick might be played codfish said but little he was growing pale and at the first chance threw away the second cigarette  of course fred and randy had listened to every word that was said ordinarily the rovers did not favor playing the part of eavesdroppers but just now they thought they were amply justified in listening to everything that their enemies might have to say  they are a fine bunch if ever there was one whispered randy  come on away i guess weve heard enough answered his cousin the best thing we can do is to report to jack and andy and then make up our minds what we are going to do next     chapter xv  an alarm of fire   with great care so as not to make any noise the two rover boys tiptoed their way back behind the boxes and barrels until they reached the narrow stairway  come on but dont make a bit of noise said randy quickly and went down the stairs as rapidly as possible with fred at his heels reaching the lower floor of the gymnasium they shut the door and then lost no time in mixing with the other rovers and their chums at the far end of the building  where have you fellows been questioned jack who had suddenly noticed their absence  ill tell you later said fred  now dont say a word more about our being awayespecially if slugger and nappy and codfish come this way act just as if we had been here right along  i get you randy said jack and a minute later as the others who had been mentioned came into sight he continued in a loud voice go ahead randy its your turn have you been asleep  no im not asleep answered randy and caught a ball which was being pitched around  fred began to practise on an exercising machine and acted as if he had been at it for some time  soon slugger nappy and codfish came down and passed the crowd eyeing all of them closely then slugger winked to the others and the three made their way slowly from the gymnasium building  now then ill tell you fellows something announced fred and thereupon he and his cousin related to the others what they had overheard in the upper room of the building  so thats their game is it cried jack wrathfully thats the way they are going to pay us back for agreeing to give them another chance at this school  you ought to tell colonel colby about this at once put in spouter who had listened to what was being said then he can have those rascals watched  i dont like the idea of going to colonel colby jack answered i feel more like taking the matter in my own hands  dont you do it jack advised gif your idea would be all well enough if they were ordinary cadets but they are not they should have been dismissed from this school long ago if i were you i wouldnt dirty my hands on them report the matter to the colonel and let him take charge of it  what is this you are saying garrison demanded a voice from close behind the cadets and professor brice appeared in the doorway of the washroom of the gymnasium what is this you just said about brown and martell  i said they were not fit to be cadets in this institution answered gif flatly  from what you young gentlemen have been saying i should judge that you know something concerning brown and martell went on the young teacher with a glance around the crowd  we do know something answered walt after a somewhat painful silence that is two of the crowd here know we have been urging them to speak to colonel colby about it  who are the two and what do you know  again there was a silence and then spouter came to the front  professor brice id like to ask a question he said two of the cadets here overheard a talk between brown martell and stowell those three proposed to play a most outrageous trick on colonel colby and then make it appear as if that trick had been played by some other cadets in fact they were going to make all the evidence point to those other cadets now do you think those cadets ought to defend themselves by telling colonel colby all they know they feel that they dont want to be tale bearers  if the trick was to be played solely to injure their reputation they certainly ought to expose it was the teachers quick response it is one thing to tell on another person just for the sake of telling and it is quite a different thing to defend ones own reputation  following this there was quite a discussion but in the end professor brice convinced the rovers that they had better tell the particulars of what they had overheard he listened to their story with close attention  this is certainly worthy of an investigation he said after they had finished ill tell colonel colby about it and maybe he will send for you if he does so kindly take my advice and see to it that when you come to the colonels office you are not watched by brown martell and stowell or that may spoil everything i think that the colonel will agree with me that the thing to do is to catch those fellows redhanded  all right professor well leave everything in your hands answered fred even yet he did not feel just right over what had been done he still felt that he and his cousins should have settled affairs privately with slugger brown and his cronies even if it had been a matter of fist fights  the young professor lost no time in going to colonel colby he found the master of the hall in his study looking over the questions which were to be used in the coming examination  i am sorry to report more trouble sir he announced and sitting down he gave colonel colby a rapid sketch of what had taken place at the gymnasium  too bad too bad and the master of the hall showed his disappointment he heaved a sigh it looks to me brice as if i had made a mistake in giving brown and martell another chance  just what i was thinking sir returned the young teacher  you say the rovers did not wish to report the matter  thats it sir i had to fairly drag the story but of them they did not want to have the reputation of tale bearers  i think i understand their view of it brice at the same time this is too serious a matter to allow them to settle it between themselves i think the best thing we can do is to have those three cadets watched closely to see if they really intend to carry out their nefarious plot  exactly what i was thinking colonel colby  first however you may send randy rover and his cousin fred to me i want to question them so as to make sure of my ground  expecting this call randy and fred kept themselves in readiness and as soon as professor brice came for them they hurried off to the office taking care that none of their enemies should see them slugger nappy and codfish however were out of sight having gone upstairs to their rooms  now i want you to tell me exactly what was said announced colonel colby as soon as the two cadets appeared  they had their story well in mind and it did not take long to give the master of the hall all of the details in the midst of the conversation fred let drop accidentally that the three unworthy cadets had been smoking  they were smoking interrupted the colonel  yes sir butiididnt mean to mention that stammered fred  what were they smoking rover  cigarettes  all of them  yes sir although to tell the truth codfishi mean stowelldidnt seem to want to smoke but sluggerthat is brownurged him so that he didnt know how to get out of it i guess the cigarette made him sick  i see colonel colby nodded his head slowly now go on and then the story of what had been overheard in the upper room of the gymnasium was finished  its an outrage an outrage if what you say is true and i have no reason to doubt your word went on the master of the hall after the cadets had finished i am sorry now that i gave brown and martell this chance to return to our school  to this neither of the rovers made any reply for an instant both of them thought of the trick they had played on asa lemm colonel colby seemed to follow their thought  your trick and this thing are two entirely different affairs continued the colonel in the one case you in your boyish fashion tried to square up for the way you had been mistreated in this case however these cadets are trying to get you into trouble and if this trick had succeeded it is just possible that i might have been angry enough to send you and the rest of your family home  well dont send brown and martell home on our account announced randy we are not afraid of them  that may be rover but i cannot have such underhand work at this school now i want you cadets to do me a favor i want you to act exactly as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred i want you to tell all of the others to keep quiet about this i want to set a trap and if possible catch those rascals in the midst of their work do you understand  yes sir came from both of the cadets  then that is all  allowed to leave the office randy and fred lost no time in hunting up the others who had gone upstairs to the rover boys rooms on the way they met walt spouter and gif and told these cadets to come along then they closed the door to the hallway  its to be kept a secret announced randy  in subdued voices so that no one passing in the hallway might hear them the rovers and their chums discussed the situation they were in the midst of this when they suddenly heard a wild cry of alarm then came a rush of footsteps and less than a minute later the loud clanging of a bell  hello whats that exclaimed jack  something is wrongthats sure announced randy  whats the bell ringing for queried fred it isnt time for parade yet  that isnt the parade bell ejaculated gif thats the fire bell there must be a fire  the boys flung open the doors and ran hastily into the hallway cadets were pouring forth from every quarter and there was a tremendous excitement  is the building on fire  take it easy boys take it easy yelled major ralph mason as he appeared at the head of one of the stairways there is no fire in this building dont get excited  where is the fire queried a dozen voices in chorus  its down at the gym the upper floor is in flames     chapter xvi  putting out the flames   what do you know about that the gym is on fire gasped fred and clutched randy by the arm he looked at his cousin knowingly  i know what youre thinking fred those cigarettes that slugger nappy and codfish were smoking  thats it they threw them down recklessly and also threw down the matches they had lighted  if the gym burns down colonel colby will hold them responsible for the loss put in jack who had heard what was said  while this talk was taking place all of the cadets were rushing down the stairs soon they were out on the campus and headed through the fastfalling snow in the direction of the gymnasium building  a heavy smoke was pouring from a brokenout upper window and also from the edges of a scuttle on the roof as the cadets hurried closer they saw a thin flame show itself for a moment just inside the window  its on fire all right enough but maybe they can get it under control announced jack come on fellows do your duty  warned by the fate which had overtaken putnam hall colonel colby had taken every possible precaution against fire there were several large water towers erected in and near the school buildings and these were connected with various fire plugs there were also numerous lengths of hose with nozzles attached hung up in the several buildings and both the cadets and the teachers had been instructed in a fire drill  some of the cadets who had been in the gymnasium when the fire was discovered had already brought out the hose in that building and attached it to one of the plugs now this water was turned on and a stream of fair size began to play upon the flames the cadets aided by one of the teachers dragging the hose up the narrow stairway for that purpose  get out hose number three and number eight directed colonel colby who was on the scene and the cadets went to work with a will and soon had two more streams in action  despite the thickness of the smoke two of the teachers and several of the cadets had gone up into the second floor of the building and located the fire  its up near the steam radiator just between the two windows announced one of the teachers its in some boxes and barrels that contain straw and excelsior  isnt the building on fire queried one cadet  the flames are going up to the roof but so far they havent broken through  the announcement that the fire so far was confined to some boxes and barrels nerved the cadets and the others to make a greater effort to get it under control and some began to fill buckets with water in the washroom below and these were passed up the narrow stairway and the water thrown where it was apparently most needed  randy and andy were in this bucket brigade while fred and jack worked with one of the hose gangs it was exciting labor for all of the boys but this they did not mind  hurrah were getting it under control shouted major mason presently keep it up boys and well save the whole building  in the crowd were of course slugger nappy and codfish at the first alarm they had run forth from the school and gazed in amazement at the smoke pouring from the gymnasium  oh look its the gym thats on fire codfish had burst out and then the little sneak had suddenly turned deadly pale and would have sunk down in the snow had not slugger caught him  see here codfish hissed the bully shaking him dont you say a word about this do you understand not a word  dont you dare to admit to anybody that you were upstairs in the gymnasium added nappy  ii aint going to say nothing sniveled codfish and then of a sudden burst out crying you fellows let me alone i didnt want to smoke anyhow he wailed  shut up dont you mention smoking to anybody or ill just about half kill you hissed slugger now mind not a word if you know when you are best off and then he gave codfishs arm such a twist that the little cadet screamed with pain  not to be suspected of what they had done slugger and nappy mingled with the other cadets and did their full share in working on the lines of hose but there were really more cadets than were needed for this labor so they had little to do codfish also tried to take hold but he trembled so that he soon had to give up and then he ran back into the hall where he sat on the stairs half sobbing  by this time there was little more than smoke to be seen in the upper part of the gymnasium the teachers and the cadets still continued to play water into the building some now began to open all the windows realizing that a draft could not do much harm then as the smoke began to clear away they began an investigation so that the last spark of the fire might be extinguished  i guess its about out announced professor brice presently he had worked hard and his face and hands were streaked with black  i think you are right brice answered colonel colby who had also mounted to the upper floor we may as well bring up a few buckets of water and then turn off all the hose there is no use of flooding the building especially in this cold weather as it is i think the boys will have a skating pond below by morning and he smiled faintly  do you suppose this started from the heating plant questioned the teacher  not at all was the low reply but we wont speak about that now brice added colonel colby significantly and thereupon the young teacher understood and said no more about the matter  the cadets were sent below and colonel colby and professor brice aided by a couple of the hired men made a close examination of the spot where the fire had taken place it had been confined almost wholly to three boxes loosely filled with excelsior and two barrels containing straw and waste paper  it was a mistake to put such inflammable material up here said colonel colby to mr crews the gymnasium instructor  i realize that now colonel colby answered silas crews and his manner showed how much the fire had upset him but you see it was this way we got some of that new gymnasium material in only a couple of weeks ago and we werent altogether satisfied with itif you will remember i said something about sending it back well it came in those boxes and barrels and so i just put them up here thinking that maybe wed want to use them in sending the stuff back if it hadnt been for that id have cleaned the boxes and barrels out and burnt the stuff up  i see crews well after this i want you to be careful and not do anything like that again  but i dont see how the boxes and barrels caught fire sir went on the gymnasium instructor perplexedly we had no light up here and i dont see how they could catch from that little steam radiator over there why that radiator hardly gets warm it may be mentioned here that the radiator had been placed on the upper floor of the gymnasium because there had once been talk of partitioning this part of the floor from the rest and making of it a meeting room for one of the cadet clubs  ill make an investigation later answered colonel colby for the present as the steam heating plant seems to be in perfect order you had better start the fire up well so that we can dry things out here otherwise all the pipes may freeze up and that might give us more trouble than this fire  yes sir ill see to it sir said silas crews hastily and ill have this whole place cleaned up the first thing in the morning and ill also have the broken windows fixed  as soon as he returned to the school colonel colby sent for randy and fred he questioned them closely about the cigarette smoking indulged in by slugger nappy and codfish  you two are quite sure that you were not smoking yourselves he demanded sternly  we dont smoke sir answered randy promptly  did you light any matches while you were upstairs in the gymnasium  no sir we had no need for a light returned fred  have you any idea how this fire started  i dont see how it could start unless it was from the cigarettes and the matches those fellows used answered randy bluntly i hate to make that statement but the truth is the truth  i believe you are right rover now then i wish you to do me a favor i want you to keep as quiet about this as you are to keep quiet about that joke those cadets proposed to play do you understand  yes sir answered both the rovers  then that is all for the present and so speaking colonel colby dismissed the boys  i guess hes going to save this fire affair until he catches them trying to play the joke was freds comment as they hurried away to join the others  thats it fred randy looked at his cousin knowingly there is certainly something coming to slugger nappy and codfish isnt there     chapter xvii  caught in the act   the news that there had been a fire at colby hall soon spread to the town and to clearwater hall and there were many anxious inquiries over the telephone and otherwise as to whether anybody had been hurt  no nobody was hurt and the fire didnt amount to much said spouter when called up by his cousin may perhaps when we see you girls personally well have something to tell you that will be a surprise  in the middle of the afternoon of the day following the fire a number of letters were brought in by one of the hired men from the haven point postoffice  heres a drop letter for you jack remarked gif who was distributing some of the mail most likely from your best girl and he smiled goodnaturedly  doesnt look much like a girls handwriting answered the oldest rover boy as he inspected the envelope wondering what the letter might contain he tore open the envelope and was considerably surprised to read the following written on a raggedlytorn half sheet of note paper       you rovers think yourselves smart but do not forget that i am not      done with you you have been the means of my losing a very      lucrative position i will not have you arrested for it would be a      hard matter for me to obtain justice in this neighborhood but i      will remember you and some day i will bring you to book for what      you have done you are nothing but a set of imps and hoodlums and      sooner or later colby will learn the truth  this is undoubtedly from professor lemm announced jack as he allowed his cousins and their chums to read the letter  hes certainly a sweetnatured man was andys comment hes real charitable and kind isnt he and this brought forth a smile from the others  what do you think hell do questioned fred  i dont believe hell do anything answered jack fellows who write such anonymous communications are usually cowards old lemon belongs in the class with slugger nappy  company  the heavy snowstorm cleared away as rapidly as it had come and the wind blew the snow from large sections of the lake so that the cadets could once more enjoy themselves skating  lets skate up to clearwater hall and see the girls suggested jack at the first opportunity and this was agreed to readily by all of the crowd  they found the girls of clearwater hall on the ice watching out for them and soon the cadets and the girls were enjoying themselves thoroughly  you must tell me all about the fire and about how professor lemm happened to leave the hall said ruth as she skated away with jack  ill do that he answered but you must keep a good part of what im going to tell you a secretat least for the present he added and then gave the particulars of the joke which had been played on the disliked teacher then he told of what had occurred at the gymnasium  oh jack do you really think slugger and nappy and that little codfish set the gymnasium on fire cried the girl  i think they did ruthalthough of course it was by accident  what dreadful boys they must be getting to be sighed the girl  she had quite a few things to tell about happenings at the hall and also mentioned what she intended to do during the christmas holidays  i wish you were coming down to new york said jack id like first rate to have you meet my sister martha and my cousin mary  perhaps i shall get down there some time jack are you going to stay at home during all of the holidays  no we have been planning to stay at home about a week and then if we can arrange it we want to visit snowshoe island and do a little hunting before school opens again  then youre going to accept old uncle barneys invitation  thats the idea ruth you dont mind do you and the oldest rover boy looked anxiously at his companion  not at all in fact im rather glad to hear of your going to the island it may give you a chance to talk to old uncle barney about my folks and if you get any such chance i hope youll impress it upon him that we want to be friends  when the cadets returned to colby hall both jack and fred were in unusual good humor for not only had ruth said she would try to get down to new york during the holidays but may had told fred that if spouter came down to the metropolis she would try to accompany her cousin  several days slipped by and the rover boys applied themselves closely to their lessons for they wished to make as good a showing as possible during the coming examinations during that time they saw slugger nappy and codfish a number of times but all of those unworthies seemed to give them a wide berth  although colonel colby had not given the rovers any of the particulars of what he proposed to do he had not forgotten what randy and fred had told him he had had a conference on the subject with professor brice silas crews and bob nixon the chauffeur and nixon and crews were detailed to watch every movement made by the bully and his cronies  it was on the following tuesday the day previous to the examinations that silas crews came hurrying to the master of the hall who had just entered the school library in search of a certain book  i think brown and martell are at it he announced in a low tone of voice martell just sneaked a quart bottle of ink from the storeroom while brown picked up some of the cans of vegetables which were cast aside by the cook as unfit to eat now they have both gone down into the boilerroom evidently after those ashes  continue to watch them crews and tell nixon to watch them too i will notify professor brice and also captain dale captain dale was the military instructor of the academy  silas crews hurried off and colonel colby lost no time in notifying the others of what was taking place as a result a guard was established which took cognizance of every move made by slugger and nappy why it was that codfish was not with them nobody knew the fact was the poor little sneak had been so terrified at the mere mention of doing anything further that he had burst out crying and locked himself in his room stating that he was too sick to act  having obtained the bottle of ink and several cans of spoiled tomatoes slugger and nappy watched their chance and visited the boilerroom under the school here they found a dozen large cans of ashes and also an old empty soapbox  well fill the soap box half full of ashes said slugger and then we can place the openedup cans of tomatoes and the openedup bottle of ink on top when we get the stuff over to colonel colbys rooms we can spread half of everything around where it will make the best showing then we can skip over to the offices and do the same thing and after that well rush back and leave a little trail of ashes and some ink leading into the rovers rooms and place the empty ink bottle and the empty cans in their closets and put the ashbox under one of the beds  dandy replied nappy come on  not knowing that bob nixon was watching them from a corner of the boilerroom they soon had the box of ashes and other stuff ready then watching their chance to see that the coast was clear they sneaked up out of the boilerroom and then out of the school by a side door here a path led to the nearby building where colonel colby had his private suite of rooms  now then hurry up cried nappy who was beginning to show signs of nervousness  they found the door to the main room unlocked and both entered and set the box of stuff on one of the easy chairs then one took up the ink and the other an opened can of the decayed tomatoes  now make a fine job of it whispered slugger  both took a step forward to start their nefarious work when each was almost paralyzed by hearing colonel colbys voice  stop commanded the master of the school and stepped out from behind a screen which stood near a corner of the apartment  oh ejaculated nappy were discovered and dropping the bottle of ink in his hands he started to run  not so quick martell came from the doorway and then both of the youths were startled to see themselves confronted by bob nixon behind the chauffeur stood captain dale while in another doorway appeared the form of professor brice  wawawhat does this mean stammered slugger he knew not what to say or do  it means that i have found you out answered colonel colby sternly you will both march over to my office at once     chapter xviii  home again   good riddance to bad rubbish  you told the truth that time andy were certainly well rid of slugger brown and nappy martell  say id like to know some of the particulars of the interview slugger and nappy had with colonel colby it must have been a pippin remarked fred  one thing is certaincolonel colby must have laid down the law pretty severely to them otherwise they would never have gotten out of this school in such a hurry came from jack  im mighty glad i got that one crack in on martell remarked fred some day ill give that fellow a licking big as he is continued the youngest of the rover boys  the only fellow im sorry for is codfish came from randy that poor little rat looks about as miserable as any kid could look  he ought to be thankful that he wasnt kicked out with the others said spouter he certainly deserved it  he did agreed jack just the same now that slugger and nappy are gone if codfish wants to turn over a new leaf and make a man of himself im not going to stand in his way  twentyfour hours had passed since the events recorded in the previous chapter they had been filled with both mystery and excitement for the rover boys and their chums only a little of what had taken place in colonel colbys office had filtered out to the cadets but it was enough to show them that the master of the hall had dealt severely with slugger and nappy those two unworthies had come forth looking both cowed and excited and they had rushed up to their rooms to pack their belongings without delay  in the meanwhile codfish had come forth sobbing and had been allowed to go to his room where he locked himself in and denied himself even to mrs crews the matron who looked after the younger scholars  ii dont want to see nonobody codfish had cried out go away and leave me alone ii didnt mean to do anything it was brown and martell made me do it and then he had burst into another fit of weeping  both the rover boys and their chums had wanted to see how the bully and his crony would act after their interview with colonel colby they met slugger and nappy in the hall as they were on the point of leaving the school and some sharp words had passed nappy had threatened fred and made a savage pass at him with his fist in return the youngest rover had landed on the others chin and sent nappy staggering up against the wall  in the meanwhile there had been a setto between slugger and jack and although the oldest rover boy was struck on the shoulder he had had the satisfaction of making the bully measure his length on his back then the approach of professor brice backed up by captain dale and bob nixon had brought the brief contests to a close and slugger and nappy had lost no time in hurrying below where the autostage was already in waiting to take them and their baggage to haven point many of the cadets assembled had jeered at the departing youths and they in their rage had shaken their fists at those left behind as the autostage departed  i hope we never see those fellows again remarked randy but this wish was doomed to disappointmentthe rovers were to see a good deal more of slugger brown and nappy martell  the boys had now to apply themselves to their examinations and they went at this with a will resolved to make the best showing possible  weve got to do it was the way jack expressed himself we want the folks at home to know that we are keeping at our studies then if they happen to hear of some of the jokes we play they will know that were doing something else here besides having fun  the lads had already written home regarding the christmas holidays and what they would like to do in return they received word that they could have gif and spouter down for the week between christmas and new years if they so desired and jacks mother also sent a letter to spouter inviting him to bring along his cousin may and her friend ruth       all of us including martha and mary will be glad to become      acquainted with your cousin and her school chum wrote mrs dick      rover the girls are very anxious to learn more about clearwater      hall and it is just possible that we may send them to that school      later on  hurrah thats fine cried jack when spouter showed him the letter if only may and ruth go to new york im sure theyll be able to persuade martha and mary that there is no better girls school on earth than clearwater hall  you leave that to me jack answered spouter ill tell may just what to do  of course the rover boys were all very anxious after the examinations were over to find out how they had fared on the following friday afternoon colonel colby read the results fred and randy had received ninetyfour per cent jack had gotten ninetytwo and andy had reached eightyeight as seventy per cent was the passing mark it can be seen that the boys had passed with considerable to spare  my thats a relief sighed andy somehow at the last minute i was afraid i had fallen down completely there were a few examples in algebra that were regular stickers for me  physiology was what got me observed jack grimly how do i know how many bones ive got in my body i never saw them and at this there was a general smile  after the examinations there was but little to do at the school apart from the drills there was an entertainment given by the boys in which both jack and andy took part then almost before they knew it the session came to an end and the cadets had packed up and were on their way home  after all ill be glad to see little old new york once more remarked randy when they and their friends were seated on the train  right you are cried fred i think after the semicountry life at haven point a big city will look mighty good to us  say fellows do you remember when we came up to the school how we fell in with asa lemm remarked andy  i havent forgotten it cried his twin and then he added quickly i wonder if old lemon wrote to our folks  i dont think so answered jack if he had i think we would have heard of it  when the boys arrived at the grand central terminal they found martha and mary and tom rover awaiting them  glad to see you back boys cried the father of the twins as he greeted them warmly and then greeted the others  oh jack i declare youre growing awfully tall burst out his sister martha as she embraced him  well i guess fred is growing tall too put in mary rover  well you wouldnt expect any of us to grow shorter would you queried andy gaily and this made both of the girls laugh  with greetings all around finished the whole party pushed its way through the crowd to the fortysecond street entrance of the terminal where two of the rover limousines were in waiting  this looks something like remarked jack when the automobiles were on their way through the busy streets to riverside drive i havent seen so many people since i left  and how do you like colby hall questioned his sister eagerly  dandy martha it couldnt be beat i can tell you we boys are mighty glad that our dads picked out such a bully good school for us and his face showed his satisfaction  and what about clearwater hall  thats a dandy place tooat least the girls who go there say it is if may powell comes down with spouter shell tell you all about it  the homecoming of the rover boys was a gala occasion dick rover and his brother sam had just come up home from the offices in wall street and they and their wives as well as the twins mother greeted the lads affectionately  its been kind of lonely since you went away said mrs tom rover as she caught each of the twins around the waist  i suppose you missed our tricks ma returned andy slyly  maybe i did andy but i wouldnt mind the tricks so much if only you were here and she gave a little sigh  well were going to be here for a week anyway put in randy and then both of the twins gave their mother such a hug as she had not received for a long time  jack was already telling his father and his two uncles something about colby hall all of the men listened with close attention and considerable satisfaction  i guess larry has patterned it pretty closely after putnam hall and west point remarked sam rover and thats as it should be to my way of thinking  hed have to go a long way to do better answered tom rover everybody knows that west point is an ideal school and dear old putnam hall was a close second to it  i hope you lads havent been playing too many tricks went on dick rover as he gazed from one face to another before him  well uncle dick we had to play some tricks answered andy a bit lamely  you couldnt expect us to just sit still and hold our hands added randy  we might as well own up to one thing said jack boldly we did play a trick on one of the teachersa fellow named asa lemm nobody liked lemm and when colonel colby had a rumpus with him and made him resign all of us felt better  fortunately for the boys an interruption came just at that moment in the way of an announcement that dinner was ready this was served in the dick rover home and was participated in by all of the members of the rover family it made quite a table full  gee but its nice to be here once more exclaimed andy while he was eating  beats a meal in the messroom at the hall all hollow doesnt it returned his twin  and yet you talk about going away on a hunting trip broke in their father quizzically  oh yes but uncle tom we are going to spend a whole week in new york before that broke in fred  i want to know a little more about this trip youre planning to snowshoe island remarked dick rover i want to make sure that its a perfectly safe place for you to visit  oh im sure its safe enough answered jack and thereupon he and the others told what they knew about the island and barney stevenson  that old lumberman must be quite a character was dick rovers comment well well see about this trip later and there for the time being the matter was dropped  the boys had gotten home just two days before christmas and they spent their entire time the next day in shopping for presents in this they were partly aided by martha and mary especially when it came to selecting presents for their mothers then however they sent the girls away so that they might buy something for them although they did not mention this jack also wished to get a little reminder for ruth while fred was equally desirous of obtaining something for may  christmas dawned bright and clear and many were the cries of joy which rang throughout the three rover households all the young folks spent over an hour in running back and forth wishing this one and that one merry christmas then came the distribution of presents  just what i wanted cried fred as he inspected his pile of gifts there was a new watch some gorgeous neckties several books and a splendid little doublebarrelled shotgun  dont say a word it couldnt be better came from randy  the best christmas ever echoed his twin they too had numerous gifts including little diamond stickpins new skates some boxing gloves and brightcolored sweaters into which their cousins had knitted the initials c h  now i presume youll be real colby hall cadets said their mother when they had donned the sweaters and were strutting around in them  this sure is one grand christmas said jack he too had fared well receiving a beautiful seal ring a new traveling bag completely equipped several sets of books for which he had longed greatly and also a small but firstclass repeating rifle  now weve certainly got to go on that hunt remarked fred placing his new shotgun beside the new rifle  right you are fred responded jack but first were going to have one dandy time down here in new york     chapter xix  off for snowshoe island   what an awfully large place new york is  it was ruth who uttered the words while she was taking a ride down fifth avenue in company with jack and his sister and several of the others  it was the day after christmas and spouter had arrived at noon bringing his cousin may and ruth with him the young folks were taking a ride previous to stopping at the grand central terminal to meet gif who was to come later  you wont find many places larger answered dick he felt very happy to think that ruth was beside him and more so because ruth and his sister seemed to become good friends from the very moment they met  behind the first auto came a second containing spouter may mary and fred they too were enjoying themselves the youngest rover doing what he could to point out the various places of interest to spouters fair cousin  the rover boys aided by mary and martha had laid their plans for the next five days with care the young folks were to be taken to central and bronx parks to several wellknown theaters and also to the grand opera and mrs dick rover had arranged to give a party at her home in the visitors honor  mary and martha had been eager to hear about clearwater hall and the two girl visitors were not slow in singing the praises of that institution  oh i think id like to go there cried martha what do you think mary  i think id like to go myself now that we know somebody there was her cousins reply mary had always been a little shy  during those days of pleasure in new york only one thing occurred to mar the happiness of the young folks that was one afternoon when all of them went over to central park for a couple of hours to enjoy the skating there quite unexpectedly they ran into nappy martell he favored the rover boys with a black look and then lost himself in the crowd of skaters  he certainly has no love for us was jacks comment if he could possibly do us an injury i think he would do it  but aside from this incident the young folks had nothing to worry them and they spent a most agreeable time on the ice they talked a good deal of nonsense and often laughed when there was no apparent cause for so doing but that was due entirely to their high spirits when they returned to the rover homes the girls had a glow in their cheeks and a sparkle in their eyes that made them more beautiful than ever  that ruth stevenson is certainly a handsome girl whispered mrs dick rover to her husband  so she is dora answered dick and if youll notice our jack has quite an eye for her he added dryly  oh dick you dont suppose hes smitten with her why hes so young  im not saying anything about that dora i cant help but remember that i was smitten with you the first time i saw you and at this dora rover gave her husband a warm look that meant a great deal  may had not forgotten her promise to her cousin spouter and during the visit she did all she could to impress on the older folks the charms of life at clearwater hall she told of what fine teachers there were at the school how rapidly most of the pupils advanced in their studies and of the good times to be had there  and i do hope that you will let mary and martha join us she concluded i am sure they will feel perfectly at home there and that they will be as well taught if not better than they would be if they remained here in the city  ill think it over may answered mrs sam rover and marthas mother said the same  jack and his cousins had already sent a letter to barney stevenson completing the arrangements for going up to snowshoe island now came a brief communication from the old lumberman stating that he would be on the lookout for them and would do all he could to make their outing enjoyable  what a nice letter for him to write exclaimed ruth when jack showed her the communication oh i do hope youll be able to fix up this difference between old uncle barney and my folks its dreadful to have him on the outs with our family  as i said before ruth ill do what i can jack replied  with so much going on the holidays sped by swiftly and all too soon it was time for the visitors to take their departure spouter and gif both wished they could accompany the rovers to snowshoe island but this was not to be as they had already made other arrangements  but have a good time said spouter  dont forget to lay low a few deer and a bear or two added gif  good gracious you dont expect them to shoot bears do you exclaimed may in some alarm  i dont believe there are any bears on that island are there came from ruth  there are very few bears anywhere answered jack gif was only fooling the biggest game that we may possibly see will be a deer although even they are growing scarce we may see nothing bigger than squirrels rabbits and partridges and maybe a mink or a fox  the rover boys accompanied the others to the grand central terminal here jack managed to have a few words in private with ruth and at the conclusion he gave her hand so tight a squeeze that she blushed then the visitors boarded the train and in a minute more were gone  and now to get ready for the trip to snowshoe island cried randy  thats the talk returned his twin  the boys were to leave for rockville the nearest railroad station to snowshoe island on the day after new years they spent several hours in packing their things being advised in that matter by their fathers who as my old readers know had been on many hunting expeditions before them  now there is no use of my giving you any advice on how to handle your firearms said dick rover i have given you that advice before and you ought to remember what i said  i do dad answered his son and im sure the others remember too  and i want you two boys to keep out of mischief put in tom rover addressing his twins of course you can have all the fun you please but let it be good innocent nonsense dont do anything mean and dont do anything to get somebody else into trouble  and my advice is to go slow and be careful added sam rover in other words look before you leap  as the clown in the circus said finished tom rover when he thought he was going to jump through a paper hoop and found instead that it was a solid white barrelhead and at this little joke there was a general laugh  the boys had already told their fathers about the doings of nappy martell and slugger brown  nappy martell is evidently the son of his father remarked dick rover the senior martell is just as domineering and not one bit more reliable down in wall street weve been watching him pretty closely  yes and he needed watching put in tom rover to my mind if he isnt a fraud hes pretty close to it  you said something about his underhanded work before came from sam if he is a swindler i certainly hope that sooner or later they expose him  the boys had learned that rockville was a town of considerable importance and boasted of several goodsized stores they felt certain that they could buy all the supplies needed at that place so it would be unnecessary to get them in new york they however took along all the clothing that was needed and likewise their guns and a good supply of ammunition  now do be careful pleaded mrs tom rover when they were ready to depart i dont want any of you to get shot  dont you worry ma well be careful all right enough answered randy as he kissed her goodbye  several of the neighboring boys had come to see them off and there was a little bit of envy as these watched the rovers depart they went to the railroad station in one of the limousines only the two girls going with them to see them off  now dont get hurt jack said martha when it was almost time for him to take the train remember if you do ruth will never forgive you and she gave her brother a roguish look which somehow made his cheeks burn  illustration what a nice letter for him to write exclaimed ruth  page 191  aw cut that martha he answered and then of a sudden he continued you join those girls at clearwater hall and ill pick a fine cadet for you to go out with  boo cried martha and put out the tip of her tongue at him who said i wanted any of your old cadets then as he and his cousins ran for the train she waved him an affectionate farewell  the boys had obtained seats in advance in one of the parlor cars and soon they made themselves comfortable they talked over what had happened while their visitors had been with them and presently commenced to discuss the expected hunting on and around snowshoe island  we ought to have a dandy two weeks was freds comment just think of it for fourteen days well be able to do exactly as we please  yumyum added randy sleep as long as you please eat when you please and as much as you please and shoot all the game you want to what more could a fellow want  and cut all the firewood you want to and wash all the dirty dishes you want to and miss all the really good game you want to commenced andy  jump on him  throw him out of the window  lets make him go without his supper tonight  so the cries went on as the three others caught andy by the arms and by the coat collar  hold up i surrender gasped the funloving youth let up will you  youve got to promise to be good and not throw cold water on our hopes announced jack were going to have the best time ever on snowshoe island and not a thing is going to happen to mar our pleasure  but in this last surmise the oldest rover boy was sadly mistaken many things of which he and his cousins did not dream were to occur not only to startle and annoy them but also to place them in extreme peril     chapter xx  caught in a snowstorm   next station stop rockville  thats our jumping off place boys we had better get our baggage together exclaimed jack  i wonder if barney stevenson will be at the station to meet us questioned fred  that depends on whether he got my last message or not answered jack however if he isnt there i guess we can find our way to snowshoe island alone  soon the long train rolled into the little station at rockville and the boys alighted being assisted by the porter who had already taken charge of their baggage he readily accepted the tip they gave him and as he had learned that they were off on a little hunting tour said he hoped they would have every success  but dont you bring down too many lions and elephants added the colored man  no well leave the lions and elephants for you returned andy and this made the porter grin broadly showing two rows of white ivories  hello boys so youve got here at last eh cried a voice from the doorway of the railroad station and old barney stevenson strode toward them he looked the picture of health having recovered entirely from the accident in the woods he shook hands cordially giving each hand a squeeze that made the recipient wince  were glad to see you mr stevenson began fred when up went the old lumbermans hand in protest  twont do boys twont do at all if youre going to come over to snowshoe island with me youve got to drop that mister business plain uncle barney is good enough for me  all right then uncle barney it is answered fred and the others smiled and nodded  i just got your message this noon explained the old lumberman billy sanders the station agents son brought it over to me i see youve got your duffle with you and he looked at their various bags  we didnt bring anything along in the way of provisions answered randy we thought we could buy all those things here in town  so you canproviding youve got the money lad and uncle barney smiled  oh weve got the money answered andy our folks treated us very handsomely  i brought over my big bobsled went on the old lumberman come aheadill help you carry your baggage we can leave it all at crumpers boathouse until we get the other stuff  he led the way and they soon found themselves at the boathouse he had mentioned here they placed their traveling bags on uncle barneys bobsled and then made their way to a nearby general store where the old fellow was well known  weve got a list written out here explained jack bringing it forth ill read it to you and then you can tell me what you think of it  the list was quite a long one and the old lumberman listened attentively as jack read it over then he nodded approvingly  youve got it about right boys he said you must have been out before  my dad helped me make out this list explained dick he and my uncles have had quite some experience hunting and of course they knew just what to take along  do you think it will be enough questioned randy anxiously his appetite for eating never seemed to be lacking  youve got enough there for six or eight answered the old lumberman however it wont do any harm to add a few more beans and a little extra bacon likewise a little more sugar seeing as how boys generally like things sweet  it was an easy matter to purchase the various articles at the general store and the boys had the clerk pack them securely in several soap boxes then jack as the treasurer for the crowd paid the bill  by this time it was growing dark and uncle barney told them they had better not waste their time  i may be mistaken but it looks a good deal like another snowstorm to me he explained and if its going to snow we might as well get to the island before it starts to come down too hard  the old lumberman was right about the snow and some early flakes came sifting down while they were still at the boathouse packing the bobsled the old lumberman showed them how to secure the load so that there would be no danger of its falling off  now then on with your skates and well be off he announced in the winter time he always made the journey between the island and the town on his steel runners  i suppose skating is a good deal easier than walking remarked fred while the boys were putting on their skates  to be sure and we can make so much better time  how far have we got to go questioned andy  to the upper end of the island where ive got my home is about four miles  oh that isnt so far cried fred we can skate that in no time  we could if we could go in a straight line but we cant answered uncle barney the wind blew the last snow in all sorts of ridges across the ice and well have to pick our way along as best we can  a long rope had been attached to the bobsled so that they could all assist in hauling it along on the smooth ice the load proved to be a light one so that they had little difficulty in progressing but as the old lumberman had said the ridges of snow on the lake were numerous and some of these were piled up several feet high and the party had to make long detours around them  this isnt going to be so easy after all remarked fred after they had skated for almost half an hour i thought we would get to snowshoe island in no time  it was now quite dark and the snow was falling steadily so far there had been little wind but now this too sprang up sending the frozen particles directly into their faces  gee this isnt so pleasant exclaimed andy as he pulled down his cap and pulled up the sweater he was wearing  the wind is increasing said fred a minute later hark to that will you  all listened and from a distance heard the wind stirring through the woods bordering the lake in that vicinity then the wind bore down upon them and with it came a heavier fall of snow  say this is going to be some snowstorm  yes and some blow too  i wish it wasnt so dark  uncle barney are you sure you know the way questioned randy as all came to a halt for a moment to turn their backs to the wind and catch their breath  oh yes my lad i know the way well enough was the old lumbermans reply but believe me i didnt expect any such snowstorm as this when i went after you i thought it would be just an ordinary fall  it seems to be getting heavier every minute declared jack as he sheltered his eyes with his hand and tried to peer forth into the darkness why the snow is coming down in regular chunks  the flakes were indeed both heavy and thick and the wind sent the snow sweeping across the ice forming new ridges in every direction  the first thing you know well be blocked completely declared randy after they had progressed another quarter of a mile just look at that wall of snow will you and he pointed ahead where a snowdrift was all of five feet high and rapidly growing higher  the rovers could see by his manner that the old lumberman was growing much disturbed he led the way first in one direction and then in another then presently he called a halt  it aint no use he declared flatly i thought i could work my way around these snowdrifts the same as i did when i came over to town after you but the darkness and this heavy fall of snow is bothering me tremendously  what do you think we ought to do questioned fred anxiously the situation was making the youngest rover boy a little fearful  i guess about the best thing we can do is to strike a beeline for the island answered uncle barney it wont be much harder to break through these snowdrifts than it is to try to find our way around them in this wind and darkness  are you sure you know the way to the island questioned jack who knew only too well that it was the easiest thing in the world to get turned around in such a situation as this  oh im pretty sure i havent lost my bearings answered the old lumberman however to make sure maybe i had better have a squint at my compass  oh say that puts me in mind burst out randy whats the matter with using one of our flashlights for the boys had brought along two of those useful articles which were now packed in the baggage on the bobsled  yes lets get out both of the flashlights returned fred in this darkness well want all the light we can get  sheltering themselves as best they could from the wind which seemed every minute to be increasing in violence the boys unstrapped part of their load and managed to bring forth the two flashlights while this was being done uncle barney brought from his pocket a small compass  now i think north is in that direction he said pointing with his hand with the aid of one of the lights the compass was inspected and it was found that the old lumberman was almost right he having pointed a little to the northwest  if wed gone on the way i expected to go wed have struck the lower end of the island instead of the upper he explained it wouldnt have made a great deal of difference but we might as well take the straightest line we know how come on follow me and ill break the way for you  once more they started forward and in a minute more the boys found themselves struggling through snow which was several feet deep  gee a fellow ought to have snowshoes instead of skates panted fred when in the midst of the drift this is the worst ever  the drift isnt very wide fred announced jack who was ahead of his cousin flashing one of the lights around here we come to the clear ice again and a few seconds later they found themselves skating along as easily as before  but this open patch did not last long soon they came to several more snowdrifts the first was barely a foot high but the second was almost up to their armpits the old lumberman was still ahead breaking a path for them as well as he was able hampered with the load of the bobsled the boys made slow progress  its no use groaned andy at last im all out of breath ive got to stop and rest  we had better not stop to rest here andy answered jack quickly we must reach some sort of shelter from this wind  im all out of breath myself came from fred the exertion of plowing through the snowdrifts had tired him dreadfully and he was trembling in the legs so that he could scarcely stand  come on boys dont stay here called back uncle barney to them this snowstorm is getting worse every minute  the old lumberman had scarcely spoken when all the boys heard a strange whistling in the air then the wind tore down upon them harder than ever sending the snowy particles in all directions so that to make out what was ahead even with the flashlights was out of the question     chapter xxi  an astonishing revelation   the situation was certainly a disheartening one and the boys huddled close together around the bobsled both for protection and to talk the matter over  can you tell us at all how far we really are from some sort of shelteri mean the nearest shelter at hand questioned jack of uncle barney as the old lumberman came back to see what had happened  its about a mile to my cabin was the reply  and is that the nearest place asked fred who had sat down on the bobsled load to rest  no the nearest place is a little hut that i put up at this end of the island several years ago it isnt very much of a shelter but it might do  do you mean we could stay there all night queried randy  oh yes its plenty large enough for all of us and there is a rough fireplace where we could start a blaze and cook something  then lets head for that place by all means cried jack this storm is getting worse every minute  with the wind whistling keenly in their ears and blowing the snow across the ice and into numerous high drifts the little party moved on once more the boys doing their best to keep up with the old lumberman this was comparatively easy for even uncle barney was wellnigh exhausted by his exertions  if this snow keeps on it will be one of the worst storms we ever had up here he announced but somehow i dont think it will last the sky didnt look heavy enough this afternoon  i hope it doesnt last returned jack  we dont want to be snowed in while we are up here added randy we want to have a chance to hunt  to make progress against the fury of the elements was not easy but presently the boys heard uncle barney give a cry of satisfaction  here we are lads in sight of the island exclaimed the old lumberman now it wont be long before we reach that shelter i mentioned  by the aid of the two flashlights the boys made out a number of trees and bushes ahead the bushes were covered thickly with snow and behind them were sharp rocks also outlined in white  this is what i call squirrel point explained the old lumberman it used to be a great place for squirrels  how much further to that shelter queried fred just then he took no interest whatever in game he was so tired he could scarcely place one foot in front of the other and to tell the truth his cousins were little better off  weve got only a couple of hundred feet to go was the reply come ahead ill help you pull that bobsled and now uncle barney took hold and once again they started forward this time skirting the lower extremity of snowshoe island here there were a great number of pines and hemlocks growing amid a perfect wilderness of rocks now all thickly covered with snow  now youll have a little climbing to do announced the old lumberman a few minutes later you might as well take off your skates and ill do the same and well have to hoist that bobsled up the best we know how  he had turned toward the island and soon they were climbing up over the rough rocks and pulling the bobsled after them in one spot they had to raise the sled up over their heads the old lumberman assisted them in this task and then pointed to a small cleared space between a number of pines  hurrah i see the hut cried jack in delight and ran forward followed by his cousins uncle barney came with them and an instant later had forced open a rude door then one of the lights was flashed inside  the boys and uncle barney had expected to find the little cabin vacant consequently they were much surprised when they heard a queer little noise not unlike the snarl of a dog  by gum its a wolf ejaculated the old lumberman in amazement  scarcely had he spoken when there leaped into view a fullgrown wolf as he confronted the boys and the old man he snarled viciously and his eyes appeared to gleam like two balls of fire  its a wolf sure enough  shoot him somebody shoot him  wheres my gun  the guns are all strapped down on the bobsled  such were some of the cries which came from the rover boys when they found themselves confronted by the wolf they fell back several paces and uncle barney did likewise the old lumberman had gone to rockville armed but he too had strapped his weapon fast on the bobsled so that he might assist the boys in hauling the load  as the little party fell back wondering what was best to do the wolf gave another leap thereby reaching the doorway of the little cabin then with a snarl he whirled around leaped into the snow behind some hemlocks and in a moment more had disappeared from view  well what do you know about that cried fred faintly  and to think we werent ready to shoot groaned randy  were a fine bunch of hunters we are scoffed andy  well we didnt expect to find a wolf in possession of this hut remarked jack just the same i wish we had been able to get a shot at him he added wistfully  i should have carried my gun remarked uncle barney it was a mistake to put it on the sled thats just my luck confound it whenever i go out freehanded im almost certain to see something worth shooting and he shook his head grimly  you didnt say anything about wolves being on the island said fred while the old man was looking around inside the cabin with both flashlights  there are very few wolves in this neighborhood was the reply the last wolf i saw on the island outside of this one was two years ago  as the door to the cabin had been closed the boys wondered how the wolf had gotten into the place but uncle barney showed them a small brokenout window in the rear of the shelter this window was now partly covered with snow  i suppose the wolf thought he couldnt get out that way on account of the snow and consequently he had to come by way of the door explained the old lumberman well im mighty glad he didnt go any damage  an examination revealed the fact that no other living thing was in or around the cabin and as soon as they were satisfied of this the boys brought in the bobsled in the meantime uncle barney stirred around outside and managed to find some firewood which was fairly dry then a blaze was started in the rude fireplace the door was shut and a blanket was nailed up over the brokenout window  now this is something like remarked jack when the cabin began to grow warm the boys had unpacked the contents of the bobsled and brought forth a candle which was lighted and placed in a rude holder on the wall  now that they were safe from the storm all of the rovers felt in better humor uncle barney showed them how they could obtain water by melting some snow and ice and soon they had enough to make a pot of chocolate and another pot of coffee in the meantime the old lumberman assisted by jack opened up a box of sardines fried some bacon and also warmed up a can of green corn which had been among the stores they had no bread so they used up one of the boxes of soda crackers which they had purchased  its too bad we havent got some game to cook observed randy  lets be thankful that weve got some sort of a roof over our heads and that we can rest put in fred he had not yet gotten over the struggle to get through the snow  with nothing else to do the boys and the old lumberman took their time over the evening meal and never had anything tasted better than did this first supper on snowshoe island to the rovers  outside the wind was blowing as strongly as ever and the snow still came down steadily to make sure that they would not suffer from the cold all of the lads went out with uncle barney and brought in a large supply of firewood then they built up a good blaze around which they sat in a semicircle on the sled and the boxes brought along and on a rude bench of which the little cabin boasted  when i first came to snowshoe island twelve years ago i thought i would locate at this end remarked barney stevenson during the course of the conversation but after staying here a short while i concluded that it was nicer at the upper end so i went there  did you buy the island as far back as that queried jack  oh no lad in those days i only leased the island you see it belonged to an old lady named martinson she had a son who drifted out to california and then went to alaska when the old lady died luke martinson came back home and then he came to see me he wanted to get rid of all his property around here so he could go back to alaska and he offered this place to me and i bought it that was several years ago  its nice to own an island like this observed fred a fellow can have a regular robinson crusoe time of it if he wants to  when i bought the island i thought id have no difficulty in holding it continued barney stevenson but since that time i have had a whole lot of trouble two men claim that luke martinson never had any rights herethat the old martinson claim to the island was a false one they have tried two or three times to get me off the place but ive refused to go  didnt you get a deed to the island questioned jack who had often heard his father and his uncles speak about deeds to real estate  certainly i got a deed but they claim that the old martinson deed was no good but it is goodand i know it grumbled uncle barney  who are the men who want to take the island away from you questioned andy some hunters around here or lumbermen  oh no they are two men from the citya real estate dealer and a man who used to be interested in buying and selling property but who lost most of his fortune and then went to teaching or something like that  teaching exclaimed jack struck by a sudden idea what is that mans name if i may ask  his name is asa lemm and the name of the other man is slogwell brown was the reply of the old lumberman which filled the rover boys with amazement     chapter xxii  the first night on the island   asa lemm and slogwell brown  what do you know about that boys  thats bringing this matter pretty close to us isnt it  i should say so  such were some of the remarks coming from the rover boys after barney stevenson had made his astonishing declaration that the father of slugger brown and the exteacher of colby hall were the two men who were trying to dispossess him  why you speak as if you knew those two men exclaimed the old lumberman  we certainly know asa lemm answered jack  and we know the son of slogwell brown added randy  yes and if mr brown is no better than his son i wouldnt put it past him to do something crooked was andys comment  tell me what you know said uncle barney  thereupon the four boys related the particulars of the trouble they had had with professor lemm and of how he had left the military academy they also told much about slugger and incidentally nappy martell and of how the two cadets had been dismissed by colonel colby  this certainly is wonderful exclaimed the old lumberman when they had finished i had no idea you boys knew anything about those men i reckon your opinion of their honesty is just about as high as mine is and he smiled grimly  asa lemm claims to have lost quite a fortune said jack but we certainly did not think that part of it was located in this island  it isnt located in this islandat least it isnt so far as i am concerned cried uncle barney if those men bought what they thought were the rights to this island they were defrauded thats all and that has absolutely nothing to do with my rights to this land  i should think if you got a good deed to the land from that luke martinsonand his folks had a good deed from somebody elsethat ought to be proof enough that you own the island  well ive got the deed from martinson and ive got the old deeds he used to have too ive got them placed away in a tin box and in a safe place too answered the old man  then if youve got those deeds why do they bother you questioned fred  as ive said before they wont admit that the deeds old mrs martinson had were any good the fact of the matter is slogwell brown wants to get those deeds away from me he has been at me to let him look at the deeds several times but ive always refused for i was afraid that if he got the deeds away from me i would never see them again  i thought they recorded deeds at the court house said jack who had heard this fact mentioned between his father and his uncles  they do record deeds and i suppose that one was recorded at some time or other but the court house in this county was burnt down some years ago and all the records went up in smoke  but you could get the deeds recorded nowi mean have it done over again remarked randy  i suppose so but that wouldnt do me any good because they would probably try to prove that the deeds i brought in were not the originals you see the date when a deed is recorded has a good deal to do with it anyway im not going to let anybody have those deeds until i am sure of what im doing went on uncle barney it was easy to see that the old man was peculiar and wanted to do things in his own manner  did you ever ask a lawyer about this questioned fred  no i aint got no use for lawyers was the quick reply i hired a lawyer in a lawsuit nigh on to thirteen years ago and i lost the suit and it cost me over a hundred dollars more than i might have paid otherwise the old lumberman did not add that this was a lawsuit to which ruth stevensons father was also a party yet such was the fact  how long is it since you heard from mr brown and professor lemm asked andy  the last time they came to see me was in the middle of the summer they threatened all sorts of things and they got me so mad that i had to take down my shotgun and warn them away then they left in a big hurry  dont you think its a bad thing to warn them off with a gun questioned jack they might have you arrested for threatening their lives  im not afraid of them was the quick reply this is my island and nobody shall take it away from me  the boys could see that the subject was becoming distasteful to the old man and so they started to speak of other things they questioned him about how they could get to his regular cabin and also the cabin they were to occupy and then spoke about the game they might have a chance to bring down  your going hunting will depend a good deal on how the weather turns out said the old lumberman if this snow keeps on for a day or two it will make traveling pretty bad however im in hopes that the storm will clear away by morning  the boys had put in a strenuous day and they were glad enough when uncle barney suggested that they turn in for the night  were pretty short on blankets he said but that wont matter so much so long as we keep the fire going ive got a good back log started and that ought to last until morning if not longer when im at this hut alone i usually sleep in that corner and ill do the same tonight you can spread yourselves around as you please  with such a limited supply of blankets it was no easy matter to make comfortable couches yet the boys had left home to rough it so nobody complained they lay down in their clothing using some of their suitcases and gladstone bags for pillows  if we had had a chance to do so we might have brought in some pine boughs to lie on said jack but as it is i guess well manage  is there any chance of that wolf coming back questioned fred a bit anxiously  i hardly think so fred and anyway i dont see how hes going to get in here with the door closed and the blanket nailed over the window however we can keep our guns handy in case he does appear  worn out so completely it did not take the boys long to fall into a sound sleep and the old lumberman soon joined them snoring lustily thus the night passed and nothing came to disturb them  of the lads it was randy who was the first to arise in the morning he found uncle barney in the act of stirring up the fire the old lumberman had already brought in some ice to be melted for a pot of coffee  i aint really awake in the morning until after ive had my cup of coffee he explained thats the one thing that really sets me on my feet  how about the storm questioned randy and now the sound of his voice set the others to stirring  the storm is about over was the welcome announcement in a little while i think youll see the sun peeping out over the woods on the eastern shore  hurrah thats good news cried andy leaping to his feet and stretching himself i must have a look and jamming his cap on his head he started for the door the other rovers followed him  outside they found the snow covering everything to a depth of from several inches to several feet but the air was as clear as a bell and just beyond the woods on the eastern shore of lake monona there was a rosy glow betokening the rising of the sun  its going to be a grand day exclaimed fred  i dont think it could be any better even though the snow is quite deep in spots returned jack  once more they went over the stores which had been brought along and took out enough for breakfast they had with them some flour for griddle cakes and soon the appetizing odor of the cakes mingling with the aroma of hot coffee and hot chocolate filled the little cabin then they took turns at frying bacon and making more griddle cakes and eating breakfast  what do you think will be the easiest way of getting to the other end of the island questioned jack of uncle barney while they were eating  well as youve got the bobsled and all those stores along i should say the easiest way would be to climb down to the lake again was the reply that wind must have cleaned off some of the ice and we can get along a good deal better by skating and by hauling the bobsled over the ice than we can trying to break our way through the woods in this heavy fall of snow  i was thinking if we walked the length of the island we might stir up some game remarked randy  youll have plenty of chances to go out after game after youre settled at the regular camp returned the old lumberman the game isnt going to run away you know and he smiled pleasantly  breakfast at an end the boys lost no time in repacking their belongings and uncle barney assisted them in fastening the load to the bobsled  but im going to carry my shotgun this time announced fred then if any game appears ill be ready for it  you can all carry your guns if you want to said the owner of the island ill leave my weapon strapped to the sled so that if any game appears you boys can do the shooting  the little cabin was closed up and then the party made its way down over the rough rocks and between the trees to the lake shore it was no easy matter to bring the bobsled along and once fred slipped on one of the smooth rocks and pitched headlong into a snowbank  hi you stop your fooling cried andy and then in great glee he picked up a chunk of snow and hurled it at jack  let up cried the oldest rover boy this is no time for jokes and then as andy came at him with another chunk of snow he jumped at his cousin put out his foot and made the funloving youth measure his length in a drift  wow but that snow is cold cried andy who had gotten some down the sleeves of his sweater stop dont bury me ill be good and then he scrambled to his feet once more while fred did the same then the whole party proceeded on its way  reaching the lake they lost no time in putting on their skates and then with uncle barney leading the way the four rovers followed dragging the loaded bobsled behind them  on all sides could be seen snowdrifts and ridges of snow piled in curiously fantastic shapes but the keen wind of the afternoon and night had cleared many long reaches of the ice and over these reaches uncle barney picked his way gradually working closer and closer to the upper end of snowshoe island  well turn in here he announced presently when they came to where there was something of a cove there seems to be quite a cleared space it wont be very long now before we reach the upper end  as they turned in once more toward the island jack noticed a peculiar fluttering among some trees not far away  wait a minute he cried out in a low tone i think i see some game  all came to a halt and then uncle barney looked in the direction to which the oldest rover boy pointed  you are right my lad answered the old lumberman there is a fine chance for all of you  what are they questioned fred a trifle excitedly  wild turkeys and the best kind of eatingif you can only get close enough to bring them down     chapter xxiii  unexpected visitors   oh say weve got to bring down at least one of those wild turkeys cried andy  keep quiet admonished jack speaking in a whisper if those turkeys hear you theyll be gone in a jiffy  i didnt know there were any wild turkeys around here remarked randy i thought they had been all cleaned out long ago  they are getting very scarce answered uncle barney but once in a while you will see a small flock of them i was after that flock about a week ago but they got away from me ive a notion that its about the last flock in this district  while this talk was going on in low tones of voice all of the rovers had abandoned the bobsled and were moving toward the shore of the island  you had better come this way and crawl up in the shelter of yonder rocks and brushwood advised uncle barney and dont shoot until you have a good aim and know what youre shooting at he concluded  it must be admitted that all of the boys were somewhat excited over the prospect ahead they caught only a brief glance at the game but felt certain that it was close at hand  wild turkeys are a good sight better than rabbits or squirrels or even pheasants said fred theyll make dandy eating  dont eat them until after you have shot them fred remarked andy dryly  hush warned jack now make as little noise as possible and each of you hold his gun ready for use  they had not stopped to take off their skates but this was unnecessary for the snow was deep and the skates merely kept them from slipping they pushed on around some large rocks and then in between the thick brushwood where the snow fell upon their heads and shoulders covering them with whitesomething which was to their advantage as it aided them in hiding themselves from the game not far away they could hear the wild turkeys one in particular giving the peculiar gobble by which they are well known  i see them whispered fred a minute later and pointed with his gun  there in a little clearing some distance ahead was a tall and long turkey gobbler surrounded by a number of hens they were plump and of a peculiar black and bronzed color  lets all fire together maybe we can bring down the whole flock exclaimed randy and his manner showed that he was growing quite excited  all rightim willing answered jack but let us see if we cant get a little nearer first  maybe if we try to get closer theyll get away from us said andy  keep your guns pointed at them and if they start to leave fire as quickly as you can answered jack and then he moved forward with his cousins ranged on either side of him  the rover boys had advanced but a few paces when the wild turkeys caught sight of them the turkey cock issued a loud note of alarm and all started to fly from the low bushes upon which they had been resting  fire yelled jack and discharged his rifle  the crack of this weapon was followed by the report of freds shotgun and then the twins also let drive then fred fired again and so did some of the others  at the first report the turkey cock was seen to rise in the air followed by some of the hens while two hens dropped lifeless in the snow the turkey cock however was seriously wounded and fluttered around in a circle  give him another shot yelled fred whose gun was empty and thereupon jack and randy fired and the gobbler fell directly at their feet he was not yet dead but they quickly put him out of his misery by wringing his neck by this time the hens which had flown away were out of sight  two hens and one gobbler cried jack as he surveyed the game i think we can congratulate ourselves on this haul  you certainly can exclaimed uncle barney as he plowed up behind the boys wild turkeys are no mean game to bring down let me tell you ive tried time and again to get a turkey and somehow or other it would always get away from me  some size to this gobbler remarked fred and some weight too he added as he picked the turkey cock up by the legs  hell weigh sixteen or eighteen pounds at least said the old lumberman as he took the turkey cock from the youngest rover boy and held the game out in both hands yes sir every bit of eighteenand he may go twenty youll have a dandy meal off of him  i know what id like to do said randy wistfully id like to send him home to the folks  thats the talk returned his twin why cant we do it  im willing answered jack the express company ought to know how to pack game like that so it will carry properly  theyll pack anything you want them to down at the railroad station said uncle barney there is a man there who makes a specialty of that sort of thing for hunters hell see that the turkey reaches your folks in new york in firstclass shape  we can send the gobbler home and keep the two hens said fred that will make eating enough for us im sure they must weigh at least seven or eight pounds apiece  all of that came from the old lumberman  much elated over the success of their first effort at hunting on snowshoe island the rovers picked up the game and made their way back to where they had left the bobsled they placed the turkeys on the sled and then resumed their journey once more  were coming up to the end of the island now announced barney stevenson presently and a minute later they made a turn around some trees lining the shore and came into view of a cleared spot containing a small boatlanding beyond the cleared spot backed up by some tall pines and hemlocks were two fairsized cabins standing about a hundred feet apart  thats the cabin i use explained the old lumberman pointing to the building on the right the other is the one you can make yourselves at home in  the setting for the two cabins was an ideal one and the boys could well imagine how beautiful the place must look in the summer time with the green trees and the cleared space sloping down to the great lake now of course the ground as well as the trees and brushwood was heavily covered with snow and the snow hung down off the rough roof of each cabin  ill take you directly over to the cabin you are to occupy said uncle barney ive got it all in shape for you with plenty of firewood and everything  he led the way and they followed dragging the bobsled behind them the door to the cabin had been locked for the old lumberman stated that he did not wish any outside hunters or other people to take possession during his absence  of course a good many of the hunters and lumberman are my friends he explained but then there are often strangers and some of those fellows wouldnt be above carrying off anything that suited their fancy  the boys gave cries of delight when he took them into the cabin which they were to occupy during their stay on the island they found it a fairly large place divided into two rooms one a general livingroom and the other a sleeping apartment in the former was located a fairly wellmade table a couple of benches and also a swinging shelf containing quite an assortment of dishes while at one side there was a big open fireplace and in a corner a small closet furnished with numerous kitchen utensils  the other apartment contained three regular bunks and a temporary one put in for the occasion and these bunks were well spread with fresh pine boughs and camp blankets the opening from one room into the next was so located that the warmth from the fire in the livingroom could easily reach the sleeping apartment  say this is bangup exclaimed randy  its the best ever echoed fred  its a peach was andys comment  i certainly didnt expect anything half as good as this uncle barney remarked jack his eyes showing his pleasure if we dont have a good time here it certainly wont be your fault  then you really like it do you boys asked the old lumberman anxiously  i certainly dont know how it could be better remarked randy and just look at the dishes and things to cook with  and these fine bunks exclaimed his twin sitting down on one why this is just as good as a hair mattress  and how sweet the pine boughs smell murmured fred  if you boys want to send that turkey cock home you had better let me take it down to rockville today said the old lumberman i wont mind the trip at all he added as he saw that some of them were going to remonstrate fact is i forgot to get some of the things i was going to buy yesterday so if youll just make yourselves at home here ill go down there and be back some time before nightfall  dont you want to wait until after dinner questioned jack  no ill get something to eat while im in town  the matter was talked over and it was finally arranged that barney stevenson should return to rockville with the turkey cock and have it shipped by express to the rover boys folks in new york jack wrote out a card which was to be sent with the game and also another card to be tacked on the box in which it was to be shipped then the old lumberman hurried over to his own cabin to get ready for the journey  wont our folks be surprised when they get that box exclaimed fred i wish i could be there to see them  theyll know we didnt lose any time going hunting added andy with a happy laugh  when the old hunter had departed with the turkey cock the boys hung up the dead hens and then proceeded to make themselves at home in the cabin which had been assigned to them they had quite something to do to build a fire and to unpack and stow away the various things which they had brought along and almost before they were aware it was time for dinner  shall we eat the game today questioned randy  oh let us wait until tomorrow then uncle barney will be with us and he can enjoy it too answered jack and so it was decided then the boys started in to get such a meal as their stores and the things which the old lumberman had turned over to them provided  it was great fun and all of them felt in the best of spirits andy could hardly keep himself down and had to whistle at the top of his lungs and even do a jig or two while he moved about  its going to be the best outing ever he declared over and over again  yes and wont we have something to tell when we get back to colby hall put in fred  it was over an hour later before dinner was ready having had such an early breakfast the boys did full justice to all the things they had cooked and they spent quite some time over the meal after that they continued to put the cabin in order and cleaned their skates and also looked over their guns  well have to try these snowshoes tomorrow announced jack referring to a number of such articles which barney stevenson had hung on the walls of the cabin maybe well almost break our necks at first but there is nothing like getting used to a thing  what do you mean getting used to breaking your neck questioned andy dryly and this brought forth a laugh all around  about the middle of the afternoon the boys found themselves with but little to do and fred suggested that they might go out and look for more game  oh lets take it easy for the rest of the day and go out early in the morning cried randy  let us go over to the other cabin and take a look around suggested andy im sure old uncle barney wont mind hes a fine old gentleman even though he is rather peculiar  i want to talk to him about ruth stevensons folks some time said jack but im afraid im going to have a hard time getting at it  andy led the way out of the cabin and the four boys had almost reached the place used by the old lumberman when suddenly fred gave a cry  here come two men from the lake  maybe its uncle barney coming back with one of his friends said andy  no neither of the men walks like the old lumberman announced his twin  one of those men looks familiar to me burst out jack he gazed intently at the advancing pair  there are two others behind them broke in fred young fellows i think  one of those men is professor lemm cried jack  and the two fellows in the rear are slugger brown and nappy martell added fred     chapter xxiv  a war of words   the knowledge that professor lemm slugger brown and nappy martell were approaching the cabins on the upper end of snowshoe island filled the rover boys with wonder  professor lemm must have come to see uncle barney about those deeds remarked randy  i wonder if that is sluggers father with him broke in fred  maybe answered jack those men were the only two who were interested in getting possession of this island  ill tell you what i think we ought to do exclaimed andy  what came from the others quickly  i think we ought to go back to our own cabin and arm ourselves  that might not be such a bad idea andy returned jack those men backed up by slugger and nappy may want to carry things with a high hand  acting on andys suggestion the four boys retreated to the cabin which they had just left and each took possession of his weapon  i dont think theyll try much roughhouse work when they see how we are armed remarked randy grimly  of course we dont want to do any shooting cautioned jack we only want to scare them in case they go too far  jack you had better be the spokesman for the crowd remarked randy you go ahead and talk to them and well stand back with our guns  still holding his rifle jack went forward again and in a moment more found himself confronted by asa lemm and the man who was with him  rover is it possible exclaimed the former teacher of colby hall in astonishment what are you doing here  i and my cousins are here to hunt  humph i didnt know old stevenson allowed anybody to do hunting around here  maybe they are hunting here without the old mans permission suggested the other man where is barney stevenson he demanded of jack  mr stevenson has gone over to rockville on an errand was the reply  by this time slugger and nappy had come up and they stared at jack and his cousins as if they could not believe the evidences of their senses  well what do you know about this burst out the former bully of colby hall  all of those rovers up here and armed came from nappy  who gave you the right to come to this island went on the bully glaring at jack  do you know these boys queried the man who was with professor lemm  sure dad i know them they are the rover boys i told you aboutthe fellows who helped to have me and nappy sent away from school  oh so thats it cried slogwell brown did you have any idea they might be up here he questioned quickly  not the least dad i thought they were down in new york nappy said he had seen them on the ice in central park  i did see them too answered the lad mentioned  well we didnt come here to see you rovers broke in asa lemm stiffly not but what i have an account to settle with you he continued significantly  we want nothing more to do with you professor lemm answered jack boldly  but im going to have something to do with you young man stormed the former teacher of the hall beginning to show his usual ill humor  never mind these boys now lemm interposed slogwell brown we want to fix up our business with old stevenson first  if you have anything to say to mr stevenson youll have to come when he is here answered jack  when do you expect him back  i dont know exactly when he will comeprobably before nightfall  then all we can do is to wait for him grumbled slogwell brown  if we have to wait we might as well go inside his cabin and do it suggested nappy its too cold to stay out here  yes and im all tired out from wading through those snowdrifts added slugger he looked past jack at the other rover boys had any luck hunting  for the moment there was no reply then randy stepped forward  i dont know as that is any of your business slugger he replied coldly  oh say you neednt get on your highhorse growled the bully what nappy and i ought to do is to pitch into you for having us fired out of the hall  you stay right where you are cried fred  humph you think youve got the best of us with those guns dont you came from nappy who had ranged up beside slugger  never mind what we think answered andy if you know when youre well off youll keep your distance  see here you boys neednt get too fresh came harshly from slogwell brown ive heard all about your doings at colby hall and how you got the professor here and my son and his chum into trouble some day i intend to make you suffer for that but just now we are here on a different errand  were going to put old stevenson off this island and take possession cried nappy triumphantly and then when he goes you can go too  why cannot we take possession of these two cabins at once suggested asa lemm the island belongs to us and we have a perfect right to do so  of course we can take possession answered slogwell brown rememberpossession is nine points of the law he added in a low tone of voice  well show old stevenson where he belongs growled slugger  yes and well show these rover boys where they belong too put in nappy his eyes snapping viciously  without further ado the whole party started toward the cabin which was barney stevensons home evidently the men had been there before and knew that this was the right building of the two  oh jack are you going to let them take possession questioned fred in a low voice  what do you fellows think we ought to do queried the oldest rover boy quickly  i think we ought to make them keep out until uncle barney gets back answered randy  thats my idea too added his twin  they may have the right to this island but id make them fight it out with mr stevenson was freds comment  thats just the way i look at it too answered jack come on randy well guard that cabin while andy and fred can remain here to guard this place  would you dare to shoot at them questioned fred anxiously  i dont think there will be any necessity for shooting fred i think if we merely show we mean business they will keep their distance  the boys exchanged a few more words and then jack and randy set off on a run for the cabin occupied by uncle barney they outdistanced the visitors and soon placed themselves in the doorway  now you keep back cried jack warningly dont come near this place until mr stevenson returns  ha do you dare to threaten me burst out slogwell brown in amazement  you heard what i said  every one of you keep away from here put in randy  see here rover commenced asa lemm this is outrageous we own this island and we intend to take possession  whether you own it or not you are not going to take possession of anything until after mr stevenson gets here answered jack as calmly as he could i dont know anything about your claim as far as i do know mr stevenson is the owner of this place he left us in charge when he went away and we are going to remain in charge until he gets back  huh do you think were going to stay out in this cold grumbled slugger  i dont care what you do answered jack you cant come into either of these cabinsand thats final  well see about that stormed nappy and advanced several steps  get back there ordered jack sternly and made a movement as if to raise his rifle  stop stop dont shoot yelled asa lemm in sudden fright keep back boys or theyll certainly shoot at us and he began to retreat  do you dare to threaten us questioned slogwell brown and the tone of his voice showed his uneasiness a glance over his shoulder had shown him the other two boys at the doorway of the second cabin and also armed  im telling you to keep away from herethats all answered jack you can come back when mr stevenson returns  ii think maybe it would be better for us to retire stammered professor lemm weerdont want to run the risk of being shot those boys are very hotheaded and there is no telling what they might do if we exasperated them  im not going to give in to a bunch of school boys stormed slogwell brown who in his manner was every bit as much of a bully as his son  but if they should shoot at us  i dont think theyve got the nerve to do it they are only putting up a big bluff  dont you be too sure about that put in nappy who was just as much scared as was the professor those rover boys are game to do almost anything when they are aroused  weve got to remember one thing came from slugger there are four of them and each of em has got a gun  i wish i had brought a gun along myself said his crony  we should have armed ourselves grumbled slogwell brown it was a mistake to come over to this island without so much as a pistol if i only had some sort of a weapon id show those boys a thing or two  maybe we can get into the cabin by a back way suggested nappy  say thats an idea cried his crony and if we can do that maybe theres a gun or a pistol inside that we can use  you boys can take a walk around to the rear if you want to answered sluggers father ill see if i cant bluff those fellows into letting us in at the front  slugger and nappy had just started to move away toward the lake shore intending to sneak behind some rocks and bushes when they heard fred give a loud shout from the entrance to the second cabin then andy gave a long whistle  whats that for questioned nappy quickly  see they are waving their hands to somebody announced slugger he turned to gaze out over the lake a man is coming  what do you bet it isnt old stevenson  it is see hes coming as fast as he can  yes and he has his gun with him announced asa lemm somewhat feebly  attracted by the call from fred and the loud whistle given by andy the old lumberman had noted that a number of visitors were standing in front of the two cabins at the upper end of snowshoe island he was still a considerable distance out on the lake but his rapid skate strokes soon brought him to the shore then without waiting to unstrap his skates he came forward through the snow his shotgun ready for use  well im mighty glad hes got here murmured jack and his cousins echoed the sentiment     chapter xxv  facing the wolves   so this is how you treat me eh exclaimed old barney stevenson as he confronted the visitors come here to do as you please while im away eh and his face showed his intense displeasure  they wanted to go into your cabin but we wouldnt let them do it while you were away said jack quickly  good for you boysim glad you kept em out  see here stevenson this nonsense has got to end cried slogwell brown you know as well as i do that you have no valid claim to this island  the island belongs to me brown and i intend to keep it was the quick reply ive got my deed for it  that deed is no good and you know it broke in asa lemm  look here if you are so sure that mr stevenson is in the wrong why dont you go to law about it questioned jack struck by a sudden idea  see here boy this is none of your affair growled slogwell brown well conduct our own business in our own way  and ill conduct my own business in my own way too interposed uncle barney you get off of this islandall of youjust as quick as you can and he started as if to raise his gun  now see here stevenson began slogwell brown  we have rights came from asa lemm  ive listened to you before im not going to listen again interrupted the old lumberman you havent any right on this island and im ordering youevery one of youto get off just as soon as you can youre trespassersnothing else and now he raised his gun as if getting ready to shoot  come on let us go back cried professor lemm in sudden terror and he retreated several steps followed by slugger and nappy  see here stevenson youll be sorry for this some day growled slogwell brown he had still too much of the fight left in him to retreat and yet he was not brave enough to advance  ill take my chances returned uncle barney ive got those deeds and i know they are all o k now you clear outand dont you dare to come here again  why wont you let me see those deeds questioned the other man  because i wontthats why  i came on purpose to look them over and show you your mistake  maybe he hasnt got any deeds came from nappy who had fallen back still further  ive got those deeds safe and soundin a boxand put away where you fellows cant find em answered the old lumberman triumphantly now you get out ill give you just five minutes to do it in jack you time em will you and he glanced at the oldest rover boy  sure i will was the ready reply and jack pulled out his watch its now exactly twelve minutes past four  all right then youve got until seventeen minutes after four to get off of this island announced barney stevenson to the visitors if you are not off by that time therell most likely be some shooting around here  he had taken his place in front of his cabin and all of the boys were now ranged beside him as each was armed they made quite a formidable looking firing squad  much against his will slogwell brown retreated to where professor lemm and the others of the crowd stood the four talked matters over in a low tone  its too bad we came here unarmed grumbled slogwell brown  thats just what i say dad answered his son lets go back and get some guns and pistols  no no we dont want any shooting cried asa lemm in new alarm  im not going to get mixed up in any gunplay added nappy  if we could only get possession of those deeds went on the former teacher of colby hall  ive got a plan suggested nappy after a moments pause come on lets go away now and ill tell you what it is  growling and grumbling the four visitors made their way slowly to the lake shore as they skated off slugger brown turned to shake his fist at the rovers and nappy did likewise  well theyve gone exclaimed fred and his voice showed his relief  but theres no telling when theyll come back said randy quickly  i dont think theyll come back in a hurry broke in andy we scared them pretty thoroughly with our guns  what did they say to you before i came questioned uncle barney while the party on the lake was disappearing in the gloom  thereupon the boys related the particulars of all that had taken place the old lumberman listening closely to the recital at the end he shut his teeth and shook his head grimly  the rascals he ejaculated if it hadnt been for you they would most likely have ransacked both of the cabins and maybe if they had gotten hold of my extra gun or my pistol taken possession and made me keep away  oh they would have taken possession all right enough cried jack but if the island is really yours uncle barney i dont see why you couldnt have had them arrested for anything like that  i told you beforei have no use for lawyers or law courts grumbled the old lumberman all i want to do is to stay here and not be disturbed ive got my deeds and thats enough  are you sure they are in a safe place questioned jack i mean some place where those rascals cant get at them  ive got em in a tin box and put away safe enough  i hope you havent got them hidden around one of the cabins said fred theyd be sure to find them if they came here some time when you were away and made a search  i havent got em in or near either of the cabins ive got em in a better place than that was the cunning reply  you really ought to have them recorded uncle barney and then maybe it wouldnt be a bad scheme to put them in a safe deposit box in a bank said jack  oh theyre safe enoughdont you fear answered the old man it was plainly to be seen that he was bound to have his own way in everything he did  satisfied that the visitors had left the island for the time being the boys followed the old lumberman into his own cabin and there helped him to start up the fire he told them that he had shipped off the wild turkey as desired  the evening passed quietly and in the morning the boys found themselves thoroughly rested  its a grand day for hunting exclaimed fred as he went outside to view the landscape the sun was just peeping over the trees on the eastern shore of lake monona and soon the dazzling shafts of light were streaming over the ice and snow in all directions  do you think asa lemm and those others will be back today queried randy  theres no telling answered jack  while some of the boys were preparing breakfast the others walked over to uncle barneys cabin they found the old lumberman already stirring and invited him to come over and eat his morning meal with them an invitation which he readily accepted for he had taken a great liking to all of the rovers  weve been thinking of trying those snowshoes uncle barney said jack  no time like the present boys was the answer ill show you how to put em on and how to use em too  wont you go out hunting with us questioned fred  no im going to stay around the cabins in case those rascals come back i dont think they will but there is nothing like being on the safe side  the hour after the morning meal was productive of a good deal of fun none of the boys had ever used snowshoes before and consequently in their efforts to move around on them they got more than one tumble  great watermelons cried andy as he pitched headfirst into a snowdrift and i thought using snowshoes was the easiest thing in the world  its just like plain walking andy its got to be learned answered jack who a moment before had had a tumble himself  finally however the boys managed to remain on their feet fairly well and then they started off to do a little hunting along the eastern shore of the island  i dont know as youll be able to stir up very much today announced uncle barney but even a few rabbits and a few squirrels wont be so bad  they carried a lunch with them not knowing whether they would get back to the cabin by noon or not they were soon gliding over the snow where something of a trail led through the woods  they tramped a good half mile before they saw anything in the way of game then several squirrels appeared and fred and andy had the satisfaction of laying them low with their shotguns then they tramped on further and by noon managed to obtain a rabbit and two woodcocks  not so bad but what it might be worse announced jack who had the rabbit to his credit we wont go hungry thats sure  and dont forget that weve got those wild turkeys to eat added andy who had laid low the two woodcocks  being unaccustomed to the use of snowshoes the lads were glad to rest they built themselves a little campfire and huddling around this partook of the lunch they had brought along washing it down with some hot chocolate from a thermos bottle they carried  the lunch finished they set off once again this time going deeper into the woods than ever  listen cried jack presently i thought i heard some game stirring  all came to a halt and listened intently from a distance they heard a peculiar drumming sound  partridges ill bet anything cried randy in a low voice come on lets see if we cant get some of them  he led the way over the snow and the others were not slow in following they had reached a point where the trees grew sparingly and where there were a great number of rocks and brushwood  they could hear a strange fluttering and then a number of partridges arose in the air some distance in front of them all took hasty aim and fired but the game sailed out of sight unharmed  thats the time we missed it observed jack dismally i guess we made too much noise and they heard us  listen interrupted randy there is some sort of fight going on ahead  he was right and listening they made out a strange bark mingled with a snarl and several yelps  lets go ahead and see what it means exclaimed andy and pushed on with the others close behind him  the boys had to skirt some heavy brushwood and then came out in a small cleared space surrounded by numerous big rocks and pine trees the strange noises they had heard had come from between two of the large rocks and now of a sudden several forms snapping and snarling and whirling this way and that in the snow burst upon their view  wolves  four of them  they are all fighting over the possession of a dead partridge  four gaunt and hungrylooking wolves had come tumbling out in the snow one of them was carrying a dead partridge in his mouth and the other three were doing their best to get the game away from him as the rovers came into the opening the wolves for an instant stopped their fighting and glared at the boys then the animal having the game made a sudden leap over the rocks and disappeared from view the three wolves that remained began to snap and snarl and show their teeth  gracious they are certainly hungrylooking beggars was randys comment  come on lets shoot them exclaimed jack  theyre no good for game interposed randy  i know that randy but we dont want them on the island and neither does uncle barney  i thought he said there werent very many wolves left maybe  fred who was speaking got no further for at that moment the three hungrylooking wolves crouched low and then sprang straight in the direction of the four young hunters     chapter xxvi  jack frees his mind   jump for your lives  shoot them  these cries had scarcely been made when jacks gun rang out and the foremost of the three wolves was hit in the foreleg he gave a plunge and rolled over in the snow snapping and snarling viciously the report of the weapon was followed by the discharge of randys gun but his aim was wild and the charge passed harmlessly over the heads of the wolves  shoot them  club them  then another shot rang out as fred swung into action it was at close range and the charge of shot tore directly into the throat of the leading wolf causing him to leap high into the air and then fall over on his back he plunged for a moment sending the snow flying in every direction and then lay still  shocked evidently by the fate that had overtaken both of his companions the third wolf came to a sudden halt with eyes glaring fiercely he snapped and then leaped for the nearest rocks  illustration the wolf received a blow that bowled him over  page 260  shoot him somebody we want to get all three of them  crack bang went a rifle and a shotgun almost simultaneously but the aim of the two marksmen was poor and only a few scattering shots went through the tail of the wolf then with a wild yelp he disappeared behind the rocks and that was the last seen of him in the meantime the wounded beast was snapping and snarling most ferociously he sent a shower of loose snow toward the rovers and then made a desperate leap at jack  it was a time of dire peril and no one realized it more than did the oldest rover boy he attempted to retreat but to do so in snowshoes was too much for him and over he went on his side in a deep bank of snow almost disappearing from view  the wolf is on top of jack  shoot himbut be careful and dont hit jack  dont fire gasped randy youll hit jack sure and then as well as he was able he sprang to the front using his gun as a club as he did so around came the stock with a wide swing and the wolf received a blow in the side that bowled him over and over  this second attack coming after he had been wounded in the foreleg was too much for the animal and with a yelp of sudden fear he went limping and leaping through the snow sending the loose particles flying all about him one of the boys discharged his gun after the beast but whether he hit the animal or not he could not tell in another moment the wolf was out of sight  do you think any of them will come back panted andy who was quite out of breath with excitement  i dont think so answered jack however let us reload just as quickly as we can and be ready for them he had been taught the allimportant lesson that a hunter should not let his firearm remain empty  well anyhow i got one of them cried fred with proper pride as he surveyed the beast he had laid low the discharge of shot had almost torn the wolfs throat asunder  what will you do with him questioned randy  im going to take him back to the cabin and ask uncle barney about it was freds reply perhaps we can have the wolf stuffed  the excitement of the encounter with the wolves had taken away the boys desire to do any more hunting that day and strapping the dead wolf fast to a tree limb they started on the return to the northern end of the island each doing his share in carrying the dead animal  whats that a wolf cried barney stevenson when he saw what they had brought and then he added quickly must be the one that we located in the cabin at the other end of the island  we cant say about that answered jack and then all of the boys told the story of the encounter in the woods  four of them why i havent heard of any such thing as that around here for years ill have to go after some of those wolves myself  i was wondering what we could do with this wolf said fred do you think i could send him home to have him stuffed  you could my boy but i wouldnt advise it who would want a stuffed wolf around anyhow of course you might put him in some clubhouse or furriers windowor something like that  oh i guess i wont bother answered fred  ill tell you what well do suggested jack well prop the wolf up against a tree and then take a photograph of fred shooting at him and so it was decided and the boys had much fun taking the picture  several days passed and no one came near the island in the meantime the boys went out hunting every day and barney stevenson showed them how to fish through a hole in the ice this was great sport and they had the satisfaction of adding a number of pickerel and perch to their bill of fare during those days they cooked and ate the wild turkeys and found the meat quite palatable  we sure are having one dandy time said fred one evening when sitting in front of the blazing fire  i dont see how it could be any better fred answered andy  and just think of what weve brought down in the way of rabbits squirrels pheasants woodcocks and turkeys  not to say anything about my wolf came from fred  yes and a shot i got at a brook mink added jack he had seen the mink at a distance but had been unable to bring the game down  uncle barney had been with the boys at supper time but had taken himself over to his own cabin to smoke and to read one of several books the boys had given him  i think ill go over and see the old lumberman said jack presently you fellows can stay here  going to talk to him about ruth and her folks questioned randy  yes if i get the chance  i wouldnt worry him too much said fred he hasnt gotten over that visit from professor lemm and the others yet  oh ill be carefuldont worry about that  the old lumberman was a bit surprised to have jack walk in on him but the youth had brought his gun along and he asked uncle barney to examine the hammer of the weapon  it looks all right to me said the old lumberman after an examination but ill put on a few drops of oil and then maybe itll work easier it wont do to have the hammer stick just when you want to use it  and now uncle barney if youll permit me id like to speak of something else said jack as he dropped into a seat alongside of the fireplace ive got something on my mind and i want to see if you cant help me out  something on your mind eh returned the old man kindly well if i can help you out you can depend on old uncle barney to do it and he smiled broadly  it isnt exactly my trouble uncle barney its somebody elses went on the oldest rover boy a young lady i know is very much worried over something and she has asked me if i cant do something to help her get rid of that worry  must be some young lady you know pretty well then jack and the old lumberman smiled again  i do know her quite well and i think a great deal of her friendship her folks have some trouble on handquite a good deal of it in factand it worries the girl a good deal and that of course worries me you see there has been a terrible mistake made and neither the girl nor her folks know how to get at it to remedy it  i seei see the old lumberman nodded his head several times thats the way it is often things get into a snarl and a fellow cant see his way clear to straighten em out ive been there myself and i know  this young lady im speaking about has an old relativea sort of unclethat she thinks a great deal of her folks think a great deal of this gentleman too now years ago her folks and the old gentleman had a quarrel and now the old gentleman wont let her come anywhere near him even though she would love dearly to talk to him and try to explain matters so that he would understand that it was not her folks fault that the quarrel had taken place  see here what are you talking about exclaimed uncle barney eyeing jack suspiciously come now no beating about the bush  well if you must know im speaking about ruth stevenson who goes to a young ladies school not far from colby hall she and i are very good friends and she has told me a good deal about this quarrel you had with her father  it was fred stevensons faultit wasnt my fault grumbled the old lumberman  maybe it was uncle barney i dont know anything about that but i do know that ruth has told me that her father never wanted nor tried to do you any injury he claims that it was all a mistake and that you should have given him a chance to explain  it wasnt any mistakei know just exactly what happened  but dont you think you ought to at least listen to what ruths father has to say all he wants you to do is to hear his story  did he tell you that  ruth told me she said both her father and her mother are very much upset over the way you have treated them they want to be friends with you and her father is willing to do whatever is right regarding what took place years ago she said her folks would like nothing better than to have you give up your lonely life on this island and come down and make your home with them  what me go down there and live with them after all that has happened i couldnt do anything like that and the old lumberman sprang up and began to pace the cabin floor  you could do it if you tried uncle barney by the way dont you remember ruth  sure i doas pretty a little girl as ever i set eyes on i never had anything against her it was her father i had my quarrel with  and you liked ruths mother too didnt you went on jack slowly  oh yes helen dean always was a nice girl i knew her long before fred stevenson married her  and you liked ruths father too didnt you before this quarrel took place  of course we were very chummy up to that time the old lumberman took several turns across the cabin floor but thats all over now he didnt treat me fairthats all there is to it he didnt even come to my wifes funeral  well if he didnt hes very sorry for it now and you can take it from me uncle barney that he would like nothing better than to patch up the matter somehow or other and be friends once more  yes but  and just think how happy it would make his wife and ruth continued jack quietly  maybe but i dont see how it can be done anyway i aint going to take the first step went on uncle barney somewhat lamely  you wont have to take the first step cried jack you just let them do that he came over and caught the old lumberman by the arm will you  for a moment uncle barney was silent he bit his lip and rubbed his chin with the back of his hand  well ill see about it he said slowly ill think it over     chapter xxvii  the blue tin box   when jack rover returned to the other cabin he was in a happy frame of mind he had talked to barney stevenson for over an hour and the old man had at last agreed to listen to what ruths father might have to say to him he had admitted that living on the island was rather a lonely existence for him especially as he was getting old  i do hope they patch up their differences remarked jack to his cousins after he had told them of the conversation held i know it will take a great load off of ruths mind  are you going to send the stevensons a letter questioned fred  im going to do better than that fred was the reply ill skate down to rockville the first thing in the morning and send ruth and her folks a telegram there is nothing like striking while the iron is hot  exactly so put in andy its just like catching a flea while he is biting and at this sally there was a general laugh  jack was as good as his word and slipped off early in the morning accompanied by randy it was a beautiful day and the youths had little difficulty in reaching the town here the oldest rover boy spent quite some time concocting the proper message which he sent to the stevenson home address  i only hope somebody will be there to receive it he said after the message had been paid for and he had urged upon the operator to send it without delay  several more days including sunday passed rather quietly for the boys one afternoon there came another fall of snow and they grew rather fearful thinking they might be snowed in but the fall proved a light one and in the morning it was as clear as ever  jack had been rather disappointed at not getting the brook mink at which he had shot and now he asked the others if they would not go to the locality where the mink had been seen  id like to bring one of them down said the oldest rover boy  well we might as well go after the mink as do anything answered fred he was growing just a bit tired of going after nothing but rabbits and squirrels for two days they had seen nothing else at which to shoot even the wolves and wild turkeys kept well out of sight  the boys found old uncle barney polishing his gun he told them however that he was not going out hunting but was going into the woods to inspect some of the trees with a view to cutting them down for lumber  you wont have no easy time of it getting a mink he said the only way i ever got em was in a trap howsomever go ahead and enjoy yourselves hunting is a good deal like fishingyou can have lots of fun even if you dont get anything and he chuckled nevertheless his face looked as if he was somewhat worried  ill wager hes thinking about ruths father and that meeting they may have said randy when the rovers were alone and preparing to go out on the hunt  either that randy or else he is brooding over the trouble professor lemm and mr brown are making for him  theres one thing i cant understand about this put in andy why should those men be so anxious to obtain possession of an island like this it isnt very large and the lumber on it cant be worth a great deal i should think they could pick up a piece of real estate almost anywhere that would be far more valuable than this  now youre saying something that ive been thinking right along answered jack even if they wanted this place for a summer resort it wouldnt bring any great sum of money  one thing is certain said fred they are very eager to get possession  yes and another thing is certain too added jack that is uncle barney isnt going to let them have it if he can possibly stop them  the boys had had an early breakfast and now they filled one of their game bags with a wellcooked lunch and also carried with them a thermos bottle filled with hot chocolate  we dont want to run short on food cautioned andy gee what an appetite this fresh air gives a fellow  right you are answered fred i could eat five or six meals a day and never mind it at all  im glad we have managed to bring down so many squirrels and rabbits put in randy if it wasnt for that we might have run a little short on eating im a little bit tired of squirrel stew and rabbit potpie although they are a whole lot better than going hungry  barney stevenson came out to see them off  going down to that brook where you saw the mink he questioned referring to a tiny watercourse now of course frozen up located near the southern end of the island  yes and maybe well get away down to the other cabin answered jack we thought wed like to take a look around there  and if we dont come back tonight youll know that were staying at that cabin said fred  oh we didnt calculate to stay out all night put in jack quickly  i know we didnt but its just possible it may get too late for us to come back and that cabin would be comfortable enough especially if we managed to drag in some pine boughs for beds  well dont shoot more than half a dozen minksor half a dozen deer either shouted uncle barney after them and then they started off and were soon out of sight skating along the eastern shore of snowshoe island  left to himself uncle barney began to pace the floor of his cabin impatiently evidently the old lumberman was turning over something in his mindsomething which bothered him a great deal  of course they are safe he murmured to himself it couldnt be otherwise the last time i looked the tin box was just where i had left it i dont see why i should get so nervous over it  presently he drew out his pipe filled it and sat down in front of the fire to smoke as he did this a slight noise outside the cabin attracted his attention  i wonder what that was he asked himself and arising looked out of one of the cabin windows then he went to the door and gazed around no one was in sight and he closed the door again  must have been the wind or something like that he murmured or else im getting more nervous than i ever was before now that ive got used to those boys around it seems dreadfully lonely when they are gone and he heaved a deep sigh  he remained in front of the fire for the best part of half an hour then as if struck by a sudden determination he leaped up knocked the ashes from his pipe and began to put on his snowshoes he donned his heavy coat and his cap locked up his cabin and strode off in the direction of the heavy woods in the center of the island  although barney stevenson was not aware of it the noise he had heard while seated before the open fire had betokened something of importance entirely unknown to the old lumberman or to the rover boys slugger brown and nappy martell had arrived in the vicinity of the two cabins on the northern point of the island both of the youths were armed but they approached the cabin occupied by the old lumberman with the greatest of secrecy  it looks like another wildgoose chase to me growled slugger brown when they were close to the place weve been here three times now and the old man hasnt done a thing out of the ordinary  well were sure of one thing anyway nappy replied he hasnt got those deeds anywhere around that cabinor at least no place where we could locate them  the bully and his crony had from a distance watched the departure of the rovers as can be guessed from their conversation they had visited the island several times before each time taking care that none of the others should discover their presence on their trips they had been strongly tempted to roughhouse the cabin occupied by jack and his cousins but they had not dared to do this fearing it might cause the rovers to go on guard  and anyhow were not here for that purpose now slugger brown had observed we want to get those land deeds for my dad and old lemon  the two youths had come close to the side of the cabin and peered in at one of the windows and it was this noise that had attracted barney stevensons attention but they had managed to keep out of sight of the old lumberman by flinging themselves down behind some bushes they watched the departure of uncle barney with interest and at once resolved to follow him  of course we havent any snowshoes so maybe we wont get very far said slugger but we will do the best we can  unconscious that his movements were being so closely observed uncle barney plunged deep into the woods taking a trail which was familiar to him in some spots the snow lay deep but in the majority of places the wind had swept the ground almost bare so slugger and nappy had no great difficulty in following in the old mans footsteps  he doesnt seem to be going out after any game observed nappy presently i just saw a rabbit running ahead of him and he never even raised his gun  i think i know where hes going answered slugger well soon find out if im right  you mean that cave your father once spoke about  thats it nappy  what is there about that cave that makes it so important went on the other curiously  never mind that nowyoull know some daywhen my father gets possession of the island answered slugger rather importantly  the best part of half a mile more was covered and then barney stevenson left the trail and plunged in among a wilderness of trees and rocks he had to take off his snowshoes and he hung them up in a tree then he went ahead once more presently reaching the foot of a little cliff here there was an opening six or seven feet in diameter and he disappeared into this  what do you know about that cried nappy in a low voice is that a cave  thats just what it is answered slugger triumphantly i only hope its the cave my father wanted to locate  why does he want to locate a cave on this island asked nappy more curious than ever  youll know some day nap now come onlets try to find out what the old man is going to do in that cave  with caution the bully and his crony made their way over the snow and then slipped inside the entrance to the cave ahead of them they saw the flicker of a lantern which uncle barney had lit  the cave was irregular in shape running back a distance of a hundred feet or more as the old man advanced he held his gun ready for use thinking that possibly some wild animal had taken possession but no animal of any sort appeared  coming to the back end of the cave the old man set down the lantern on a rock then he got down on his knees and began to pull away at a large flat stone close by he worked rather feverishly as if growing more nervous every instance  it must be here they couldnt have gotten it away from me he muttered to himself  as he worked slugger and nappy approached until they were within plain sight of what he was doing they did not make a sound however and uncle barney never suspected their presence  when the flat stone had been set aside there was revealed a small cache lined with more stones at the bottom of this cache rested a fairsized tin box dark blue in color and secured with a padlock  ha i knew it was safe cried the old man in a relieved tone of voice i knew they couldnt find it  say what do you suppose began nappy when slugger clapped a hand over his mouth  the lowspoken words echoed throughout the cavern and much startled uncle barney dropped the tin box and sprang to his feet as he did this slugger brown shoved his crony behind a projecting rock and crouched low himself  who is there cried the old lumberman and caught up his gun who is there i say speak or ill fire  for reply slugger picked up a goodsized stone which was handy taking hasty aim he hurled it at the old man it struck uncle barney in the forehead and slowly the old lumberman sank to the floor of the cave unconscious     chapter xxviii  uncle barneys secret   looks to me as if we were going to be stumped jack  i agree andy it doesnt look as if there were any mink in this neighborhood answered the oldest rover boy  dont give up yet pleaded fred who sat on a fallen tree resting  its barely noon yet announced andy glancing at his watch weve half a day before us  the boys had spent the entire time since leaving their cabin in skating along the shore of the island and making their way along the tiny frozenup watercourse where they had hoped to discover at least one brook mink but the only game to come into sight had been a squirrel and they had not shot at this fearing to disturb the other game were it in that vicinity  lets have lunch before we continue hunting suggested andy this is as good a spot as any to rest in  the others were willing and finding a little cleared space they built a tiny campfire and proceeded to make themselves at home they passed a full hour over the midday meal for the constant skating and tramping through the woods and climbing over the rocks was very tiring  it wont be long before our vacation will be at an end observed fred only a few days more and well have to get into the grind again at colby hall  dont dare to mention lessons yet fred cried andy time enough for that when the school bell rings  i was hoping mr stevenson would get up here before we left said jack i want to see how he and old uncle barney get along  maybe hes staying away on purpose so that hell have a chance to see the old man alone suggested randy  the middle of the afternoon found the four young hunters near the end of the frozenup watercourse at a point where it ran in summer over some rough rocks into the lake below here the ground was very irregular and once fred slipped into a hollow giving his left ankle a bad twist  ouch he cried and made a wry face  much hurt asked the others quickly  ii dont think so answered the youngest rover slowly he pulled himself up and took a step or two i guess it is all right but it was a nasty tumble just the same  weve got to be careful it wont do for any of us to sprain an ankle or break a leg cautioned jack  they had gone only a short distance further when randy suddenly put up his hand  i saw something flit through the snow near yonder rocks he whispered pointing  i see it ejaculated jack and with these words he took hasty aim and fired then his cousins saw another movement in the snow between some nearby rocks and they too discharged their weapons  there was a commotion both in the direction in which jack had fired and also down between the nearer rocks and rushing up the four young hunters beheld two minks whirling about in the snow each badly wounded  mink boys think of it  dont let them get away  these cries mingled with several more rapid reports as one lad after another fired a second charge this time their aims were better and in a moment each of the minks lay stretched out on the rocks dead  i think there was a third one observed randy but he must have got away  well weve got two anyway answered jack with some pride what beautiful creatures they are  each of the minks was over a foot in length not counting the bushy tail they were of a soft brown shade with a ridge of black on the back and patches of white below each was quite plump and gave forth a peculiar strong odor  the boys were greatly delighted and viewed the game with much satisfaction they placed the minks over their shoulders and then continued the hunt presently stirring up half a dozen rabbits  i guess we had better be starting for the cabin announced jack presently  how about going to that other cabin at the south end of the island queried fred  oh lets give that up cried randy i feel like getting back to where we have all our things  the others were inclined to do this and somewhat against his will fred agreed to return to the north end of snowshoe island not without some difficulty they made their way back to the lake shore and there put on their skates once again and started  the young hunters had expected to see uncle barney awaiting them on their return and they were a bit surprised when the old lumberman did not show himself  he must be putting in a full day sizing up that lumber he spoke about observed jack as he gazed at his watch its nearly six oclock  he cant see much in this darkness observed randy  the boys entered their cabin and after resting a bit proceeded to cook supper they expected every moment to hear a shout from uncle barney but none came and at last they sat down to the meal alone  i dont like this much was jacks comment when another hour had passed and the old lumberman had failed to show himself if he was going to stay away like this he should have left some word  lets take a look around his cabin suggested fred  this was done but it shed no light on the unusual occurrence the boys sat down and tried to amuse themselves as best they could but as another hour went by their anxiety increased  something is wrong i feel certain announced jack at last  maybe while he was out in the woods he fell down over some rocks suggested andy  hes a pretty old man to be climbing around in dangerous places added his twin  when the time came to go to bed none of the boys felt like retiring a lantern was lit and hung up on a flagpole which stood between the two cabins this was a signal which had been agreed upon when the rovers had first come to snowshoe island  there now if he can see the light hell be able to locate himself said fred  the boys took a walk around by the boat landing and also to the edge of the woods back of the cabin but all to no purpose then they finally retired to their own shelter  we might as well go to bed suggested handy it wont do any good for all of us to stay up if you say so we might take turns in staying on guard in case we should hear a call for help or anything like that  this was considered good advice and each youth took two hours at staying awake while the others slept and thus the night passed  with the first streak of daylight the boys prepared a hasty breakfast and then went outside to view the situation they soon found the tracks of the old lumbermans snowshoes leading into the woods and presently saw two other tracks close behind them  im no sleuth but it looks to me as if uncle barney went into the woods and two persons followed him exclaimed jack  just the way it looks to me too answered fred  lets go and follow up those footprints at once suggested andy  the others were willing and in a short space of time they were on their snowshoes and making their way through the woods in the center of the island  hello heres something cried jack presently and pointed to the old lumbermans snowshoes where they still rested among the branches of a tree  then the boys saw where he had climbed between the rocks and taking off their snowshoes they followed the footprints  a cave  what do you know about that  it did not take the lads long to reach the entrance of the cavern then jack who had brought along one of the flashlights turned it on and entered followed by his cousins  hello uncle barney he cried out at the top of his lungs uncle barney are you here  help help came feebly from the inner end of the cave and guided by the flashlight the four rovers ran in that direction they found the old man sitting on a rock with his head resting on his arm  are you hurt how did it happen questioned jack quickly  theyve robbed me moaned the old lumberman they came up behind me and somebody hit me in the head with a rock then they ran away with my tin box  who was it are you badly hurt questioned randy  i guess im not so awfully bad off even though my head did bleed some answered uncle barney but the worst of it is they got away with my tin boxthe one thats got the deeds to this island in it and all my other valuables including my dead wifes jewelry and a thousand dollars in gold  by this time the boys were examining the old mans head they saw where the rock had struck him making quite a cut from which the blood had flowed over one ear it was much swollen and over it uncle barney had tied a bandanna handkerchief  ill get some snow and wash it off with that cried fred and did so then the wound was bound up once more and uncle barney said he felt better he told his story in detail  what am i going to do he groaned those rascals have got my treasure box  who were they questioned randy  i dont know exactly i heard them talk and faced them with my gun they were in the dark so i couldnt distinguish them very good then one of them threw a big rock and that is all i can remember as soon as i became unconscious they must have grabbed the box and run away with it  it must have been either asa lemm and mr brown or else slugger and nappy said randy  i dont know what im going to do now those deeds are gonenot to say anything about my wifes jewelry and all that gold groaned the old lumberman  just you take it easy uncle barney you mustnt excite yourself now said jack kindly well do what we can toward getting the box back  the boys had brought some food along and they insisted upon it that the old man eat and drink something this seemed to strengthen uncle barney greatly and he arose to his feet  now well get after those rascals he said with something of the oldtime fire in his eyes im not going to allow em to rob me in this fashion  while the old lumberman had been eating the rover boys had glanced around the cave curiously it was a place partly natural and partly artificial on one side it looked as if a little mining had been done and jack who had studied geology gazed at the surface of rocks and dirt with much interest  why uncle barney this looks to me as if it was zinc ore he cried presently  hush hush boy i dont want anybody to know about that answered the old man quickly  then it is zinc ore is it queried randy who had also been inspecting a side of the cave  yes if you must know was the surprising reply right here in the middle of this island is one of the most valuable zinc ore beds to be found anywhere     chapter xxix  the discovery   the trouble is those rascals have a twentyfour hours start of us remarked jack for all we know they may be miles away by this time  its too bad uncle barney didnt take our advice and either have those deeds recorded or else place them in some bank vault said fred  the thing now is to see if we can trail those fellows whoever they were put in randy  thats the talk cried his twin no use of crying over spilt milk as the cat said when she tipped the pan over into the well and at this remark there was a faint smile  the rovers had drawn to one side to talk over the situation while barney stevenson was preparing to accompany them from the cave the old man was both excited and worried he cared little about the wound he had received on the head all he wanted to do was to get back his treasure box as he called it  the little party soon reached the point where all had left their snowshoes they looked around with care and presently made out a trail leading toward the lake shore  if they went down to the lake they most likely skated away remarked fred  it was an easy matter to follow the trail through the snow it led up to the vicinity of some rough rocks and here turned southward  i guess they reasoned that they couldnt get over those rocks remarked uncle barney maybe they were afraid of a bad tumble i wish they had gone over them and broken their necks he added bitterly  if only they had dropped the treasure box in the snow murmured fred  no such luck for us fred responded jack im afraid that box and its precious contents are far away by this time  they continued to follow the footprints and at the end of a quarter of an hour found themselves at something of a clearing between the trees here those who had stolen the box had evidently stopped to rest for it could be seen where they had been seated on a fallen log and where they had placed the box  look here cried jack who was inspecting the ground closely just as i thoughtthose fellows were slugger and nappy i feel certain he pointed to several halfburnt matches and also a number of cigarette stubs  i guess youre right returned randy im quite sure asa lemm doesnt smoke cigarettes and when he was on the island mr brown was smoking a blacklooking cigar  well if those boys stole the box they will most likely turn it over to the professor and brown said uncle barney oh if only i could get my hands on them and his eyes flashed  the trail now led through a patch of woods and went into something of a semicircle then there was a little loop which caused the boys some perplexity but did not bother the old lumberman  they lost their waythats all explained uncle barney but after moving around in a loop they headed in this direction and he pointed with his hand come on maybe they got hopelessly lost further on and are still in the woods i hope so  the trail led deeper and deeper into the woods and wound in and out among a number of rocks it was plainly evident that slugger and nappy had lost their way and had made a number of false turns  here is where they rested again announced jack presently and showed where some rocks had been swept clear of the snow  yes and they stopped long enough to have something to eat added randy here are a crust of bread and some cake crumbs  the trail continued to wind in and out among the woods and the rovers and the old lumberman followed it for fully an hour longer then they came out on the eastern shore of the island  i guess this is the end of it announced uncle barney dismally they probably skated away from this point  no they didnt cried jack who was making an examination of the footprints they went down the lake shore  ill tell you what i think said randy they most likely wanted to get to rockville and they were afraid that if they attempted to cross to the other side of the island they would become lost again so instead of going across they went down to the lower end  here come two men cried randy suddenly he had been peering out on the surface of the lake  maybe they are professor lemm and mr brown suggested andy  the men were at a great distance but skating rapidly toward the island as they came closer jack saw that they were strangers and he waved his cap and shouted at them  they may have seen slugger and nappy or else they may have some news for us he said  as the two strangers came closer uncle barney looked at them curiously then he drew himself up and his face stiffened  dont you know those two men he questioned rather sharply turning to the boys  no answered jack and the others shook their heads  the man ahead is fred stevenson and the other is mr powell  oh is that so exclaimed jack and then without further ado he ran out on the ice to meet the newcomers  so this is jack rover eh said mr stevenson shaking hands warmly im glad to know you and i must thank you for sending me that telegram  i sincerely hope you can patch up your differences with old uncle barney answered jack quietly hes in a peck of trouble just now  why what has happened questioned ruths father but excuse me he added this is my friend mr powell  by this time the other rovers had come forward and all told the two men of what had taken place in the meantime uncle barney remained behind on the lake shore resting on his gun and eyeing the visitors speculatively  i wish you would all do me a favor said mr stevenson in a low tone of voice so that the old lumberman might not hear i wish you would give me a chance to speak to uncle barney alone  certainly well give you that chance mr stevenson answered jack readily we are after the two rascals who stole that treasure box tell uncle barney that we are going to continue the hunt while you are doing your talking maybe mr powell would like to go with us  certainly i dont want to interfere with this affair between these other men was the quick reply  leaving ruths father to talk matters over with the old lumberman the rover boys and mr powell began the journey down the side of snowshoe island as they proceeded the boys told the man many of the particulars of how professor lemm and mr brown accompanied by slugger and nappy had come to the island to take possession and then how the old lumberman had been attacked in the cave and how the precious blue tin box had been stolen  thats certainly carrying matters with a high hand was mr powells comment i sincerely trust the old man gets the box back if he doesnt it may cause him a great deal of trouble especially if those deeds have not been recorded since the old courthouse burnt down i remember well that that fire caused a great deal of trouble among property owners in this county  he told the boys that he and his wife and daughter may had been visiting the stevensons at the time the rovers telegram arrived he had left his wife and daughter to continue the visit and had accompanied mr stevenson on the trip just for the sake of a little outing  this quarrel between old uncle barney as he is called and the stevensons is all nonsense he declared flatly it could have been cleared up years ago if the old man would only have listened to reason but he was much upset by his financial losses and more upset when his wife died and he wouldnt listen to a word now that he is willing to talk i am sure they can patch it up  about a mile was covered and then the rovers and mr powell found where slugger and nappy had gone ashore again at a point where the island was quite low  ill wager they thought they could cross here with ease and thus save themselves the trouble of going around the south point said jack and in this surmise he was correct  once again the trail led into the woods and now it was fairly straight up to a point where the ground became rougher here they found the snow scattered around some rocks and rightly guessed that one of the youths had had a tumble  and i guess the tumble must have hurt some announced randy look at those footprints further on will you one of the fellows did a lot of limping  maybe he twisted his ankle or something like that cried andy  its too bad he didnt hurt himself so severely that he couldnt go any further grumbled fred  it wont be long now before we come out near that cabin where we stayed during that awful snowstorm said jack  it was now well along in the middle of the afternoon and the rovers rightly concluded that this point had not been reached by slugger and nappy until late the day before  if one of them was hurt they wouldnt want to skate away over to rockville in the dark said randy maybe they stayed on this island all night  there is that old cabin exclaimed fred as they reached a cleared space and could see some distance ahead  the little cabin was thickly surrounded by snow and looked very much as it had when they had left it but to their surprise not to say delight they saw a thin wreath of smoke curling up out of the chimney  somebody is there as sure as fate exclaimed jack  come on lets see who it is burst out randy  all hurried forward making no noise in the snow and soon reached the side of the cabin then jack who was in advance peered in through a corner of the brokenout window pulling aside the nailedup blanket for that purpose  the sight which met his gaze filled him with surprise and satisfaction on a rude couch at one side of the single room of which the structure boasted rested slugger brown his ankle tied up in a rude bandage in front of the fire sat nappy martell with the old lumbermans treasure box on his lap nappy had a knife in one hand and with the file blade was trying to file apart the padlock to the box     chapter xxx  settling accountsconclusion   how are you making out those outside the cabin heard slugger brown ask  its slow work with such a small file grumbled nappy martell if i had a big file i could get the padlock off in no time  whats the matter with smashing it off with a rock growled the bully he arose to his feet and hobbled to where his crony sat give it to meill soon have it off  come on whispered jack to his cousins and mr powell they are in there and trying to open the treasure box  it took the party but a few seconds to reach the door of the cabin jack pushed upon it to find the barrier locked in some manner from the inside  hello whos there shouted slugger  maybe its your father and professor lemm come back added nappy  the bully came to the door and threw it open when he found himself confronted by the rovers and a strange man he fell back in consternation  you he gasped howerdid you get here  you let us alone cried nappy in alarm and leaping to his feet he tried to hide the precious box behind him  so weve got you have we exclaimed jack nappy you hand over that box  ii dont know what you mean stammered the lad addressed  see here you havent any right to come in here in this fashion blustered slugger recovering somewhat from his surprise  havent we though broke out randy  weve caught you and we intend to make you suffer for what youve done said andy  as lame as he was slugger attempted to edge his way toward the door thinking he might get a chance to run away but jack caught him by the arm and sent him flying backward into a corner of the cabin  youll stay right where you are slugger brown declared the oldest rover boy dont you dare to run away  by this time randy and fred had approached nappy and suddenly the youngest rover darted behind the youth and snatched the blue tin box from his grasp  hi you give me that box stormed nappy youve no right to take it from me and then he too tried to run from the cabin he got as far as the doorway when andy put out his foot and sent him headlong into the snow outside then andy quickly sat down on him and rushing up randy did the same  dondont smash me spluttered nappy whose face was partly in the snow  were not going to let you get away came firmly from andy  lets tie his hands behind him and make him a prisoner suggested his twin and this the two boys proceeded to do using some skate straps for that purpose  in the meanwhile slugger attempted to draw a pistol but was promptly hurled back by jack and fred then mr powell disarmed the youth and he too was made a prisoner  youll catch it for treating us this way growled slugger when he realized that he could do no more just wait until my father hears of this  and just you wait slugger until mr stevenson gets here retorted jack and this answer made the bully turn pale  now that the two rascals had been captured the rover boys felt very much elated the more so since they had recovered uncle barneys treasure box without the contents having been disturbed  wont he be glad murmured fred as he looked the box over  lets go out and see if we cant signal to him in some way returned randy  he went outside and three shots were fired in rapid succession a signal which had been agreed upon when the boys had first gone out hunting after the signal had been given mr powell said he would go out and watch for the coming of the stevensons while he was doing this the rovers talked matters over with slugger and nappy  youre a fine pair to act in this fashion said jack sternly dont you know you might have killed barney stevenson  oh we didnt hurt him much grumbled slugger  and it was stealing to run off with this box said randy  no it wasnt that box has got deeds in it that ought to go to my father  i dont believe it slugger those deeds belong to barney stevenson  a minute or two later all those in the cabin heard mr powell give a shout  a couple of men are coming he cried  its my dad and professor lemm broke out slugger now you fellows will catch it  be on your guard everybody sang out jack to his cousins and each of them caught up his gun and waited  a few minutes later professor lemm and mr brown appeared in front of the cabin their arms were full of camp supplies evidently this place had been a rendezvous for the entire brown party for several days it was from here that slugger and nappy had gone up to the other end of the island to spy upon uncle barney  what is the meaning of this demanded mr brown when he found himself confronted by the rovers  it means that we have made your son and nappy martell prisoners explained jack calmly  prisoners  yes and i think more than likely well have to hand them over to the authorities  i dont understand this at all put in asa lemm and his voice trembled a little  mr powell had now come up and the rovers told him who the men were he at once took charge of matters  this is a serious business mr brown he said sternly your son and this other young man attacked old barney stevenson in a most outrageous manner and robbed him of a box of valuables what mr stevenson will do in the matter i dont know i expect him here very shortly  at once there was a wordy quarrel mr brown showing his temper in anything but a dignified manner he wanted his son and nappy released and threatened all sorts of things but all to no purpose mr powell was obdurate and the rovers kept themselves in readiness to use their firearms should the occasion require asa lemm had little to say  the discussion was growing exceedingly warm when there came another interruption and uncle barney followed by frederic stevenson burst into the cabin the old lumberman gazed at the assembled crowd and then at the rovers  my box did you find my box he questioned quickly  yes uncle barney weve got the box safe and sound answered jack and handed it over  did those young rascals have it and uncle barney pointed to slugger and nappy  yes and that fellow was trying to file away the padlock when we got here  you whelps you cried the old lumberman his eyes blazing and as he strode toward slugger and nappy they shrank back as far as the corner of the cabin permitted  dont you hit medont you dare howled the bully  ii didnt mean anything by it whined nappy he was now thoroughly cowed  another war of words followed and the discussion grew even hotter than before again mr brown threatened all sorts of things but uncle barney simply laughed at him then frederic stevenson took a hand  uncle barney he said catching the old man by the shoulder you let me manage this for you will you  all right fred you do as you pleaseonly they cant have snowshoe island was the old mans answer evidently the long standing differences between the pair had been patched up at last  what ive got to say i can say in very few words came from ruths father as he confronted mr brown and professor lemm you have tried to carry matters here with a high hand and the result has been that you have laid yourselves liable to a suit at law while those two young rascals are liable to go to prison  oh dad dont let them have us arrested pleaded slugger  i dont want to bother with the lawi want to be left alone said uncle barney in a low voice  this island belongs to my relative heremr barnard stevenson proceeded ruths father he has a free and clear title to it as i well know i understand something of your underhanded work brown and i understand too how you and professor lemm found out that this island contained some very valuable zinc ore beds but your scheme to gain possession of this place has fallen through  dont be so sure of that snarled sluggers father  i am sure of it unless you leave my relative here alone you are going to get yourself into pretty hot water and not only thatif you bother him again ill see to it that your son and that other young man are sent to prison for what they have done  say will you let us go if my dad gives up his claim to the island broke in slugger eagerly  if your father and professor lemm will promise never to bother barnard stevenson in the future i think hell be willing to let this case against you drop  all right then dad lets do that we dont want the old island anyhow  you cant do anything without those deeds added nappy  shut up you boys make me sick grunted mr brown  but martell is rightwe cant do anything without the deeds whispered professor lemm he was growing more fearful every moment over the outcome of what had taken place  more words followed but in the end mr brown and professor lemm promised to let their socalled claim on snowshoe island drop then slugger and nappy were released and all were told to take their departure as soon as possible  you think youre smart dont you grumbled slugger to jack when he was ready to go you just wait jack rover im not going to forget you and your cousins in a hurry  and i wont forget you either added nappy martell  what these two unworthies did in the future to worry the rovers will be told in another volume to be entitled the rover boys under canvas or the mystery of the wrecked submarine in that volume we shall meet many of our old friends again and learn the particulars of some outoftheordinary happenings  well im mighty glad theyre gone said fred after the visitors had disappeared in the distance  glad doesnt express it added andy i could fairly dance a jig for joy  and to think we saved the treasure box broke in jack  thats the best of all came from randy  old uncle barney was exceedingly happy not only to have the box restored to him but also because the trouble between himself and his relatives had been completely cleared away  i guess i was something of an old fool to quarrel with fred and his family he remarked to jack later on when talking the matter over it shows that a man should not be too hasty and headstrong if i had only listened in the first place all this would never have happened  im glad youre friends once more said jack  i owe you boys a great deal for this just as i owe you a great deal for saving the treasure box and saving my life in the woods that time answered the old lumberman with feeling  the next day was spent by uncle barney and mr stevenson in going over the matter of the deeds ruths father insisted upon it that they be duly recorded and then placed away in a bank vault it may be added here that later on this was done and later still the zinc ore beds on the island were opened up and found to be fully as valuable as anticipated old uncle barney became quite a rich man and took up his home with the other stevensons  while the stevensons were consulting about the deeds the rover boys went out on another hunt this time accompanied by mr powell who was quite a sportsman they had considerable luck bringing in over a dozen rabbits four squirrels and several partridges  and now weve got to get ready to go home said jack a day or two later  yes and get ready for the grind at colby hall added fred  but weve had some dandy times on this island declared andy  couldnt have been
