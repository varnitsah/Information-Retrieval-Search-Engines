65138376	the mayor of casterbridge  by thomas hardy     1   one evening of late summer before the nineteenth century had reached onethird of its span a young man and woman the latter carrying a child were approaching the large village of weydonpriors in upper wessex on foot they were plainly but not ill clad though the thick hoar of dust which had accumulated on their shoes and garments from an obviously long journey lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their appearance just now  the man was of fine figure swarthy and stern in aspect and he showed in profile a facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost perpendicular he wore a short jacket of brown corduroy newer than the remainder of his suit which was a fustian waistcoat with white horn buttons breeches of the same tanned leggings and a straw hat overlaid with black glazed canvas at his back he carried by a looped strap a rush basket from which protruded at one end the crutch of a hayknife a wimble for haybonds being also visible in the aperture his measured springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from the desultory shamble of the general labourer while in the turn and plant of each foot there was further a dogged and cynical indifference personal to himself showing its presence even in the regularly interchanging fustian folds now in the left leg now in the right as he paced along  what was really peculiar however in this couples progress and would have attracted the attention of any casual observer otherwise disposed to overlook them was the perfect silence they preserved they walked side by side in such a way as to suggest afar off the low easy confidential chat of people full of reciprocity but on closer view it could be discerned that the man was reading or pretending to read a ballad sheet which he kept before his eyes with some difficulty by the hand that was passed through the basket strap whether this apparent cause were the real cause or whether it were an assumed one to escape an intercourse that would have been irksome to him nobody but himself could have said precisely but his taciturnity was unbroken and the woman enjoyed no society whatever from his presence virtually she walked the highway alone save for the child she bore sometimes the mans bent elbow almost touched her shoulder for she kept as close to his side as was possible without actual contact but she seemed to have no idea of taking his arm nor he of offering it and far from exhibiting surprise at his ignoring silence she appeared to receive it as a natural thing if any word at all were uttered by the little group it was an occasional whisper of the woman to the childa tiny girl in short clothes and blue boots of knitted yarnand the murmured babble of the child in reply  the chiefalmost the onlyattraction of the young womans face was its mobility when she looked down sideways to the girl she became pretty and even handsome particularly that in the action her features caught slantwise the rays of the strongly coloured sun which made transparencies of her eyelids and nostrils and set fire on her lips when she plodded on in the shade of the hedge silently thinking she had the hard halfapathetic expression of one who deems anything possible at the hands of time and chance except perhaps fair play the first phase was the work of nature the second probably of civilization  that the man and woman were husband and wife and the parents of the girl in arms there could be little doubt no other than such relationship would have accounted for the atmosphere of stale familiarity which the trio carried along with them like a nimbus as they moved down the road  the wife mostly kept her eyes fixed ahead though with little interestthe scene for that matter being one that might have been matched at almost any spot in any county in england at this time of the year a road neither straight nor crooked neither level nor hilly bordered by hedges trees and other vegetation which had entered the blackenedgreen stage of colour that the doomed leaves pass through on their way to dingy and yellow and red the grassy margin of the bank and the nearest hedgerow boughs were powdered by the dust that had been stirred over them by hasty vehicles the same dust as it lay on the road deadening their footfalls like a carpet and this with the aforesaid total absence of conversation allowed every extraneous sound to be heard  for a long time there was none beyond the voice of a weak bird singing a trite old evening song that might doubtless have been heard on the hill at the same hour and with the selfsame trills quavers and breves at any sunset of that season for centuries untold but as they approached the village sundry distant shouts and rattles reached their ears from some elevated spot in that direction as yet screened from view by foliage when the outlying houses of weydonpriors could just be described the family group was met by a turniphoer with his hoe on his shoulder and his dinnerbag suspended from it the reader promptly glanced up  any trade doing here he asked phlegmatically designating the village in his van by a wave of the broadsheet and thinking the labourer did not understand him he added anything in the haytrussing line  the turniphoer had already begun shaking his head why save the man what wisdoms in him that a should come to weydon for a job of that sort this time o year  then is there any house to leta little small new cottage just a builded or such like asked the other  the pessimist still maintained a negative pulling down is more the nater of weydon there were five houses cleared away last year and three this and the volk nowhere to gono not so much as a thatched hurdle thats the way o weydonpriors  the haytrusser which he obviously was nodded with some superciliousness looking towards the village he continued there is something going on here however is there not  ay tis fair day though what you hear now is little more than the clatter and scurry of getting away the money o children and fools for the real business is done earlier than this ive been working within sound ot all day but i didnt go upnot i twas no business of mine  the trusser and his family proceeded on their way and soon entered the fairfield which showed standingplaces and pens where many hundreds of horses and sheep had been exhibited and sold in the forenoon but were now in great part taken away at present as their informant had observed but little real business remained on hand the chief being the sale by auction of a few inferior animals that could not otherwise be disposed of and had been absolutely refused by the better class of traders who came and went early yet the crowd was denser now than during the morning hours the frivolous contingent of visitors including journeymen out for a holiday a stray soldier or two come on furlough village shopkeepers and the like having latterly flocked in persons whose activities found a congenial field among the peepshows toystands waxworks inspired monsters disinterested medical men who travelled for the public good thimbleriggers nicknack vendors and readers of fate  neither of our pedestrians had much heart for these things and they looked around for a refreshment tent among the many which dotted the down two which stood nearest to them in the ochreous haze of expiring sunlight seemed almost equally inviting one was formed of new milkhued canvas and bore red flags on its summit it announced good homebrewed beer ale and cyder the other was less new a little iron stovepipe came out of it at the back and in front appeared the placard good furmity sold hear the man mentally weighed the two inscriptions and inclined to the former tent  nonothe other one said the woman i always like furmity and so does elizabethjane and so will you it is nourishing after a long hard day  ive never tasted it said the man however he gave way to her representations and they entered the furmity booth forthwith  a rather numerous company appeared within seated at the long narrow tables that ran down the tent on each side at the upper end stood a stove containing a charcoal fire over which hung a large threelegged crock sufficiently polished round the rim to show that it was made of bellmetal a haggish creature of about fifty presided in a white apron which as it threw an air of respectability over her as far as it extended was made so wide as to reach nearly round her waist she slowly stirred the contents of the pot the dull scrape of her large spoon was audible throughout the tent as she thus kept from burning the mixture of corn in the grain flour milk raisins currants and what not that composed the antiquated slop in which she dealt vessels holding the separate ingredients stood on a whiteclothed table of boards and trestles close by  the young man and woman ordered a basin each of the mixture steaming hot and sat down to consume it at leisure this was very well so far for furmity as the woman had said was nourishing and as proper a food as could be obtained within the four seas though to those not accustomed to it the grains of wheat swollen as large as lemonpips which floated on its surface might have a deterrent effect at first  but there was more in that tent than met the cursory glance and the man with the instinct of a perverse character scented it quickly after a mincing attack on his bowl he watched the hags proceedings from the corner of his eye and saw the game she played he winked to her and passed up his basin in reply to her nod when she took a bottle from under the table slily measured out a quantity of its contents and tipped the same into the mans furmity the liquor poured in was rum the man as slily sent back money in payment  he found the concoction thus strongly laced much more to his satisfaction than it had been in its natural state his wife had observed the proceeding with much uneasiness but he persuaded her to have hers laced also and she agreed to a milder allowance after some misgiving  the man finished his basin and called for another the rum being signalled for in yet stronger proportion the effect of it was soon apparent in his manner and his wife but too sadly perceived that in strenuously steering off the rocks of the licensed liquortent she had only got into maelstrom depths here amongst the smugglers  the child began to prattle impatiently and the wife more than once said to her husband michael how about our lodging you know we may have trouble in getting it if we dont go soon  but he turned a deaf ear to those birdlike chirpings he talked loud to the company the childs black eyes after slow round ruminating gazes at the candles when they were lighted fell together then they opened then shut again and she slept  at the end of the first basin the man had risen to serenity at the second he was jovial at the third argumentative at the fourth the qualities signified by the shape of his face the occasional clench of his mouth and the fiery spark of his dark eye began to tell in his conduct he was overbearingeven brilliantly quarrelsome  the conversation took a high turn as it often does on such occasions the ruin of good men by bad wives and more particularly the frustration of many a promising youths high aims and hopes and the extinction of his energies by an early imprudent marriage was the theme  i did for myself that way thoroughly said the trusser with a contemplative bitterness that was wellnight resentful i married at eighteen like the fool that i was and this is the consequence ot he pointed at himself and family with a wave of the hand intended to bring out the penuriousness of the exhibition  the young woman his wife who seemed accustomed to such remarks acted as if she did not hear them and continued her intermittent private words of tender trifles to the sleeping and waking child who was just big enough to be placed for a moment on the bench beside her when she wished to ease her arms the man continued  i havent more than fifteen shillings in the world and yet i am a good experienced hand in my line id challenge england to beat me in the fodder business and if i were a free man again id be worth a thousand pound before id done ot but a fellow never knows these little things till all chance of acting upon em is past  the auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be heard saying now this is the last lotnow wholl take the last lot for a song shall i say forty shillings tis a very promising broodmare a trifle over five years old and nothing the matter with the hoss at all except that shes a little holler in the back and had her left eye knocked out by the kick of another her own sister coming along the road  for my part i dont see why men who have got wives and dont want em shouldnt get rid of em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses said the man in the tent why shouldnt they put em up and sell em by auction to men who are in need of such articles hey why begad id sell mine this minute if anybody would buy her  theres them that would do that some of the guests replied looking at the woman who was by no means illfavoured  true said a smoking gentleman whose coat had the fine polish about the collar elbows seams and shoulderblades that longcontinued friction with grimy surfaces will produce and which is usually more desired on furniture than on clothes from his appearance he had possibly been in former time groom or coachman to some neighbouring county family ive had my breedings in as good circles i may say as any man he added and i know true cultivation or nobody do and i can declare shes got itin the bone mind ye i sayas much as any female in the fairthough it may want a little bringing out then crossing his legs he resumed his pipe with a nicelyadjusted gaze at a point in the air  the fuddled young husband stared for a few seconds at this unexpected praise of his wife half in doubt of the wisdom of his own attitude towards the possessor of such qualities but he speedily lapsed into his former conviction and said harshly  well then now is your chance i am open to an offer for this gem o creation  she turned to her husband and murmured michael you have talked this nonsense in public places before a joke is a joke but you may make it once too often mind  i know ive said it before i meant it all i want is a buyer  at the moment a swallow one among the last of the season which had by chance found its way through an opening into the upper part of the tent flew to and from quick curves above their heads causing all eyes to follow it absently in watching the bird till it made its escape the assembled company neglected to respond to the workmans offer and the subject dropped  but a quarter of an hour later the man who had gone on lacing his furmity more and more heavily though he was either so strongminded or such an intrepid toper that he still appeared fairly sober recurred to the old strain as in a musical fantasy the instrument fetches up the original theme herei am waiting to know about this offer of mine the woman is no good to me wholl have her  the company had by this time decidedly degenerated and the renewed inquiry was received with a laugh of appreciation the woman whispered she was imploring and anxious come come it is getting dark and this nonsense wont do if you dont come along i shall go without you come  she waited and waited yet he did not move in ten minutes the man broke in upon the desultory conversation of the furmity drinkers with i asked this question and nobody answered to t will any jack rag or tom straw among ye buy my goods  the womans manner changed and her face assumed the grim shape and colour of which mention has been made  mike mike she said this is getting serious otoo serious  will anybody buy her said the man  i wish somebody would said she firmly her present owner is not at all to her liking  nor you to mine said he so we are agreed about that gentlemen you hear its an agreement to part she shall take the girl if she wants to and go her ways ill take my tools and go my ways tis simple as scripture history now then stand up susan and show yourself  dont my chiel whispered a buxom staylace dealer in voluminous petticoats who sat near the woman yer good man dont know what hes saying  the woman however did stand up now whos auctioneer cried the haytrusser  i be promptly answered a short man with a nose resembling a copper knob a damp voice and eyes like buttonholes wholl make an offer for this lady  the woman looked on the ground as if she maintained her position by a supreme effort of will  five shillings said someone at which there was a laugh  no insults said the husband wholl say a guinea  nobody answered and the female dealer in staylaces interposed  behave yerself moral good man for heavens love ah what a cruelty is the poor soul married to bed and board is dear at some figures pon my vation tis  set it higher auctioneer said the trusser  two guineas said the auctioneer and no one replied  if they dont take her for that in ten seconds theyll have to give more said the husband very well now auctioneer add another  three guineasgoing for three guineas said the rheumy man  no bid said the husband good lord why shes cost me fifty times the money if a penny go on  four guineas cried the auctioneer  ill tell ye whati wont sell her for less than five said the husband bringing down his fist so that the basins danced ill sell her for five guineas to any man that will pay me the money and treat her well and he shall have her for ever and never hear aught o me but she shant go for less now thenfive guineasand shes yours susan you agree  she bowed her head with absolute indifference  five guineas said the auctioneer or shell be withdrawn do anybody give it the last time yes or no  yes said a loud voice from the doorway  all eyes were turned standing in the triangular opening which formed the door of the tent was a sailor who unobserved by the rest had arrived there within the last two or three minutes a dead silence followed his affirmation  you say you do asked the husband staring at him  i say so replied the sailor  saying is one thing and paying is another wheres the money  the sailor hesitated a moment looked anew at the woman came in unfolded five crisp pieces of paper and threw them down upon the tablecloth they were bankofengland notes for five pounds upon the face of this he clinked down the shillings severallyone two three four five  the sight of real money in full amount in answer to a challenge for the same till then deemed slightly hypothetical had a great effect upon the spectators their eyes became riveted upon the faces of the chief actors and then upon the notes as they lay weighted by the shillings on the table  up to this moment it could not positively have been asserted that the man in spite of his tantalizing declaration was really in earnest the spectators had indeed taken the proceedings throughout as a piece of mirthful irony carried to extremes and had assumed that being out of work he was as a consequence out of temper with the world and society and his nearest kin but with the demand and response of real cash the jovial frivolity of the scene departed a lurid colour seemed to fill the tent and change the aspect of all therein the mirthwrinkles left the listeners faces and they waited with parting lips  now said the woman breaking the silence so that her low dry voice sounded quite loud before you go further michael listen to me if you touch that money i and this girl go with the man mind it is a joke no longer  a joke of course it is not a joke shouted her husband his resentment rising at her suggestion i take the money the sailor takes you thats plain enough it has been done elsewhereand why not here  tis quite on the understanding that the young woman is willing said the sailor blandly i wouldnt hurt her feelings for the world  faith nor i said her husband but she is willing provided she can have the child she said so only the other day when i talked ot  that you swear said the sailor to her  i do said she after glancing at her husbands face and seeing no repentance there  very well she shall have the child and the bargains complete said the trusser he took the sailors notes and deliberately folded them and put them with the shillings in a high remote pocket with an air of finality  the sailor looked at the woman and smiled come along he said kindly the little one toothe more the merrier she paused for an instant with a close glance at him then dropping her eyes again and saying nothing she took up the child and followed him as he made towards the door on reaching it she turned and pulling off her weddingring flung it across the booth in the haytrussers face  mike she said ive lived with thee a couple of years and had nothing but temper now im no more to ee ill try my luck elsewhere twill be better for me and elizabethjane both so goodbye  seizing the sailors arm with her right hand and mounting the little girl on her left she went out of the tent sobbing bitterly  a stolid look of concern filled the husbands face as if after all he had not quite anticipated this ending and some of the guests laughed  is she gone he said  faith ay shes gone clane enough said some rustics near the door  he rose and walked to the entrance with the careful tread of one conscious of his alcoholic load some others followed and they stood looking into the twilight the difference between the peacefulness of inferior nature and the wilful hostilities of mankind was very apparent at this place in contrast with the harshness of the act just ended within the tent was the sight of several horses crossing their necks and rubbing each other lovingly as they waited in patience to be harnessed for the homeward journey outside the fair in the valleys and woods all was quiet the sun had recently set and the west heaven was hung with rosy cloud which seemed permanent yet slowly changed to watch it was like looking at some grand feat of stagery from a darkened auditorium in presence of this scene after the other there was a natural instinct to abjure man as the blot on an otherwise kindly universe till it was remembered that all terrestrial conditions were intermittent and that mankind might some night be innocently sleeping when these quiet objects were raging loud  where do the sailor live asked a spectator when they had vainly gazed around  god knows that replied the man who had seen high life hes without doubt a stranger here  he came in about five minutes ago said the furmity woman joining the rest with her hands on her hips and then a stepped back and then a looked in again im not a penny the better for him  serves the husband well beright said the staylace vendor a comely respectable body like herwhat can a man want more i glory in the womans sperrit id ha done it myselfod send if i wouldnt if a husband had behaved so to me id go and a might call and call till his keacorn was raw but id never come backno not till the great trumpet would i  well the woman will be better off said another of a more deliberative turn for seafaring natures be very good shelter for shorn lambs and the man do seem to have plenty of money which is what shes not been used to lately by all showings  mark meill not go after her said the trusser returning doggedly to his seat let her go if shes up to such vagaries she must suffer for em shed no business to take the maidtis my maid and if it were the doing again she shouldnt have her  perhaps from some little sense of having countenanced an indefensible proceeding perhaps because it was late the customers thinned away from the tent shortly after this episode the man stretched his elbows forward on the table leant his face upon his arms and soon began to snore the furmity seller decided to close for the night and after seeing the rumbottles milk corn raisins etc that remained on hand loaded into the cart came to where the man reclined she shook him but could not wake him as the tent was not to be struck that night the fair continuing for two or three days she decided to let the sleeper who was obviously no tramp stay where he was and his basket with him extinguishing the last candle and lowering the flap of the tent she left it and drove away     2   the morning sun was streaming through the crevices of the canvas when the man awoke a warm glow pervaded the whole atmosphere of the marquee and a single big blue fly buzzed musically round and round it besides the buzz of the fly there was not a sound he looked aboutat the benchesat the table supported by trestlesat his basket of toolsat the stove where the furmity had been boiledat the empty basinsat some shed grains of wheatat the corks which dotted the grassy floor among the odds and ends he discerned a little shining object and picked it up it was his wifes ring  a confused picture of the events of the previous evening seemed to come back to him and he thrust his hand into his breastpocket a rustling revealed the sailors banknotes thrust carelessly in  this second verification of his dim memories was enough he knew now they were not dreams he remained seated looking on the ground for some time i must get out of this as soon as i can he said deliberately at last with the air of one who could not catch his thoughts without pronouncing them shes goneto be sure she isgone with that sailor who bought her and little elizabethjane we walked here and i had the furmity and rum in itand sold her yes thats whats happened and here am i now what am i to doam i sober enough to walk i wonder he stood up found that he was in fairly good condition for progress unencumbered next he shouldered his tool basket and found he could carry it then lifting the tent door he emerged into the open air  here the man looked around with gloomy curiosity the freshness of the september morning inspired and braced him as he stood he and his family had been weary when they arrived the night before and they had observed but little of the place so that he now beheld it as a new thing it exhibited itself as the top of an open down bounded on one extreme by a plantation and approached by a winding road at the bottom stood the village which lent its name to the upland and the annual fair that was held thereon the spot stretched downward into valleys and onward to other uplands dotted with barrows and trenched with the remains of prehistoric forts the whole scene lay under the rays of a newly risen sun which had not as yet dried a single blade of the heavily dewed grass whereon the shadows of the yellow and red vans were projected far away those thrown by the felloe of each wheel being elongated in shape to the orbit of a comet all the gipsies and showmen who had remained on the ground lay snug within their carts and tents or wrapped in horsecloths under them and were silent and still as death with the exception of an occasional snore that revealed their presence but the seven sleepers had a dog and dogs of the mysterious breeds that vagrants own that are as much like cats as dogs and as much like foxes as cats also lay about here a little one started up under one of the carts barked as a matter of principle and quickly lay down again he was the only positive spectator of the haytrussers exit from the weydon fairfield  this seemed to accord with his desire he went on in silent thought unheeding the yellowhammers which flitted about the hedges with straws in their bills the crowns of the mushrooms and the tinkling of local sheepbells whose wearer had had the good fortune not to be included in the fair when he reached a lane a good mile from the scene of the previous evening the man pitched his basket and leant upon a gate a difficult problem or two occupied his mind  did i tell my name to anybody last night or didnt i tell my name he said to himself and at last concluded that he did not his general demeanour was enough to show how he was surprised and nettled that his wife had taken him so literallyas much could be seen in his face and in the way he nibbled a straw which he pulled from the hedge he knew that she must have been somewhat excited to do this moreover she must have believed that there was some sort of binding force in the transaction on this latter point he felt almost certain knowing her freedom from levity of character and the extreme simplicity of her intellect there may too have been enough recklessness and resentment beneath her ordinary placidity to make her stifle any momentary doubts on a previous occasion when he had declared during a fuddle that he would dispose of her as he had done she had replied that she would not hear him say that many times more before it happened in the resigned tones of a fatalist yet she knows i am not in my senses when i do that he exclaimed well i must walk about till i find herseize her why didnt she know better than bring me into this disgrace he roared out she wasnt queer if i was tis like susan to show such idiotic simplicity meekthat meekness has done me more harm than the bitterest temper  when he was calmer he turned to his original conviction that he must somehow find her and his little elizabethjane and put up with the shame as best he could it was of his own making and he ought to bear it but first he resolved to register an oath a greater oath than he had ever sworn before and to do it properly he required a fit place and imagery for there was something fetichistic in this mans beliefs  he shouldered his basket and moved on casting his eyes inquisitively round upon the landscape as he walked and at the distance of three or four miles perceived the roofs of a village and the tower of a church he instantly made towards the latter object the village was quite still it being that motionless hour of rustic daily life which fills the interval between the departure of the fieldlabourers to their work and the rising of their wives and daughters to prepare the breakfast for their return hence he reached the church without observation and the door being only latched he entered the haytrusser deposited his basket by the font went up the nave till he reached the altarrails and opening the gate entered the sacrarium where he seemed to feel a sense of the strangeness for a moment then he knelt upon the footpace dropping his head upon the clamped book which lay on the communiontable he said aloud  i michael henchard on this morning of the sixteenth of september do take an oath before god here in this solemn place that i will avoid all strong liquors for the space of twentyone years to come being a year for every year that i have lived and this i swear upon the book before me and may i be strook dumb blind and helpless if i break this my oath  when he had said it and kissed the big book the haytrusser arose and seemed relieved at having made a start in a new direction while standing in the porch a moment he saw a thick jet of wood smoke suddenly start up from the red chimney of a cottage near and knew that the occupant had just lit her fire he went round to the door and the housewife agreed to prepare him some breakfast for a trifling payment which was done then he started on the search for his wife and child  the perplexing nature of the undertaking became apparent soon enough though he examined and inquired and walked hither and thither day after day no such characters as those he described had anywhere been seen since the evening of the fair to add to the difficulty he could gain no sound of the sailors name as money was short with him he decided after some hesitation to spend the sailors money in the prosecution of this search but it was equally in vain the truth was that a certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented michael henchard from following up the investigation with the loud hueandcry such a pursuit demanded to render it effectual and it was probably for this reason that he obtained no clue though everything was done by him that did not involve an explanation of the circumstances under which he had lost her  weeks counted up to months and still he searched on maintaining himself by small jobs of work in the intervals by this time he had arrived at a seaport and there he derived intelligence that persons answering somewhat to his description had emigrated a little time before then he said he would search no longer and that he would go and settle in the district which he had had for some time in his mind  next day he started journeying southwestward and did not pause except for nights lodgings till he reached the town of casterbridge in a far distant part of wessex     3   the highroad into the village of weydonpriors was again carpeted with dust the trees had put on as of yore their aspect of dingy green and where the henchard family of three had once walked along two persons not unconnected with the family walked now  the scene in its broad aspect had so much of its previous character even to the voices and rattle from the neighbouring village down that it might for that matter have been the afternoon following the previously recorded episode change was only to be observed in details but here it was obvious that a long procession of years had passed by one of the two who walked the road was she who had figured as the young wife of henchard on the previous occasion now her face had lost much of its rotundity her skin had undergone a textural change and though her hair had not lost colour it was considerably thinner than heretofore she was dressed in the mourning clothes of a widow her companion also in black appeared as a wellformed young woman about eighteen completely possessed of that ephemeral precious essence youth which is itself beauty irrespective of complexion or contour  a glance was sufficient to inform the eye that this was susan henchards grownup daughter while lifes middle summer had set its hardening mark on the mothers face her former springlike specialities were transferred so dexterously by time to the second figure her child that the absence of certain facts within her mothers knowledge from the girls mind would have seemed for the moment to one reflecting on those facts to be a curious imperfection in natures powers of continuity  they walked with joined hands and it could be perceived that this was the act of simple affection the daughter carried in her outer hand a withy basket of oldfashioned make the mother a blue bundle which contrasted oddly with her black stuff gown  reaching the outskirts of the village they pursued the same track as formerly and ascended to the fair here too it was evident that the years had told certain mechanical improvements might have been noticed in the roundabouts and highfliers machines for testing rustic strength and weight and in the erections devoted to shooting for nuts but the real business of the fair had considerably dwindled the new periodical great markets of neighbouring towns were beginning to interfere seriously with the trade carried on here for centuries the pens for sheep the tieropes for horses were about half as long as they had been the stalls of tailors hosiers coopers linendrapers and other such trades had almost disappeared and the vehicles were far less numerous the mother and daughter threaded the crowd for some little distance and then stood still  why did we hinder our time by coming in here i thought you wished to get onward said the maiden  yes my dear elizabethjane explained the other but i had a fancy for looking up here  why  it was here i first met with newsonon such a day as this  first met with father here yes you have told me so before and now hes drowned and gone from us as she spoke the girl drew a card from her pocket and looked at it with a sigh it was edged with black and inscribed within a design resembling a mural tablet were the words in affectionate memory of richard newson mariner who was unfortunately lost at sea in the month of november 184 aged fortyone years  and it was here continued her mother with more hesitation that i last saw the relation we are going to look formr michael henchard  what is his exact kin to us mother i have never clearly had it told me  he is or wasfor he may be deada connection by marriage said her mother deliberately  thats exactly what you have said a score of times before replied the young woman looking about her inattentively hes not a near relation i suppose  not by any means  he was a haytrusser wasnt he when you last heard of him  he was  i suppose he never knew me the girl innocently continued  mrs henchard paused for a moment and answered uneasily of course not elizabethjane but come this way she moved on to another part of the field  it is not much use inquiring here for anybody i should think the daughter observed as she gazed round about people at fairs change like the leaves of trees and i daresay you are the only one here today who was here all those years ago  i am not so sure of that said mrs newson as she now called herself keenly eyeing something under a green bank a little way off see there  the daughter looked in the direction signified the object pointed out was a tripod of sticks stuck into the earth from which hung a threelegged crock kept hot by a smouldering wood fire beneath over the pot stooped an old woman haggard wrinkled and almost in rags she stirred the contents of the pot with a large spoon and occasionally croaked in a broken voice good furmity sold here  it was indeed the former mistress of the furmity tentonce thriving cleanly whiteaproned and chinking with moneynow tentless dirty owning no tables or benches and having scarce any customers except two small whitybrown boys who came up and asked for a haporth pleasegood measure which she served in a couple of chipped yellow basins of commonest clay  she was here at that time resumed mrs newson making a step as if to draw nearer  dont speak to herit isnt respectable urged the other  i will just say a wordyou elizabethjane can stay here  the girl was not loth and turned to some stalls of coloured prints while her mother went forward the old woman begged for the latters custom as soon as she saw her and responded to mrs henchardnewsons request for a pennyworth with more alacrity than she had shown in selling sixpennyworths in her younger days when the soidisant widow had taken the basin of thin poor slop that stood for the rich concoction of the former time the hag opened a little basket behind the fire and looking up slily whispered just a thought o rum in itsmuggled you knowsay two pennorthtwill make it slip down like cordial  her customer smiled bitterly at this survival of the old trick and shook her head with a meaning the old woman was far from translating she pretended to eat a little of the furmity with the leaden spoon offered and as she did so said blandly to the hag youve seen better days  ah maamwell ye may say it responded the old woman opening the sluices of her heart forthwith ive stood in this fairground maid wife and widow these nineandthirty years and in that time have known what it was to do business with the richest stomachs in the land maam youd hardly believe that i was once the owner of a great paviliontent that was the attraction of the fair nobody could come nobody could go without having a dish of mrs goodenoughs furmity i knew the clergys taste the dandy gents taste i knew the towns taste the countrys taste i even knowed the taste of the coarse shameless females but lords my lifethe worlds no memory straightforward dealings dont bring profittis the sly and the underhand that get on in these times  mrs newson glanced roundher daughter was still bending over the distant stalls can you call to mind she said cautiously to the old woman the sale of a wife by her husband in your tent eighteen years ago today  the hag reflected and half shook her head if it had been a big thing i should have minded it in a moment she said i can mind every serious fight o married parties every murder every manslaughter even every pocketpickingleastwise large onesthat t has been my lot to witness but a selling was it done quietlike  well yes i think so  the furmity woman half shook her head again and yet she said i do at any rate i can mind a man doing something o the sorta man in a cord jacket with a basket of tools but lord bless ye we dont gie it headroom we dont such as that the only reason why i can mind the man is that he came back here to the next years fair and told me quite privatelike that if a woman ever asked for him i was to say he had gone towherecasterbridgeyesto casterbridge said he but lords my life i shouldnt ha thought of it again  mrs newson would have rewarded the old woman as far as her small means afforded had she not discreetly borne in mind that it was by that unscrupulous persons liquor her husband had been degraded she briefly thanked her informant and rejoined elizabeth who greeted her with mother do lets get onit was hardly respectable for you to buy refreshments there i see none but the lowest do  i have learned what i wanted however said her mother quietly the last time our relative visited this fair he said he was living at casterbridge it is a long long way from here and it was many years ago that he said it but there i think well go  with this they descended out of the fair and went onward to the village where they obtained a nights lodging     4   henchards wife acted for the best but she had involved herself in difficulties a hundred times she had been upon the point of telling her daughter elizabethjane the true story of her life the tragical crisis of which had been the transaction at weydon fair when she was not much older than the girl now beside her but she had refrained an innocent maiden had thus grown up in the belief that the relations between the genial sailor and her mother were the ordinary ones that they had always appeared to be the risk of endangering a childs strong affection by disturbing ideas which had grown with her growth was to mrs henchard too fearful a thing to contemplate it had seemed indeed folly to think of making elizabethjane wise  but susan henchards fear of losing her dearly loved daughters heart by a revelation had little to do with any sense of wrongdoing on her own part her simplicitythe original ground of henchards contempt for herhad allowed her to live on in the conviction that newson had acquired a morally real and justifiable right to her by his purchasethough the exact bearings and legal limits of that right were vague it may seem strange to sophisticated minds that a sane young matron could believe in the seriousness of such a transfer and were there not numerous other instances of the same belief the thing might scarcely be credited but she was by no means the first or last peasant woman who had religiously adhered to her purchaser as too many rural records show  the history of susan henchards adventures in the interim can be told in two or three sentences absolutely helpless she had been taken off to canada where they had lived several years without any great worldly success though she worked as hard as any woman could to keep their cottage cheerful and wellprovided when elizabethjane was about twelve years old the three returned to england and settled at falmouth where newson made a living for a few years as boatman and general handy shoreman  he then engaged in the newfoundland trade and it was during this period that susan had an awakening a friend to whom she confided her history ridiculed her grave acceptance of her position and all was over with her peace of mind when newson came home at the end of one winter he saw that the delusion he had so carefully sustained had vanished for ever  there was then a time of sadness in which she told him her doubts if she could live with him longer newson left home again on the newfoundland trade when the season came round the vague news of his loss at sea a little later on solved a problem which had become torture to her meek conscience she saw him no more  of henchard they heard nothing to the liege subjects of labour the england of those days was a continent and a mile a geographical degree  elizabethjane developed early into womanliness one day a month or so after receiving intelligence of newsons death off the bank of newfoundland when the girl was about eighteen she was sitting on a willow chair in the cottage they still occupied working twine nets for the fishermen her mother was in a back corner of the same room engaged in the same labour and dropping the heavy wood needle she was filling she surveyed her daughter thoughtfully the sun shone in at the door upon the young womans head and hair which was worn loose so that the rays streamed into its depths as into a hazel copse her face though somewhat wan and incomplete possessed the raw materials of beauty in a promising degree there was an underhandsomeness in it struggling to reveal itself through the provisional curves of immaturity and the casual disfigurements that resulted from the straitened circumstances of their lives she was handsome in the bone hardly as yet handsome in the flesh she possibly might never be fully handsome unless the carking accidents of her daily existence could be evaded before the mobile parts of her countenance had settled to their final mould  the sight of the girl made her mother sadnot vaguely but by logical inference they both were still in that straitwaistcoat of poverty from which she had tried so many times to be delivered for the girls sake the woman had long perceived how zealously and constantly the young mind of her companion was struggling for enlargement and yet now in her eighteenth year it still remained but little unfolded the desiresober and repressedof elizabethjanes heart was indeed to see to hear and to understand how could she become a woman of wider knowledge higher reputebetter as she termed itthis was her constant inquiry of her mother she sought further into things than other girls in her position ever did and her mother groaned as she felt she could not aid in the search  the sailor drowned or no was probably now lost to them and susans staunch religious adherence to him as her husband in principle till her views had been disturbed by enlightenment was demanded no more she asked herself whether the present moment now that she was a free woman again were not as opportune a one as she would find in a world where everything had been so inopportune for making a desperate effort to advance elizabeth to pocket her pride and search for the first husband seemed wisely or not the best initiatory step he had possibly drunk himself into his tomb but he might on the other hand have had too much sense to do so for in her time with him he had been given to bouts only and was not a habitual drunkard  at any rate the propriety of returning to him if he lived was unquestionable the awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening elizabeth a proceeding which her mother could not endure to contemplate she finally resolved to undertake the search without confiding to the girl her former relations with henchard leaving it to him if they found him to take what steps he might choose to that end this will account for their conversation at the fair and the halfinformed state at which elizabeth was led onward  in this attitude they proceeded on their journey trusting solely to the dim light afforded of henchards whereabouts by the furmity woman the strictest economy was indispensable sometimes they might have been seen on foot sometimes on farmers waggons sometimes in carriers vans and thus they drew near to casterbridge elizabethjane discovered to her alarm that her mothers health was not what it once had been and there was ever and anon in her talk that renunciatory tone which showed that but for the girl she would not be very sorry to quit a life she was growing thoroughly weary of  it was on a friday evening near the middle of september and just before dusk that they reached the summit of a hill within a mile of the place they sought there were high banked hedges to the coachroad here and they mounted upon the green turf within and sat down the spot commanded a full view of the town and its environs  what an oldfashioned place it seems to be said elizabethjane while her silent mother mused on other things than topography it is huddled all together and it is shut in by a square wall of trees like a plot of garden ground by a boxedging  its squareness was indeed the characteristic which most struck the eye in this antiquated borough the borough of casterbridgeat that time recent as it was untouched by the faintest sprinkle of modernism it was compact as a box of dominoes it had no suburbsin the ordinary sense country and town met at a mathematical line  to birds of the more soaring kind casterbridge must have appeared on this fine evening as a mosaicwork of subdued reds browns greys and crystals held together by a rectangular frame of deep green to the level eye of humanity it stood as an indistinct mass behind a dense stockade of limes and chestnuts set in the midst of miles of rotund down and concave field the mass became gradually dissected by the vision into towers gables chimneys and casements the highest glazings shining bleared and bloodshot with the coppery fire they caught from the belt of sunlit cloud in the west  from the centre of each side of this treebound square ran avenues east west and south into the wide expanse of cornland and coomb to the distance of a mile or so it was by one of these avenues that the pedestrians were about to enter before they had risen to proceed two men passed outside the hedge engaged in argumentative conversation  why surely said elizabeth as they receded those men mentioned the name of henchard in their talkthe name of our relative  i thought so too said mrs newson  that seems a hint to us that he is still here  yes  shall i run after them and ask them about him  no no no not for the world just yet he may be in the workhouse or in the stocks for all we know  dear mewhy should you think that mother  twas just something to saythats all but we must make private inquiries  having sufficiently rested they proceeded on their way at evenfall the dense trees of the avenue rendered the road dark as a tunnel though the open land on each side was still under a faint daylight in other words they passed down a midnight between two gloamings the features of the town had a keen interest for elizabeths mother now that the human side came to the fore as soon as they had wandered about they could see that the stockade of gnarled trees which framed in casterbridge was itself an avenue standing on a low green bank or escarpment with a ditch yet visible without within the avenue and bank was a wall more or less discontinuous and within the wall were packed the abodes of the burghers  though the two women did not know it these external features were but the ancient defences of the town planted as a promenade  the lamplights now glimmered through the engirdling trees conveying a sense of great smugness and comfort inside and rendering at the same time the unlighted country without strangely solitary and vacant in aspect considering its nearness to life the difference between burgh and champaign was increased too by sounds which now reached them above othersthe notes of a brass band the travellers returned into the high street where there were timber houses with overhanging stories whose smallpaned lattices were screened by dimity curtains on a drawingstring and under whose bargeboards old cobwebs waved in the breeze there were houses of bricknogging which derived their chief support from those adjoining there were slate roofs patched with tiles and tile roofs patched with slate with occasionally a roof of thatch  the agricultural and pastoral character of the people upon whom the town depended for its existence was shown by the class of objects displayed in the shop windows scythes reaphooks sheepshears billhooks spades mattocks and hoes at the ironmongers beehives butterfirkins churns milking stools and pails hayrakes fieldflagons and seedlips at the coopers cartropes and ploughharness at the saddlers carts wheelbarrows and millgear at the wheelwrights and machinists horseembrocations at the chemists at the glovers and leathercutters hedginggloves thatchers kneecaps ploughmens leggings villagers pattens and clogs  they came to a grizzled church whose massive square tower rose unbroken into the darkening sky the lower parts being illuminated by the nearest lamps sufficiently to show how completely the mortar from the joints of the stonework had been nibbled out by time and weather which had planted in the crevices thus made little tufts of stonecrop and grass almost as far up as the very battlements from this tower the clock struck eight and thereupon a bell began to toll with a peremptory clang the curfew was still rung in casterbridge and it was utilized by the inhabitants as a signal for shutting their shops no sooner did the deep notes of the bell throb between the housefronts than a clatter of shutters arose through the whole length of the high street in a few minutes business at casterbridge was ended for the day  other clocks struck eight from time to timeone gloomily from the gaol another from the gable of an almshouse with a preparative creak of machinery more audible than the note of the bell a row of tall varnished caseclocks from the interior of a clockmakers shop joined in one after another just as the shutters were enclosing them like a row of actors delivering their final speeches before the fall of the curtain then chimes were heard stammering out the sicilian mariners hymn so that chronologists of the advanced school were appreciably on their way to the next hour before the whole business of the old one was satisfactorily wound up  in an open space before the church walked a woman with her gownsleeves rolled up so high that the edge of her underlinen was visible and her skirt tucked up through her pocket hole she carried a load under her arm from which she was pulling pieces of bread and handing them to some other women who walked with her which pieces they nibbled critically the sight reminded mrs henchardnewson and her daughter that they had an appetite and they inquired of the woman for the nearest bakers  ye may as well look for mannafood as good bread in casterbridge just now she said after directing them they can blare their trumpets and thump their drums and have their roaring dinnerswaving her hand towards a point further along the street where the brass band could be seen standing in front of an illuminated buildingbut we must needs be putto for want of a wholesome crust theres less good bread than good beer in casterbridge now  and less good beer than swipes said a man with his hands in his pockets  how does it happen theres no good bread asked mrs henchard  oh tis the cornfactorhes the man that our millers and bakers all deal wi and he has sold em growed wheat which they didnt know was growed so they say till the dough ran all over the ovens like quicksilver so that the loaves be as flat as toads and like suet pudden inside ive been a wife and ive been a mother and i never see such unprincipled bread in casterbridge as this beforebut you must be a real stranger here not to know whats made all the poor volks insides plim like blowed bladders this week  i am said elizabeths mother shyly  not wishing to be observed further till she knew more of her future in this place she withdrew with her daughter from the speakers side getting a couple of biscuits at the shop indicated as a temporary substitute for a meal they next bent their steps instinctively to where the music was playing     5   a few score yards brought them to the spot where the town band was now shaking the windowpanes with the strains of the roast beef of old england  the building before whose doors they had pitched their musicstands was the chief hotel in casterbridgenamely the kings arms a spacious bowwindow projected into the street over the main portico and from the open sashes came the babble of voices the jingle of glasses and the drawing of corks the blinds moreover being left unclosed the whole interior of this room could be surveyed from the top of a flight of stone steps to the roadwaggon office opposite for which reason a knot of idlers had gathered there  we might perhaps after all make a few inquiries aboutour relation mr henchard whispered mrs newson who since her entry into casterbridge had seemed strangely weak and agitated and this i think would be a good place for trying itjust to ask you know how he stands in the townif he is here as i think he must be you elizabethjane had better be the one to do it im too worn out to do anythingpull down your fall first  she sat down upon the lowest step and elizabethjane obeyed her directions and stood among the idlers  whats going on tonight asked the girl after singling out an old man and standing by him long enough to acquire a neighbourly right of converse  well ye must be a stranger sure said the old man without taking his eyes from the window why tis a great public dinner of the gentlepeople and such like leading volkwi the mayor in the chair as we plainer fellows baint invited they leave the windershutters open that we may get jist a sense ot out here if you mount the steps you can see em thats mr henchard the mayor at the end of the table a facing ye and thats the council men right and leftah lots of them when they begun life were no more than i be now  henchard said elizabethjane surprised but by no means suspecting the whole force of the revelation she ascended to the top of the steps  her mother though her head was bowed had already caught from the innwindow tones that strangely riveted her attention before the old mans words mr henchard the mayor reached her ears she arose and stepped up to her daughters side as soon as she could do so without showing exceptional eagerness  the interior of the hotel diningroom was spread out before her with its tables and glass and plate and inmates facing the window in the chair of dignity sat a man about forty years of age of heavy frame large features and commanding voice his general build being rather coarse than compact he had a rich complexion which verged on swarthiness a flashing black eye and dark bushy brows and hair when he indulged in an occasional loud laugh at some remark among the guests his large mouth parted so far back as to show to the rays of the chandelier a full score or more of the twoandthirty sound white teeth that he obviously still could boast of  that laugh was not encouraging to strangers and hence it may have been well that it was rarely heard many theories might have been built upon it it fell in well with conjectures of a temperament which would have no pity for weakness but would be ready to yield ungrudging admiration to greatness and strength its producers personal goodness if he had any would be of a very fitful castan occasional almost oppressive generosity rather than a mild and constant kindness  susan henchards husbandin law at leastsat before them matured in shape stiffened in line exaggerated in traits disciplined thoughtmarkedin a word older elizabeth encumbered with no recollections as her mother was regarded him with nothing more than the keen curiosity and interest which the discovery of such unexpected social standing in the longsought relative naturally begot he was dressed in an oldfashioned evening suit an expanse of frilled shirt showing on his broad breast jewelled studs and a heavy gold chain three glasses stood at his right hand but to his wifes surprise the two for wine were empty while the third a tumbler was half full of water  when last she had seen him he was sitting in a corduroy jacket fustian waistcoat and breeches and tanned leather leggings with a basin of hot furmity before him time the magician had wrought much here watching him and thus thinking of past days she became so moved that she shrank back against the jamb of the waggonoffice doorway to which the steps gave access the shadow from it conveniently hiding her features she forgot her daughter till a touch from elizabethjane aroused her have you seen him mother whispered the girl  yes yes answered her companion hastily i have seen him and it is enough for me now i only want to gopass awaydie  whyo what she drew closer and whispered in her mothers ear does he seem to you not likely to befriend us i thought he looked a generous man what a gentleman he is isnt he and how his diamond studs shine how strange that you should have said he might be in the stocks or in the workhouse or dead did ever anything go more by contraries why do you feel so afraid of him i am not at all ill call upon himhe can but say he dont own such remote kin  i dont know at alli cant tell what to set about i feel so down  dont be that mother now we have got here and all rest there where you be a little whilei will look on and find out more about him  i dont think i can ever meet mr henchard he is not how i thought he would behe overpowers me i dont wish to see him any more  but wait a little time and consider  elizabethjane had never been so much interested in anything in her life as in their present position partly from the natural elation she felt at discovering herself akin to a coach and she gazed again at the scene the younger guests were talking and eating with animation their elders were searching for titbits and sniffing and grunting over their plates like sows nuzzling for acorns three drinks seemed to be sacred to the companyport sherry and rum outside which oldestablished trinity few or no palates ranged  a row of ancient rummers with ground figures on their sides and each primed with a spoon was now placed down the table and these were promptly filled with grog at such high temperatures as to raise serious considerations for the articles exposed to its vapours but elizabethjane noticed that though this filling went on with great promptness up and down the table nobody filled the mayors glass who still drank large quantities of water from the tumbler behind the clump of crystal vessels intended for wine and spirits  they dont fill mr henchards wineglasses she ventured to say to her elbow acquaintance the old man  ah no dont ye know him to be the celebrated abstaining worthy of that name he scorns all tempting liquors never touches nothing o yes heve strong qualities that way i have heard tell that he sware a gospel oath in bygone times and has bode by it ever since so they dont press him knowing it would be unbecoming in the face of that for yer gospel oath is a serious thing  another elderly man hearing this discourse now joined in by inquiring how much longer have he got to suffer from it solomon longways  another two year they say i dont know the why and the wherefore of his fixing such a time for a never has told anybody but tis exactly two calendar years longer they say a powerful mind to hold out so long  truebut theres great strength in hope knowing that in fourandtwenty months time yell be out of your bondage and able to make up for all youve suffered by partaking without stintwhy it keeps a man up no doubt  no doubt christopher coney no doubt and a must need such reflectionsa lonely widow man said longways  when did he lose his wife asked elizabeth  i never knowed her twas afore he came to casterbridge solomon longways replied with terminative emphasis as if the fact of his ignorance of mrs henchard were sufficient to deprive her history of all interest but i know that as a banded teetotaller and that if any of his men be ever so little overtook by a drop hes down upon em as stern as the lord upon the jovial jews  has he many men then said elizabethjane  many why my good maid hes the powerfullest member of the town council and quite a principal man in the country round besides never a big dealing in wheat barley oats hay roots and suchlike but henchards got a hand in it ay and hell go into other things too and thats where he makes his mistake he worked his way up from nothing when a came here and now hes a pillar of the town not but what hes been shaken a little toyear about this bad corn he has supplied in his contracts ive seen the sun rise over durnover moor these nineandsixty year and though mr henchard has never cussed me unfairly ever since ive worked forn seeing i be but a little small man i must say that i have never before tasted such rough bread as has been made from henchards wheat lately tis that growed out that ye could amost call it malt and theres a list at bottom o the loaf as thick as the sole of ones shoe  the band now struck up another melody and by the time it was ended the dinner was over and speeches began to be made the evening being calm and the windows still open these orations could be distinctly heard henchards voice arose above the rest he was telling a story of his haydealing experiences in which he had outwitted a sharper who had been bent upon outwitting him  hahaha responded his audience at the upshot of the story and hilarity was general till a new voice arose with this is all very well but how about the bad bread  it came from the lower end of the table where there sat a group of minor tradesmen who although part of the company appeared to be a little below the social level of the others and who seemed to nourish a certain independence of opinion and carry on discussions not quite in harmony with those at the head just as the west end of a church is sometimes persistently found to sing out of time and tune with the leading spirits in the chancel  this interruption about the bad bread afforded infinite satisfaction to the loungers outside several of whom were in the mood which finds its pleasure in others discomfiture and hence they echoed pretty freely hey how about the bad bread mr mayor moreover feeling none of the restraints of those who shared the feast they could afford to add you rather ought to tell the story o that sir  the interruption was sufficient to compel the mayor to notice it  well i admit that the wheat turned out badly he said but i was taken in in buying it as much as the bakers who bought it o me  and the poor folk who had to eat it whether or no said the inharmonious man outside the window  henchards face darkened there was temper under the thin bland surfacethe temper which artificially intensified had banished a wife nearly a score of years before  you must make allowances for the accidents of a large business he said you must bear in mind that the weather just at the harvest of that corn was worse than we have known it for years however i have mended my arrangements on account ot since i have found my business too large to be well looked after by myself alone i have advertised for a thorough good man as manager of the corn department when ive got him you will find these mistakes will no longer occurmatters will be better looked into  but what are you going to do to repay us for the past inquired the man who had before spoken and who seemed to be a baker or miller will you replace the grown flour weve still got by sound grain  henchards face had become still more stern at these interruptions and he drank from his tumbler of water as if to calm himself or gain time instead of vouchsafing a direct reply he stiffly observed  if anybody will tell me how to turn grown wheat into wholesome wheat ill take it back with pleasure but it cant be done  henchard was not to be drawn again having said this he sat down     6   now the group outside the window had within the last few minutes been reinforced by new arrivals some of them respectable shopkeepers and their assistants who had come out for a whiff of air after putting up the shutters for the night some of them of a lower class distinct from either there appeared a strangera young man of remarkably pleasant aspectwho carried in his hand a carpetbag of the smart floral pattern prevalent in such articles at that time  he was ruddy and of a fair countenance brighteyed and slight in build he might possibly have passed by without stopping at all or at most for half a minute to glance in at the scene had not his advent coincided with the discussion on corn and bread in which event this history had never been enacted but the subject seemed to arrest him and he whispered some inquiries of the other bystanders and remained listening  when he heard henchards closing words it cant be done he smiled impulsively drew out his pocketbook and wrote down a few words by the aid of the light in the window he tore out the leaf folded and directed it and seemed about to throw it in through the open sash upon the diningtable but on second thoughts edged himself through the loiterers till he reached the door of the hotel where one of the waiters who had been serving inside was now idly leaning against the doorpost  give this to the mayor at once he said handing in his hasty note  elizabethjane had seen his movements and heard the words which attracted her both by their subject and by their accenta strange one for those parts it was quaint and northerly  the waiter took the note while the young stranger continued  and can ye tell me of a respectable hotel thats a little more moderate than this  the waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street  they say the three mariners just below here is a very good place he languidly answered but i have never stayed there myself  the scotchman as he seemed to be thanked him and strolled on in the direction of the three mariners aforesaid apparently more concerned about the question of an inn than about the fate of his note now that the momentary impulse of writing it was over while he was disappearing slowly down the street the waiter left the door and elizabethjane saw with some interest the note brought into the diningroom and handed to the mayor  henchard looked at it carelessly unfolded it with one hand and glanced it through thereupon it was curious to note an unexpected effect the nettled clouded aspect which had held possession of his face since the subject of his corndealings had been broached changed itself into one of arrested attention he read the note slowly and fell into thought not moody but fitfully intense as that of a man who has been captured by an idea  by this time toasts and speeches had given place to songs the wheat subject being quite forgotten men were putting their heads together in twos and threes telling good stories with pantomimic laughter which reached convulsive grimace some were beginning to look as if they did not know how they had come there what they had come for or how they were going to get home again and provisionally sat on with a dazed smile squarebuilt men showed a tendency to become hunchbacks men with a dignified presence lost it in a curious obliquity of figure in which their features grew disarranged and onesided whilst the heads of a few who had dined with extreme thoroughness were somehow sinking into their shoulders the corners of their mouth and eyes being bent upwards by the subsidence only henchard did not conform to these flexuous changes he remained stately and vertical silently thinking  the clock struck nine elizabethjane turned to her companion the evening is drawing on mother she said what do you propose to do  she was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become we must get a place to lie down in she murmured i have seenmr henchard and thats all i wanted to do  thats enough for tonight at any rate elizabethjane replied soothingly we can think tomorrow what is best to do about him the question now isis it nothow shall we find a lodging  as her mother did not reply elizabethjanes mind reverted to the words of the waiter that the three mariners was an inn of moderate charges a recommendation good for one person was probably good for another lets go where the young man has gone to she said he is respectable what do you say  her mother assented and down the street they went  in the meantime the mayors thoughtfulness engendered by the note as stated continued to hold him in abstraction till whispering to his neighbour to take his place he found opportunity to leave the chair this was just after the departure of his wife and elizabeth  outside the door of the assemblyroom he saw the waiter and beckoning to him asked who had brought the note which had been handed in a quarter of an hour before  a young man sira sort of traveller he was a scotchman seemingly  did he say how he had got it  he wrote it himself sir as he stood outside the window  ohwrote it himselfis the young man in the hotel  no sir he went to the three mariners i believe  the mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands under his coat tails as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere than that of the room he had quitted but there could be no doubt that he was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea whatever that might be at length he went back to the door of the diningroom paused and found that the songs toasts and conversation were proceeding quite satisfactorily without his presence the corporation private residents and major and minor tradesmen had in fact gone in for comforting beverages to such an extent that they had quite forgotten not only the mayor but all those vast political religious and social differences which they felt necessary to maintain in the daytime and which separated them like iron grills seeing this the mayor took his hat and when the waiter had helped him on with a thin holland overcoat went out and stood under the portico  very few persons were now in the street and his eyes by a sort of attraction turned and dwelt upon a spot about a hundred yards further down it was the house to which the writer of the note had gonethe three marinerswhose two prominent elizabethan gables bowwindow and passagelight could be seen from where he stood having kept his eyes on it for a while he strolled in that direction  this ancient house of accommodation for man and beast now unfortunately pulled down was built of mellow sandstone with mullioned windows of the same material markedly out of perpendicular from the settlement of foundations the bay window projecting into the street whose interior was so popular among the frequenters of the inn was closed with shutters in each of which appeared a heartshaped aperture somewhat more attenuated in the right and left ventricles than is seen in nature inside these illuminated holes at a distance of about three inches were ranged at this hour as every passer knew the ruddy polls of billy wills the glazier smart the shoemaker buzzford the general dealer and others of a secondary set of worthies of a grade somewhat below that of the diners at the kings arms each with his yard of clay  a fourcentred tudor arch was over the entrance and over the arch the signboard now visible in the rays of an opposite lamp hereon the mariners who had been represented by the artist as persons of two dimensions onlyin other words flat as a shadowwere standing in a row in paralyzed attitudes being on the sunny side of the street the three comrades had suffered largely from warping splitting fading and shrinkage so that they were but a halfinvisible film upon the reality of the grain and knots and nails which composed the signboard as a matter of fact this state of things was not so much owing to stannidge the landlords neglect as from the lack of a painter in casterbridge who would undertake to reproduce the features of men so traditional  a long narrow dimlylit passage gave access to the inn within which passage the horses going to their stalls at the back and the coming and departing human guests rubbed shoulders indiscriminately the latter running no slight risk of having their toes trodden upon by the animals the good stabling and the good ale of the mariners though somewhat difficult to reach on account of there being but this narrow way to both were nevertheless perseveringly sought out by the sagacious old heads who knew what was what in casterbridge  henchard stood without the inn for a few instants then lowering the dignity of his presence as much as possible by buttoning the brown holland coat over his shirtfront and in other ways toning himself down to his ordinary everyday appearance he entered the inn door     7   elizabethjane and her mother had arrived some twenty minutes earlier outside the house they had stood and considered whether even this homely place though recommended as moderate might not be too serious in its prices for their light pockets finally however they had found courage to enter and duly met stannidge the landlord a silent man who drew and carried frothing measures to this room and to that shoulder to shoulder with his waitingmaidsa stately slowness however entering into his ministrations by contrast with theirs as became one whose service was somewhat optional it would have been altogether optional but for the orders of the landlady a person who sat in the bar corporeally motionless but with a flitting eye and quick ear with which she observed and heard through the open door and hatchway the pressing needs of customers whom her husband overlooked though close at hand elizabeth and her mother were passively accepted as sojourners and shown to a small bedroom under one of the gables where they sat down  the principle of the inn seemed to be to compensate for the antique awkwardness crookedness and obscurity of the passages floors and windows by quantities of clean linen spread about everywhere and this had a dazzling effect upon the travellers  tis too good for uswe cant meet it said the elder woman looking round the apartment with misgiving as soon as they were left alone  i fear it is too said elizabeth but we must be respectable  we must pay our way even before we must be respectable replied her mother mr henchard is too high for us to make ourselves known to him i much fear so weve only our own pockets to depend on  i know what ill do said elizabethjane after an interval of waiting during which their needs seemed quite forgotten under the press of business below and leaving the room she descended the stairs and penetrated to the bar  if there was one good thing more than another which characterized this singlehearted girl it was a willingness to sacrifice her personal comfort and dignity to the common weal  as you seem busy here tonight and mothers not well off might i take out part of our accommodation by helping she asked of the landlady  the latter who remained as fixed in the armchair as if she had been melted into it when in a liquid state and could not now be unstuck looked the girl up and down inquiringly with her hands on the chairarms such arrangements as the one elizabeth proposed were not uncommon in country villages but though casterbridge was oldfashioned the custom was wellnigh obsolete here the mistress of the house however was an easy woman to strangers and she made no objection thereupon elizabeth being instructed by nods and motions from the taciturn landlord as to where she could find the different things trotted up and down stairs with materials for her own and her parents meal  while she was doing this the wood partition in the centre of the house thrilled to its centre with the tugging of a bellpull upstairs a bell below tinkled a note that was feebler in sound than the twanging of wires and cranks that had produced it  tis the scotch gentleman said the landlady omnisciently and turning her eyes to elizabeth now then can you go and see if his supper is on the tray if it is you can take it up to him the front room over this  elizabethjane though hungry willingly postponed serving herself awhile and applied to the cook in the kitchen whence she brought forth the tray of supper viands and proceeded with it upstairs to the apartment indicated the accommodation of the three mariners was far from spacious despite the fair area of ground it covered the room demanded by intrusive beams and rafters partitions passages staircases disused ovens settles and fourposters left comparatively small quarters for human beings moreover this being at a time before homebrewing was abandoned by the smaller victuallers and a house in which the twelvebushel strength was still religiously adhered to by the landlord in his ale the quality of the liquor was the chief attraction of the premises so that everything had to make way for utensils and operations in connection therewith thus elizabeth found that the scotchman was located in a room quite close to the small one that had been allotted to herself and her mother  when she entered nobody was present but the young man himselfthe same whom she had seen lingering without the windows of the kings arms hotel he was now idly reading a copy of the local paper and was hardly conscious of her entry so that she looked at him quite coolly and saw how his forehead shone where the light caught it and how nicely his hair was cut and the sort of velvetpile or down that was on the skin at the back of his neck and how his cheek was so truly curved as to be part of a globe and how clearly drawn were the lids and lashes which hid his bent eyes  she set down the tray spread his supper and went away without a word on her arrival below the landlady who was as kind as she was fat and lazy saw that elizabethjane was rather tired though in her earnestness to be useful she was waiving her own needs altogether mrs stannidge thereupon said with a considerate peremptoriness that she and her mother had better take their own suppers if they meant to have any  elizabeth fetched their simple provisions as she had fetched the scotchmans and went up to the little chamber where she had left her mother noiselessly pushing open the door with the edge of the tray to her surprise her mother instead of being reclined on the bed where she had left her was in an erect position with lips parted at elizabeths entry she lifted her finger  the meaning of this was soon apparent the room allotted to the two women had at one time served as a dressingroom to the scotchmans chamber as was evidenced by signs of a door of communication between themnow screwed up and pasted over with the wall paper but as is frequently the case with hotels of far higher pretensions than the three mariners every word spoken in either of these rooms was distinctly audible in the other such sounds came through now  thus silently conjured elizabeth deposited the tray and her mother whispered as she drew near tis he  who said the girl  the mayor  the tremors in susan henchards tone might have led any person but one so perfectly unsuspicious of the truth as the girl was to surmise some closer connection than the admitted simple kinship as a means of accounting for them  two men were indeed talking in the adjoining chamber the young scotchman and henchard who having entered the inn while elizabethjane was in the kitchen waiting for the supper had been deferentially conducted upstairs by host stannidge himself the girl noiselessly laid out their little meal and beckoned to her mother to join her which mrs henchard mechanically did her attention being fixed on the conversation through the door  i merely strolled in on my way home to ask you a question about something that has excited my curiosity said the mayor with careless geniality but i see you have not finished supper  ay but i will be done in a little ye neednt go sir take a seat ive almost done and it makes no difference at all  henchard seemed to take the seat offered and in a moment he resumed well first i should ask did you write this a rustling of paper followed  yes i did said the scotchman  then said henchard i am under the impression that we have met by accident while waiting for the morning to keep an appointment with each other my name is henchard hant you replied to an advertisement for a cornfactors manager that i put into the paperhant you come here to see me about it  no said the scotchman with some surprise  surely you are the man went on henchard insistingly who arranged to come and see me joshua joshua jippjoppwhat was his name  youre wrong said the young man my name is donald farfrae it is true i am in the corren tradebut i have replied to no advertisement and arranged to see no one i am on my way to bristolfrom there to the other side of the warrld to try my fortune in the great wheatgrowing districts of the west i have some inventions useful to the trade and there is no scope for developing them heere  to americawell well said henchard in a tone of disappointment so strong as to make itself felt like a damp atmosphere and yet i could have sworn you were the man  the scotchman murmured another negative and there was a silence till henchard resumed then i am truly and sincerely obliged to you for the few words you wrote on that paper  it was nothing sir  well it has a great importance for me just now this row about my grown wheat which i declare to heaven i didnt know to be bad till the people came complaining has put me to my wits end ive some hundreds of quarters of it on hand and if your renovating process will make it wholesome why you can see what a quag twould get me out of i saw in a moment there might be truth in it but i should like to have it proved and of course you dont care to tell the steps of the process sufficiently for me to do that without my paying ye well fort first  the young man reflected a moment or two i dont know that i have any objection he said im going to another country and curing bad corn is not the line ill take up there yes ill tell ye the whole of ityoull make more out of it heere than i will in a foreign country just look heere a minute sir i can show ye by a sample in my carpetbag  the click of a lock followed and there was a sifting and rustling then a discussion about so many ounces to the bushel and drying and refrigerating and so on  these few grains will be sufficient to show ye with came in the young fellows voice and after a pause during which some operation seemed to be intently watched by them both he exclaimed there now do you taste that  its completequite restored orwellnearly  quite enough restored to make good seconds out of it said the scotchman to fetch it back entirely is impossible nature wont stand so much as that but heere you go a great way towards it well sir thats the process i dont value it for it can be but of little use in countries where the weather is more settled than in ours and ill be only too glad if its of service to you  but hearken to me pleaded henchard my business you know is in corn and in hay but i was brought up as a haytrusser simply and hay is what i understand best though i now do more in corn than in the other if youll accept the place you shall manage the corn branch entirely and receive a commission in addition to salary  youre liberalvery liberal but no noi cannet the young man still replied with some distress in his accents  so be it said henchard conclusively nowto change the subjectone good turn deserves another dont stay to finish that miserable supper come to my house i can find something better for ee than cold ham and ale  donald farfrae was gratefulsaid he feared he must declinethat he wished to leave early next day  very well said henchard quickly please yourself but i tell you young man if this holds good for the bulk as it has done for the sample you have saved my credit stranger though you be what shall i pay you for this knowledge  nothing at all nothing at all it may not prove necessary to ye to use it often and i dont value it at all i thought i might just as well let ye know as you were in a difficulty and they were harrd upon ye  henchard paused i shant soon forget this he said and from a stranger i couldnt believe you were not the man i had engaged says i to myself he knows who i am and recommends himself by this stroke and yet it turns out after all that you are not the man who answered my advertisement but a stranger  ay ay thats so said the young man  henchard again suspended his words and then his voice came thoughtfully your forehead farfrae is something like my poor brothersnow dead and gone and the nose too isnt unlike his you must be whatfive foot nine i reckon i am six foot one and a half out of my shoes but what of that in my business tis true that strength and bustle build up a firm but judgment and knowledge are what keep it established unluckily i am bad at science farfrae bad at figuresa rule o thumb sort of man you are just the reversei can see that i have been looking for such as you these two year and yet you are not for me well before i go let me ask this though you are not the young man i thought you were whats the difference cant ye stay just the same have you really made up your mind about this american notion i wont mince matters i feel you would be invaluable to methat neednt be saidand if you will bide and be my manager i will make it worth your while  my plans are fixed said the young man in negative tones i have formed a scheme and so we need na say any more about it but will you not drink with me sir i find this casterbridge ale warreming to the stomach  no no i fain would but i cant said henchard gravely the scraping of his chair informing the listeners that he was rising to leave when i was a young man i went in for that sort of thing too strongfar too strongand was wellnigh ruined by it i did a deed on account of it which i shall be ashamed of to my dying day it made such an impression on me that i swore there and then that id drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as i was old that day i have kept my oath and though farfrae i am sometimes that dry in the dog days that i could drink a quarterbarrel to the pitching i think o my oath and touch no strong drink at all  ill no press ye sirill no press ye i respect your vow  well i shall get a manager somewhere no doubt said henchard with strong feeling in his tones but it will be long before i see one that would suit me so well  the young man appeared much moved by henchards warm convictions of his value he was silent till they reached the door i wish i could staysincerely i would like to he replied but noit cannet be it cannet i want to see the warrld     8   thus they parted and elizabethjane and her mother remained each in her thoughts over their meal the mothers face being strangely bright since henchards avowal of shame for a past action the quivering of the partition to its core presently denoted that donald farfrae had again rung his bell no doubt to have his supper removed for humming a tune and walking up and down he seemed to be attracted by the lively bursts of conversation and melody from the general company below he sauntered out upon the landing and descended the staircase  when elizabethjane had carried down his supper tray and also that used by her mother and herself she found the bustle of serving to be at its height below as it always was at this hour the young woman shrank from having anything to do with the groundfloor serving and crept silently about observing the sceneso new to her fresh from the seclusion of a seaside cottage in the general sittingroom which was large she remarked the two or three dozen strongbacked chairs that stood round against the wall each fitted with its genial occupant the sanded floor the black settle which projecting endwise from the wall within the door permitted elizabeth to be a spectator of all that went on without herself being particularly seen  the young scotchman had just joined the guests these in addition to the respectable mastertradesmen occupying the seats of privileges in the bowwindow and its neighbourhood included an inferior set at the unlighted end whose seats were mere benches against the wall and who drank from cups instead of from glasses among the latter she noticed some of those personages who had stood outside the windows of the kings arms  behind their backs was a small window with a wheel ventilator in one of the panes which would suddenly start off spinning with a jingling sound as suddenly stop and as suddenly start again  while thus furtively making her survey the opening words of a song greeted her ears from the front of the settle in a melody and accent of peculiar charm there had been some singing before she came down and now the scotchman had made himself so soon at home that at the request of some of the mastertradesmen he too was favouring the room with a ditty  elizabethjane was fond of music she could not help pausing to listen and the longer she listened the more she was enraptured she had never heard any singing like this and it was evident that the majority of the audience had not heard such frequently for they were attentive to a much greater degree than usual they neither whispered nor drank nor dipped their pipestems in their ale to moisten them nor pushed the mug to their neighbours the singer himself grew emotional till she could imagine a tear in his eye as the words went on       its hame and its hame hame fain would i be      o hame hame hame to my ain countree      theres an eye that ever weeps and a fair face will be fain      as i pass through annan water with my bonnie bands again      when the flower is in the bud and the leaf upon the tree      the lark shall sing me hame to my ain countree  there was a burst of applause and a deep silence which was even more eloquent than the applause it was of such a kind that the snapping of a pipestem too long for him by old solomon longways who was one of those gathered at the shady end of the room seemed a harsh and irreverent act then the ventilator in the windowpane spasmodically started off for a new spin and the pathos of donalds song was temporarily effaced  twas not amissnot at all amiss muttered christopher coney who was also present and removing his pipe a fingers breadth from his lips he said aloud draw on with the next verse young gentleman please  yes lets have it again stranger said the glazier a stout bucketheaded man with a white apron rolled up round his waist folks dont lift up their hearts like that in this part of the world and turning aside he said in undertones who is the young manscotch dye say  yes straight from the mountains of scotland i believe replied coney  young farfrae repeated the last verse it was plain that nothing so pathetic had been heard at the three mariners for a considerable time the difference of accent the excitability of the singer the intense local feeling and the seriousness with which he worked himself up to a climax surprised this set of worthies who were only too prone to shut up their emotions with caustic words  danged if our country down here is worth singing about like that continued the glazier as the scotchman again melodized with a dying fall my ain countree when you take away from among us the fools and the rogues and the lammigers and the wanton hussies and the slatterns and such like theres cust few left to ornament a song with in casterbridge or the country round  true said buzzford the dealer looking at the grain of the table casterbridge is a old hoary place o wickedness by all account tis recorded in history that we rebelled against the king one or two hundred years ago in the time of the romans and that lots of us was hanged on gallows hill and quartered and our different jints sent about the country like butchers meat and for my part i can well believe it  what did ye come away from yer own country for young maister if ye be so wownded about it inquired christopher coney from the background with the tone of a man who preferred the original subject faith it wasnt worth your while on our account for as maister billy wills says we be bruckle folk herethe best o us hardly honest sometimes what with hard winters and so many mouths to fill and godamighty sending his little taties so terrible small to fill em with we dont think about flowers and fair faces not weexcept in the shape o cauliflowers and pigs chaps  but no said donald farfrae gazing round into their faces with earnest concern the best of ye hardly honestnot that surely none of ye has been stealing what didnt belong to him  lord no no said solomon longways smiling grimly thats only his random way o speaking a was always such a man of underthoughts and reprovingly towards christopher dont ye be so overfamiliar with a gentleman that ye know nothing ofand thats travelled amost from the north pole  christopher coney was silenced and as he could get no public sympathy he mumbled his feelings to himself be dazed if i loved my country half as well as the young feller do id live by claning my neighbours pigsties afore id go away for my part ive no more love for my country than i have for botany bay  come said longways let the young man draw onward with his ballet or we shall be here all night  thats all of it said the singer apologetically  soul of my body then well have another said the general dealer  can you turn a strain to the ladies sir inquired a fat woman with a figured purple apron the waiststring of which was overhung so far by her sides as to be invisible  let him breathelet him breathe mother cuxsom he haint got his second wind yet said the master glazier  oh yes but i have exclaimed the young man and he at once rendered o nannie with faultless modulations and another or two of the like sentiment winding up at their earnest request with auld lang syne  by this time he had completely taken possession of the hearts of the three mariners inmates including even old coney notwithstanding an occasional odd gravity which awoke their sense of the ludicrous for the moment they began to view him through a golden haze which the tone of his mind seemed to raise around him casterbridge had sentimentcasterbridge had romance but this strangers sentiment was of differing quality or rather perhaps the difference was mainly superficial he was to them like the poet of a new school who takes his contemporaries by storm who is not really new but is the first to articulate what all his listeners have felt though but dumbly till then  the silent landlord came and leant over the settle while the young man sang and even mrs stannidge managed to unstick herself from the framework of her chair in the bar and get as far as the doorpost which movement she accomplished by rolling herself round as a cask is trundled on the chine by a drayman without losing much of its perpendicular  and are you going to bide in casterbridge sir she asked  ahno said the scotchman with melancholy fatality in his voice im only passing thirrough i am on my way to bristol and on frae there to foreign parts  we be truly sorry to hear it said solomon longways we can ill afford to lose tuneful wyndpipes like yours when they fall among us and verily to mak acquaintance with a man acome from so far from the land o perpetual snow as we may say where wolves and wild boars and other dangerous animalcules be as common as blackbirds hereaboutwhy tis a thing we cant do every day and theres good sound information for bideathomes like we when such a man opens his mouth  nay but ye mistake my country said the young man looking round upon them with tragic fixity till his eye lighted up and his cheek kindled with a sudden enthusiasm to right their errors there are not perpetual snow and wolves at all in itexcept snow in winter andwella little in summer just sometimes and a gaberlunzie or two stalking about here and there if ye may call them dangerous eh but you should take a summer jarreny to edinboro and arthurs seat and all round there and then go on to the lochs and all the highland sceneryin may and juneand you would never say tis the land of wolves and perpetual snow  of course notit stands to reason said buzzford tis barren ignorance that leads to such words hes a simple homespun man that never was fit for good companythink nothing of him sir  and do ye carry your flock bed and your quilt and your crock and your bit of chiney or do ye go in bare bones as i may say inquired christopher coney  ive sent on my luggagethough it isnt much for the voyage is long donalds eyes dropped into a remote gaze as he added but i said to myself never a one of the prizes of life will i come by unless i undertake it and i decided to go  a general sense of regret in which elizabethjane shared not least made itself apparent in the company as she looked at farfrae from the back of the settle she decided that his statements showed him to be no less thoughtful than his fascinating melodies revealed him to be cordial and impassioned she admired the serious light in which he looked at serious things he had seen no jest in ambiguities and roguery as the casterbridge tosspots had done and rightly notthere was none she disliked those wretched humours of christopher coney and his tribe and he did not appreciate them he seemed to feel exactly as she felt about life and its surroundingsthat they were a tragical rather than a comical thing that though one could be gay on occasion moments of gaiety were interludes and no part of the actual drama it was extraordinary how similar their views were  though it was still early the young scotchman expressed his wish to retire whereupon the landlady whispered to elizabeth to run upstairs and turn down his bed she took a candlestick and proceeded on her mission which was the act of a few moments only when candle in hand she reached the top of the stairs on her way down again mr farfrae was at the foot coming up she could not very well retreat they met and passed in the turn of the staircase  she must have appeared interesting in some waynotwithstanding her plain dressor rather possibly in consequence of it for she was a girl characterized by earnestness and soberness of mien with which simple drapery accorded well her face flushed too at the slight awkwardness of the meeting and she passed him with her eyes bent on the candleflame that she carried just below her nose thus it happened that when confronting her he smiled and then with the manner of a temporarily lighthearted man who has started himself on a flight of song whose momentum he cannot readily check he softly tuned an old ditty that she seemed to suggest           as i came in by my bower door             as day was waxin wearie          oh wha came tripping down the stair             but bonnie peg my dearie  elizabethjane rather disconcerted hastened on and the scotchmans voice died away humming more of the same within the closed door of his room  here the scene and sentiment ended for the present when soon after the girl rejoined her mother the latter was still in thoughton quite another matter than a young mans song  weve made a mistake she whispered that the scotchman might not overhear on no account ought ye to have helped serve here tonight not because of ourselves but for the sake of him if he should befriend us and take us up and then find out what you did when staying here twould grieve and wound his natural pride as mayor of the town  elizabeth who would perhaps have been more alarmed at this than her mother had she known the real relationship was not much disturbed about it as things stood her he was another man than her poor mothers for myself she said i didnt at all mind waiting a little upon him hes so respectable and educatedfar above the rest of em in the inn they thought him very simple not to know their grim broad way of talking about themselves here but of course he didnt knowhe was too refined in his mind to know such things thus she earnestly pleaded  meanwhile the he of her mother was not so far away as even they thought after leaving the three mariners he had sauntered up and down the empty high street passing and repassing the inn in his promenade when the scotchman sang his voice had reached henchards ears through the heartshaped holes in the windowshutters and had led him to pause outside them a long while  to be sure to be sure how that fellow does draw me he had said to himself i suppose tis because im so lonely id have given him a third share in the business to have stayed     9   when elizabethjane opened the hinged casement next morning the mellow air brought in the feel of imminent autumn almost as distinctly as if she had been in the remotest hamlet casterbridge was the complement of the rural life around not its urban opposite bees and butterflies in the cornfields at the top of the town who desired to get to the meads at the bottom took no circuitous course but flew straight down high street without any apparent consciousness that they were traversing strange latitudes and in autumn airy spheres of thistledown floated into the same street lodged upon the shop fronts blew into drains and innumerable tawny and yellow leaves skimmed along the pavement and stole through peoples doorways into their passages with a hesitating scratch on the floor like the skirts of timid visitors  hearing voices one of which was close at hand she withdrew her head and glanced from behind the windowcurtains mr henchardnow habited no longer as a great personage but as a thriving man of businesswas pausing on his way up the middle of the street and the scotchman was looking from the window adjoining her own henchard it appeared had gone a little way past the inn before he had noticed his acquaintance of the previous evening he came back a few steps donald farfrae opening the window further  and you are off soon i suppose said henchard upwards  yesalmost this moment sir said the other maybe ill walk on till the coach makes up on me  which way  the way ye are going  then shall we walk together to the top o town  if yell wait a minute said the scotchman  in a few minutes the latter emerged bag in hand henchard looked at the bag as at an enemy it showed there was no mistake about the young mans departure ah my lad he said you should have been a wise man and have stayed with me  yes yesit might have been wiser said donald looking microscopically at the houses that were furthest off it is only telling ye the truth when i say my plans are vague  they had by this time passed on from the precincts of the inn and elizabethjane heard no more she saw that they continued in conversation henchard turning to the other occasionally and emphasizing some remark with a gesture thus they passed the kings arms hotel the market house st peters churchyard wall ascending to the upper end of the long street till they were small as two grains of corn when they bent suddenly to the right into the bristol road and were out of view  he was a good manand hes gone she said to herself i was nothing to him and there was no reason why he should have wished me goodbye  the simple thought with its latent sense of slight had moulded itself out of the following little fact when the scotchman came out at the door he had by accident glanced up at her and then he had looked away again without nodding or smiling or saying a word  you are still thinking mother she said when she turned inwards  yes i am thinking of mr henchards sudden liking for that young man he was always so now surely if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all may he not take as warmly to his own kin  while they debated this question a procession of five large waggons went past laden with hay up to the bedroom windows they came in from the country and the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great part of the night to the shaft of each hung a little board on which was painted in white letters henchard cornfactor and haymerchant the spectacle renewed his wifes conviction that for her daughters sake she should strain a point to rejoin him  the discussion was continued during breakfast and the end of it was that mrs henchard decided for good or for ill to send elizabethjane with a message to henchard to the effect that his relative susan a sailors widow was in the town leaving it to him to say whether or not he would recognize her what had brought her to this determination were chiefly two things he had been described as a lonely widower and he had expressed shame for a past transaction of his life there was promise in both  if he says no she enjoined as elizabethjane stood bonnet on ready to depart if he thinks it does not become the good position he has reached to in the town to ownto let us call on him ashis distant kinfolk say then sir we would rather not intrude we will leave casterbridge as quietly as we have come and go back to our own countryi almost feel that i would rather he did say so as i have not seen him for so many years and we are solittle allied to him  and if he say yes inquired the more sanguine one  in that case answered mrs henchard cautiously ask him to write me a note saying when and how he will see usor me  elizabethjane went a few steps towards the landing and tell him continued her mother that i fully know i have no claim upon himthat i am glad to find he is thriving that i hope his life may be long and happythere go thus with a halfhearted willingness a smothered reluctance did the poor forgiving woman start her unconscious daughter on this errand  it was about ten oclock and marketday when elizabeth paced up the high street in no great hurry for to herself her position was only that of a poor relation deputed to hunt up a rich one the front doors of the private houses were mostly left open at this warm autumn time no thought of umbrella stealers disturbing the minds of the placid burgesses hence through the long straight entrance passages thus unclosed could be seen as through tunnels the mossy gardens at the back glowing with nasturtiums fuchsias scarlet geraniums bloody warriors snapdragons and dahlias this floral blaze being backed by crusted grey stonework remaining from a yet remoter casterbridge than the venerable one visible in the street the oldfashioned fronts of these houses which had older than oldfashioned backs rose sheer from the pavement into which the bow windows protruded like bastions necessitating a pleasing chassezdechassez movement to the timepressed pedestrian at every few yards he was bound also to evolve other terpsichorean figures in respect of doorsteps scrapers cellarhatches church buttresses and the overhanging angles of walls which originally unobtrusive had become bowlegged and knockkneed  in addition to these fixed obstacles which spoke so cheerfully of individual unrestraint as to boundaries movables occupied the path and roadway to a perplexing extent first the vans of the carriers in and out of casterbridge who hailed from mellstock weatherbury the hintocks shertonabbas kingsbere overcombe and many other towns and villages round their owners were numerous enough to be regarded as a tribe and had almost distinctiveness enough to be regarded as a race their vans had just arrived and were drawn up on each side of the street in close file so as to form at places a wall between the pavement and the roadway moreover every shop pitched out half its contents upon trestles and boxes on the kerb extending the display each week a little further and further into the roadway despite the expostulations of the two feeble old constables until there remained but a tortuous defile for carriages down the centre of the street which afforded fine opportunities for skill with the reins over the pavement on the sunny side of the way hung shopblinds so constructed as to give the passengers hat a smart buffet off his head as from the unseen hands of cranstouns goblin page celebrated in romantic lore  horses for sale were tied in rows their forelegs on the pavement their hind legs in the street in which position they occasionally nipped little boys by the shoulder who were passing to school and any inviting recess in front of a house that had been modestly kept back from the general line was utilized by pigdealers as a pen for their stock  the yeomen farmers dairymen and townsfolk who came to transact business in these ancient streets spoke in other ways than by articulation not to hear the words of your interlocutor in metropolitan centres is to know nothing of his meaning here the face the arms the hat the stick the body throughout spoke equally with the tongue to express satisfaction the casterbridge marketman added to his utterance a broadening of the cheeks a crevicing of the eyes a throwing back of the shoulders which was intelligible from the other end of the street if he wondered though all henchards carts and waggons were rattling past him you knew it from perceiving the inside of his crimson mouth and a targetlike circling of his eyes deliberation caused sundry attacks on the moss of adjoining walls with the end of his stick a change of his hat from the horizontal to the less so a sense of tediousness announced itself in a lowering of the person by spreading the knees to a lozengeshaped aperture and contorting the arms chicanery subterfuge had hardly a place in the streets of this honest borough to all appearance and it was said that the lawyers in the court house hard by occasionally threw in strong arguments for the other side out of pure generosity though apparently by mischance when advancing their own  thus casterbridge was in most respects but the pole focus or nerveknot of the surrounding country life differing from the many manufacturing towns which are as foreign bodies set down like boulders on a plain in a green world with which they have nothing in common casterbridge lived by agriculture at one remove further from the fountainhead than the adjoining villagesno more the townsfolk understood every fluctuation in the rustics condition for it affected their receipts as much as the labourers they entered into the troubles and joys which moved the aristocratic families ten miles roundfor the same reason and even at the dinnerparties of the professional families the subjects of discussion were corn cattledisease sowing and reaping fencing and planting while politics were viewed by them less from their own standpoint of burgesses with rights and privileges than from the standpoint of their country neighbours  all the venerable contrivances and confusions which delighted the eye by their quaintness and in a measure reasonableness in this rare old markettown were metropolitan novelties to the unpractised eyes of elizabethjane fresh from netting fishseines in a seaside cottage very little inquiry was necessary to guide her footsteps henchards house was one of the best faced with dull redandgrey old brick the front door was open and as in other houses she could see through the passage to the end of the gardennearly a quarter of a mile off  mr henchard was not in the house but in the storeyard she was conducted into the mossy garden and through a door in the wall which was studded with rusty nails speaking of generations of fruittrees that had been trained there the door opened upon the yard and here she was left to find him as she could it was a place flanked by haybarns into which tons of fodder all in trusses were being packed from the waggons she had seen pass the inn that morning on other sides of the yard were wooden granaries on stone staddles to which access was given by flemish ladders and a storehouse several floors high wherever the doors of these places were open a closely packed throng of bursting wheatsacks could be seen standing inside with the air of awaiting a famine that would not come  she wandered about this place uncomfortably conscious of the impending interview till she was quite weary of searching she ventured to inquire of a boy in what quarter mr henchard could be found he directed her to an office which she had not seen before and knocking at the door she was answered by a cry of come in  elizabeth turned the handle and there stood before her bending over some samplebags on a table not the cornmerchant but the young scotchman mr farfraein the act of pouring some grains of wheat from one hand to the other his hat hung on a peg behind him and the roses of his carpetbag glowed from the corner of the room  having toned her feelings and arranged words on her lips for mr henchard and for him alone she was for the moment confounded  yes what it is said the scotchman like a man who permanently ruled there  she said she wanted to see mr henchard  ah yes will you wait a minute hes engaged just now said the young man apparently not recognizing her as the girl at the inn he handed her a chair bade her sit down and turned to his samplebags again while elizabethjane sits waiting in great amaze at the young mans presence we may briefly explain how he came there  when the two new acquaintances had passed out of sight that morning towards the bath and bristol road they went on silently except for a few commonplaces till they had gone down an avenue on the town walls called the chalk walk leading to an angle where the north and west escarpments met from this high corner of the square earthworks a vast extent of country could be seen a footpath ran steeply down the green slope conducting from the shady promenade on the walls to a road at the bottom of the scarp it was by this path the scotchman had to descend  well heres success to ee said henchard holding out his right hand and leaning with his left upon the wicket which protected the descent in the act there was the inelegance of one whose feelings are nipped and wishes defeated i shall often think of this time and of how you came at the very moment to throw a light upon my difficulty  still holding the young mans hand he paused and then added deliberately now i am not the man to let a cause be lost for want of a word and before ye are gone for ever ill speak once more will ye stay there it is flat and plain you can see that it isnt all selfishness that makes me press ee for my business is not quite so scientific as to require an intellect entirely out of the common others would do for the place without doubt some selfishness perhaps there is but there is more it isnt for me to repeat what come bide with meand name your own terms ill agree to em willingly and ithout a word of gainsaying for hang it farfrae i like thee well  the young mans hand remained steady in henchards for a moment or two he looked over the fertile country that stretched beneath them then backward along the shaded walk reaching to the top of the town his face flushed  i never expected thisi did not he said its providence should any one go against it no ill not go to america ill stay and be your man  his hand which had lain lifeless in henchards returned the latters grasp  done said henchard  done said donald farfrae  the face of mr henchard beamed forth a satisfaction that was almost fierce in its strength now you are my friend he exclaimed come back to my house lets clinch it at once by clear terms so as to be comfortable in our minds farfrae caught up his bag and retraced the northwest avenue in henchards company as he had come henchard was all confidence now  i am the most distant fellow in the world when i dont care for a man he said but when a man takes my fancy he takes it strong now i am sure you can eat another breakfast you couldnt have eaten much so early even if they had anything at that place to gie thee which they hadnt so come to my house and we will have a solid staunch tuckin and settle terms in blackandwhite if you like though my words my bond i can always make a good meal in the morning ive got a splendid cold pigeonpie going just now you can have some homebrewed if you want to you know  it is too airly in the morning for that said farfrae with a smile  well of course i didnt know i dont drink it because of my oath but i am obliged to brew for my workpeople  thus talking they returned and entered henchards premises by the back way or traffic entrance here the matter was settled over the breakfast at which henchard heaped the young scotchmans plate to a prodigal fulness he would not rest satisfied till farfrae had written for his luggage from bristol and dispatched the letter to the postoffice when it was done this man of strong impulses declared that his new friend should take up his abode in his houseat least till some suitable lodgings could be found  he then took farfrae round and showed him the place and the stores of grain and other stock and finally entered the offices where the younger of them has already been discovered by elizabeth     10   while she still sat under the scotchmans eyes a man came up to the door reaching it as henchard opened the door of the inner office to admit elizabeth the newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple at bethesda and entered in her stead she could hear his words to henchard joshua jopp sirby appointmentthe new manager  the new managerhes in his office said henchard bluntly  in his office said the man with a stultified air  i mentioned thursday said henchard and as you did not keep your appointment i have engaged another manager at first i thought he must be you do you think i can wait when business is in question  you said thursday or saturday sir said the newcomer pulling out a letter  well you are too late said the cornfactor i can say no more  you as good as engaged me murmured the man  subject to an interview said henchard i am sorry for youvery sorry indeed but it cant be helped  there was no more to be said and the man came out encountering elizabethjane in his passage she could see that his mouth twitched with anger and that bitter disappointment was written in his face everywhere  elizabethjane now entered and stood before the master of the premises his dark pupilswhich always seemed to have a red spark of light in them though this could hardly be a physical factturned indifferently round under his dark brows until they rested on her figure now then what is it my young woman he said blandly  can i speak to younot on business sir said she  yesi suppose he looked at her more thoughtfully  i am sent to tell you sir she innocently went on that a distant relative of yours by marriage susan newson a sailors widow is in the town and to ask whether you would wish to see her  the rich rougeetnoir of his countenance underwent a slight change ohsusan isstill alive he asked with difficulty  yes sir  are you her daughter  yes sirher only daughter  whatdo you call yourselfyour christian name  elizabethjane sir  newson  elizabethjane newson  this at once suggested to henchard that the transaction of his early married life at weydon fair was unrecorded in the family history it was more than he could have expected his wife had behaved kindly to him in return for his unkindness and had never proclaimed her wrong to her child or to the world  i ama good deal interested in your news he said and as this is not a matter of business but pleasure suppose we go indoors  it was with a gentle delicacy of manner surprising to elizabeth that he showed her out of the office and through the outer room where donald farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring inspection of a beginner in charge henchard preceded her through the door in the wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and flowers and onward into the house the diningroom to which he introduced her still exhibited the remnants of the lavish breakfast laid for farfrae it was furnished to profusion with heavy mahogany furniture of the deepest redspanish hues pembroke tables with leaves hanging so low that they wellnigh touched the floor stood against the walls on legs and feet shaped like those of an elephant and on one lay three huge folio volumesa family bible a josephus and a whole duty of man in the chimney corner was a firegrate with a fluted semicircular back having urns and festoons cast in relief thereon and the chairs were of the kind which since that day has cast lustre upon the names of chippendale and sheraton though in point of fact their patterns may have been such as those illustrious carpenters never saw or heard of  sit downelizabethjanesit down he said with a shake in his voice as he uttered her name and sitting down himself he allowed his hands to hang between his knees while he looked upon the carpet your mother then is quite well  she is rather worn out sir with travelling  a sailors widowwhen did he die  father was lost last spring  henchard winced at the word father thus applied do you and she come from abroadamerica or australia he asked  no we have been in england some years i was twelve when we came here from canada  ah exactly by such conversation he discovered the circumstances which had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that he had long ago believed them to be in their graves these things being clear he returned to the present and where is your mother staying  at the three mariners  and you are her daughter elizabethjane repeated henchard he arose came close to her and glanced in her face i think he said suddenly turning away with a wet eye you shall take a note from me to your mother i should like to see hershe is not left very well off by her late husband his eye fell on elizabeths clothes which though a respectable suit of black and her very best were decidedly oldfashioned even to casterbridge eyes  not very well she said glad that he had divined this without her being obliged to express it  he sat down at the table and wrote a few lines next taking from his pocketbook a fivepound note which he put in the envelope with the letter adding to it as by an afterthought five shillings sealing the whole up carefully he directed it to mrs newson three mariners inn and handed the packet to elizabeth  deliver it to her personally please said henchard well i am glad to see you here elizabethjanevery glad we must have a long talk togetherbut not just now  he took her hand at parting and held it so warmly that she who had known so little friendship was much affected and tears rose to her aerialgrey eyes the instant that she was gone henchards state showed itself more distinctly having shut the door he sat in his diningroom stiffly erect gazing at the opposite wall as if he read his history there  begad he suddenly exclaimed jumping up i didnt think of that perhaps these are impostorsand susan and the child dead after all  however a something in elizabethjane soon assured him that as regarded her at least there could be little doubt and a few hours would settle the question of her mothers identity for he had arranged in his note to see her that evening  it never rains but it pours said henchard his keenly excited interest in his new friend the scotchman was now eclipsed by this event and donald farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that he wondered at the suddenness of his employers moods  in the meantime elizabeth had reached the inn her mother instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance was much moved at sight of it she did not read it at once asking elizabeth to describe her reception and the very words mr henchard used elizabeths back was turned when her mother opened the letter it ran thus   meet me at eight oclock this evening if you can at the ring on the budmouth road the place is easy to find i can say no more now the news upsets me almost the girl seems to be in ignorance keep her so till i have seen you m h   he said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas the amount was significant it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again she waited restlessly for the close of the day telling elizabethjane that she was invited to see mr henchard that she would go alone but she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was not at his house nor did she hand the note to elizabeth     11   the ring at casterbridge was merely the local name of one of the finest roman amphitheatres if not the very finest remaining in britain  casterbridge announced old rome in every street alley and precinct it looked roman bespoke the art of rome concealed dead men of rome it was impossible to dig more than a foot or two deep about the town fields and gardens without coming upon some tall soldier or other of the empire who had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a space of fifteen hundred years he was mostly found lying on his side in an oval scoop in the chalk like a chicken in its shell his knees drawn up to his chest sometimes with the remains of his spear against his arm a fibula or brooch of bronze on his breast or forehead an urn at his knees a jar at his throat a bottle at his mouth and mystified conjecture pouring down upon him from the eyes of casterbridge street boys and men who had turned a moment to gaze at the familiar spectacle as they passed by  imaginative inhabitants who would have felt an unpleasantness at the discovery of a comparatively modern skeleton in their gardens were quite unmoved by these hoary shapes they had lived so long ago their time was so unlike the present their hopes and motives were so widely removed from ours that between them and the living there seemed to stretch a gulf too wide for even a spirit to pass  the amphitheatre was a huge circular enclosure with a notch at opposite extremities of its diameter north and south from its sloping internal form it might have been called the spittoon of the jotuns it was to casterbridge what the ruined coliseum is to modern rome and was nearly of the same magnitude the dusk of evening was the proper hour at which a true impression of this suggestive place could be received standing in the middle of the arena at that time there by degrees became apparent its real vastness which a cursory view from the summit at noonday was apt to obscure melancholy impressive lonely yet accessible from every part of the town the historic circle was the frequent spot for appointments of a furtive kind intrigues were arranged there tentative meetings were there experimented after divisions and feuds but one kind of appointmentin itself the most common of anyseldom had place in the amphitheatre that of happy lovers  why seeing that it was preeminently an airy accessible and sequestered spot for interviews the cheerfullest form of those occurrences never took kindly to the soil of the ruin would be a curious inquiry perhaps it was because its associations had about them something sinister its history proved that apart from the sanguinary nature of the games originally played therein such incidents attached to its past as these that for scores of years the towngallows had stood at one corner that in 1705 a woman who had murdered her husband was halfstrangled and then burnt there in the presence of ten thousand spectators tradition reports that at a certain stage of the burning her heart burst and leapt out of her body to the terror of them all and that not one of those ten thousand people ever cared particularly for hot roast after that in addition to these old tragedies pugilistic encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent dates in that secluded arena entirely invisible to the outside world save by climbing to the top of the enclosure which few townspeople in the daily round of their lives ever took the trouble to do so that though close to the turnpikeroad crimes might be perpetrated there unseen at midday  some boys had latterly tried to impart gaiety to the ruin by using the central arena as a cricketground but the game usually languished for the aforesaid reasonthe dismal privacy which the earthen circle enforced shutting out every appreciative passers vision every commendatory remark from outsiderseverything except the sky and to play at games in such circumstances was like acting to an empty house possibly too the boys were timid for some old people said that at certain moments in the summer time in broad daylight persons sitting with a book or dozing in the arena had on lifting their eyes beheld the slopes lined with a gazing legion of hadrians soldiery as if watching the gladiatorial combat and had heard the roar of their excited voices that the scene would remain but a moment like a lightning flash and then disappear  it was related that there still remained under the south entrance excavated cells for the reception of the wild animals and athletes who took part in the games the arena was still smooth and circular as if used for its original purpose not so very long ago the sloping pathways by which spectators had ascended to their seats were pathways yet but the whole was grown over with grass which now at the end of summer was bearded with withered bents that formed waves under the brush of the wind returning to the attentive ear aeolian modulations and detaining for moments the flying globes of thistledown  henchard had chosen this spot as being the safest from observation which he could think of for meeting his longlost wife and at the same time as one easily to be found by a stranger after nightfall as mayor of the town with a reputation to keep up he could not invite her to come to his house till some definite course had been decided on  just before eight he approached the deserted earthwork and entered by the south path which descended over the debris of the former dens in a few moments he could discern a female figure creeping in by the great north gap or public gateway they met in the middle of the arena neither spoke just at firstthere was no necessity for speechand the poor woman leant against henchard who supported her in his arms  i dont drink he said in a low halting apologetic voice you hear susani dont drink nowi havent since that night those were his first words  he felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that she understood after a minute or two he again began  if i had known you were living susan but there was every reason to suppose you and the child were dead and gone i took every possible step to find youtravelledadvertised my opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man and had been drowned on your voyage why did you keep silent like this  o michael because of himwhat other reason could there be i thought i owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our livesfoolishly i believed there was something solemn and binding in the bargain i thought that even in honour i dared not desert him when he had paid so much for me in good faith i meet you now only as his widowi consider myself that and that i have no claim upon you had he not died i should never have comenever of that you may be sure  tsss how could you be so simple  i dont know yet it would have been very wickedif i had not thought like that said susan almost crying  yesyesso it would it is only that which makes me feel ee an innocent woman butto lead me into this  what michael she asked alarmed  why this difficulty about our living together again and elizabethjane she cannot be told allshe would so despise us both thati could not bear it  that was why she was brought up in ignorance of you i could not bear it either  wellwe must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief and getting matters straight in spite of it you have heard i am in a large way of business herethat i am mayor of the town and churchwarden and i dont know what all  yes she murmured  these things as well as the dread of the girl discovering our disgrace makes it necessary to act with extreme caution so that i dont see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter i once treated badly and banished from me and theres the rub ot  well go away at once i only came to see  no no susan you are not to goyou mistake me he said with kindly severity i have thought of this plan that you and elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow mrs newson and her daughter that i meet you court you and marry you elizabethjane coming to my house as my stepdaughter the thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking ot this would leave my shady headstrong disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened the secret would be yours and mine only and i should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof as well as my wife  i am quite in your hands michael she said meekly i came here for the sake of elizabeth for myself if you tell me to leave again tomorrow morning and never come near you more i am content to go  now now we dont want to hear that said henchard gently of course you wont leave again think over the plan i have proposed for a few hours and if you cant hit upon a better one well adopt it i have to be away for a day or two on business unfortunately but during that time you can get lodgingsthe only ones in the town fit for you are those over the chinashop in high streetand you can also look for a cottage  if the lodgings are in high street they are dear i suppose  never mindyou must start genteel if our plan is to be carried out look to me for money have you enough till i come back  quite said she  and are you comfortable at the inn  o yes  and the girl is quite safe from learning the shame of her case and oursthats what makes me most anxious of all  you would be surprised to find how unlikely she is to dream of the truth how could she ever suppose such a thing  true  i like the idea of repeating our marriage said mrs henchard after a pause it seems the only right course after all this now i think i must go back to elizabethjane and tell her that our kinsman mr henchard kindly wishes us to stay in the town  very wellarrange that yourself ill go some way with you  no no dont run any risk said his wife anxiously i can find my way backit is not late please let me go alone  right said henchard but just one word do you forgive me susan  she murmured something but seemed to find it difficult to frame her answer  never mindall in good time said he judge me by my future worksgoodbye  he retreated and stood at the upper side of the amphitheatre while his wife passed out through the lower way and descended under the trees to the town then henchard himself went homeward going so fast that by the time he reached his door he was almost upon the heels of the unconscious woman from whom he had just parted he watched her up the street and turned into his house     12   on entering his own door after watching his wife out of sight the mayor walked on through the tunnelshaped passage into the garden and thence by the back door towards the stores and granaries a light shone from the officewindow and there being no blind to screen the interior henchard could see donald farfrae still seated where he had left him initiating himself into the managerial work of the house by overhauling the books henchard entered merely observing dont let me interrupt you if ye will stay so late  he stood behind farfraes chair watching his dexterity in clearing up the numerical fogs which had been allowed to grow so thick in henchards books as almost to baffle even the scotchmans perspicacity the cornfactors mien was half admiring and yet it was not without a dash of pity for the tastes of any one who could care to give his mind to such finnikin details henchard himself was mentally and physically unfit for grubbing subtleties from soiled paper he had in a modern sense received the education of achilles and found penmanship a tantalizing art  you shall do no more tonight he said at length spreading his great hand over the paper theres time enough tomorrow come indoors with me and have some supper now you shall i am determined ont he shut the accountbooks with friendly force  donald had wished to get to his lodgings but he already saw that his friend and employer was a man who knew no moderation in his requests and impulses and he yielded gracefully he liked henchards warmth even if it inconvenienced him the great difference in their characters adding to the liking  they locked up the office and the young man followed his companion through the private little door which admitting directly into henchards garden permitted a passage from the utilitarian to the beautiful at one step the garden was silent dewy and full of perfume it extended a long way back from the house first as lawn and flowerbeds then as fruitgarden where the longtied espaliers as old as the old house itself had grown so stout and cramped and gnarled that they had pulled their stakes out of the ground and stood distorted and writhing in vegetable agony like leafy laocoons the flowers which smelt so sweetly were not discernible and they passed through them into the house  the hospitalities of the morning were repeated and when they were over henchard said pull your chair round to the fireplace my dear fellow and lets make a blazetheres nothing i hate like a black grate even in september he applied a light to the laidin fuel and a cheerful radiance spread around  it is odd said henchard that two men should meet as we have done on a purely business ground and that at the end of the first day i should wish to speak to ee on a family matter but damn it all i am a lonely man farfrae i have nobody else to speak to and why shouldnt i tell it to ee  ill be glad to hear it if i can be of any service said donald allowing his eyes to travel over the intricate woodcarvings of the chimneypiece representing garlanded lyres shields and quivers on either side of a draped oxskull and flanked by heads of apollo and diana in low relief  ive not been always what i am now continued henchard his firm deep voice being ever so little shaken he was plainly under that strange influence which sometimes prompts men to confide to the newfound friend what they will not tell to the old i began life as a working haytrusser and when i was eighteen i married on the strength o my calling would you think me a married man  i heard in the town that you were a widower  ah yesyou would naturally have heard that well i lost my wife nineteen years ago or soby my own faultthis is how it came about one summer evening i was travelling for employment and she was walking at my side carrying the baby our only child we came to a booth in a country fair i was a drinking man at that time  henchard paused a moment threw himself back so that his elbow rested on the table his forehead being shaded by his hand which however did not hide the marks of introspective inflexibility on his features as he narrated in fullest detail the incidents of the transaction with the sailor the tinge of indifference which had at first been visible in the scotchman now disappeared  henchard went on to describe his attempts to find his wife the oath he swore the solitary life he led during the years which followed i have kept my oath for nineteen years he went on i have risen to what you see me now  ay  wellno wife could i hear of in all that time and being by nature something of a womanhater i have found it no hardship to keep mostly at a distance from the sex no wife could i hear of i say till this very day and nowshe has come back  come back has she  this morningthis very morning and whats to be done  can ye no take her and live with her and make some amends  thats what ive planned and proposed but farfrae said henchard gloomily by doing right with susan i wrong another innocent woman  ye dont say that  in the nature of things farfrae it is almost impossible that a man of my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o life without making more blunders than one it has been my custom for many years to run across to jersey in the the way of business particularly in the potato and root season i do a large trade wi them in that line well one autumn when stopping there i fell quite ill and in my illness i sank into one of those gloomy fits i sometimes suffer from on account o the loneliness of my domestic life when the world seems to have the blackness of hell and like job i could curse the day that gave me birth  ah now i never feel like it said farfrae  then pray to god that you never may young man while in this state i was taken pity on by a womana young lady i should call her for she was of good family well bred and well educatedthe daughter of some harumscarum military officer who had got into difficulties and had his pay sequestrated he was dead now and her mother too and she was as lonely as i this young creature was staying at the boardinghouse where i happened to have my lodging and when i was pulled down she took upon herself to nurse me from that she got to have a foolish liking for me heaven knows why for i wasnt worth it but being together in the same house and her feeling warm we got naturally intimate i wont go into particulars of what our relations were it is enough to say that we honestly meant to marry there arose a scandal which did me no harm but was of course ruin to her though farfrae between you and me as man and man i solemnly declare that philandering with womankind has neither been my vice nor my virtue she was terribly careless of appearances and i was perhaps more because o my dreary state and it was through this that the scandal arose at last i was well and came away when i was gone she suffered much on my account and didnt forget to tell me so in letters one after another till latterly i felt i owed her something and thought that as i had not heard of susan for so long i would make this other one the only return i could make and ask her if she would run the risk of susan being alive very slight as i believed and marry me such as i was she jumped for joy and we should no doubt soon have been marriedbut behold susan appears  donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the degree of his simple experiences  now see what injury a man may cause around him even after that wrongdoing at the fair when i was young if i had never been so selfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at jersey to the injury of her name all might now be well yet as it stands i must bitterly disappoint one of these women and it is the second my first duty is to susantheres no doubt about that  they are both in a very melancholy position and thats true murmured donald  they are for myself i dont caretwill all end one way but these two henchard paused in reverie i feel i should like to treat the second no less than the first as kindly as a man can in such a case  ah well it cannet be helped said the other with philosophic woefulness you mun write to the young lady and in your letter you must put it plain and honest that it turns out she cannet be your wife the first having come back that ye cannet see her more and thatye wish her weel  that wont do od seize it i must do a little more than that i mustthough she did always brag about her rich uncle or rich aunt and her expectations from emi must send a useful sum of money to her i supposejust as a little recompense poor girlnow will you help me in this and draw up an explanation to her of all ive told ye breaking it as gently as you can im so bad at letters  and i will  now i havent told you quite all yet my wife susan has my daughter with herthe baby that was in her arms at the fair and this girl knows nothing of me beyond that i am some sort of relation by marriage she has grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom i made over her mother and who is now dead was her father and her mothers husband what her mother has always felt she and i together feel nowthat we cant proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth now what would you doi want your advice  i think id run the risk and tell her the truth shell forgive ye both  never said henchard i am not going to let her know the truth her mother and i be going to marry again and it will not only help us to keep our childs respect but it will be more proper susan looks upon herself as the sailors widow and wont think o living with me as formerly without another religious ceremonyand shes right  farfrae thereupon said no more the letter to the young jersey woman was carefully framed by him and the interview ended henchard saying as the scotchman left i feel it a great relief farfrae to tell some friend o this you see now that the mayor of casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket  i do and im sorry for ye said farfrae  when he was gone henchard copied the letter and enclosing a cheque took it to the postoffice from which he walked back thoughtfully  can it be that it will go off so easily he said poor thinggod knows now then to make amends to susan     13   the cottage which michael henchard hired for his wife susan under her name of newsonin pursuance of their planwas in the upper or western part of the town near the roman wall and the avenue which overshadowed it the evening sun seemed to shine more yellowly there than anywhere else this autumnstretching its rays as the hours grew later under the lowest sycamore boughs and steeping the groundfloor of the dwelling with its green shutters in a substratum of radiance which the foliage screened from the upper parts beneath these sycamores on the town walls could be seen from the sittingroom the tumuli and earth forts of the distant uplands making it altogether a pleasant spot with the usual touch of melancholy that a pastmarked prospect lends  as soon as the mother and daughter were comfortably installed with a whiteaproned servant and all complete henchard paid them a visit and remained to tea during the entertainment elizabeth was carefully hoodwinked by the very general tone of the conversation that prevaileda proceeding which seemed to afford some humour to henchard though his wife was not particularly happy in it the visit was repeated again and again with businesslike determination by the mayor who seemed to have schooled himself into a course of strict mechanical rightness towards this woman of prior claim at any expense to the later one and to his own sentiments  one afternoon the daughter was not indoors when henchard came and he said drily this is a very good opportunity for me to ask you to name the happy day susan  the poor woman smiled faintly she did not enjoy pleasantries on a situation into which she had entered solely for the sake of her girls reputation she liked them so little indeed that there was room for wonder why she had countenanced deception at all and had not bravely let the girl know her history but the flesh is weak and the true explanation came in due course  o michael she said i am afraid all this is taking up your time and giving troublewhen i did not expect any such thing and she looked at him and at his dress as a man of affluence and at the furniture he had provided for the roomornate and lavish to her eyes  not at all said henchard in rough benignity this is only a cottageit costs me next to nothing and as to taking up my timehere his red and black visage kindled with satisfactionive a splendid fellow to superintend my business nowa man whose like ive never been able to lay hands on before i shall soon be able to leave everything to him and have more time to call my own than ive had for these last twenty years  henchards visits here grew so frequent and so regular that it soon became whispered and then openly discussed in casterbridge that the masterful coercive mayor of the town was raptured and enervated by the genteel widow mrs newson his wellknown haughty indifference to the society of womankind his silent avoidance of converse with the sex contributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic matter enough that such a poor fragile woman should be his choice was inexplicable except on the ground that the engagement was a family affair in which sentimental passion had no place for it was known that they were related in some way mrs henchard was so pale that the boys called her the ghost sometimes henchard overheard this epithet when they passed together along the walksas the avenues on the walls were namedat which his face would darken with an expression of destructiveness towards the speakers ominous to see but he said nothing  he pressed on the preparations for his union or rather reunion with this pale creature in a dogged unflinching spirit which did credit to his conscientiousness nobody would have conceived from his outward demeanour that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt great house nothing but three large resolvesone to make amends to his neglected susan another to provide a comfortable home for elizabethjane under his paternal eye and a third to castigate himself with the thorns which these restitutory acts brought in their train among them the lowering of his dignity in public opinion by marrying so comparatively humble a woman  susan henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life when she stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the weddingday to take her and elizabethjane to church it was a windless morning of warm november rain which floated down like meal and lay in a powdery form on the nap of hats and coats few people had gathered round the church door though they were well packed within the scotchman who assisted as groomsman was of course the only one present beyond the chief actors who knew the true situation of the contracting parties he however was too inexperienced too thoughtful too judicial too strongly conscious of the serious side of the business to enter into the scene in its dramatic aspect that required the special genius of christopher coney solomon longways buzzford and their fellows but they knew nothing of the secret though as the time for coming out of church drew on they gathered on the pavement adjoining and expounded the subject according to their lights  tis fiveandforty years since i had my settlement in this here town said coney but daze me if i ever see a man wait so long before to take so little theres a chance even for thee after this nance mockridge the remark was addressed to a woman who stood behind his shoulderthe same who had exhibited henchards bad bread in

and as for hewell therelowering her voice tis said a was a poor parish prenticei wouldnt say it for all the worldbut a was a poor parish prentice that began life wi no more belonging to en than a carrion crow  and now hes worth ever so much a minute murmured longways when a man is said to be worth so much a minute hes a man to be considered  turning he saw a circular disc reticulated with creases and recognized the smiling countenance of the fat woman who had asked for another song at the three mariners well mother cuxsom he said hows this heres mrs newson a mere skellinton has got

sure ah the miles i used to walk then and now i can hardly step over a furrow  their reminiscences were cut short by the appearance of the reunited pairhenchard looking round upon the idlers with that ambiguous gaze of his which at one moment seemed to mean satisfaction and at another fiery disdain  welltheres a difference between em though he do call himself a teetotaller said nance mockridge shell wish her cake dough afore shes done of him theres a bluebeardy look about en and twill out in time  stuffhes well enough some folk want their luck buttered if i had a choice as wide as the ocean sea i wouldnt wish for a better man a poor twanking woman like hertis a godsend for her and hardly a pair of jumps or nightrail to her name  the plain little brougham drove off in the mist and the idlers dispersed well we hardly know how to look at things in these times said solomon there was a man dropped down dead yesterday not so very many miles from here and what wi that and this moist weather tis scarce worth ones while to begin any work o consequence today im in such a low key with drinking nothing but small table ninepenny this last week or two that i shall call and warm up at the marners as i pass along  i dont know but that i may as well go with ee solomon said christopher im as clammy as a cocklesnail     14   a martinmas summer of mrs henchards life set in with her entry into her husbands large house and respectable social orbit and it was as bright as such summers well can be lest she should pine for deeper affection than he could give he made a point of showing some semblance of it in external action among other things he had the iron railings that had smiled sadly in dull rust for the last eighty years painted a bright green and the heavybarred smallpaned georgian sash windows enlivened with three coats of white he was as kind to her as a man mayor and churchwarden could possibly be the house was large the rooms lofty and the landings wide and the two unassuming women scarcely made a perceptible addition to its contents  to elizabethjane the time was a most triumphant one the freedom she experienced the indulgence with which she was treated went beyond her expectations the reposeful easy affluent life to which her mothers marriage had introduced her was in truth the beginning of a great change in elizabeth she found she could have nice personal possessions and ornaments for the asking and as the mediaeval saying puts it take have and keep are pleasant words with peace of mind came development and with development beauty knowledgethe result of great natural insightshe did not lack learning accomplishmentthose alas she had not but as the winter and spring passed by her thin face and figure filled out in rounder and softer curves the lines and contractions upon her young brow went away the muddiness of skin which she had looked upon as her lot by nature departed with a change to abundance of good things and a bloom came upon her cheek perhaps too her grey thoughtful eyes revealed an arch gaiety sometimes but this was infrequent the sort of wisdom which looked from their pupils did not readily keep company with these lighter moods like all people who have known rough times lightheartedness seemed to her too irrational and inconsequent to be indulged in except as a reckless dram now and then for she had been too early habituated to anxious reasoning to drop the habit suddenly she felt none of those ups and downs of spirit which beset so many people without cause neverto paraphrase a recent poetnever a gloom in elizabethjanes soul but she well knew how it came there and her present cheerfulness was fairly proportionate to her solid guarantees for the same  it might have been supposed that given a girl rapidly becoming goodlooking comfortably circumstanced and for the first time in her life commanding ready money she would go and make a fool of herself by dress but no the reasonableness of almost everything that elizabeth did was nowhere more conspicuous than in this question of clothes to keep in the rear of opportunity in matters of indulgence is as valuable a habit as to keep abreast of opportunity in matters of enterprise this unsophisticated girl did it by an innate perceptiveness that was almost genius thus she refrained from bursting out like a waterflower that spring and clothing herself in puffings and knickknacks as most of the casterbridge girls would have done in her circumstances her triumph was tempered by circumspection she had still that fieldmouse fear of the coulter of destiny despite fair promise which is common among the thoughtful who have suffered early from poverty and oppression  i wont be too gay on any account she would say to herself it would be tempting providence to hurl mother and me down and afflict us again as he used to do  we now see her in a black silk bonnet velvet mantle or silk spencer dark dress and carrying a sunshade in this latter article she drew the line at fringe and had it plain edged with a little ivory ring for keeping it closed it was odd about the necessity for that sunshade she discovered that with the clarification of her complexion and the birth of pink cheeks her skin had grown more sensitive to the suns rays she protected those cheeks forthwith deeming spotlessness part of womanliness  henchard had become very fond of her and she went out with him more frequently than with her mother now her appearance one day was so attractive that he looked at her critically  i happened to have the ribbon by me so i made it up she faltered thinking him perhaps dissatisfied with some rather bright trimming she had donned for the first time  ayof courseto be sure he replied in his leonine way do as you likeor rather as your mother advises ye od sendive nothing to say tot  indoors she appeared with her hair divided by a parting that arched like a white rainbow from ear to ear all in front of this line was covered with a thick encampment of curls all behind was dressed smoothly and drawn to a knob  the three members of the family were sitting at breakfast one day and henchard was looking silently as he often did at this head of hair which in colour was brownrather light than dark i thought elizabethjanes hairdidnt you tell me that elizabethjanes hair promised to be black when she was a baby he said to his wife  she looked startled jerked his foot warningly and murmured did i  as soon as elizabeth was gone to her own room henchard resumed begad i nearly forgot myself just now what i meant was that the girls hair certainly looked as if it would be darker when she was a baby  it did but they alter so replied susan  their hair gets darker i knowbut i wasnt aware it lightened ever  o yes and the same uneasy expression came out on her face to which the future held the key it passed as henchard went on  well so much the better now susan i want to have her called miss henchardnot miss newson lots o people do it already in carelessnessit is her legal nameso it may as well be made her usual namei dont like tother name at all for my own flesh and blood ill advertise it in the casterbridge paperthats the way they do it she wont object  no o no but  well then i shall do it he said peremptorily surely if shes willing you must wish it as much as i  o yesif she agrees let us do it by all means she replied  then mrs henchard acted somewhat inconsistently it might have been called falsely but that her manner was emotional and full of the earnestness of one who wishes to do right at great hazard she went to elizabethjane whom she found sewing in her own sittingroom upstairs and told her what had been proposed about her surname can you agreeis it not a slight upon newsonnow hes dead and gone  elizabeth reflected ill think of it mother she answered  when later in the day she saw henchard she adverted to the matter at once in a way which showed that the line of feeling started by her mother had been persevered in do you wish this change so very much sir she asked  wish it why my blessed fathers what an ado you women make about a trifle i proposed itthats all now lizabethjane just please yourself curse me if i care what you do now you understand dont ee go agreeing to it to please me  here the subject dropped and nothing more was said and nothing was done and elizabeth still passed as miss newson and not by her legal name  meanwhile the great corn and hay traffic conducted by henchard throve under the management of donald farfrae as it had never thriven before it had formerly moved in jolts now it went on oiled casters the old crude viva voce system of henchard in which everything depended upon his memory and bargains were made by the tongue alone was swept away letters and ledgers took the place of ill dot and you shall haet and as in all such cases of advance the rugged picturesqueness of the old method disappeared with its inconveniences  the position of elizabethjanes roomrather high in the house so that it commanded a view of the haystores and granaries across the gardenafforded her opportunity for accurate observation of what went on there she saw that donald and mr henchard were inseparables when walking together henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his managers shoulder as if farfrae were a younger brother bearing so heavily that his slight frame bent under the weight occasionally she would hear a perfect cannonade of laughter from henchard arising from something donald had said the latter looking quite innocent and not laughing at all in henchards somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young man as desirable for comradeship as he was useful for consultations donalds brightness of intellect maintained in the cornfactor the admiration it had won at the first hour of their meeting the poor opinion and but illconcealed that he entertained of the slim farfraes physical girth strength and dash was more than counterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains  her quiet eye discerned that henchards tigerish affection for the younger man his constant liking to have farfrae near him now and then resulted in a tendency to domineer which however was checked in a moment when donald exhibited marks of real offence one day looking down on their figures from on high she heard the latter remark as they stood in the doorway between the garden and yard that their habit of walking and driving about together rather neutralized farfraes value as a second pair of eyes which should be used in places where the principal was not od damn it cried henchard whats all the world i like a fellow to talk to now come along and hae some supper and dont take too much thought about things or yell drive me crazy  when she walked with her mother on the other hand she often beheld the scotchman looking at them with a curious interest the fact that he had met her at the three mariners was insufficient to account for it since on the occasions on which she had entered his room he had never raised his eyes besides it was at her mother more particularly than at herself that he looked to elizabethjanes halfconscious simpleminded perhaps pardonable disappointment thus she could not account for this interest by her own attractiveness and she decided that it might be apparent onlya way of turning his eyes that mr farfrae had  she did not divine the ample explanation of his manner without personal vanity that was afforded by the fact of donald being the depositary of henchards confidence in respect of his past treatment of the pale chastened mother who walked by her side her conjectures on that past never went further than faint ones based on things casually heard and seenmere guesses that henchard and her mother might have been lovers in their younger days who had quarrelled and parted  casterbridge as has been hinted was a place deposited in the block upon a cornfield there was no suburb in the modern sense or transitional intermixture of town and down it stood with regard to the wide fertile land adjoining cleancut and distinct like a chessboard on a green tablecloth the farmers boy could sit under his barleymow and pitch a stone into the officewindow of the townclerk reapers at work among the sheaves nodded to acquaintances standing on the pavementcorner the redrobed judge when he condemned a sheepstealer pronounced sentence to the tune of baa that floated in at the window from the remainder of the flock browsing hard by and at executions the waiting crowd stood in a meadow immediately before the drop out of which the cows had been temporarily driven to give the spectators room  the corn grown on the upland side of the borough was garnered by farmers who lived in an eastern purlieu called durnover here wheatricks overhung the old roman street and thrust their eaves against the church tower greenthatched barns with doorways as high as the gates of solomons temple opened directly upon the main thoroughfare barns indeed were so numerous as to alternate with every halfdozen houses along the way here lived burgesses who daily walked the fallow shepherds in an intramural squeeze a street of farmers homesteadsa street ruled by a mayor and corporation yet echoing with the thump of the flail the flutter of the winnowingfan and the purr of the milk into the pailsa street which had nothing urban in it whateverthis was the durnover end of casterbridge  henchard as was natural dealt largely with this nursery or bed of small farmers close at handand his waggons were often down that way one day when arrangements were in progress for getting home corn from one of the aforesaid farms elizabethjane received a note by hand asking her to oblige the writer by coming at once to a granary on durnover hill as this was the granary whose contents henchard was removing she thought the request had something to do with his business and proceeded thither as soon as she had put on her bonnet the granary was just within the farmyard and stood on stone staddles high enough for persons to walk under the gates were open but nobody was within however she entered and waited presently she saw a figure approaching the gatethat of donald farfrae he looked up at the church clock and came in by some unaccountable shyness some wish not to meet him there alone she quickly ascended the stepladder leading to the granary door and entered it before he had seen her farfrae advanced imagining himself in solitude and a few drops of rain beginning to fall he moved and stood under the shelter where she had just been standing here he leant against one of the staddles and gave himself up to patience he too was plainly expecting some one could it be herself if so why in a few minutes he looked at his watch and then pulled out a note a duplicate of the one she had herself received  this situation began to be very awkward and the longer she waited the more awkward it became to emerge from a door just above his head and descend the ladder and show she had been in hiding there would look so very foolish that she still waited on a winnowing machine stood close beside her and to relieve her suspense she gently moved the handle whereupon a cloud of wheat husks flew out into her face and covered her clothes and bonnet and stuck into the fur of her victorine he must have heard the slight movement for he looked up and then ascended the steps  ahits miss newson he said as soon as he could see into the granary i didnt know you were there i have kept the appointment and am at your service  o mr farfrae she faltered so have i but i didnt know it was you who wished to see me otherwise i  i wished to see you o noat least that is i am afraid there may be a mistake  didnt you ask me to come here didnt you write this elizabeth held out her note  no indeed at no hand would i have thought of it and for youdidnt you ask me this is not your writing and he held up his  by no means  and is that really so then its somebody wanting to see us both perhaps we would do well to wait a little longer  acting on this consideration they lingered elizabethjanes face being arranged to an expression of preternatural composure and the young scot at every footstep in the street without looking from under the granary to see if the passer were about to enter and declare himself their summoner they watched individual drops of rain creeping down the thatch of the opposite rickstraw after strawtill they reached the bottom but nobody came and the granary roof began to drip  the person is not likely to be coming said farfrae its a trick perhaps and if so its a great pity to waste our time like this and so much to be done  tis a great liberty said elizabeth  its true miss newson well hear news of this some day depend ont and who it was that did it i wouldnt stand for it hindering myself but you miss newson  i dont mindmuch she replied  neither do i  they lapsed again into silence you are anxious to get back to scotland i suppose mr farfrae she inquired  o no miss newson why would i be  i only supposed you might be from the song you sang at the three marinersabout scotland and home i meanwhich you seemed to feel so deep down in your heart so that we all felt for you  ayand i did sing therei didbut miss newsonand donalds voice musically undulated between two semitones as it always did when he became earnestits well you feel a song for a few minutes and your eyes they get quite tearful but you finish it and for all you felt you dont mind it or think of it again for a long while o no i dont want to go back yet ill sing the song to you wi pleasure whenever you like i could sing it now and not mind at all  thank you indeed but i fear i must gorain or no  ay then miss newson ye had better say nothing about this hoax and take no heed of it and if the person should say anything to you be civil to him or her as if you did not mind itso youll take the clever persons laugh away in speaking his eyes became fixed upon her dress still sown with wheat husks theres husks and dust on you perhaps you dont know it he said in tones of extreme delicacy and its very bad to let rain come upon clothes when theres chaff on them it washes in and spoils them let me help youblowing is the best  as elizabeth neither assented nor dissented donald farfrae began blowing her back hair and her side hair and her neck and the crown of her bonnet and the fur of her victorine elizabeth saying o thank you at every puff at last she was fairly clean though farfrae having got over his first concern at the situation seemed in no manner of hurry to be gone  ahnow ill go and get ye an umbrella he said  she declined the offer stepped out and was gone farfrae walked slowly after looking thoughtfully at her diminishing figure and whistling in undertones as i came down through cannobie     15   at first miss newsons budding beauty was not regarded with much interest by anybody in casterbridge donald farfraes gaze it is true was now attracted by the mayors socalled stepdaughter but he was only one the truth is that she was but a poor illustrative instance of the prophet baruchs sly definition the virgin that loveth to go gay  when she walked abroad she seemed to be occupied with an inner chamber of ideas and to have slight need for visible objects she formed curious resolves on checking gay fancies in the matter of clothes because it was inconsistent with her past life to blossom gaudily the moment she had become possessed of money but nothing is more insidious than the evolution of wishes from mere fancies and of wants from mere wishes henchard gave elizabethjane a box of delicatelytinted gloves one spring day she wanted to wear them to show her appreciation of his kindness but she had no bonnet that would harmonize as an artistic indulgence she thought she would have such a bonnet when she had a bonnet that would go with the gloves she had no dress that would go with the bonnet it was now absolutely necessary to finish she ordered the requisite article and found that she had no sunshade to go with the dress in for a penny in for a pound she bought the sunshade and the whole structure was at last complete  everybody was attracted and some said that her bygone simplicity was the art that conceals art the delicate imposition of rochefoucauld she had produced an effect a contrast and it had been done on purpose as a matter of fact this was not true but it had its result for as soon as casterbridge thought her artful it thought her worth notice it is the first time in my life that i have been so much admired she said to herself though perhaps it is by those whose admiration is not worth having  but donald farfrae admired her too and altogether the time was an exciting one sex had never before asserted itself in her so strongly for in former days she had perhaps been too impersonally human to be distinctively feminine after an unprecedented success one day she came indoors went upstairs and leant upon her bed face downwards quite forgetting the possible creasing and damage good heaven she whispered can it be here am i setting up as the town beauty  when she had thought it over her usual fear of exaggerating appearances engendered a deep sadness there is something wrong in all this she mused if they only knew what an unfinished girl i amthat i cant talk italian or use globes or show any of the accomplishments they learn at boarding schools how they would despise me better sell all this finery and buy myself grammarbooks and dictionaries and a history of all the philosophies  she looked from the window and saw henchard and farfrae in the hayyard talking with that impetuous cordiality on the mayors part and genial modesty on the younger mans that was now so generally observable in their intercourse friendship between man and man what a rugged strength there was in it as evinced by these two and yet the seed that was to lift the foundation of this friendship was at that moment taking root in a chink of its structure  it was about six oclock the men were dropping off homeward one by one the last to leave was a roundshouldered blinking young man of nineteen or twenty whose mouth fell ajar on the slightest provocation seemingly because there was no chin to support it henchard called aloud to him as he went out of the gate hereabel whittle  whittle turned and ran back a few steps yes sir he said in breathless deprecation as if he knew what was coming next  once morebe in time tomorrow morning you see whats to be done and you hear what i say and you know im not going to be trifled with any longer  yes sir then abel whittle left and henchard and farfrae and elizabeth saw no more of them  now there was good reason for this command on henchards part poor abel as he was called had an inveterate habit of oversleeping himself and coming late to his work his anxious will was to be among the earliest but if his comrades omitted to pull the string that he always tied round his great toe and left hanging out the window for that purpose his will was as wind he did not arrive in time  as he was often second hand at the hayweighing or at the crane which lifted the sacks or was one of those who had to accompany the waggons into the country to fetch away stacks that had been purchased this affliction of abels was productive of much inconvenience for two mornings in the present week he had kept the others waiting nearly an hour hence henchards threat it now remained to be seen what would happen tomorrow  six oclock struck and there was no whittle at halfpast six henchard entered the yard the waggon was horsed that abel was to accompany and the other man had been waiting twenty minutes then henchard swore and whittle coming up breathless at that instant the cornfactor turned on him and declared with an oath that this was the last time that if he were behind once more by god he would come and drag him out o bed  there is sommit wrong in my make your worshipful said abel especially in the inside whereas my poor dumb brain gets as dead as a clot afore ive said my few scrags of prayers yesit came on as a stripling just afore id got mans wages whereas i never enjoy my bed at all for no sooner do i lie down than i be asleep and afore i be awake i be up ive fretted my gizzard green about it maister but what can i do now last night afore i went to bed i only had a scantling o cheese and  i dont want to hear it roared henchard tomorrow the waggons must start at four and if youre not here stand clear ill mortify thy flesh for thee  but let me clear up my points your worshipful  henchard turned away  he asked me and he questioned me and then a wouldnt hear my points said abel to the yard in general now i shall twitch like a momenthand all night tonight for fear o him  the journey to be taken by the waggons next day was a long one into blackmoor vale and at four oclock lanterns were moving about the yard but abel was missing before either of the other men could run to abels and warn him henchard appeared in the garden doorway wheres abel whittle not come after all ive said now ill carry out my word by my blessed fathersnothing else will do him any good im going up that way  henchard went off entered abels house a little cottage in back street the door of which was never locked because the inmates had nothing to lose reaching whittles bedside the cornfactor shouted a bass note so vigorously that abel started up instantly and beholding henchard standing over him was galvanized into spasmodic movements which had not much relation to getting on his clothes  out of bed sir and off to the granary or you leave my employ today tis to teach ye a lesson march on never mind your breeches  the unhappy whittle threw on his sleeve waistcoat and managed to get into his boots at the bottom of the stairs while henchard thrust his hat over his head whittle then trotted on down back street henchard walking sternly behind  just at this time farfrae who had been to henchards house to look for him came out of the back gate and saw something white fluttering in the morning gloom which he soon perceived to be part of abels shirt that showed below his waistcoat  for maircys sake what objects this said farfrae following abel into the yard henchard being some way in the rear by this time  ye see mr farfrae gibbered abel with a resigned smile of terror he said hed mortify my flesh if so be i didnt get up sooner and now hes adoing ont ye see it cant be helped mr farfrae things do happen queer sometimes yesill go to blackmoor vale half naked as i be since he do command but i shall kill myself afterwards i cant outlive the disgrace for the womenfolk will be looking out of their winders at my mortification all the way along and laughing me to scorn as a man ithout breeches you know how i feel such things maister farfrae and how forlorn thoughts get hold upon me yesi shall do myself harmi feel it coming on  get back home and slip on your breeches and come to wark like a man if ye go not youll hae your death standing there  im afeard i mustnt mr henchard said  i dont care what mr henchard said nor anybody else tis simple foolishness to do this go and dress yourself instantly whittle  hullo hullo said henchard coming up behind whos sending him back  all the men looked towards farfrae  i am said donald i say this joke has been carried far enough  and i say it hasnt get up in the waggon whittle  not if i am manager said farfrae he either goes home or i march out of this yard for good  henchard looked at him with a face stern and red but he paused for a moment and their eyes met donald went up to him for he saw in henchards look that he began to regret this  come said donald quietly a man o your position should ken better sir it is tyrannical and no worthy of you  tis not tyrannical murmured henchard like a sullen boy it is to make him remember he presently added in a tone of one bitterly hurt why did you speak to me before them like that farfrae you might have stopped till we were alone ahi know why ive told ye the secret o my lifefool that i was to dotand you take advantage of me  i had forgot it said farfrae simply  henchard looked on the ground said nothing more and turned away during the day farfrae learnt from the men that henchard had kept abels old mother in coals and snuff all the previous winter which made him less antagonistic to the cornfactor but henchard continued moody and silent and when one of the men inquired of him if some oats should be hoisted to an upper floor or not he said shortly ask mr farfrae hes master here  morally he was there could be no doubt of it henchard who had hitherto been the most admired man in his circle was the most admired no longer one day the daughters of a deceased farmer in durnover wanted an opinion of the value of their haystack and sent a messenger to ask mr farfrae to oblige them with one the messenger who was a child met in the yard not farfrae but henchard  very well he said ill come  but please will mr farfrae come said the child  i am going that waywhy mr farfrae said henchard with the fixed look of thought why do people always want mr farfrae  i suppose because they like him sothats what they say  ohi seethats what they sayhey they like him because hes cleverer than mr henchard and because he knows more and in short mr henchard cant hold a candle to himhey  yesthats just it sirsome of it  oh theres more of course theres more what besides come heres a sixpence for a fairing  and hes better tempered and henchards a fool to him they say and when some of the women were awalking home they said hes a dimenthes a chap o waxhes the besthes the horse for my money says they and they said hes the most understanding man o them two by long chalks i wish he was the master instead of henchard they said  theyll talk any nonsense henchard replied with covered gloom well you can go now and i am coming to value the hay dye heari the boy departed and henchard murmured wish he were master here do they  he went towards durnover on his way he overtook farfrae they walked on together henchard looking mostly on the ground  youre no yoursel the day donald inquired  yes i am very well said henchard  but ye are a bit downsurely ye are down why theres nothing to be angry about tis splendid stuff that weve got from blackmoor vale by the by the people in durnover want their hay valued  yes i am going there  ill go with ye  as henchard did not reply donald practised a piece of music sotto voce till getting near the bereaved peoples door he stopped himself with  ah as their father is dead i wont go on with such as that how could i forget  do you care so very much about hurting folks feelings observed henchard with a half sneer you do i knowespecially mine  i am sorry if i have hurt yours sir replied donald standing still with a second expression of the same sentiment in the regretfulness of his face why should you say itthink it  the cloud lifted from henchards brow and as donald finished the cornmerchant turned to him regarding his breast rather than his face  i have been hearing things that vexed me he said twas that made me short in my mannermade me overlook what you really are now i dont want to go in here about this hayfarfrae you can do it better than i they sent for ee too i have to attend a meeting of the town council at eleven and tis drawing on fort  they parted thus in renewed friendship donald forbearing to ask henchard for meanings that were not very plain to him on henchards part there was now again repose and yet whenever he thought of farfrae it was with a dim dread and he often regretted that he had told the young man his whole heart and confided to him the secrets of his life     16   on this account henchards manner towards farfrae insensibly became more reserved he was courteoustoo courteousand farfrae was quite surprised at the good breeding which now for the first time showed itself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought undisciplined if warm and sincere the cornfactor seldom or never again put his arm upon the young mans shoulder so as to nearly weigh him down with the pressure of mechanized friendship he left off coming to donalds lodgings and shouting into the passage hoy farfrae boy come and have some dinner with us dont sit here in solitary confinement but in the daily routine of their business there was little change  thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had recently taken place  for some time casterbridge by nature slow made no response then one day donald farfrae broached the subject to henchard by asking if he would have any objection to lend some rickcloths to himself and a few others who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on the day named and required a shelter for the same to which they might charge admission at the rate of so much a head  have as many cloths as you like henchard replied  when his manager had gone about the business henchard was fired with emulation it certainly had been very remiss of him as mayor he thought to call no meeting ere this to discuss what should be done on this holiday but farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as to give oldfashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative however it was not too late and on second thoughts he determined to take upon his own shoulders the responsibility of organizing some amusements if the other councilmen would leave the matter in his hands to this they quite readily agreed the majority being fine old crusted characters who had a decided taste for living without worry  so henchard set about his preparations for a really brilliant thingsuch as should be worthy of the venerable town as for farfraes little affair henchard nearly forgot it except once now and then when on it coming into his mind he said to himself charge admission at so much a headjust like a scotchmanwho is going to pay anything a head the diversions which the mayor intended to provide were to be entirely free  he had grown so dependent upon donald that he could scarcely resist calling him in to consult but by sheer selfcoercion he refrained no he thought farfrae would be suggesting such improvements in his damned luminous way that in spite of himself he henchard would sink to the position of second fiddle and only scrape harmonies to his managers talents  everybody applauded the mayors proposed entertainment especially when it became known that he meant to pay for it all himself  close to the town was an elevated green spot surrounded by an ancient square earthworkearthworks square and not square were as common as blackberries hereabouta spot whereon the casterbridge people usually held any kind of merrymaking meeting or sheepfair that required more space than the streets would afford on one side it sloped to the river froom and from any point a view was obtained of the country round for many miles this pleasant upland was to be the scene of henchards exploit  he advertised about the town in long posters of a pink colour that games of all sorts would take place here and set to work a little battalion of men under his own eye they erected greasypoles for climbing with smoked hams and local cheeses at the top they placed hurdles in rows for jumping over across the river they laid a slippery pole with a live pig of the neighbourhood tied at the other end to become the property of the man who could walk over and get it there were also provided wheelbarrows for racing donkeys for the same a stage for boxing wrestling and drawing blood generally sacks for jumping in moreover not forgetting his principles henchard provided a mammoth tea of which everybody who lived in the borough was invited to partake without payment the tables were laid parallel with the inner slope of the rampart and awnings were stretched overhead  passing to and fro the mayor beheld the unattractive exterior of farfraes erection in the west walk rickcloths of different sizes and colours being hung up to the arching trees without any regard to appearance he was easy in his mind now for his own preparations far transcended these  the morning came the sky which had been remarkably clear down to within a day or two was overcast and the weather threatening the wind having an unmistakable hint of water in it henchard wished he had not been quite so sure about the continuance of a fair season but it was too late to modify or postpone and the proceedings went on at twelve oclock the rain began to fall small and steady commencing and increasing so insensibly that it was difficult to state exactly when dry weather ended or wet established itself in an hour the slight moisture resolved itself into a monotonous smiting of earth by heaven in torrents to which no end could be prognosticated  a number of people had heroically gathered in the field but by three oclock henchard discerned that his project was doomed to end in failure the hams at the top of the poles dripped watered smoke in the form of a brown liquor the pig shivered in the wind the grain of the deal tables showed through the sticking tablecloths for the awning allowed the rain to drift under at its will and to enclose the sides at this hour seemed a useless undertaking the landscape over the river disappeared the wind played on the tentcords in aeolian improvisations and at length rose to such a pitch that the whole erection slanted to the ground those who had taken shelter within it having to crawl out on their hands and knees  but towards six the storm abated and a drier breeze shook the moisture from the grass bents it seemed possible to carry out the programme after all the awning was set up again the band was called out from its shelter and ordered to begin and where the tables had stood a place was cleared for dancing  but where are the folk said henchard after the lapse of halfanhour during which time only two men and a woman had stood up to dance the shops are all shut why dont they come  they are at farfraes affair in the west walk answered a councilman who stood in the field with the mayor  a few i suppose but where are the body o em  all out of doors are there  then the more fools they  henchard walked away moodily one or two young fellows gallantly came to climb the poles to save the hams from being wasted but as there were no spectators and the whole scene presented the most melancholy appearance henchard gave orders that the proceedings were to be suspended and the entertainment closed the food to be distributed among the poor people of the town in a short time nothing was left in the field but a few hurdles the tents and the poles  henchard returned to his house had tea with his wife and daughter and then walked out it was now dusk he soon saw that the tendency of all promenaders was towards a particular spot in the walks and eventually proceeded thither himself the notes of a stringed band came from the enclosure that farfrae had erectedthe pavilion as he called itand when the mayor reached it he perceived that a gigantic tent had been ingeniously constructed without poles or ropes the densest point of the avenue of sycamores had been selected where the boughs made a closely interlaced vault overhead to these boughs the canvas had been hung and a barrel roof was the result the end towards the wind was enclosed the other end was open henchard went round and saw the interior  in form it was like the nave of a cathedral with one gable removed but the scene within was anything but devotional a reel or fling of some sort was in progress and the usually sedate farfrae was in the midst of the other dancers in the costume of a wild highlander flinging himself about and spinning to the tune for a moment henchard could not help laughing then he perceived the immense admiration for the scotchman that revealed itself in the womens faces and when this exhibition was over and a new dance proposed and donald had disappeared for a time to return in his natural garments he had an unlimited choice of partners every girl being in a comingon disposition towards one who so thoroughly understood the poetry of motion as he  all the town crowded to the walk such a delightful idea of a ballroom never having occurred to the inhabitants before among the rest of the onlookers were elizabeth and her motherthe former thoughtful yet much interested her eyes beaming with a longing lingering light as if nature had been advised by correggio in their creation the dancing progressed with unabated spirit and henchard walked and waited till his wife should be disposed to go home he did not care to keep in the light and when he went into the dark it was worse for there he heard remarks of a kind which were becoming too frequent  mr henchards rejoicings couldnt say good morning to this said one a man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think folk would go up to that bleak place today  the other answered that people said it was not only in such things as those that the mayor was wanting where would his business be if it were not for this young fellow twas verily fortune sent him to henchard his accounts were like a bramblewood when mr farfrae came he used to reckon his sacks by chalk strokes all in a row like gardenpalings measure his ricks by stretching with his arms weigh his trusses by a lift judge his hay by a chaw and settle the price with a curse but now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and mensuration then the wheatthat sometimes used to taste so strong o mice when made into bread that people could fairly tell the breedfarfrae has a plan for purifying so that nobody would dream the smallest fourlegged beast had walked over it once o yes everybody is full of him and the care mr henchard has to keep him to be sure concluded this gentleman  but he wont do it for long goodnow said the other  no said henchard to himself behind the tree or if he do hell be honeycombed clean out of all the character and standing that hes built up in these eighteen year  he went back to the dancing pavilion farfrae was footing a quaint little dance with elizabethjanean old country thing the only one she knew and though he considerately toned down his movements to suit her demurer gait the pattern of the shining little nails in the soles of his boots became familiar to the eyes of every bystander the tune had enticed her into it being a tune of a busy vaulting leaping sortsome low notes on the silver string of each fiddle then a skipping on the small like running up and down laddersmiss mleod of ayr was its name so mr farfrae had said and that it was very popular in his own country  it was soon over and the girl looked at henchard for approval but he did not give it he seemed not to see her look here farfrae he said like one whose mind was elsewhere ill go to portbredy great market tomorrow myself you can stay and put things right in your clothesbox and recover strength to your knees after your vagaries he planted on donald an antagonistic glare that had begun as a smile  some other townsmen came up and donald drew aside whats this henchard said alderman tubber applying his thumb to the cornfactor like a cheesetaster an opposition randy to yours eh jacks as good as his master eh cut ye out quite hasnt he  you see mr henchard said the lawyer another goodnatured friend where you made the mistake was in going so far afield you should have taken a leaf out of his book and have had your sports in a sheltered place like this but you didnt think of it you see and he did and thats where hes beat you  hell be topsawyer soon of you two and carry all afore him added jocular mr tubber  no said henchard gloomily he wont be that because hes shortly going to leave me he looked towards donald who had come near mr farfraes time as my manager is drawing to a closeisnt it farfrae  the young man who could now read the lines and folds of henchards stronglytraced face as if they were clear verbal inscriptions quietly assented and when people deplored the fact and asked why it was he simply replied that mr henchard no longer required his help  henchard went home apparently satisfied but in the morning when his jealous temper had passed away his heart sank within him at what he had said and done he was the more disturbed when he found that this time farfrae was determined to take him at his word     17   elizabethjane had perceived from henchards manner that in assenting to dance she had made a mistake of some kind in her simplicity she did not know what it was till a hint from a nodding acquaintance enlightened her as the mayors stepdaughter she learnt she had not been quite in her place in treading a measure amid such a mixed throng as filled the dancing pavilion  thereupon her ears cheeks and chin glowed like live coals at the dawning of the idea that her tastes were not good enough for her position and would bring her into disgrace  this made her very miserable and she looked about for her mother but mrs henchard who had less idea of conventionality than elizabeth herself had gone away leaving her daughter to return at her own pleasure the latter moved on into the dark dense old avenues or rather vaults of living woodwork which ran along the town boundary and stood reflecting  a man followed in a few minutes and her face being towards the shine from the tent he recognized her it was farfraejust come from the dialogue with henchard which had signified his dismissal  and its you miss newsonand ive been looking for ye everywhere he said overcoming a sadness imparted by the estrangement with the cornmerchant may i walk on with you as far as your streetcorner  she thought there might be something wrong in this but did not utter any objection so together they went on first down the west walk and then into the bowling walk till farfrae said its like that im going to leave you soon  she faltered why  ohas a mere matter of businessnothing more but well not concern ourselves about itit is for the best i hoped to have another dance with you  she said she could not dancein any proper way  nay but you do its the feeling for it rather than the learning of steps that makes pleasant dancersi fear i offended your father by getting up this and now perhaps ill have to go to another part o the warrld altogether  this seemed such a melancholy prospect that elizabethjane breathed a sighletting it off in fragments that he might not hear her but darkness makes people truthful and the scotchman went on impulsivelyperhaps he had heard her after all  i wish i was richer miss newson and your stepfather had not been offended i would ask you something in a short timeyes i would ask you tonight but thats not for me  what he would have asked her he did not say and instead of encouraging him she remained incompetently silent thus afraid one of another they continued their promenade along the walls till they got near the bottom of the bowling walk twenty steps further and the trees would end and the streetcorner and lamps appear in consciousness of this they stopped  i never found out who it was that sent us to durnover granary on a fools errand that day said donald in his undulating tones did ye ever know yourself miss newson  never said she  i wonder why they did it  for fun perhaps  perhaps it was not for fun it might have been that they thought they would like us to stay waiting there talking to one another ay well i hope you casterbridge folk will not forget me if i go  that im sure we wont she said earnestly iwish you wouldnt go at all  they had got into the lamplight now ill think over that said donald farfrae and ill not come up to your door but part from you here lest it make your father more angry still  they parted farfrae returning into the dark bowling walk and elizabethjane going up the street without any consciousness of what she was doing she started running with all her might till she reached her fathers door o dear mewhat am i at she thought as she pulled up breathless  indoors she fell to conjecturing the meaning of farfraes enigmatic words about not daring to ask her what he fain would elizabeth that silent observing woman had long noted how he was rising in favour among the townspeople and knowing henchards nature now she had feared that farfraes days as manager were numbered so that the announcement gave her little surprise would mr farfrae stay in casterbridge despite his words and her fathers dismissal his occult breathings to her might be solvable by his course in that respect  the next day was windyso windy that walking in the garden she picked up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in donald farfraes writing which had flown over the wall from the office the useless scrap she took indoors and began to copy the calligraphy which she much admired the letter began dear sir and presently writing on a loose slip elizabethjane she laid the latter over sir making the phrase dear elizabethjane when she saw the effect a quick red ran up her face and warmed her through though nobody was there to see what she had done she quickly tore up the slip and threw it away after this she grew cool and laughed at herself walked about the room and laughed again not joyfully but distressfully rather  it was quickly known in casterbridge that farfrae and henchard had decided to dispense with each other elizabethjanes anxiety to know if farfrae were going away from the town reached a pitch that disturbed her for she could no longer conceal from herself the cause at length the news reached her that he was not going to leave the place a man following the same trade as henchard but on a very small scale had sold his business to farfrae who was forthwith about to start as corn and hay merchant on his own account  her heart fluttered when she heard of this step of donalds proving that he meant to remain and yet would a man who cared one little bit for her have endangered his suit by setting up a business in opposition to mr henchards surely not and it must have been a passing impulse only which had led him to address her so softly  to solve the problem whether her appearance on the evening of the dance were such as to inspire a fleeting love at first sight she dressed herself up exactly as she had dressed thenthe muslin the spencer the sandals the parasoland looked in the mirror the picture glassed back was in her opinion precisely of such a kind as to inspire that fleeting regard and no morejust enough to make him silly and not enough to keep him so she said luminously and elizabeth thought in a much lower key that by this time he had discovered how plain and homely was the informing spirit of that pretty outside  hence when she felt her heart going out to him she would say to herself with a mock pleasantry that carried an ache with it no no elizabethjanesuch dreams are not for you she tried to prevent herself from seeing him and thinking of him succeeding fairly well in the former attempt in the latter not so completely  henchard who had been hurt at finding that farfrae did not mean to put up with his temper any longer was incensed beyond measure when he learnt what the young man had done as an alternative it was in the townhall after a council meeting that he first became aware of farfraes coup for establishing himself independently in the town and his voice might have been heard as far as the townpump expressing his feelings to his fellow councilmen these tones showed that though under a long reign of selfcontrol he had become mayor and churchwarden and what not there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of michael henchard as when he had sold his wife at weydon fair  well hes a friend of mine and im a friend of hisor if we are not what are we od send if ive not been his friend who has i should like to know didnt he come here without a sound shoe to his voot didnt i keep him herehelp him to a living didnt i help him to money or whatever he wanted i stuck out for no termsi said name your own price id have shared my last crust with that young fellow at one time i liked him so well and now hes defied me but damn him ill have a tussle with him nowat fair buying and selling mindat fair buying and selling and if i cant overbid such a stripling as he then im not woth a varden well show that we know our business as well as one here and there  his friends of the corporation did not specially respond henchard was less popular now than he had been when nearly two years before they had voted him to the chief magistracy on account of his amazing energy while they had collectively profited by this quality of the cornfactors they had been made to wince individually on more than one occasion so he went out of the hall and down the street alone  reaching home he seemed to recollect something with a sour satisfaction he called elizabethjane seeing how he looked when she entered she appeared alarmed  nothing to find fault with he said observing her concern only i want to caution you my dear that man farfraeit is about him ive seen him talking to you two or three timeshe danced with ee at the rejoicings and came home with ee now now no blame to you but just harken have you made him any foolish promise gone the least bit beyond sniff and snaff at all  no i have promised him nothing  good alls well that ends well i particularly wish you not to see him again  very well sir  you promise  she hesitated for a moment and then said  yes if you much wish it  i do hes an enemy to our house  when she had gone he sat down and wrote in a heavy hand to farfrae thus   siri make request that henceforth you and my stepdaughter be as strangers to each other she on her part has promised to welcome no more addresses from you and i trust therefore you will not attempt to force them upon her  m henchard   one would almost have supposed henchard to have had policy to see that no better modus vivendi could be arrived at with farfrae than by encouraging him to become his soninlaw but such a scheme for buying over a rival had nothing to recommend it to the mayors headstrong faculties with all domestic finesse of that kind he was hopelessly at variance loving a man or hating him his diplomacy was as wrongheaded as a buffalos and his wife had not ventured to suggest the course which she for many reasons would have welcomed gladly  meanwhile donald farfrae had opened the gates of commerce on his own account at a spot on durnover hillas far as possible from henchards stores and with every intention of keeping clear of his former friend and employers customers there was it seemed to the younger man room for both of them and to spare the town was small but the corn and haytrade was proportionately large and with his native sagacity he saw opportunity for a share of it  so determined was he to do nothing which should seem like tradeantagonism to the mayor that he refused his first customera large farmer of good reputebecause henchard and this man had dealt together within the preceding three months  he was once my friend said farfrae and its not for me to take business from him i am sorry to disappoint you but i cannot hurt the trade of a man whos been so kind to me  in spite of this praiseworthy course the scotchmans trade increased whether it were that his northern energy was an overmastering force among the easygoing wessex worthies or whether it was sheer luck the fact remained that whatever he touched he prospered in like jacob in padanaram he would no sooner humbly limit himself to the ringstrakedandspotted exceptions of trade than the ringstrakedandspotted would multiply and prevail  but most probably luck had little to do with it character is fate said novalis and farfraes character was just the reverse of henchards who might not inaptly be described as faust has been describedas a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without light to guide him on a better way  farfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to elizabethjane his acts of that kind had been so slight that the request was almost superfluous yet he had felt a considerable interest in her and after some cogitation he decided that it would be as well to enact no romeo part just thenfor the young girls sake no less than his own thus the incipient attachment was stifled down  a time came when avoid collision with his former friend as he might farfrae was compelled in sheer selfdefence to close with henchard in mortal commercial combat he could no longer parry the fierce attacks of the latter by simple avoidance as soon as their war of prices began everybody was interested and some few guessed the end it was in some degree northern insight matched against southern doggednessthe dirk against the cudgeland henchards weapon was one which if it did not deal ruin at the first or second stroke left him afterwards wellnigh at his antagonists mercy  almost every saturday they encountered each other amid the crowd of farmers which thronged about the marketplace in the weekly course of their business donald was always ready and even anxious to say a few friendly words but the mayor invariably gazed stormfully past him like one who had endured and lost on his account and could in no sense forgive the wrong nor did farfraes snubbed manner of perplexity at all appease him the large farmers cornmerchants millers auctioneers and others had each an official stall in the cornmarket room with their names painted thereon and when to the familiar series of henchard everdene shiner darton and so on was added one inscribed farfrae in staring new letters henchard was stung into bitterness like bellerophon he wandered away from the crowd cankered in soul  from that day donald farfraes name was seldom mentioned in henchards house if at breakfast or dinner elizabethjanes mother inadvertently alluded to her favourites movements the girl would implore her by a look to be silent and her husband would say whatare you too my enemy     18   there came a shock which had been foreseen for some time by elizabeth as the box passenger foresees the approaching jerk from some channel across the highway  her mother was illtoo unwell to leave her room henchard who treated her kindly except in moments of irritation sent at once for the richest busiest doctor whom he supposed to be the best bedtime came and they burnt a light all night in a day or two she rallied  elizabeth who had been staying up did not appear at breakfast on the second morning and henchard sat down alone he was startled to see a letter for him from jersey in a writing he knew too well and had expected least to behold again he took it up in his hands and looked at it as at a picture a vision a vista of past enactments and then he read it as an unimportant finale to conjecture  the writer said that she at length perceived how impossible it would be for any further communications to proceed between them now that his remarriage had taken place that such reunion had been the only straightforward course open to him she was bound to admit   on calm reflection therefore she went on i quite forgive you for landing me in such a dilemma remembering that you concealed nothing before our illadvised acquaintance and that you really did set before me in your grim way the fact of there being a certain risk in intimacy with you slight as it seemed to be after fifteen or sixteen years of silence on your wifes part i thus look upon the whole as a misfortune of mine and not a fault of yours  so that michael i must ask you to overlook those letters with which i pestered you day after day in the heat of my feelings they were written whilst i thought your conduct to me cruel but now i know more particulars of the position you were in i see how inconsiderate my reproaches were  now you will i am sure perceive that the one condition which will make any future happiness possible for me is that the past connection between our lives be kept secret outside this isle speak of it i know you will not and i can trust you not to write of it one safeguard more remains to be mentionedthat no writings of mine or trifling articles belonging to me should be left in your possession through neglect or forgetfulness to this end may i request you to return to me any such you may have particularly the letters written in the first abandonment of feeling  for the handsome sum you forwarded to me as a plaster to the wound i heartily thank you  i am now on my way to bristol to see my only relative she is rich and i hope will do something for me i shall return through casterbridge and budmouth where i shall take the packetboat can you meet me with the letters and other trifles i shall be in the coach which changes horses at the antelope hotel at halfpast five wednesday evening i shall be wearing a paisley shawl with a red centre and thus may easily be found i should prefer this plan of receiving them to having them senti remain still yours ever  lucetta   henchard breathed heavily poor thingbetter you had not known me upon my heart and soul if ever i should be left in a position to carry out that marriage with thee i ought to do iti ought to do it indeed  the contingency that he had in his mind was of course the death of mrs henchard  as requested he sealed up lucettas letters and put the parcel aside till the day she had appointed this plan of returning them by hand being apparently a little ruse of the young lady for exchanging a word or two with him on past times he would have preferred not to see her but deeming that there could be no great harm in acquiescing thus far he went at dusk and stood opposite the coachoffice  the evening was chilly and the coach was late henchard crossed over to it while the horses were being changed but there was no lucetta inside or out concluding that something had happened to modify her arrangements he gave the matter up and went home not without a sense of relief meanwhile mrs henchard was weakening visibly she could not go out of doors any more one day after much thinking which seemed to distress her she said she wanted to write something a desk was put upon her bed with pen and paper and at her request she was left alone she remained writing for a short time folded her paper carefully called elizabethjane to bring a taper and wax and then still refusing assistance sealed up the sheet directed it and locked it in her desk she had directed it in these words  mr michael henchard not to be opened till elizabethjanes weddingday  the latter sat up with her mother to the utmost of her strength night after night to learn to take the universe seriously there is no quicker way than to watchto be a waker as the countrypeople call it between the hours at which the last tosspot went by and the first sparrow shook himself the silence in casterbridgebarring the rare sound of the watchmanwas broken in elizabeths ear only by the timepiece in the bedroom ticking frantically against the clock on the stairs ticking harder and harder till it seemed to clang like a gong and all this while the subtlesouled girl asking herself why she was born why sitting in a room and blinking at the candle why things around her had taken the shape they wore in preference to every other possible shape why they stared at her so helplessly as if waiting for the touch of some wand that should release them from terrestrial constraint what that chaos called consciousness which spun in her at this moment like a top tended to and began in her eyes fell together she was awake yet she was asleep  a word from her mother roused her without preface and as the continuation of a scene already progressing in her mind mrs henchard said you remember the note sent to you and mr farfraeasking you to meet some one in durnover bartonand that you thought it was a trick to make fools of you  yes  it was not to make fools of youit was done to bring you together twas i did it  why said elizabeth with a start  iwanted you to marry mr farfrae  o mother elizabethjane bent down her head so much that she looked quite into her own lap but as her mother did not go on she said what reason  well i had a reason twill out one day i wish it could have been in my time but therenothing is as you wish it henchard hates him  perhaps theyll be friends again murmured the girl  i dont knowi dont know after this her mother was silent and dozed and she spoke on the subject no more  some little time later on farfrae was passing henchards house on a sunday morning when he observed that the blinds were all down he rang the bell so softly that it only sounded a single full note and a small one and then he was informed that mrs henchard was deadjust deadthat very hour  at the townpump there were gathered when he passed a few old inhabitants who came there for water whenever they had as at present spare time to fetch it because it was purer from that original fount than from their own wells mrs cuxsom who had been standing there for an indefinite time with her pitcher was describing the incidents of mrs henchards death as she had learnt them from the nurse  and she was white as marblestone said mrs cuxsom and likewise such a thoughtful woman tooah poor soulthat a minded every little thing that wanted tending yes says she when im gone and my last breaths blowed look in the top drawer o the chest in the back room by the window and youll find all my coffin clothes a piece of flannelthats to put under me and the little piece is to put under my head and my new stockings for my feetthey are folded alongside and all my other things and theres four ounce pennies the heaviest i could find atied up in bits of linen for weightstwo for my right eye and two for my left she said and when youve used em and my eyes dont open no more bury the pennies good souls and dont ye go spending em for i shouldnt like it and open the windows as soon as i am carried out and make it as cheerful as you can for elizabethjane  ah poor heart  well and martha did it and buried the ounce pennies in the garden but if yell believe words that man christopher coney went and dug em up and spent em at the three mariners faith he said why should death rob life o fourpence deaths not of such good report that we should respect en to that

work but money is scarce and throats get dry why should death rob life o fourpence i say there was no treason in it  well poor soul shes helpless to hinder that or anything now answered mother cuxsom and all her shining keys will be took from her and her cupboards opened and little things a didnt wish seen anybody will see and her wishes and ways will all be as nothing     19   henchard and elizabeth sat conversing by the fire it was three weeks after mrs henchards funeral the candles were not lighted and a restless acrobatic flame poised on a coal called from the shady walls the smiles of all shapes that could respondthe old pierglass with gilt columns and huge entablature the pictureframes sundry knobs and handles and the brass rosette at the bottom of each riband bellpull on either side of the chimneypiece  elizabeth do you think much of old times said henchard  yes sir often she said  who do you put in your pictures of em  mother and fathernobody else hardly  henchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain when elizabethjane spoke of richard newson as father ah i am out of all that am i not he said was newson a kind father  yes sir very  henchards face settled into an expression of stolid loneliness which gradually modulated into something softer suppose i had been your real father he said would you have cared for me as much as you cared for richard newson  i cant think it she said quickly i can think of no other as my father except my father  henchards wife was dissevered from him by death his friend and helper farfrae by estrangement elizabethjane by ignorance it seemed to him that only one of them could possibly be recalled and that was the girl his mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone till he could no longer sit still he walked up and down and then he came and stood behind her chair looking down upon the top of her head he could no longer restrain his impulse what did your mother tell you about memy history he asked  that you were related by marriage  she should have told morebefore you knew me then my task would not have been such a hard oneelizabeth it is i who am your father and not richard newson shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of em were alive  the back of elizabeths head remained still and her shoulders did not denote even the movements of breathing henchard went on id rather have your scorn your fear anything than your ignorance tis that i hate your mother and i were man and wife when we were young what you saw was our second marriage your mother was too honest we had thought each other deadandnewson became her husband  this was the nearest approach henchard could make to the full truth as far as he personally was concerned he would have screened nothing but he showed a respect for the young girls sex and years worthy of a better man  when he had gone on to give details which a whole series of slight and unregarded incidents in her past life strangely corroborated when in short she believed his story to be true she became greatly agitated and turning round to the table flung her face upon it weeping  dont crydont cry said henchard with vehement pathos i cant bear it i wont bear it i am your father why should you cry am i so dreadful so hateful to ee dont take against me elizabethjane he cried grasping her wet hand dont take against methough i was a drinking man once and used your mother roughlyill be kinder to you than he was ill do anything if you will only look upon me as your father  she tried to stand up and comfort him trustfully but she could not she was troubled at his presence like the brethren at the avowal of joseph  i dont want you to come to me all of a sudden said henchard in jerks and moving like a great tree in a wind no elizabeth i dont ill go away and not see you till tomorrow or when you like and then ill show ee papers to prove my words there i am gone and wont disturb you any moretwas i that chose your name my daughter your mother wanted it susan there dont forget twas i gave you your name he went out at the door and shut her softly in and she heard him go away into the garden but he had not done before she had moved or in any way recovered from the effect of his disclosure he reappeared  one word more elizabeth he said youll take my surname nowhey your mother was against it but it will be much more pleasant to me tis legally yours you know but nobody need know that you shall take it as if by choice ill talk to my lawyeri dont know the law of it exactly but will you do thislet me put a few lines into the newspaper that such is to be your name  if it is my name i must have it mustnt i she asked  well well usage is everything in these matters  i wonder why mother didnt wish it  oh some whim of the poor souls now get a bit of paper and draw up a paragraph as i shall tell you but lets have a light  i can see by the firelight she answered yesid rather  very well  she got a piece of paper and bending over the fender wrote at his dictation words which he had evidently got by heart from some advertisement or otherwords to the effect that she the writer hitherto known as elizabethjane newson was going to call herself elizabethjane henchard forthwith it was done and fastened up and directed to the office of the casterbridge chronicle  now said henchard with the blaze of satisfaction that he always emitted when he had carried his pointthough tenderness softened it this timeill go upstairs and hunt for some documents that will prove it all to you but i wont trouble you with them till tomorrow goodnight my elizabethjane  he was gone before the bewildered girl could realize what it all meant or adjust her filial sense to the new center of gravity she was thankful that he had left her to herself for the evening and sat down over the fire here she remained in silence and weptnot for her mother now but for the genial sailor richard newson to whom she seemed doing a wrong  henchard in the meantime had gone upstairs papers of a domestic nature he kept in a drawer in his bedroom and this he unlocked before turning them over he leant back and indulged in reposeful thought elizabeth was his at last and she was a girl of such good sense and kind heart that she would be sure to like him he was the kind of man to whom some human object for pouring out his heart uponwere it emotive or were it cholericwas almost a necessity the craving for his heart for the reestablishment of this tenderest human tie had been great during his wifes lifetime and now he had submitted to its mastery without reluctance and without fear he bent over the drawer again and proceeded in his search  among the other papers had been placed the contents of his wifes little desk the keys of which had been handed to him at her request here was the letter addressed to him with the restriction not to be opened till elizabethjanes weddingday  mrs henchard though more patient than her husband had been no practical hand at anything in sealing up the sheet which was folded and tucked in without an envelope in the oldfashioned way she had overlaid the junction with a large mass of wax without the requisite undertouch of the same the seal had cracked and the letter was open henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect some trifling fancy or other of poor susans i suppose he said and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter   my dear michaelfor the good of all three of us i have kept one thing a secret from you till now i hope you will understand why i think you will though perhaps you may not forgive me but dear michael i have done it for the best i shall be in my grave when you read this and elizabethjane will have a home dont curse me mikethink of how i was situated i can hardly write it but here it is elizabethjane is not your elizabethjanethe child who was in my arms when you sold me no she died three months after that and this living one is my other husbands i christened her by the same name we had given to the first and she filled up the ache i felt at the others loss michael i am dying and i might have held my tongue but i could not tell her husband of this or not as you may judge and forgive if you can a woman you once deeply wronged as she forgives you  susan henchard   her husband regarded the paper as if it were a windowpane through which he saw for miles his lips twitched and he seemed to compress his frame as if to bear better his usual habit was not to consider whether destiny were hard upon him or notthe shape of his ideals in cases of affliction being simply a moody i am to suffer i perceive this much scourging then it is for me but now through his passionate head there stormed this thoughtthat the blasting disclosure was what he had deserved  his wifes extreme reluctance to have the girls name altered from newson to henchard was now accounted for fully it furnished another illustration of that honesty in dishonesty which had characterized her in other things  he remained unnerved and purposeless for near a couple of hours till he suddenly said ahi wonder if it is true  he jumped up in an impulse kicked off his slippers and went with a candle to the door of elizabethjanes room where he put his ear to the keyhole and listened she was breathing profoundly henchard softly turned the handle entered and shading the light approached the bedside gradually bringing the light from behind a screening curtain he held it in such a manner that it fell slantwise on her face without shining on her eyes he steadfastly regarded her features  they were fair his were dark but this was an unimportant preliminary in sleep there come to the surface buried genealogical facts ancestral curves dead mens traits which the mobility of daytime animation screens and overwhelms in the present statuesque repose of the young girls countenance richard newsons was unmistakably reflected he could not endure the sight of her and hastened away  misery taught him nothing more than defiant endurance of it his wife was dead and the first impulse for revenge died with the thought that she was beyond him he looked out at the night as at a fiend henchard like all his kind was superstitious and he could not help thinking that the concatenation of events this evening had produced was the scheme of some sinister intelligence bent on punishing him yet they had developed naturally if he had not revealed his past history to elizabeth he would not have searched the drawer for papers and so on the mockery was that he should have no sooner taught a girl to claim the shelter of his paternity than he discovered her to have no kinship with him  this ironical sequence of things angered him like an impish trick from a fellowcreature like prester johns his table had been spread and infernal harpies had snatched up the food he went out of the house and moved sullenly onward down the pavement till he came to the bridge at the bottom of the high street here he turned in upon a bypath on the river bank skirting the northeastern limits of the town  these precincts embodied the mournful phases of casterbridge life as the south avenues embodied its cheerful moods the whole way along here was sunless even in summer time in spring white frosts lingered here when other places were steaming with warmth while in winter it was the seedfield of all the aches rheumatisms and torturing cramps of the year the casterbridge doctors must have pined away for want of sufficient nourishment but for the configuration of the landscape on the northeastern side  the riverslow noiseless and darkthe schwarzwasser of casterbridgeran beneath a low cliff the two together forming a defence which had rendered walls and artificial earthworks on this side unnecessary here were ruins of a franciscan priory and a mill attached to the same the water of which roared down a backhatch like the voice of desolation above the cliff and behind the river rose a pile of buildings and in the front of the pile a square mass cut into the sky it was like a pedestal lacking its statue this missing feature without which the design remained incomplete was in truth the corpse of a man for the square mass formed the base of the gallows the extensive buildings at the back being the county gaol in the meadow where henchard now walked the mob were wont to gather whenever an execution took place and there to the tune of the roaring weir they stood and watched the spectacle  the exaggeration which darkness imparted to the glooms of this region impressed henchard more than he had expected the lugubrious harmony of the spot with his domestic situation was too perfect for him impatient of effects scenes and adumbrations it reduced his heartburning to melancholy and he exclaimed why the deuce did i come here he went on past the cottage in which the old local hangman had lived and died in times before that calling was monopolized over all england by a single gentleman and climbed up by a steep back lane into the town  for the sufferings of that night engendered by his bitter disappointment he might well have been pitied he was like one who had half fainted and could neither recover nor complete the swoon in words he could blame his wife but not in his heart and had he obeyed the wise directions outside her letter this pain would have been spared him for longpossibly for ever elizabethjane seeming to show no ambition to quit her safe and secluded maiden courses for the speculative path of matrimony  the morning came after this night of unrest and with it the necessity for a plan he was far too selfwilled to recede from a position especially as it would involve humiliation his daughter he had asserted her to be and his daughter she should always think herself no matter what hyprocrisy it involved  but he was illprepared for the first step in this new situation the moment he came into the breakfastroom elizabeth advanced with open confidence to him and took him by the arm  i have thought and thought all night of it she said frankly and i see that everything must be as you say and i am going to look upon you as the father that you are and not to call you mr henchard any more it is so plain to me now indeed father it is for of course you would not have done half the things you have done for me and let me have my own way so entirely and bought me presents if i had only been your stepdaughter hemr newsonwhom my poor mother married by such a strange mistake henchard was glad that he had disguised matters here was very kindo so kind she spoke with tears in her eyes but that is not the same thing as being ones real father after all now father breakfast is ready she said cheerfully  henchard bent and kissed her cheek the moment and the act he had prefigured for weeks with a thrill of pleasure yet it was no less than a miserable insipidity to him now that it had come his reinstation of her mother had been chiefly for the girls sake and the fruition of the whole scheme was such dust and ashes as this     20   of all the enigmas which ever confronted a girl there can have been seldom one like that which followed henchards announcement of himself to elizabeth as her father he had done it in an ardour and an agitation which had half carried the point of affection with her yet behold from the next morning onwards his manner was constrained as she had never seen it before  the coldness soon broke out into open chiding one grievous failing of elizabeths was her occasional pretty and picturesque use of dialect wordsthose terrible marks of the beast to the truly genteel  it was dinnertimethey never met except at mealsand she happened to say when he was rising from table wishing to show him something if youll bide where you be a minute father ill get it  bide where you be he echoed sharply good god are you only fit to carry wash to a pigtrough that ye use such words as those  she reddened with shame and sadness  i meant stay where you are father she said in a low humble voice i ought to have been more careful  he made no reply and went out of the room  the sharp reprimand was not lost upon her and in time it came to pass that for fay she said succeed that she no longer spoke of dumbledores but of humble bees no longer said of young men and women that they walked together but that they were engaged that she grew to talk of greggles as wild hyacinths that when she had not slept she did not quaintly tell the servants next morning that she had been hagrid but that she had suffered from indigestion  these improvements however are somewhat in advance of the story henchard being uncultivated himself was the bitterest critic the fair girl could possibly have had of her own lapsesreally slight now for she read omnivorously a gratuitous ordeal was in store for her in the matter of her handwriting she was passing the diningroom door one evening and had occasion to go in for something it was not till she had opened the door that she knew the mayor was there in the company of a man with whom he transacted business  here elizabethjane he said looking round at her just write down what i tell youa few words of an agreement for me and this gentleman to sign i am a poor tool with a pen  be jowned and so be i said the gentleman  she brought forward blottingbook paper and ink and sat down  now thenan agreement entered into this sixteenth day of octoberwrite that first  she started the pen in an elephantine march across the sheet it was a splendid round bold hand of her own conception a style that would have stamped a woman as minervas own in more recent days but other ideas reigned then henchards creed was that proper young girls wrote ladieshandnay he believed that bristling characters were as innate and inseparable a part of refined womanhood as sex itself hence when instead of scribbling like the princess ida       in such a hand as when a field of corn      bows all its ears before the roaring east  elizabethjane produced a line of chainshot and sandbags he reddened in angry shame for her and peremptorily saying never mindill finish it dismissed her there and then  her considerate disposition became a pitfall to her now she was it must be admitted sometimes provokingly and unnecessarily willing to saddle herself with manual labours she would go to the kitchen instead of ringing not to make phoebe come up twice she went down on her knees shovel in hand when the cat overturned the coalscuttle moreover she would persistently thank the parlourmaid for everything till one day as soon as the girl was gone from the room henchard broke out with good god why dostnt leave off thanking that girl as if she were a goddessborn dont i pay her a dozen pound a year to do things for ee elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation that he became sorry a few minutes after and said that he did not mean to be rough  these domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which suggested rather than revealed what was underneath but his passion had less terror for her than his coldness the increasing frequency of the latter mood told her the sad news that he disliked her with a growing dislike the more interesting that her appearance and manners became under the softening influences which she could now command and in her wisdom did command the more she seemed to estrange him sometimes she caught him looking at her with a louring invidiousness that she could hardly bear not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery that she should for the first time excite his animosity when she had taken his surname  but the most terrible ordeal was to come elizabeth had latterly been accustomed of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and breadandcheese to nance mockridge who worked in the yard wimbling haybonds nance accepted this offering thankfully at first afterwards as a matter of course on a day when henchard was on the premises he saw his stepdaughter enter the haybarn on this errand and as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands on her hips easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf  elizabeth come here said henchard and she obeyed  why do you lower yourself so confoundedly he said with suppressed passion havent i told you ot fifty times hey making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers why yell disgrace me to the dust  now these words were uttered loud enough to reach nance inside the barn door who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences come to that mr henchard i can let ee know sheve waited on worse  then she must have had more charity than sense said henchard  o no she hadnt twere not for charity but for hire and at a publichouse in this town  it is not true cried henchard indignantly  just ask her said nance folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows  henchard glanced at elizabethjane whose complexion now pink and white from confinement lost nearly all of the former colour what does this mean he said to her anything or nothing  it is true said elizabethjane but it was only  did you do it or didnt you where was it  at the three mariners one evening for a little while when we were staying there  nance glanced triumphantly at henchard and sailed into the barn for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory henchard however said nothing about discharging her unduly sensitive on such points by reason of his own past he had the look of one completely ground down to the last indignity elizabeth followed him to the house like a culprit but when she got inside she could not see him nor did she see him again that day  convinced of the scathing damage to his local repute and position that must have been caused by such a fact though it had never before reached his own ears henchard showed a positive distaste for the presence of this girl not his own whenever he encountered her he mostly dined with the farmers at the marketroom of one of the two chief hotels leaving her in utter solitude could he have seen how she made use of those silent hours he might have found reason to reserve his judgment on her quality she read and took notes incessantly mastering facts with painful laboriousness but never flinching from her selfimposed task she began the study of latin incited by the roman characteristics of the town she lived in if i am not wellinformed it shall be by no fault of my own she would say to herself through the tears that would occasionally glide down her peachy cheeks when she was fairly baffled by the portentous obscurity of many of these educational works  thus she lived on a dumb deepfeeling greateyed creature construed by not a single contiguous being quenching with patient fortitude her incipient interest in farfrae because it seemed to be onesided unmaidenly and unwise true that for reasons best known to herself she had since farfraes dismissal shifted her quarters from the back room affording a view of the yard which she had occupied with such zest to a front chamber overlooking the street but as for the young man whenever he passed the house he seldom or never turned his head  winter had almost come and unsettled weather made her still more dependent upon indoor resources but there were certain early winter days in casterbridgedays of firmamental exhaustion which followed angry southwesterly tempestswhen if the sun shone the air was like velvet she seized on these days for her periodical visits to the spot where her mother lay buriedthe stillused burialground of the old romanbritish city whose curious feature was this its continuity as a place of sepulture mrs henchards dust mingled with the dust of women who lay ornamented with glass hairpins and amber necklaces and men who held in their mouths coins of hadrian posthumus and the constantines  halfpast ten in the morning was about her hour for seeking this spota time when the town avenues were deserted as the avenues of karnac business had long since passed down them into its daily cells and leisure had not arrived there so elizabethjane walked and read or looked over the edge of the book to think and thus reached the churchyard  there approaching her mothers grave she saw a solitary dark figure in the middle of the gravelwalk this figure too was reading but not from a book the words which engrossed it being the inscription on mrs henchards tombstone the personage was in mourning like herself was about her age and size and might have been her wraith or double but for the fact that it was a lady much more beautifully dressed than she indeed comparatively indifferent as elizabethjane was to dress unless for some temporary whim or purpose her eyes were arrested by the artistic perfection of the ladys appearance her gait too had a flexuousness about it which seemed to avoid angularity it was a revelation to elizabeth that human beings could reach this stage of external developmentshe had never suspected it she felt all the freshness and grace to be stolen from herself on the instant by the neighbourhood of such a stranger and this was in face of the fact that elizabeth could now have been writ handsome while the young lady was simply pretty  had she been envious she might have hated the woman but she did not do thatshe allowed herself the pleasure of feeling fascinated she wondered where the lady had come from the stumpy and practical walk of honest homeliness which mostly prevailed there the two styles of dress thereabout the simple and the mistaken equally avouched that this figure was no casterbridge womans even if a book in her hand resembling a guidebook had not also suggested it  the stranger presently moved from the tombstone of mrs henchard and vanished behind the corner of the wall elizabeth went to the tomb herself beside it were two footprints distinct in the soil signifying that the lady had stood there a long time she returned homeward musing on what she had seen as she might have mused on a rainbow or the northern lights a rare butterfly or a cameo  interesting as things had been out of doors at home it turned out to be one of her bad days henchard whose two years mayoralty was ending had been made aware that he was not to be chosen to fill a vacancy in the list of aldermen and that farfrae was likely to become one of the council this caused the unfortunate discovery that she had played the waitingmaid in the town of which he was mayor to rankle in his mind yet more poisonously he had learnt by personal inquiry at the time that it was to donald farfraethat treacherous upstartthat she had thus humiliated herself and though mrs stannidge seemed to attach no great importance to the incidentthe cheerful souls at the three mariners having exhausted its aspects long agosuch was henchards haughty spirit that the simple thrifty deed was regarded as little less than a social catastrophe by him  ever since the evening of his wifes arrival with her daughter there had been something in the air which had changed his luck that dinner at the kings arms with his friends had been henchards austerlitz he had had his successes since but his course had not been upward he was not to be numbered among the aldermenthat peerage of burghersas he had expected to be and the consciousness of this soured him today  well where have you been he said to her with offhand laconism  ive been strolling in the walks and churchyard father till i feel quite leery she clapped her hand to her mouth but too late  this was just enough to incense henchard after the other crosses of the day i wont have you talk like that he thundered leery indeed one would think you worked upon a farm one day i learn that you lend a hand in publichouses then i hear you talk like a clodhopper im burned if it goes on this house cant hold us two  the only way of getting a single pleasant thought to go to sleep upon after this was by recalling the lady she had seen that day and hoping she might see her again  meanwhile henchard was sitting up thinking over his jealous folly in forbidding farfrae to pay his addresses to this girl who did not belong to him when if he had allowed them to go on he might not have been encumbered with her at last he said to himself with satisfaction as he jumped up and went to the writingtable ah hell think it means peace and a marriage portionnot that i dont want my house to be troubled with her and no portion at all he wrote as follows   siron consideration i dont wish to interfere with your courtship of elizabethjane if you care for her i therefore withdraw my objection excepting in thisthat the business be not carried on in my house  yours m henchard mr farfrae   the morrow being fairly fine found elizabethjane again in the churchyard but while looking for the lady she was startled by the apparition of farfrae who passed outside the gate he glanced up for a moment from a pocketbook in which he appeared to be making figures as he went whether or not he saw her he took no notice and disappeared  unduly depressed by a sense of her own superfluity she thought he probably scorned her and quite broken in spirit sat down on a bench she fell into painful thought on her position which ended with her saying quite loud o i wish i was dead with dear mother  behind the bench was a little promenade under the wall where people sometimes walked instead of on the gravel the bench seemed to be touched by something she looked round and a face was bending over her veiled but still distinct the face of the young woman she had seen yesterday  elizabethjane looked confounded for a moment knowing she had been overheard though there was pleasure in her confusion yes i heard you said the lady in a vivacious voice answering her look what can have happened  i donti cant tell you said elizabeth putting her hand to her face to hide a quick flush that had come  there was no movement or word for a few seconds then the girl felt that the young lady was sitting down beside her  i guess how it is with you said the latter that was your mother she waved her hand towards the tombstone elizabeth looked up at her as if inquiring of herself whether there should be confidence the ladys manner was so desirous so anxious that the girl decided there should be confidence it was my mother she said my only friend  but your father mr henchard he is living  yes he is living said elizabethjane  is he not kind to you  ive no wish to complain of him  there has been a disagreement  a little  perhaps you were to blame suggested the stranger  i wasin many ways sighed the meek elizabeth i swept up the coals when the servants ought to have done it and i said i was leeryand he was angry with me  the lady seemed to warm towards her for that reply do you know the impression your words give me she said ingenuously that he is a hottempered mana little proudperhaps ambitious but not a bad man her anxiety not to condemn henchard while siding with elizabeth was curious  o no certainly not bad agreed the honest girl and he has not even been unkind to me till latelysince mother died but it has been very much to bear while it has lasted all is owing to my defects i daresay and my defects are owing to my history  what is your history  elizabethjane looked wistfully at her questioner she found that her questioner was looking at her turned her eyes down and then seemed compelled to look back again my history is not gay or attractive she said and yet i can tell it if you really want to know  the lady assured her that she did want to know whereupon elizabethjane told the tale of her life as she understood it which was in general the true one except that the sale at the fair had no part therein  contrary to the girls expectation her new friend was not shocked this cheered her and it was not till she thought of returning to that home in which she had been treated so roughly of late that her spirits fell  i dont know how to return she murmured i think of going away but what can i do where can i go  perhaps it will be better soon said her friend gently so i would not go far now what do you think of this i shall soon want somebody to live in my house partly as housekeeper partly as companion would you mind coming to me but perhaps  o yes cried elizabeth with tears in her eyes i would indeedi would do anything to be independent for then perhaps my father might get to love me but ah  what  i am no accomplished person and a companion to you must be that  o not necessarily  not but i cant help using rural words sometimes when i dont mean to  never mind i shall like to know them  ando i know i shant doshe cried with a distressful laugh i accidentally learned to write round hand instead of ladieshand and of course you want some one who can write that  well no  what not necessary to write ladieshand cried the joyous elizabeth  not at all  but where do you live  in casterbridge or rather i shall be living here after twelve oclock today  elizabeth expressed her astonishment  i have been staying at budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready the house i am going into is that one they call highplace hallthe old stone one looking down the lane to the market two or three rooms are fit for occupation though not all i sleep there tonight for the first time now will you think over my proposal and meet me here the first fine day next week and say if you are still in the same mind  elizabeth her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an unbearable position joyfully assented and the two parted at the gate of the churchyard     21   as a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains practically unmarked till some mature experience enforces it so did this highplace hall now for the first time really show itself to elizabethjane though her ears had heard its name on a hundred occasions  her mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger and the house and her own chance of living there all the rest of the day in the afternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a little shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to herself had become a common topic about the streets highplace hall was undergoing repair a lady was coming there to live shortly all the shoppeople knew it and had already discounted the chance of her being a customer  elizabethjane could however add a capping touch to information so new to her in the bulk the lady she said had arrived that day  when the lamps were lighted and it was yet not so dark as to render chimneys attics and roofs invisible elizabeth almost with a lovers feeling thought she would like to look at the outside of highplace hall she went up the street in that direction  the hall with its grey facade and parapet was the only residence of its sort so near the centre of the town it had in the first place the characteristics of a country mansionbirds nests in its chimneys damp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from natures trowel at night the forms of passengers were patterned by the lamps in black shadows upon the pale walls  this evening motes of straw lay around and other signs of the premises having been in that lawless condition which accompanies the entry of a new tenant the house was entirely of stone and formed an example of dignity without great size it was not altogether aristocratic still less consequential yet the oldfashioned stranger instinctively said blood built it and wealth enjoys it however vague his opinions of those accessories might be  yet as regards the enjoying it the stranger would have been wrong for until this very evening when the new lady had arrived the house had been empty for a year or two while before that interval its occupancy had been irregular the reason of its unpopularity was soon made manifest some of its rooms overlooked the marketplace and such a prospect from such a house was not considered desirable or seemly by its wouldbe occupiers  elizabeths eyes sought the upper rooms and saw lights there the lady had obviously arrived the impression that this woman of comparatively practised manner had made upon the studious girls mind was so deep that she enjoyed standing under an opposite archway merely to think that the charming lady was inside the confronting walls and to wonder what she was doing her admiration for the architecture of that front was entirely on account of the inmate it screened though for that matter the architecture deserved admiration or at least study on its own account it was palladian and like most architecture erected since the gothic age was a compilation rather than a design but its reasonableness made it impressive it was not rich but rich enough a timely consciousness of the ultimate vanity of human architecture no less than of other human things had prevented artistic superfluity  men had still quite recently been going in and out with parcels and packingcases rendering the door and hall within like a public thoroughfare elizabeth trotted through the open door in the dusk but becoming alarmed at her own temerity she went quickly out again by another which stood open in the lofty wall of the back court to her surprise she found herself in one of the littleused alleys of the town looking round at the door which had given her egress by the light of the solitary lamp fixed in the alley she saw that it was arched and oldolder even than the house itself the door was studded and the keystone of the arch was a mask originally the mask had exhibited a comic leer as could still be discerned but generations of casterbridge boys had thrown stones at the mask aiming at its open mouth and the blows thereon had chipped off the lips and jaws as if they had been eaten away by disease the appearance was so ghastly by the weakly lampglimmer that she could not bear to look at itthe first unpleasant feature of her visit  the position of the queer old door and the odd presence of the leering mask suggested one thing above all others as appertaining to the mansions past historyintrigue by the alley it had been possible to come unseen from all sorts of quarters in the townthe old playhouse the old bullstake the old cockpit the pool wherein nameless infants had been used to disappear highplace hall could boast of its conveniences undoubtedly  she turned to come away in the nearest direction homeward which was down the alley but hearing footsteps approaching in that quarter and having no great wish to be found in such a place at such a time she quickly retreated there being no other way out she stood behind a brick pier till the intruder should have gone his ways  had she watched she would have been surprised she would have seen that the pedestrian on coming up made straight for the arched doorway that as he paused with his hand upon the latch the lamplight fell upon the face of henchard  but elizabethjane clung so closely to her nook that she discerned nothing of this henchard passed in as ignorant of her presence as she was ignorant of his identity and disappeared in the darkness elizabeth came out a second time into the alley and made the best of her way home  henchards chiding by begetting in her a nervous fear of doing anything definable as unladylike had operated thus curiously in keeping them unknown to each other at a critical moment much might have resulted from recognitionat the least a query on either side in one and the selfsame form what could he or she possibly be doing there  henchard whatever his business at the ladys house reached his own home only a few minutes later than elizabethjane her plan was to broach the question of leaving his roof this evening the events of the day had urged her to the course but its execution depended upon his mood and she anxiously awaited his manner towards her she found that it had changed he showed no further tendency to be angry he showed something worse absolute indifference had taken the place of irritability and his coldness was such that it encouraged her to departure even more than hot temper could have done  father have you any objection to my going away she asked  going away nonone whatever where are you going  she thought it undesirable and unnecessary to say anything at present about her destination to one who took so little interest in her he would know that soon enough i have heard of an opportunity of getting more cultivated and finished and being less idle she answered with hesitation a chance of a place in a household where i can have advantages of study and seeing refined life  then make the best of it in heavens nameif you cant get cultivated where you are  you dont object  objecti hono not at all after a pause he said but you wont have enough money for this lively scheme without help you know if you like i should be willing to make you an allowance so that you not be bound to live upon the starvation wages refined folk are likely to pay ee  she thanked him for this offer  it had better be done properly he added after a pause a small annuity is what i should like you to haveso as to be independent of meand so that i may be independent of you would that please ye  certainly  then ill see about it this very day he seemed relieved to get her off his hands by this arrangement and as far as they were concerned the matter was settled she now simply waited to see the lady again  the day and the hour came but a drizzling rain fell elizabethjane having now changed her orbit from one of gay independence to laborious selfhelp thought the weather good enough for such declined glory as hers if her friend would only face ita matter of doubt she went to the bootroom where her pattens had hung ever since her apotheosis took them down had their mildewed leathers blacked and put them on as she had done in old times thus mounted and with cloak and umbrella she went off to the place of appointmentintending if the lady were not there to call at the house  one side of the churchyardthe side towards the weatherwas sheltered by an ancient thatched mud wall whose eaves overhung as much as one or two feet at the back of the wall was a cornyard with its granary and barnsthe place wherein she had met farfrae many months earlier under the projection of the thatch she saw a figure the young lady had come  her presence so exceptionally substantiated the girls utmost hopes that she almost feared her good fortune fancies find rooms in the strongest minds here in a churchyard old as civilization in the worst of weathers was a strange woman of curious fascinations never seen elsewhere there might be some devilry about her presence however elizabeth went on to the church tower on whose summit the rope of a flagstaff rattled in the wind and thus she came to the wall  the lady had such a cheerful aspect in the drizzle that elizabeth forgot her fancy well said the lady a little of the whiteness of her teeth appearing with the word through the black fleece that protected her face have you decided  yes quite said the other eagerly  your father is willing  yes  then come along  when  nowas soon as you like i had a good mind to send to you to come to my house thinking you might not venture up here in the wind but as i like getting out of doors i thought i would come and see first  it was my own thought  that shows we shall agree then can you come today my house is so hollow and dismal that i want some living thing there  i think i might be able to said the girl reflecting  voices were borne over to them at that instant on the wind and raindrops from the other side of the wall there came such words as sacks quarters threshing tailing next saturdays market each sentence being disorganized by the gusts like a face in a cracked mirror both the women listened  who are those said the lady  one is my father he rents that yard and barn  the lady seemed to forget the immediate business in listening to the technicalities of the corn trade at last she said suddenly did you tell him where you were going to  no  ohow was that  i thought it safer to get away firstas he is so uncertain in his temper  perhaps you are rightbesides i have never told you my name it is miss templemanare they goneon the other side  no they have only gone up into the granary  well it is getting damp here i shall expect you todaythis evening say at six  which way shall i come maam  the front wayround by the gate there is no other that i have noticed  elizabethjane had been thinking of the door in the alley  perhaps as you have not mentioned your destination you may as well keep silent upon it till you are clear off who knows but that he may alter his mind  elizabethjane shook her head on consideration i dont fear it she said sadly he has grown quite cold to me  very well six oclock then  when they had emerged upon the open road and parted they found enough to do in holding their bowed umbrellas to the wind nevertheless the lady looked in at the cornyard gates as she passed them and paused on one foot for a moment but nothing was visible there save the ricks and the humpbacked barn cushioned with moss and the granary rising against the churchtower behind where the smacking of the rope against the flagstaff still went on  now henchard had not the slightest suspicion that elizabethjanes movement was to be so prompt hence when just before six he reached home and saw a fly at the door from the kings arms and his stepdaughter with all her little bags and boxes getting into it he was taken by surprise  but you said i might go father she explained through the carriage window  saidyes but i thought you meant next month or next year od seize ityou take time by the forelock this then is how you be going to treat me for all my trouble about ye  o father how can you speak like that it is unjust of you she said with spirit  well well have your own way he replied he entered the house and seeing that all her things had not yet been brought down went up to her room to look on he had never been there since she had occupied it evidences of her care of her endeavours for improvement were visible all around in the form of books sketches maps and little arrangements for tasteful effects henchard had known nothing of these efforts he gazed at them turned suddenly about and came down to the door  look here he said in an altered voicehe never called her by name nowdont ee go away from me it may be ive spoke roughly to youbut ive been grieved beyond everything by youtheres something that caused it  by me she said with deep concern what have i done  i cant tell you now but if youll stop and go on living as my daughter ill tell you all in time  but the proposal had come ten minutes too late she was in the flywas already in imagination at the house of the lady whose manner had such charms for her father she said as considerately as she could i think it best for us that i go on now i need not stay long i shall not be far away and if you want me badly i can soon come back again  he nodded ever so slightly as a receipt of her decision and no more you are not going far you say what will be your address in case i wish to write to you or am i not to know  oh yescertainly it is only in the townhighplace hall  where said henchard his face stilling  she repeated the words he neither moved nor spoke and waving her hand to him in utmost friendliness she signified to the flyman to drive up the street     22   we go back for a moment to the preceding night to account for henchards attitude  at the hour when elizabethjane was contemplating her stealthy reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy he had been not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in lucettas wellknown characters the selfrepression the resignation of her previous communication had vanished from her mood she wrote with some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early acquaintance   highplace hall  my dear mr hencharddont be surprised it is for your good and mine as i hope that i have come to live at casterbridgefor how long i cannot tell that depends upon another and he is a man and a merchant and a mayor and one who has the first right to my affections  seriously mon ami i am not so lighthearted as i may seem to be from this i have come here in consequence of hearing of the death of your wifewhom you used to think of as dead so many years before poor woman she seems to have been a sufferer though uncomplaining and though weak in intellect not an imbecile i am glad you acted fairly by her as soon as i knew she was no more it was brought home to me very forcibly by my conscience that i ought to endeavour to disperse the shade which my etourderie flung over my name by asking you to carry out your promise to me i hope you are of the same mind and that you will take steps to this end as however i did not know how you were situated or what had happened since our separation i decided to come and establish myself here before communicating with you  you probably feel as i do about this i shall be able to see you in a day or two till then farewellyours  lucetta  psi was unable to keep my appointment to meet you for a moment or two in passing through casterbridge the other day my plans were altered by a family event which it will surprise you to hear of   henchard had already heard that highplace hall was being prepared for a tenant he said with a puzzled air to the first person he encountered who is coming to live at the hall  a lady of the name of templeman i believe sir said his informant  henchard thought it over lucetta is related to her i suppose he said to himself yes i must put her in her proper position undoubtedly  it was by no means with the oppression that would once have accompanied the thought that he regarded the moral necessity now it was indeed with interest if not warmth his bitter disappointment at finding elizabethjane to be none of his and himself a childless man had left an emotional void in henchard that he unconsciously craved to fill in this frame of mind though without strong feeling he had strolled up the alley and into highplace hall by the postern at which elizabeth had so nearly encountered him he had gone on thence into the court and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if miss le sueur was living there miss le sueur had been the name under which he had known lucettaor lucette as she had called herself at that time  the man replied in the negative that miss templeman only had come henchard went away concluding that lucetta had not as yet settled in  he was in this interested stage of the inquiry when he witnessed elizabethjanes departure the next day on hearing her announce the address there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that lucetta and miss templeman were one and the same person for he could recall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich relative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been given as templeman though he was not a fortunehunter the possibility that lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent testament on the part of this relative lent a charm to her image which it might not otherwise have acquired he was getting on towards the dead level of middle age when material things increasingly possess the mind  but henchard was not left long in suspense lucetta was rather addicted to scribbling as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the fiasco in their marriage arrangements and hardly had elizabeth gone away when another note came to the mayors house from highplace hall   i am in residence she said and comfortable though getting here has been a wearisome undertaking you probably know what i am going to tell you or do you not my good aunt templeman the bankers widow whose very existence you used to doubt much more her affluence has lately died and bequeathed some of her property to me i will not enter into details except to say that i have taken her nameas a means of escape from mine and its wrongs  i am now my own mistress and have chosen to reside in casterbridgeto be tenant of highplace hall that at least you may be put to no trouble if you wish to see me my first intention was to keep you in ignorance of the changes in my life till you should meet me in the street but i have thought better of this  you probably are aware of my arrangement with your daughter and have doubtless laughed at thewhat shall i call itpractical joke in all affection of my getting her to live with me but my first meeting with her was purely an accident do you see michael partly why i have done itwhy to give you an excuse for coming here as if to visit her and thus to form my acquaintance naturally she is a dear good girl and she thinks you have treated her with undue severity you may have done so in your haste but not deliberately i am sure as the result has been to bring her to me i am not disposed to upbraid youin haste yours always  lucetta   the excitement which these announcements produced in henchards gloomy soul was to him most pleasurable he sat over his diningtable long and dreamily and by an almost mechanical transfer the sentiments which had run to waste since his estrangement from elizabethjane and donald farfrae gathered around lucetta before they had grown dry she was plainly in a very comingon disposition for marriage but what else could a poor woman be who had given her time and her heart to him so thoughtlessly at that former time as to lose her credit by it probably conscience no less than affection had brought her here on the whole he did not blame her  the artful little woman he said smiling with reference to lucettas adroit and pleasant manoeuvre with elizabethjane  to feel that he would like to see lucetta was with henchard to start for her house he put on his hat and went it was between eight and nine oclock when he reached her door the answer brought him was that miss templeman was engaged for that evening but that she would be happy to see him the next day  thats rather like giving herself airs he thought and considering what we but after all she plainly had not expected him and he took the refusal quietly nevertheless he resolved not to go next day these cursed womentheres not an inch of straight grain in em he said  let us follow the train of mr henchards thought as if it were a clue line and view the interior of highplace hall on this particular evening  on elizabethjanes arrival she had been phlegmatically asked by an elderly woman to go upstairs and take off her things she replied with great earnestness that she would not think of giving that trouble and on the instant divested herself of her bonnet and cloak in the passage she was then conducted to the first floor on the landing and left to find her way further alone  the room disclosed was prettily furnished as a boudoir or small drawingroom and on a sofa with two cylindrical pillows reclined a darkhaired largeeyed pretty woman of unmistakably french extraction on one side or the other she was probably some years older than elizabeth and had a sparkling light in her eye in front of the sofa was a small table with a pack of cards scattered upon it faces upward  the attitude had been so full of abandonment that she bounded up like a spring on hearing the door open  perceiving that it was elizabeth she lapsed into ease and came across to her with a reckless skip that innate grace only prevented from being boisterous  why you are late she said taking hold of elizabethjanes hands  there were so many little things to put up  and you seem deadalive and tired let me try to enliven you by some wonderful tricks i have learnt to kill time sit there and dont move she gathered up the pack of cards pulled the table in front of her and began to deal them rapidly telling elizabeth to choose some  well have you chosen she asked flinging down the last card  no stammered elizabeth arousing herself from a reverie i forgot i was thinking ofyou and meand how strange it is that i am here  miss templeman looked at elizabethjane with interest and laid down the cards ah never mind she said ill lie here while you sit by me and well talk  elizabeth drew up silently to the head of the sofa but with obvious pleasure it could be seen that though in years she was younger than her entertainer in manner and general vision she seemed more of the sage miss templeman deposited herself on the sofa in her former flexuous position and throwing her arm above her browsomewhat in the pose of a wellknown conception of titianstalked up at elizabethjane invertedly across her forehead and arm  i must tell you something she said i wonder if you have suspected it i have only been mistress of a large house and fortune a little while  ohonly a little while murmured elizabethjane her countenance slightly falling  as a girl i lived about in garrison towns and elsewhere with my father till i was quite flighty and unsettled he was an officer in the army i should not have mentioned this had i not thought it best you should know the truth  yes yes she looked thoughtfully round the roomat the little square piano with brass inlayings at the windowcurtains at the lamp at the fair and dark kings and queens on the cardtable and finally at the inverted face of lucetta templeman whose large lustrous eyes had such an odd effect upside down  elizabeths mind ran on acquirements to an almost morbid degree you speak french and italian fluently no doubt she said i have not been able to get beyond a wretched bit of latin yet  well for that matter in my native isle speaking french does not go for much it is rather the other way  where is your native isle  it was with rather more reluctance that miss templeman said jersey there they speak french on one side of the street and english on the other and a mixed tongue in the middle of the road but it is a long time since i was there bath is where my people really belong to though my ancestors in jersey were as good as anybody in england they were the le sueurs an old family who have done great things in their time i went back and lived there after my fathers death but i dont value such past matters and am quite an english person in my feelings and tastes  lucettas tongue had for a moment outrun her discretion she had arrived at casterbridge as a bath lady and there were obvious reasons why jersey should drop out of her life but elizabeth had tempted her to make free and a deliberately formed resolve had been broken  it could not however have been broken in safer company lucettas words went no further and after this day she was so much upon her guard that there appeared no chance of her identification with the young jersey woman who had been henchards dear comrade at a critical time not the least amusing of her safeguards was her resolute avoidance of a french word if one by accident came to her tongue more readily than its english equivalent she shirked it with the suddenness of the weak apostle at the accusation thy speech bewrayeth thee  expectancy sat visibly upon lucetta the next morning she dressed herself for mr henchard and restlessly awaited his call before midday as he did not come she waited on through the afternoon but she did not tell elizabeth that the person expected was the girls stepfather  they sat in adjoining windows of the same room in lucettas great stone mansion netting and looking out upon the market which formed an animated scene elizabeth could see the crown of her stepfathers hat among the rest beneath and was not aware that lucetta watched the same object with yet intenser interest he moved about amid the throng at this point lively as an anthill elsewhere more reposeful and broken up by stalls of fruit and vegetables  the farmers as a rule preferred the open carrefour for their transactions despite its inconvenient jostlings and the danger from crossing vehicles to the gloomy sheltered marketroom provided for them here they surged on this one day of the week forming a little world of leggings switches and samplebags men of extensive stomachs sloping like mountain sides men whose heads in walking swayed as the trees in november gales who in conversing varied their attitudes much lowering themselves by spreading their knees and thrusting their hands into the pockets of remote inner jackets their faces radiated tropical warmth for though when at home their countenances varied with the seasons their marketfaces all the year round were glowing little fires  all overclothes here were worn as if they were an inconvenience a hampering necessity some men were well dressed but the majority were careless in that respect appearing in suits which were historical records of their wearers deeds sunscorchings and daily struggles for many years past yet many carried ruffled chequebooks in their pockets which regulated at the bank hard by a balance of never less than four figures in fact what these gibbous human shapes specially represented was ready moneymoney insistently readynot ready next year like a noblemansoften not merely ready at the bank like a professional mans but ready in their large plump hands  it happened that today there rose in the midst of them all two or three tall appletrees standing as if they grew on the spot till it was perceived that they were held by men from the ciderdistricts who came here to sell them bringing the clay of their county on their boots elizabethjane who had often observed them said i wonder if the same trees come every week  what trees said lucetta absorbed in watching for henchard  elizabeth replied vaguely for an incident checked her behind one of the trees stood farfrae briskly discussing a samplebag with a farmer henchard had come up accidentally encountering the young man whose face seemed to inquire do we speak to each other  she saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered no elizabethjane sighed  are you particularly interested in anybody out there said lucetta  o no said her companion a quick red shooting over her face  luckily farfraes figure was immediately covered by the appletree  lucetta looked hard at her quite sure she said  o yes said elizabethjane  again lucetta looked out they are all farmers i suppose she said  no theres mr bulgehes a wine merchant theres benjamin brownleta horse dealer and kitson the pig breeder and yopper the auctioneer besides maltsters and millersand so on farfrae stood out quite distinctly now but she did not mention him  the saturday afternoon slipped on thus desultorily the market changed from the sampleshowing hour to the idle hour before starting homewards when tales were told henchard had not called on lucetta though he had stood so near he must have been too busy she thought he would come on sunday or monday  the days came but not the visitor though lucetta repeated her dressing with scrupulous care she got disheartened it may at once be declared that lucetta no longer bore towards henchard all that warm allegiance which had characterized her in their first acquaintance the then unfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably but there remained a conscientious wish to bring about her union with him now that there was nothing to hinder itto right her positionwhich in itself was a happiness to sigh for with strong social reasons on her side why their marriage should take place there had ceased to be any worldly reason on his why it should be postponed since she had succeeded to fortune  tuesday was the great candlemas fair at breakfast she said to elizabethjane quite coolly i imagine your father may call to see you today i suppose he stands close by in the marketplace with the rest of the corndealers  she shook her head he wont come  why  he has taken against me she said in a husky voice  you have quarreled more deeply than i know of  elizabeth wishing to shield the man she believed to be her father from any charge of unnatural dislike said yes  then where you are is of all places the one he will avoid  elizabeth nodded sadly  lucetta looked blank twitched up her lovely eyebrows and lip and burst into hysterical sobs here was a disasterher ingenious scheme completely stultified  o my dear miss templemanwhats the matter cried her companion  i like your company much said lucetta as soon as she could speak  yes yesand so do i yours elizabeth chimed in soothingly  butbut she could not finish the sentence which was naturally that if henchard had such a rooted dislike for the girl as now seemed to be the case elizabethjane would have to be got rid ofa disagreeable necessity  a provisional resource suggested itself miss henchardwill you go on an errand for me as soon as breakfast is overah thats very good of you will you go and order here she enumerated several commissions at sundry shops which would occupy elizabeths time for the next hour or two at least  and have you ever seen the museum  elizabethjane had not  then you should do so at once you can finish the morning by going there it is an old house in a back streeti forget wherebut youll find outand there are crowds of interesting thingsskeletons teeth old pots and pans ancient boots and shoes birds eggsall charmingly instructive youll be sure to stay till you get quite hungry  elizabeth hastily put on her things and departed i wonder why she wants to get rid of me today she said sorrowfully as she went that her absence rather than her services or instruction was in request had been readily apparent to elizabethjane simple as she seemed and difficult as it was to attribute a motive for the desire  she had not been gone ten minutes when one of lucettas servants was sent to henchards with a note the contents were briefly   dear michaelyou will be standing in view of my house today for two or three hours in the course of your business so do please call and see me i am sadly disappointed that you have not come before for can i help anxiety about my own equivocal relation to youespecially now my aunts fortune has brought me more prominently before society your daughters presence here may be the cause of your neglect and i have therefore sent her away for the morning say you come on businessi shall be quite alone  lucetta   when the messenger returned her mistress gave directions that if a gentleman called he was to be admitted at once and sat down to await results  sentimentally she did not much care to see himhis delays had wearied her but it was necessary and with a sigh she arranged herself picturesquely in the chair first this way then that next so that the light fell over her head next she flung herself on the couch in the cymarecta curve which so became her and with her arm over her brow looked towards the door this she decided was the best position after all and thus she remained till a mans step was heard on the stairs whereupon lucetta forgetting her curve for nature was too strong for art as yet jumped up and ran and hid herself behind one of the windowcurtains in a freak of timidity in spite of the waning of passion the situation was an agitating oneshe had not seen henchard since his supposed temporary parting from her in jersey  she could hear the servant showing the visitor into the room shutting the door upon him and leaving as if to go and look for her mistress lucetta flung back the curtain with a nervous greeting the man before her was not henchard     23   a conjecture that her visitor might be some other person had indeed flashed through lucettas mind when she was on the point of bursting out but it was just too late to recede  he was years younger than the mayor of casterbridge fair fresh and slenderly handsome he wore genteel cloth leggings with white buttons polished boots with infinite lace holes light cord breeches under a black velveteen coat and waistcoat and he had a silvertopped switch in his hand lucetta blushed and said with a curious mixture of pout and laugh on her faceo ive made a mistake  the visitor on the contrary did not laugh half a wrinkle  but im very sorry he said in deprecating tones i came and i inquired for miss henchard and they showed me up here and in no case would i have caught ye so unmannerly if i had known  i was the unmannerly one she said  but is it that i have come to the wrong house madam said mr farfrae blinking a little in his bewilderment and nervously tapping his legging with his switch  o no sirsit down you must come and sit down now you are here replied lucetta kindly to relieve his embarrassment miss henchard will be here directly  now this was not strictly true but that something about the young manthat hyperborean crispness stringency and charm as of a wellbraced musical instrument which had awakened the interest of henchard and of elizabethjane and of the three mariners jovial crew at sight made his unexpected presence here attractive to lucetta he hesitated looked at the chair thought there was no danger in it though there was and sat down  farfraes sudden entry was simply the result of henchards permission to him to see elizabeth if he were minded to woo her at first he had taken no notice of henchards brusque letter but an exceptionally fortunate business transaction put him on good terms with everybody and revealed to him that he could undeniably marry if he chose then who so pleasing thrifty and satisfactory in every way as elizabethjane apart from her personal recommendations a reconciliation with his former friend henchard would in the natural course of things flow from such a union he therefore forgave the mayor his curtness and this morning on his way to the fair he had called at her house where he learnt that she was staying at miss templemans a little stimulated at not finding her ready and waitingso fanciful are menhe hastened on to highplace hall to encounter no elizabeth but its mistress herself  the fair today seems a large one she said when by natural deviation their eyes sought the busy scene without your numerous fairs and markets keep me interested how many things i think of while i watch from here  he seemed in doubt how to answer and the babble without reached them as they satvoices as of wavelets on a looping sea one ever and anon rising above the rest do you look out often he asked  yesvery often  do you look for any one you know  why should she have answered as she did  i look as at a picture merely but she went on turning pleasantly to him i may do so nowi may look for you you are always there are you not ahi dont mean it seriously but it is amusing to look for somebody one knows in a crowd even if one does not want him it takes off the terrible oppressiveness of being surrounded by a throng and having no point of junction with it through a single individual  ay maybe youll be very lonely maam  nobody knows how lonely  but you are rich they say  if so i dont know how to enjoy my riches i came to casterbridge thinking i should like to live here but i wonder if i shall  where did ye come from maam  the neighbourhood of bath  and i from near edinboro he murmured its better to stay at home and thats true but a man must live where his money is made it is a great pity but its always so yet ive done very well this year o yes he went on with ingenuous enthusiasm you see that man with the drab kerseymere coat i bought largely of him in the autumn when wheat was down and then afterwards when it rose a little i sold off all i had it brought only a small profit to me while the farmers kept theirs expecting higher figuresyes though the rats were gnawing the ricks hollow just when i sold the markets went lower and i bought up the corn of those who had been holding back at less price than my first purchases and then cried farfrae impetuously his face alight i sold it a few weeks after when it happened to go up again and so by contenting mysel with small profits frequently repeated i soon made five hundred poundsyesbringing down his hand upon the table and quite forgetting where he waswhile the others by keeping theirs in hand made nothing at all  lucetta regarded him with a critical interest he was quite a new type of person to her at last his eye fell upon the ladys and their glances met  ay now im wearying you he exclaimed  she said no indeed colouring a shade  what then  quite otherwise you are most interesting  it was now farfrae who showed the modest pink  i mean all you scotchmen she added in hasty correction so free from southern extremes we common people are all one way or the otherwarm or cold passionate or frigid you have both temperatures going on in you at the same time  but how do you mean that ye were best to explain clearly maam  you are animatedthen you are thinking of getting on you are sad the next momentthen you are thinking of scotland and friends  yes i think of home sometimes he said simply  so do ias far as i can but it was an old house where i was born and they pulled it down for improvements so i seem hardly to have any home to think of now  lucetta did not add as she might have done that the house was in st helier and not in bath  but the mountains and the mists and the rocks they are there and dont they seem like home  she shook her head  they do to methey do to me he murmured and his mind could be seen flying away northwards whether its origin were national or personal it was quite true what lucetta had said that the curious double strands in farfraes thread of lifethe commercial and the romanticwere very distinct at times like the colours in a variegated cord those contrasts could be seen intertwisted yet not mingling  you are wishing you were back again she said  ah no maam said farfrae suddenly recalling himself  the fair without the windows was now raging thick and loud it was the chief hiring fair of the year and differed quite from the market of a few days earlier in substance it was a whiteybrown crowd flecked with whitethis being the body of labourers waiting for places the long bonnets of the women like waggontilts their cotton gowns and checked shawls mixed with the carters smockfrocks for they too entered into the hiring among the rest at the corner of the pavement stood an old shepherd who attracted the eyes of lucetta and farfrae by his stillness he was evidently a chastened man the battle of life had been a sharp one with him for to begin with he was a man of small frame he was now so bowed by hard work and years that approaching from behind a person could hardly see his head he had planted the stem of his crook in the gutter and was resting upon the bow which was polished to silver brightness by the long friction of his hands he had quite forgotten where he was and what he had come for his eyes being bent on the ground a little way off negotiations were proceeding which had reference to him but he did not hear them and there seemed to be passing through his mind pleasant visions of the hiring successes of his prime when his skill laid open to him any farm for the asking  the negotiations were between a farmer from a distant county and the old mans son in these there was a difficulty the farmer would not take the crust without the crumb of the bargain in other words the old man without the younger and the son had a sweetheart on his present farm who stood by waiting the issue with pale lips  im sorry to leave ye nelly said the young man with emotion but you see i cant starve father and hes out o work at ladyday tis only thirtyfive mile  the girls lips quivered thirtyfive mile she murmured ah tis enough i shall never see ee again it was indeed a hopeless length of traction for dan cupids magnet for young men were young men at casterbridge as elsewhere  o no noi never shall she insisted when he pressed her hand and she turned her face to lucettas wall to hide her weeping the farmer said he would give the young man halfanhour for his answer and went away leaving the group sorrowing  lucettas eyes full of tears met farfraes his too to her surprise were moist at the scene  it is very hard she said with strong feelings lovers ought not to be parted like that o if i had my wish id let people live and love at their pleasure  maybe i can manage that theyll not be parted said farfrae i want a young carter and perhaps ill take the old man tooyes hell not be very expensive and doubtless he will answer my pairrpose somehow  o you are so good she cried delighted go and tell them and let me know if you have succeeded  farfrae went out and she saw him speak to the group the eyes of all brightened the bargain was soon struck farfrae returned to her immediately it was concluded  it is kindhearted of you indeed said lucetta for my part i have resolved that all my servants shall have lovers if they want them do make the same resolve  farfrae looked more serious waving his head a half turn i must be a little stricter than that he said  why  you are aa thriving woman and i am a struggling hayandcorn merchant  i am a very ambitious woman  ah well i cannet explain i dont know how to talk to ladies ambitious or no and thats true said donald with grave regret i try to be civil to a folkno more  i see you are as you say replied she sensibly getting the upper hand in these exchanges of sentiment under this revelation of insight farfrae again looked out of the window into the thick of the fair  two farmers met and shook hands and being quite near the window their remarks could be heard as others had been  have you seen young mr farfrae this morning asked one he promised to meet me here at the stroke of twelve but ive gone athwart and about the fair halfadozen times and never a sign of him though hes mostly a man to his word  i quite forgot the engagement murmured farfrae  now you must go said she must you not  yes he replied but he still remained  you had better go she urged you will lose a customer  now miss templeman you will make me angry exclaimed farfrae  then suppose you dont go but stay a little longer  he looked anxiously at the farmer who was seeking him and who just then ominously walked across to where henchard was standing and he looked into the room and at her i like staying but i fear i must go he said business ought not to be neglected ought it  not for a single minute  its true ill come another timeif i may maam  certainly she said what has happened to us today is very curious  something to think over when we are alone its like to be  oh i dont know that it is commonplace after all  no ill not say that o no  well whatever it has been it is now over and the market calls you to be gone  yes yes marketbusiness i wish there were no business in the warrld  lucetta almost laughedshe would quite have laughedbut that there was a little emotion going in her at the time how you change she said you should not change like this  i have never wished such things before said the scotchman with a simple shamed apologetic look for his weakness it is only since coming here and seeing you  if thats the case you had better not look at me any longer dear me i feel i have quite demoralized you  but look or look not i will see you in my thoughts well ill gothank you for the pleasure of this visit  thank you for staying  maybe ill get into my marketmind when ive been out a few minutes he murmured but i dont knowi dont know  as he went she said eagerly you may hear them speak of me in casterbridge as time goes on if they tell you im a coquette which some may because of the incidents of my life dont believe it for i am not  i swear i will not he said fervidly  thus the two she had enkindled the young mans enthusiasm till he was quite brimming with sentiment while he from merely affording her a new form of idleness had gone on to wake her serious solicitude why was this they could not have told  lucetta as a young girl would hardly have looked at a tradesman but her ups and downs capped by her indiscretions with henchard had made her uncritical as to station in her poverty she had met with repulse from the society to which she had belonged and she had no great zest for renewing an attempt upon it now her heart longed for some ark into which it could fly and be at rest rough or smooth she did not care so long as it was warm  farfrae was shown out it having entirely escaped him that he had called to see elizabeth lucetta at the window watched him threading the maze of farmers and farmers men she could see by his gait that he was conscious of her eyes and her heart went out to him for his modestypleaded with her sense of his unfitness that he might be allowed to come again he entered the markethouse and she could see him no more  three minutes later when she had left the window knocks not of multitude but of strength sounded through the house and the waitingmaid tripped up  the mayor she said  lucetta had reclined herself and she was looking dreamily through her fingers she did not answer at once and the maid repeated the information with the addition and hes afraid he hasnt much time to spare he says  oh then tell him that as i have a headache i wont detain him today  the message was taken down and she heard the door close  lucetta had come to casterbridge to quicken henchards feelings with regard to her she had quickened them and now she was indifferent to the achievement  her morning view of elizabethjane as a disturbing element changed and she no longer felt strongly the necessity of getting rid of the girl for her stepfathers sake when the young woman came in sweetly unconscious of the turn in the tide lucetta went up to her and said quite sincerely  im so glad youve come youll live with me a long time wont you  elizabeth as a watchdog to keep her father offwhat a new idea yet it was not unpleasing henchard had neglected her all these days after compromising her indescribably in the past the least he could have done when he found himself free and herself affluent would have been to respond heartily and promptly to her invitation  her emotions rose fell undulated filled her with wild surmise at their suddenness and so passed lucettas experiences of that day     24   poor elizabethjane little thinking what her malignant star had done to blast the budding attentions she had won from donald farfrae was glad to hear lucettas words about remaining  for in addition to lucettas house being a home that raking view of the marketplace which it afforded had as much attraction for her as for lucetta the carrefour was like the regulation open place in spectacular dramas where the incidents that occur always happen to bear on the lives of the adjoining residents farmers merchants dairymen quacks hawkers appeared there from week to week and disappeared as the afternoon wasted away it was the node of all orbits  from saturday to saturday was as from day to day with the two young women now in an emotional sense they did not live at all during the intervals wherever they might go wandering on other days on marketday they were sure to be at home both stole sly glances out of the window at farfraes shoulders and poll his face they seldom saw for either through shyness or not to disturb his mercantile mood he avoided looking towards their quarters  thus things went on till a certain marketmorning brought a new sensation elizabeth and lucetta were sitting at breakfast when a parcel containing two dresses arrived for the latter from london she called elizabeth from her breakfast and entering her friends bedroom elizabeth saw the gowns spread out on the bed one of a deep cherry colour the other lightera glove lying at the end of each sleeve a bonnet at the top of each neck and parasols across the gloves lucetta standing beside the suggested human figure in an attitude of contemplation  i wouldnt think so hard about it said elizabeth marking the intensity with which lucetta was alternating the question whether this or that would suit best  but settling upon new clothes is so trying said lucetta you are that person pointing to one of the arrangements or you are that totally different person pointing to the other for the whole of the coming spring and one of the two you dont know which may turn out to be very objectionable  it was finally decided by miss templeman that she would be the cherrycoloured person at all hazards the dress was pronounced to be a fit and lucetta walked with it into the front room elizabeth following her  the morning was exceptionally bright for the time of year the sun fell so flat on the houses and pavement opposite lucettas residence that they poured their brightness into her rooms suddenly after a rumbling of wheels there were added to this steady light a fantastic series of circling irradiations upon the ceiling and the companions turned to the window immediately opposite a vehicle of strange description had come to a standstill as if it had been placed there for exhibition  it was the newfashioned agricultural implement called a horsedrill till then unknown in its modern shape in this part of the country where the venerable seedlip was still used for sowing as in the days of the heptarchy its arrival created about as much sensation in the cornmarket as a flying machine would create at charing cross the farmers crowded round it women drew near it children crept under and into it the machine was painted in bright hues of green yellow and red and it resembled as a whole a compound of hornet grasshopper and shrimp magnified enormously or it might have been likened to an upright musical instrument with the front gone that was how it struck lucetta why it is a sort of agricultural piano she said  it has something to do with corn said elizabeth  i wonder who thought of introducing it here  donald farfrae was in the minds of both as the innovator for though not a farmer he was closely leagued with farming operations and as if in response to their thought he came up at that moment looked at the machine walked round it and handled it as if he knew something about its make the two watchers had inwardly started at his coming and elizabeth left the window went to the back of the room and stood as if absorbed in the panelling of the wall she hardly knew that she had done this till lucetta animated by the conjunction of her new attire with the sight of farfrae spoke out let us go and look at the instrument whatever it is  elizabethjanes bonnet and shawl were pitchforked on in a moment and they went out among all the agriculturists gathered round the only appropriate possessor of the new machine seemed to be lucetta because she alone rivalled it in colour  they examined it curiously observing the rows of trumpetshaped tubes one within the other the little scoops like revolving saltspoons which tossed the seed into the upper ends of the tubes that conducted it to the ground till somebody said good morning elizabethjane she looked up and there was her stepfather  his greeting had been somewhat dry and thunderous and elizabethjane embarrassed out of her equanimity stammered at random this is the lady i live with fathermiss templeman  henchard put his hand to his hat which he brought down with a great wave till it met his body at the knee miss templeman bowed i am happy to become acquainted with you mr henchard she said this is a curious machine  yes henchard replied and he proceeded to explain it and still more forcibly to ridicule it  who brought it here said lucetta  oh dont ask me maam said henchard the thingwhy tis impossible it should act twas brought here by one of our machinists on the recommendation of a jumpedup jackanapes of a fellow who thinks his eye caught elizabethjanes imploring face and he stopped probably thinking that the suit might be progressing  he turned to go away then something seemed to occur which his stepdaughter fancied must really be a hallucination of hers a murmur apparently came from henchards lips in which she detected the words you refused to see me reproachfully addressed to lucetta she could not believe that they had been uttered by her stepfather unless indeed they might have been spoken to one of the yellowgaitered farmers near them yet lucetta seemed silent and then all thought of the incident was dissipated by the humming of a song which sounded as though from the interior of the machine henchard had by this time vanished into the markethouse and both the women glanced towards the corndrill they could see behind it the bent back of a man who was pushing his head into the internal works to master their simple secrets the hummed song went on       tws on a smr afternn      a wee bere the sn wnt dn      when kitty wi a braw nw gwn      cme owre the hlls to gowrie  elizabethjane had apprehended the singer in a moment and looked guilty of she did not know what lucetta next recognized him and more mistress of herself said archly the lass of gowrie from inside of a seeddrillwhat a phenomenon  satisfied at last with his investigation the young man stood upright and met their eyes across the summit  we are looking at the wonderful new drill miss templeman said but practically it is a stupid thingis it not she added on the strength of henchards information  stupid o no said farfrae gravely it will revolutionize sowing heerabout no more sowers flinging their seed about broadcast so that some falls by the wayside and some among thorns and all that each grain will go straight to its intended place and nowhere else whatever  then the romance of the sower is gone for good observed elizabethjane who felt herself at one with farfrae in biblereading at least he that observeth the wind shall not sow so the preacher said but his words will not be to the point any more how things change  ay ayit must be so donald admitted his gaze fixing itself on a blank point far away but the machines are already very common in the east and north of england he added apologetically  lucetta seemed to be outside this train of sentiment her acquaintance with the scriptures being somewhat limited is the machine yours she asked of farfrae  o no madam said he becoming embarrassed and deferential at the sound of her voice though with elizabeth jane he was quite at his ease no noi merely recommended that it should be got  in the silence which followed farfrae appeared only conscious of her to have passed from perception of elizabeth into a brighter sphere of existence than she appertained to lucetta discerning that he was much mixed that day partly in his mercantile mood and partly in his romantic one said gaily to him  well dont forsake the machine for us and went indoors with her companion  the latter felt that she had been in the way though why was unaccountable to her lucetta explained the matter somewhat by saying when they were again in the sittingroom  i had occasion to speak to mr farfrae the other day and so i knew him this morning  lucetta was very kind towards elizabeth that day together they saw the market thicken and in course of time thin away with the slow decline of the sun towards the upper end of town its rays taking the street endways and enfilading the long thoroughfare from top to bottom the gigs and vans disappeared one by one till there was not a vehicle in the street the time of the riding world was over the pedestrian world held sway field labourers and their wives and children trooped in from the villages for their weekly shopping and instead of a rattle of wheels and a tramp of horses ruling the sound as earlier there was nothing but the shuffle of many feet all the implements were gone all the farmers all the moneyed class the character of the towns trading had changed from bulk to multiplicity and pence were handled now as pounds had been handled earlier in the day  lucetta and elizabeth looked out upon this for though it was night and the street lamps were lighted they had kept their shutters unclosed in the faint blink of the fire they spoke more freely  your father was distant with you said lucetta  yes and having forgotten the momentary mystery of henchards seeming speech to lucetta she continued it is because he does not think i am respectable i have tried to be so more than you can imagine but in vain my mothers separation from my father was unfortunate for me you dont know what it is to have shadows like that upon your life  lucetta seemed to wince i do notof that kind precisely she said but you may feel asense of disgraceshamein other ways  have you ever had any such feeling said the younger innocently  o no said lucetta quickly i was thinking ofwhat happens sometimes when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world from no fault of their own  it must make them very unhappy afterwards  it makes them anxious for might not other women despise them  not altogether despise them yet not quite like or respect them  lucetta winced again her past was by no means secure from investigation even in casterbridge for one thing henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement possibly they were destroyed but she could have wished that they had never been written  the rencounter with farfrae and his bearings towards lucetta had made the reflective elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion a few days afterwards when her eyes met lucettas as the latter was going out she somehow knew that miss templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive scotchman the fact was printed large all over lucettas cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as elizabethjane was beginning to do lucetta passed on and closed the street door  a seers spirit took possession of elizabeth impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed she followed lucetta thus mentallysaw her encounter donald somewhere as if by chancesaw him wear his special look when meeting women with an added intensity because this one was lucetta she depicted his impassioned manner beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed depicted their shaking of hands how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion thus invisible to all but themselves this discerning silent witch had not done thinking of these things when lucetta came noiselessly behind her and made her start  it was all true as she had picturedshe could have sworn it lucetta had a heightened luminousness in her eye over and above the advanced colour of her cheeks  youve seen mr farfrae said elizabeth demurely  yes said lucetta how did you know  she knelt down on the hearth and took her friends hands excitedly in her own but after all she did not say when or how she had seen him or what he had said  that night she became restless in the morning she was feverish and at breakfasttime she told her companion that she had something on her mindsomething which concerned a person in whom she was interested much elizabeth was earnest to listen and sympathize  this persona ladyonce admired a man muchvery much she said tentatively  ah said elizabethjane  they were intimaterather he did not think so deeply of her as she did of him but in an impulsive moment purely out of reparation he proposed to make her his wife she agreed but there was an unsuspected hitch in the proceedings though she had been so far compromised with him that she felt she could never belong to another man as a pure matter of conscience even if she should wish to after that they were much apart heard nothing of each other for a long time and she felt her life quite closed up for her  ahpoor girl  she suffered much on account of him though i should add that he could not altogether be blamed for what had happened at last the obstacle which separated them was providentially removed and he came to marry her  how delightful  but in the interval shemy poor friendhad seen a man she liked better than him now comes the point could she in honour dismiss the first  a new man she liked betterthats bad  yes said lucetta looking pained at a boy who was swinging the town pumphandle it is bad though you must remember that she was forced into an equivocal position with the first man by an accidentthat he was not so well educated or refined as the second and that she had discovered some qualities in the first that rendered him less desirable as a husband than she had at first thought him to be  i cannot answer said elizabethjane thoughtfully it is so difficult it wants a pope to settle that  you prefer not to perhaps lucetta showed in her appealing tone how much she leant on elizabeths judgment  yes miss templeman admitted elizabeth i would rather not say  nevertheless lucetta seemed relieved by the simple fact of having opened out the situation a little and was slowly convalescent of her headache bring me a lookingglass how do i appear to people she said languidly  wella little worn answered elizabeth eyeing her as a critic eyes a doubtful painting fetching the glass she enabled lucetta to survey herself in it which lucetta anxiously did  i wonder if i wear well as times go she observed after a while  yesfairly  where am i worst  under your eyesi notice a little brownness there  yes that is my worst place i know how many years more do you think i shall last before i get hopelessly plain  there was something curious in the way in which elizabeth though the younger had come to play the part of experienced sage in these discussions it may be five years she said judicially or with a quiet life as many as ten with no love you might calculate on ten  lucetta seemed to reflect on this as on an unalterable impartial verdict she told elizabethjane no more of the past attachment she had roughly adumbrated as the experiences of a third person and elizabeth who in spite of her philosophy was very tenderhearted sighed that night in bed at the thought that her pretty rich lucetta did not treat her to the full confidence of names and dates in her confessions for by the she of lucettas story elizabeth had not been beguiled     25   the next phase of the supersession of henchard in lucettas heart was an experiment in calling on her performed by farfrae with some apparent trepidation conventionally speaking he conversed with both miss templeman and her companion but in fact it was rather that elizabeth sat invisible in the room donald appeared not to see her at all and answered her wise little remarks with curtly indifferent monosyllables his looks and faculties hanging on the woman who could boast of a more protean variety in her phases moods opinions and also principles than could elizabeth lucetta had persisted in dragging her into the circle but she had remained like an awkward third point which that circle would not touch  susan henchards daughter bore up against the frosty ache of the treatment as she had borne up under worse things and contrived as soon as possible to get out of the inharmonious room without being missed the scotchman seemed hardly the same farfrae who had danced with her and walked with her in a delicate poise between love and friendshipthat period in the history of a love when alone it can be said to be unalloyed with pain  she stoically looked from her bedroom window and contemplated her fate as if it were written on the top of the churchtower hard by yes she said at last bringing down her palm upon the sill with a pat he is the second man of that story she told me  all this time henchards smouldering sentiments towards lucetta had been fanned into higher and higher inflammation by the circumstances of the case he was discovering that the young woman for whom he once felt a pitying warmth which had been almost chilled out of him by reflection was when now qualified with a slight inaccessibility and a more matured beauty the very being to make him satisfied with life day after day proved to him by her silence that it was no use to think of bringing her round by holding aloof so he gave in and called upon her again elizabethjane being absent  he crossed the room to her with a heavy tread of some awkwardness his strong warm gaze upon herlike the sun beside the moon in comparison with farfraes modest lookand with something of a hailfellow bearing as indeed was not unnatural but she seemed so transubstantiated by her change of position and held out her hand to him in such cool friendship that he became deferential and sat down with a perceptible loss of power he understood but little of fashion in dress yet enough to feel himself inadequate in appearance beside her whom he had hitherto been dreaming of as almost his property she said something very polite about his being good enough to call this caused him to recover balance he looked her oddly in the face losing his awe  why of course i have called lucetta he said what does that nonsense mean you know i couldnt have helped myself if i had wishedthat is if i had any kindness at all ive called to say that i am ready as soon as custom will permit to give you my name in return for your devotion and what you lost by it in thinking too little of yourself and too much of me to say that you can fix the day or month with my full consent whenever in your opinion it would be seemly you know more of these things than i  it is full early yet she said evasively  yes yes i suppose it is but you know lucetta i felt directly my poor illused susan died and when i could not bear the idea of marrying again that after what had happened between us it was my duty not to let any unnecessary delay occur before putting things to rights still i wouldnt call in a hurry becausewell you can guess how this money youve come into made me feel his voice slowly fell he was conscious that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not observable in the street he looked about the room at the novel hangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself  upon my life i didnt know such furniture as this could be bought in casterbridge he said  nor can it be said she nor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town it took a waggon and four horses to get it here  hm it looks as if you were living on capital  o no i am not  so much the better but the fact is your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward  why  an answer was not really needed and he did not furnish one well he went on theres nobody in the world i would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you lucetta and nobody i am sure who will become it more he turned to her with congratulatory admiration so fervid that she shrank somewhat notwithstanding that she knew him so well  i am greatly obliged to you for all that said she rather with an air of speaking ritual the stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived and henchard showed chagrin at oncenobody was more quick to show that than he  you may be obliged or not fort though the things i say may not have the polish of what youve lately learnt to expect for the first time in your life they are real my lady lucetta  thats rather a rude way of speaking to me pouted lucetta with stormy eyes  not at all replied henchard hotly but there there i dont wish to quarrel with ee i come with an honest proposal for silencing your jersey enemies and you ought to be thankful  how can you speak so she answered firing quickly knowing that my only crime was the indulging in a foolish girls passion for you with too little regard for correctness and that i was what i call innocent all the time they called me guilty you ought not to be so cutting i suffered enough at that worrying time when you wrote to tell me of your wifes return and my consequent dismissal and if i am a little independent now surely the privilege is due to me  yes it is he said but it is not by what is in this life but by what appears that you are judged and i therefore think you ought to accept mefor your own good names sake what is known in your native jersey may get known here  how you keep on about jersey i am english  yes yes well what do you say to my proposal  for the first time in their acquaintance lucetta had the move and yet she was backward for the present let things be she said with some embarrassment treat me as an acquaintance and ill treat you as one time will she stopped and he said nothing to fill the gap for awhile there being no pressure of half acquaintance to drive them into speech if they were not minded for it  thats the way the wind blows is it he said at last grimly nodding an affirmative to his own thoughts  a yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants it was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country in a waggon marked with farfraes name beside it rode farfrae himself on horseback lucettas face becameas a womans face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition  a turn of the eye by henchard a glance from the window and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed but henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumbstraight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon lucettas face  i shouldnt have thought iti shouldnt have thought it of women he said emphatically byandby rising and shaking himself into activity while lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry bringing him some apples she insisted upon paring one for him  he would not take it no no such is not for me he said drily and moved to the door at going out he turned his eye upon her  you came to live in casterbridge entirely on my account he said yet now you are here you wont have anything to say to my offer  he had hardly gone down the staircase when she dropped upon the sofa and jumped up again in a fit of desperation i will love him she cried passionately as for himhes hottempered and stern and it would be madness to bind myself to him knowing that i wont be a slave to the pastill love where i choose  yet having decided to break away from henchard one might have supposed her capable of aiming higher than farfrae but lucetta reasoned nothing she feared hard words from the people with whom she had been earlier associated she had no relatives left and with native lightness of heart took kindly to what fate offered  elizabethjane surveying the position of lucetta between her two lovers from the crystalline sphere of a straightforward mind did not fail to perceive that her father as she called him and donald farfrae became more desperately enamoured of her friend every day on farfraes side it was the unforced passion of youth on henchards the artificially stimulated coveting of maturer age  the pain she experienced from the almost absolute obliviousness to her existence that was shown by the pair of them became at times half dissipated by her sense of its humourousness when lucetta had pricked her finger they were as deeply concerned as if she were dying when she herself had been seriously sick or in danger they uttered a conventional word of sympathy at the news and forgot all about it immediately but as regarded henchard this perception of hers also caused her some filial grief she could not help asking what she had done to be neglected so after the professions of solicitude he had made as regarded farfrae she thought after honest reflection that it was quite natural what was she beside lucettaas one of the meaner beauties of the night when the moon had risen in the skies  she had learnt the lesson of renunciation and was as familiar with the wreck of each days wishes as with the diurnal setting of the sun if her earthly career had taught her few book philosophies it had at least well practised her in this yet her experience had consisted less in a series of pure disappointments than in a series of substitutions continually it had happened that what she had desired had not been granted her and that what had been granted her she had not desired so she viewed with an approach to equanimity the now cancelled days when donald had been her undeclared lover and wondered what unwishedfor thing heaven might send her in place of him     26   it chanced that on a fine spring morning henchard and farfrae met in the chestnutwalk which ran along the south wall of the town each had just come out from his early breakfast and there was not another soul near henchard was reading a letter from lucetta sent in answer to a note from him in which she made some excuse for not immediately granting him a second interview that he had desired  donald had no wish to enter into conversation with his former friend on their present constrained terms neither would he pass him in scowling silence he nodded and henchard did the same they receded from each other several paces when a voice cried farfrae it was henchards who stood regarding him  do you remember said henchard as if it were the presence of the thought and not of the man which made him speak do you remember my story of that second womanwho suffered for her thoughtless intimacy with me  i do said farfrae  do you remember my telling ee how it all began and how it ended  yes  well i have offered to marry her now that i can but she wont marry me now what would you think of heri put it to you  well ye owe her nothing more now said farfrae heartily  it is true said henchard and went on  that he had looked up from a letter to ask his questions completely shut out from farfraes mind all vision of lucetta as the culprit indeed her present position was so different from that of the young woman of henchards story as of itself to be sufficient to blind him absolutely to her identity as for henchard he was reassured by farfraes words and manner against a suspicion which had crossed his mind they were not those of a conscious rival  yet that there was rivalry by some one he was firmly persuaded he could feel it in the air around lucetta see it in the turn of her pen there was an antagonistic force in exercise so that when he had tried to hang near her he seemed standing in a refluent current that it was not innate caprice he was more and more certain her windows gleamed as if they did not want him her curtains seem to hang slily as if they screened an ousting presence to discover whose presence that waswhether really farfraes after all or anothershe exerted himself to the utmost to see her again and at length succeeded  at the interview when she offered him tea he made it a point to launch a cautious inquiry if she knew mr farfrae  o yes she knew him she declared she could not help knowing almost everybody in casterbridge living in such a gazebo over the centre and arena of the town  pleasant young fellow said henchard  yes said lucetta  we both know him said kind elizabethjane to relieve her companions divined embarrassment  there was a knock at the door literally three full knocks and a little one at the end  that kind of knock means halfandhalfsomebody between gentle and simple said the cornmerchant to himself i shouldnt wonder therefore if it is he in a few seconds surely enough donald walked in  lucetta was full of little fidgets and flutters which increased henchards suspicions without affording any special proof of their correctness he was wellnigh ferocious at the sense of the queer situation in which he stood towards this woman one who had reproached him for deserting her when calumniated who had urged claims upon his consideration on that account who had lived waiting for him who at the first decent opportunity had come to ask him to rectify by making her his the false position into which she had placed herself for his sake such she had been and now he sat at her teatable eager to gain her attention and in his amatory rage feeling the other man present to be a villain just as any young fool of a lover might feel  they sat stiffly side by side at the darkening table like some tuscan painting of the two disciples supping at emmaus lucetta forming the third and haloed figure was opposite them elizabethjane being out of the game and out of the group could observe all from afar like the evangelist who had to write it down that there were long spaces of taciturnity when all exterior circumstances were subdued to the touch of spoons and china the click of a heel on the pavement under the window the passing of a wheelbarrow or cart the whistling of the carter the gush of water into householders buckets at the townpump opposite the exchange of greetings among their neighbours and the rattle of the yokes by which they carried off their evening supply  more breadandbutter said lucetta to henchard and farfrae equally holding out between them a plateful of long slices henchard took a slice by one end and donald by the other each feeling certain he was the man meant neither let go and the slice came in two  ohi am so sorry cried lucetta with a nervous titter farfrae tried to laugh but he was too much in love to see the incident in any but a tragic light  how ridiculous of all three of them said elizabeth to herself  henchard left the house with a ton of conjecture though without a grain of proof that the counterattraction was farfrae and therefore he would not make up his mind yet to elizabethjane it was plain as the townpump that donald and lucetta were incipient lovers more than once in spite of her care lucetta had been unable to restrain her glance from flitting across into farfraes eyes like a bird to its nest but henchard was constructed upon too large a scale to discern such minutiae as these by an evening light which to him were as the notes of an insect that lie above the compass of the human ear  but he was disturbed and the sense of occult rivalry in suitorship was so much superadded to the palpable rivalry of their business lives to the coarse materiality of that rivalry it added an inflaming soul  the thus vitalized antagonism took the form of action by henchard sending for jopp the manager originally displaced by farfraes arrival henchard had frequently met this man about the streets observed that his clothing spoke of neediness heard that he lived in mixen lanea back slum of the town the pis aller of casterbridge domiciliationitself almost a proof that a man had reached a stage when he would not stick at trifles  jopp came after dark by the gates of the storeyard and felt his way through the hay and straw to the office where henchard sat in solitude awaiting him  i am again out of a foreman said the cornfactor are you in a place  not so much as a beggars sir  how much do you ask  jopp named his price which was very moderate  when can you come  at this hour and moment sir said jopp who standing handspocketed at the street corner till the sun had faded the shoulders of his coat to scarecrow green had regularly watched henchard in the marketplace measured him and learnt him by virtue of the power which the still man has in his stillness of knowing the busy one better than he knows himself jopp too had had a convenient experience he was the only one in casterbridge besides henchard and the closelipped elizabeth who knew that lucetta came truly from jersey and but proximately from bath i know jersey too sir he said was living there when you used to do business that way o yeshave often seen ye there  indeed very good then the thing is settled the testimonials you showed me when you first tried fort are sufficient  that characters deteriorated in time of need possibly did not occur to henchard jopp said thank you and stood more firmly in the consciousness that at last he officially belonged to that spot  now said henchard digging his strong eyes into jopps face one thing is necessary to me as the biggest cornandhay dealer in these parts the scotchman whos taking the town trade so bold into his hands must be cut out dye hear we two cant live side by sidethats clear and certain  ive seen it all said jopp  by fair competition i mean of course henchard continued but as hard keen and unflinching as fairrather more so by such a desperate bid against him for the farmers custom as will grind him into the groundstarve him out ive capital mind ye and i can do it  im all that way of thinking said the new foreman jopps dislike of farfrae as the man who had once ursurped his place while it made him a willing tool made him at the same time commercially as unsafe a colleague as henchard could have chosen  i sometimes think he added that he must have some glass that he sees next year in he has such a knack of making everything bring him fortune  hes deep beyond all honest mens discerning but we must make him shallower well undersell him and overbuy him and so snuff him out  they then entered into specific details of the process by which this would be accomplished and parted at a late hour  elizabethjane heard by accident that jopp had been engaged by her stepfather she was so fully convinced that he was not the right man for the place that at the risk of making henchard angry she expressed her apprehension to him when they met but it was done to no purpose henchard shut up her argument with a sharp rebuff  the seasons weather seemed to favour their scheme the time was in the years immediately before foreign competition had revolutionized the trade in grain when still as from the earliest ages the wheat quotations from month to month depended entirely upon the home harvest a bad harvest or the prospect of one would double the price of corn in a few weeks and the promise of a good yield would lower it as rapidly prices were like the roads of the period steep in gradient reflecting in their phases the local conditions without engineering levellings or averages  the farmers income was ruled by the wheatcrop within his own horizon and the wheatcrop by the weather thus in person he became a sort of fleshbarometer with feelers always directed to the sky and wind around him the local atmosphere was everything to him the atmospheres of other countries a matter of indifference the people too who were not farmers the rural multitude saw in the god of the weather a more important personage than they do now indeed the feeling of the peasantry in this matter was so intense as to be almost unrealizable in these equable days their impulse was wellnigh to prostrate themselves in lamentation before untimely rains and tempests which came as the alastor of those households whose crime it was to be poor  after midsummer they watched the weathercocks as men waiting in antechambers watch the lackey sun elated them quiet rain sobered them weeks of watery tempest stupefied them that aspect of the sky which they now regard as disagreeable they then beheld as maleficent  it was june and the weather was very unfavourable casterbridge being as it were the bellboard on which all the adjacent hamlets and villages sounded their notes was decidedly dull instead of new articles in the shopwindows those that had been rejected in the foregoing summer were brought out again superseded reaphooks badlyshaped rakes shopworn leggings and timestiffened watertights reappeared furbished up as near to new as possible  henchard backed by jopp read a disastrous garnering and resolved to base his strategy against farfrae upon that reading but before acting he wishedwhat so many have wishedthat he could know for certain what was at present only strong probability he was superstitiousas such headstrong natures often areand he nourished in his mind an idea bearing on the matter an idea he shrank from disclosing even to jopp  in a lonely hamlet a few miles from the townso lonely that what are called lonely villages were teeming by comparisonthere lived a man of curious repute as a forecaster or weatherprophet the way to his house was crooked and miryeven difficult in the present unpropitious season one evening when it was raining so heavily that ivy and laurel resounded like distant musketry and an outdoor man could be excused for shrouding himself to his ears and eyes such a shrouded figure on foot might have been perceived travelling in the direction of the hazelcopse which dripped over the prophets cot the turnpikeroad became a lane the lane a carttrack the carttrack a bridlepath the bridlepath a footway the footway overgrown the solitary walker slipped here and there and stumbled over the natural springes formed by the brambles till at length he reached the house which with its garden was surrounded with a high dense hedge the cottage comparatively a large one had been built of mud by the occupiers own hands and thatched also by himself here he had always lived and here it was assumed he would die  he existed on unseen supplies for it was an anomalous thing that while there was hardly a soul in the neighbourhood but affected to laugh at this mans assertions uttering the formula theres nothing in em with full assurance on the surface of their faces very few of them were unbelievers in their secret hearts whenever they consulted him they did it for a fancy when they paid him they said just a trifle for christmas or candlemas as the case might be  he would have preferred more honesty in his clients and less sham ridicule but fundamental belief consoled him for superficial irony as stated he was enabled to live people supported him with their backs turned he was sometimes astonished that men could profess so little and believe so much at his house when at church they professed so much and believed so little  behind his back he was called wideoh on account of his reputation to his face mr fall  the hedge of his garden formed an arch over the entrance and a door was inserted as in a wall outside the door the tall traveller stopped bandaged his face with a handkerchief as if he were suffering from toothache and went up the path the window shutters were not closed and he could see the prophet within preparing his supper  in answer to the knock fall came to the door candle in hand the visitor stepped back a little from the light and said can i speak to ee in significant tones the others invitation to come in was responded to by the country formula this will do thank ee after which the householder had no alternative but to come out he placed the candle on the corner of the dresser took his hat from a nail and joined the stranger in the porch shutting the door behind him  ive long heard that you cando things of a sort began the other repressing his individuality as much as he could  maybe so mr henchard said the weathercaster  ahwhy do you call me that asked the visitor with a start  because its your name feeling youd come ive waited for ee and thinking you might be leery from your walk i laid two supper plateslook ye here he threw open the door and disclosed the suppertable at which appeared a second chair knife and fork plate and mug as he had declared  henchard felt like saul at his reception by samuel he remained in silence for a few moments then throwing off the disguise of frigidity which he had hitherto preserved he said then i have not come in vainnow for instance can ye charm away warts  without trouble  cure the evil  that ive donewith considerationif they will wear the toadbag by night as well as by day  forecast the weather  with labour and time  then take this said henchard tis a crownpiece now what is the harvest fortnight to be when can i know  ive worked it out already and you can know at once the fact was that five farmers had already been there on the same errand from different parts of the country by the sun moon and stars by the clouds the winds the trees and grass the candleflame and swallows the smell of the herbs likewise by the cats eyes the ravens the leeches the spiders and the dungmixen the last fortnight in august will berain and tempest  you are not certain of course  as one can be in a world where alls unsure twill be more like living in revelations this autumn than in england shall i sketch it out for ee in a scheme  o no no said henchard i dont altogether believe in forecasts come to second thoughts on such but i  you dontyou donttis quite understood said wideoh without a sound of scorn you have given me a crown because youve one too many but wont you join me at supper now tis waiting and all  henchard would gladly have joined for the savour of the stew had floated from the cottage into the porch with such appetizing distinctness that the meat the onions the pepper and the herbs could be severally recognized by his nose but as sitting down to hobandnob there would have seemed to mark him too implicitly as the weathercasters apostle he declined and went his way  the next saturday henchard bought grain to such an enormous extent that there was quite a talk about his purchases among his neighbours the lawyer the wine merchant and the doctor also on the next and on all available days when his granaries were full to choking all the weathercocks of casterbridge creaked and set their faces in another direction as if tired of the southwest the weather changed the sunlight which had been like tin for weeks assumed the hues of topaz the temperament of the welkin passed from the phlegmatic to the sanguine an excellent harvest was almost a certainty and as a consequence prices rushed down  all these transformations lovely to the outsider to the wrongheaded corndealer were terrible he was reminded of what he had well known before that a man might gamble upon the square green areas of fields as readily as upon those of a cardroom  henchard had backed bad weather and apparently lost he had mistaken the turn of the flood for the turn of the ebb his dealings had been so extensive that settlement could not long be postponed and to settle he was obliged to sell off corn that he had bought only a few weeks before at figures higher by many shillings a quarter much of the corn he had never seen it had not even been moved from the ricks in which it lay stacked miles away thus he lost heavily  in the blaze of an early august day he met farfrae in the marketplace farfrae knew of his dealings though he did not guess their intended bearing on himself and commiserated him for since their exchange of words in the south walk they had been on stiffly speaking terms henchard for the moment appeared to resent the sympathy but he suddenly took a careless turn  ho no nonothing serious man he cried with fierce gaiety these things always happen dont they i know it has been said that figures have touched me tight lately but is that anything rare the case is not so bad as folk make out perhaps and dammy a man must be a fool to mind the common hazards of trade  but he had to enter the casterbridge bank that day for reasons which had never before sent him thereand to sit a long time in the partners room with a constrained bearing it was rumoured soon after that much real property as well as vast stores of produce which had stood in henchards name in the town and neighbourhood was actually the possession of his bankers  coming down the steps of the bank he encountered jopp the gloomy transactions just completed within had added fever to the original sting of farfraes sympathy that morning which henchard fancied might be a satire disguised so that jopp met with anything but a bland reception the latter was in the act of taking off his hat to wipe his forehead and saying a fine hot day to an acquaintance  you can wipe and wipe and say a fine hot day can ye cried henchard in a savage undertone imprisoning jopp between himself and the bank wall if it hadnt been for your blasted advice it might have been a fine day enough why did ye let me go on heywhen a word of doubt from you or anybody would have made me think twice for you can never be sure of weather till tis past  my advice sir was to do what you thought best  a useful fellow and the sooner you help somebody else in that way the better henchard continued his address to jopp in similar terms till it ended in jopps dismissal there and then henchard turning upon his heel and leaving him  you shall be sorry for this sir sorry as a man can be said jopp standing pale and looking after the cornmerchant as he disappeared in the crowd of marketmen hard by     27   it was the eve of harvest prices being low farfrae was buying as was usual after reckoning too surely on famine weather the local farmers had flown to the other extreme and in farfraes opinion were selling off too recklesslycalculating with just a trifle too much certainty upon an abundant yield so he went on buying old corn at its comparatively ridiculous price for the produce of the previous year though not large had been of excellent quality  when henchard had squared his affairs in a disastrous way and got rid of his burdensome purchases at a monstrous loss the harvest began there were three days of excellent weather and thenwhat if that curst conjuror should be right after all said henchard  the fact was that no sooner had the sickles begun to play than the atmosphere suddenly felt as if cress would grow in it without other nourishment it rubbed peoples cheeks like damp flannel when they walked abroad there was a gusty high warm wind isolated raindrops starred the windowpanes at remote distances the sunlight would flap out like a quickly opened fan throw the pattern of the window upon the floor of the room in a milky colourless shine and withdraw as suddenly as it had appeared  from that day and hour it was clear that there was not to be so successful an ingathering after all if henchard had only waited long enough he might at least have avoided loss though he had not made a profit but the momentum of his character knew no patience at this turn of the scales he remained silent the movements of his mind seemed to tend to the thought that some power was working against him  i wonder he asked himself with eerie misgiving i wonder if it can be that somebody has been roasting a waxen image of me or stirring an unholy brew to confound me i dont believe in such power and yetwhat if they should ha been doing it even he could not admit that the perpetrator if any might be farfrae these isolated hours of superstition came to henchard in time of moody depression when all his practical largeness of view had oozed out of him  meanwhile donald farfrae prospered he had purchased in so depressed a market that the present moderate stiffness of prices was sufficient to pile for him a large heap of gold where a little one had been  why hell soon be mayor said henchard it was indeed hard that the speaker should of all others have to follow the triumphal chariot of this man to the capitol  the rivalry of the masters was taken up by the men  septembernight shades had fallen upon casterbridge the clocks had struck halfpast eight and the moon had risen the streets of the town were curiously silent for such a comparatively early hour a sound of jangling horsebells and heavy wheels passed up the street these were followed by angry voices outside lucettas house which led her and elizabethjane to run to the windows and pull up the blinds  the neighbouring market house and town hall abutted against its next neighbour the church except in the lower storey where an arched thoroughfare gave admittance to a large square called bull stake a stone post rose in the midst to which the oxen had formerly been tied for baiting with dogs to make them tender before they were killed in the adjoining shambles in a corner stood the stocks  the thoroughfare leading to this spot was now blocked by two fourhorse waggons and horses one laden with haytrusses the leaders having already passed each other and become entangled head to tail the passage of the vehicles might have been practicable if empty but built up with hay to the bedroom windows as one was it was impossible  you must have done it a purpose said farfraes waggoner you can hear my horses bells halfamile such a night as this  if yed been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such a gawkhammer way you would have zeed me retorted the wroth representative of henchard  however according to the strict rule of the road it appeared that henchards man was most in the wrong he therefore attempted to back into the high street in doing this the near hindwheel rose against the churchyard wall and the whole mountainous load went over two of the four wheels rising in the air and the legs of the thill horse  instead of considering how to gather up the load the two men closed in a fight with their fists before the first round was quite over henchard came upon the spot somebody having run for him  henchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by collaring one with each hand turned to the horse that was down and extricated him after some trouble he then inquired into the circumstances and seeing the state of his waggon and its load began hotly rating farfraes man  lucetta and elizabethjane had by this time run down to the street corner whence they watched the bright heap of new hay lying in the moons rays and passed and repassed by the forms of henchard and the waggoners the women had witnessed what nobody else had seenthe origin of the mishap and lucetta spoke  i saw it all mr henchard she cried and your man was most in the wrong  henchard paused in his harangue and turned oh i didnt notice you miss templeman said he my man in the wrong ah to be sure to be sure but i beg your pardon notwithstanding the others is the empty waggon and he must have been most to blame for coming on  no i saw it too said elizabethjane and i can assure you he couldnt help it  you cant trust their senses murmured henchards man  why not asked henchard sharply  why you see sir all the women side with farfraebeing a damn young dandof the sort that he isone that creeps into a maids heart like the giddying worm into a sheeps brainmaking crooked seem straight to their eyes  but do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion do you know that i pay my attentions to her and have for some time just be careful  not i i know nothing sir outside eight shillings a week  and that mr farfrae is well aware of it hes sharp in trade but he wouldnt do anything so underhand as what you hint at  whether because lucetta heard this low dialogue or not her white figure disappeared from her doorway inward and the door was shut before henchard could reach it to converse with her further this disappointed him for he had been sufficiently disturbed by what the man had said to wish to speak to her more closely while pausing the old constable came up  just see that nobody drives against that hay and waggon tonight stubberd said the cornmerchant it must bide till the morning for all hands are in the field still and if any coach or roadwaggon wants to come along tell em they must go round by the back street and be hanged to emany case tomorrow up in hall  yes sir one in number sir  oh whats that  an old flagrant female sir swearing and committing a nuisance in a horrible profane manner against the church wall sir as if twere no more than a pothouse thats all sir  oh the mayors out o town isnt he  he is sir  very well then ill be there dont forget to keep an eye on that hay good night t ee  during those moments henchard had determined to follow up lucetta notwithstanding her elusiveness and he knocked for admission  the answer he received was an expression of miss templemans sorrow at being unable to see him again that evening because she had an engagement to go out  henchard walked away from the door to the opposite side of the street and stood by his hay in a lonely reverie the constable having strolled elsewhere and the horses being removed though the moon was not bright as yet there were no lamps lighted and he entered the shadow of one of the projecting jambs which formed the thoroughfare to bull stake here he watched lucettas door  candlelights were flitting in and out of her bedroom and it was obvious that she was dressing for the appointment whatever the nature of that might be at such an hour the lights disappeared the clock struck nine and almost at the moment farfrae came round the opposite corner and knocked that she had been waiting just inside for him was certain for she instantly opened the door herself they went together by the way of a back lane westward avoiding the front street guessing where they were going he determined to follow  the harvest had been so delayed by the capricious weather that whenever a fine day occurred all sinews were strained to save what could be saved of the damaged crops on account of the rapid shortening of the days the harvesters worked by moonlight hence tonight the wheatfields abutting on the two sides of the square formed by casterbridge town were animated by the gathering hands their shouts and laughter had reached henchard at the market house while he stood there waiting and he had little doubt from the turn which farfrae and lucetta had taken that they were bound for the spot  nearly the whole town had gone into the fields the casterbridge populace still retained the primitive habit of helping one another in time of need and thus though the corn belonged to the farming section of the little communitythat inhabiting the durnover quarterthe remainder was no less interested in the labour of getting it home  reaching the top of the lane henchard crossed the shaded avenue on the walls slid down the green rampart and stood amongst the stubble the stitches or shocks rose like tents about the yellow expanse those in the distance becoming lost in the moonlit hazes  he had entered at a point removed from the scene of immediate operations but two others had entered at that place and he could see them winding among the shocks they were paying no regard to the direction of their walk whose vague serpentining soon began to bear down towards henchard a meeting promised to be awkward and he therefore stepped into the hollow of the nearest shock and sat down  you have my leave lucetta was saying gaily speak what you like  well then replied farfrae with the unmistakable inflection of the lover pure which henchard had never heard in full resonance of his lips before you are sure to be much sought after for your position wealth talents and beauty but will ye resist the temptation to be one of those ladies with lots of admirersayand be content to have only a homely one  and he the speaker said she laughing very well sir what next  ah im afraid that what i feel will make me forget my manners  then i hope youll never have any if you lack them only for that cause after some broken words which henchard lost she added are you sure you wont be jealous  farfrae seemed to assure her that he would not by taking her hand  you are convinced donald that i love nobody else she presently said but i should wish to have my own way in some things  in everything what special thing did you mean  if i wished not to live always in casterbridge for instance upon finding that i should not be happy here  henchard did not hear the reply he might have done so and much more but he did not care to play the eavesdropper they went on towards the scene of activity where the sheaves were being handed a dozen a minute upon the carts and waggons which carried them away  lucetta insisted on parting from farfrae when they drew near the workpeople he had some business with them and though he entreated her to wait a few minutes she was inexorable and tripped off homeward alone  henchard thereupon left the field and followed her his state of mind was such that on reaching lucettas door he did not knock but opened it and walked straight up to her sittingroom expecting to find her there but the room was empty and he perceived that in his haste he had somehow passed her on the way hither he had not to wait many minutes however for he soon heard her dress rustling in the hall followed by a soft closing of the door in a moment she appeared  the light was so low that she did not notice henchard at first as soon as she saw him she uttered a little cry almost of terror  how can you frighten me so she exclaimed with a flushed face it is past ten oclock and you have no right to surprise me here at such a time  i dont know that ive not the right at any rate i have the excuse is it so necessary that i should stop to think of manners and customs  it is too late for propriety and might injure me  i called an hour ago and you would not see me and i thought you were in when i called now it is you lucetta who are doing wrong it is not proper in ee to throw me over like this i have a little matter to remind you of which you seem to forget  she sank into a chair and turned pale  i dont want to hear iti dont want to hear it she said through her hands as he standing close to the edge of her gown began to allude to the jersey days  but you ought to hear it said he  it came to nothing and through you then why not leave me the freedom that i gained with such sorrow had i found that you proposed to marry me for pure love i might have felt bound now but i soon learnt that you had planned it out of mere charityalmost as an unpleasant dutybecause i had nursed you and compromised myself and you thought you must repay me after that i did not care for you so deeply as before  why did you come here to find me then  i thought i ought to marry you for conscience sake since you were free even though idid not like you so well  and why then dont you think so now  she was silent it was only too obvious that conscience had ruled well enough till new love had intervened and usurped that rule in feeling this she herself forgot for the moment her partially justifying argumentthat having discovered henchards infirmities of temper she had some excuse for not risking her happiness in his hands after once escaping them the only thing she could say was i was a poor girl then and now my circumstances have altered so i am hardly the same person  thats true and it makes the case awkward for me but i dont want to touch your money i am quite willing that every penny of your property shall remain to your personal use besides that argument has nothing in it the man you are thinking of is no better than i  if you were as good as he you would leave me she cried passionately  this unluckily aroused henchard you cannot in honour refuse me he said and unless you give me your promise this very night to be my wife before a witness ill reveal our intimacyin common fairness to other men  a look of resignation settled upon her henchard saw its bitterness and had lucettas heart been given to any other man in the world than farfrae he would probably have had pity upon her at that moment but the supplanter was the upstart as henchard called him who had mounted into prominence upon his shoulders and he could bring himself to show no mercy  without another word she rang the bell and directed that elizabethjane should be fetched from her room the latter appeared surprised in the midst of her lucubrations as soon as she saw henchard she went across to him dutifully  elizabethjane he said taking her hand i want you to hear this and turning to lucetta will you or will you not marry me  if youwish it i must agree  you say yes  i do  no sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state  what dreadful thing drives her to say this father when it is such a pain to her asked elizabeth kneeling down by lucetta dont compel her to do anything against her will i have lived with her and know that she cannot bear much  dont be a nothern simpleton said henchard drily this promise will leave him free for you if you want him wont it  at this lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start  him who are you talking about she said wildly  nobody as far as i am concerned said elizabeth firmly  ohwell then it is my mistake said henchard but the business is between me and miss templeman she agrees to be my wife  but dont dwell on it just now entreated elizabeth holding lucettas hand  i dont wish to if she promises said henchard  i have i have groaned lucetta her limbs hanging like fluid from very misery and faintness michael please dont argue it any more  i will not he said and taking up his hat he went away  elizabethjane continued to kneel by lucetta what is this she said you called my father michael as if you knew him well and how is it he has got this power over you that you promise to marry him against your will ahyou have many many secrets from me  perhaps you have some from me lucetta murmured with closed eyes little thinking however so unsuspicious was she that the secret of elizabeths heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own  i would notdo anything against you at all stammered elizabeth keeping in all signs of emotion till she was ready to burst i cannot understand how my father can command you so i dont sympathize with him in it at all ill go to him and ask him to release you  no no said lucetta let it all be     28   the next morning henchard went to the town hall below lucettas house to attend petty sessions being still a magistrate for the year by virtue of his late position as mayor in passing he looked up at her windows but nothing of her was to be seen  henchard as a justice of the peace may at first seem to be an even greater incongruity than shallow and silence themselves but his rough and ready perceptions his sledgehammer directness had often served him better than nice legal knowledge in despatching such simple business as fell to his hands in this court today dr chalkfield the mayor for the year being absent the cornmerchant took the big chair his eyes still abstractedly stretching out of the window to the ashlar front of highplace hall  there was one case only and the offender stood before him she was an old woman of mottled countenance attired in a shawl of that nameless tertiary hue which comes but cannot be madea hue neither tawny russet hazel nor ash a sticky black bonnet that seemed to have been worn in the country of the psalmist where the clouds drop fatness and an apron that had been white in time so comparatively recent as still to contrast visibly with the rest of her clothes the steeped aspect of the woman as a whole showed her to be no native of the countryside or even of a countrytown  she looked cursorily at henchard and the second magistrate and henchard looked at her with a momentary pause as if she had reminded him indistinctly of somebody or something which passed from his mind as quickly as it had come well and what has she been doing he said looking down at the charge sheet  she is charged sir with the offence of disorderly female and nuisance whispered stubberd  where did she do that said the other magistrate  by the church sir of all the horrible places in the worldi caught her in the act your worship  stand back then said henchard and lets hear what youve got to say  stubberd was sworn in the magistrates clerk dipped his pen henchard being no notetaker himself and the constable began  hearing a illegal noise i went down the street at twentyfive minutes past eleven pm on the night of the fifth instinct hannah dominy when i had  dont go so fast stubberd said the clerk  the constable waited with his eyes on the clerks pen till the latter stopped scratching and said yes stubberd continued when i had proceeded to the spot i saw defendant at another spot namely the gutter he paused watching the point of the clerks pen again  gutter yes stubberd  spot measuring twelve feet nine inches or thereabouts from where i still careful not to outrun the clerks penmanship stubberd pulled up again for having got his evidence by heart it was immaterial to him whereabouts he broke off  i object to that spoke up the old woman spot measuring twelve feet nine or thereabouts from where i is not sound testimony  the magistrates consulted and the second one said that the bench was of opinion that twelve feet nine inches from a man on his oath was admissible  stubberd with a suppressed gaze of victorious rectitude at the old woman continued was standing myself she was wambling about quite dangerous to the thoroughfare and when i approached to draw near she committed the nuisance and insulted me  insulted meyes what did she say  she said put away that dee lantern she says  yes  says she dost hear old turmithead put away that dee lantern i have floored fellows a dee sight finerlooking than a dee fool like thee you son of a bee dee me if i haint she says  i object to that conversation interposed the old woman i was not capable enough to hear what i said and what is said out of my hearing is not evidence  there was another stoppage for consultation a book was referred to and finally stubberd was allowed to go on again the truth was that the old woman had appeared in court so many more times than the magistrates themselves that they were obliged to keep a sharp lookout upon their procedure however when stubberd had rambled on a little further henchard broke out impatiently comewe dont want to hear any more of them cust dees and bees say the words out like a man and dont be so modest stubberd or else leave it alone turning to the woman now then have you any questions to ask him or anything to say  yes she replied with a twinkle in her eye and the clerk dipped his pen  twenty years ago or thereabout i was selling of furmity in a tent at weydon fair  twenty years agowell thats beginning at the beginning suppose you go back to the creation said the clerk not without satire  but henchard stared and quite forgot what was evidence and what was not  a man and a woman with a little child came into my tent the woman continued they sat down and had a basin apiece ah lords my life i was of a more respectable station in the world then than i am now being a land smuggler in a large way of business and i used to season my furmity with rum for them who asked fort i did it for the man and then he had more and more till at last he quarrelled with his wife and offered to sell her to the highest bidder a sailor came in and bid five guineas and paid the money and led her away and the man who sold his wife in that fashion is the man sitting there in the great big chair the speaker concluded by nodding her head at henchard and folding her arms  everybody looked at henchard his face seemed strange and in tint as if it had been powdered over with ashes we dont want to hear your life and adventures said the second magistrate sharply filling the pause which followed youve been asked if youve anything to say bearing on the case  that bears on the case it proves that hes no better than i and has no right to sit there in judgment upon me  tis a concocted story said the clerk so hold your tongue  notis true the words came from henchard tis as true as the light he said slowly and upon my soul it does prove that im no better than she and to keep out of any temptation to treat her hard for her revenge ill leave her to you  the sensation in the court was indescribably great henchard left the chair and came out passing through a group of people on the steps and outside that was much larger than usual for it seemed that the old furmity dealer had mysteriously hinted to the denizens of the lane in which she had been lodging since her arrival that she knew a queer thing or two about their great local man mr henchard if she chose to tell it this had brought them hither  why are there so many idlers round the town hall today said lucetta to her servant when the case was over she had risen late and had just looked out of the window  oh please maam tis this larry about mr henchard a woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair  in all the accounts which henchard had given her of the separation from his wife susan for so many years of his belief in her death and so on he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that separation the story she now heard for the first time  a gradual misery overspread lucettas face as she dwelt upon the promise wrung from her the night before at bottom then henchard was this how terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself to his care  during the day she went out to the ring and to other places not coming in till nearly dusk as soon as she saw elizabethjane after her return indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the seaside for a few daysto portbredy casterbridge was so gloomy  elizabeth seeing that she looked wan and disturbed encouraged her in the idea thinking a change would afford her relief she could not help suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over casterbridge in lucettas eyes might be partially owing to the fact that farfrae was away from home  elizabeth saw her friend depart for portbredy and took charge of highplace hall till her return after two or three days of solitude and incessant rain henchard called at the house he seemed disappointed to hear of lucettas absence and though he nodded with outward indifference he went away handling his beard with a nettled mien  the next day he called again is she come now he asked  yes she returned this morning replied his stepdaughter but she is not indoors she has gone for a walk along the turnpikeroad to portbredy she will be home by dusk  after a few words which only served to reveal his restless impatience he left the house again     29   at this hour lucetta was bounding along the road to portbredy just as elizabeth had announced that she had chosen for her afternoon walk the road along which she had returned to casterbridge three hours earlier in a carriage was curiousif anything should be called curious in concatenations of phenomena wherein each is known to have its accounting cause it was the day of the chief marketsaturdayand farfrae for once had been missed from his cornstand in the dealers room nevertheless it was known that he would be home that nightfor sunday as casterbridge expressed it  lucetta in continuing her walk had at length reached the end of the ranked trees which bordered the highway in this and other directions out of the town this end marked a mile and here she stopped  the spot was a vale between two gentle acclivities and the road still adhering to its roman foundation stretched onward straight as a surveyors line till lost to sight on the most distant ridge there was neither hedge nor tree in the prospect now the road clinging to the stubby expanse of cornland like a strip to an undulating garment near her was a barnthe single building of any kind within her horizon  she strained her eyes up the lessening road but nothing appeared thereonnot so much as a speck she sighed one worddonald and turned her face to the town for retreat  here the case was different a single figure was approaching herelizabethjanes  lucetta in spite of her loneliness seemed a little vexed elizabeths face as soon as she recognized her friend shaped itself into affectionate lines while yet beyond speaking distance i suddenly thought i would come and meet you she said smiling  lucettas reply was taken from her lips by an unexpected diversion a byroad on her right hand descended from the fields into the highway at the point where she stood and down the track a bull was rambling uncertainly towards her and elizabeth who facing the other way did not observe him  in the latter quarter of each year cattle were at once the mainstay and the terror of families about casterbridge and its neighbourhood where breeding was carried on with abrahamic success the head of stock driven into and out of the town at this season to be sold by the local auctioneer was very large and all these horned beasts in travelling to and fro sent women and children to shelter as nothing else could do in the main the animals would have walked along quietly enough but the casterbridge tradition was that to drive stock it was indispensable that hideous cries coupled with yahoo antics and gestures should be used large sticks flourished stray dogs called in and in general everything done that was likely to infuriate the viciously disposed and terrify the mild nothing was commoner than for a householder on going out of his parlour to find his hall or passage full of little children nursemaids aged women or a ladies school who apologized for their presence by saying a bull passing down street from the sale  lucetta and elizabeth regarded the animal in doubt he meanwhile drawing vaguely towards them it was a large specimen of the breed in colour rich dun though disfigured at present by splotches of mud about his seamy sides his horns were thick and tipped with brass his two nostrils like the thames tunnel as seen in the perspective toys of yore between them through the gristle of his nose was a stout copper ring welded on and irremovable as gurths collar of brass to the ring was attached an ash staff about a yard long which the bull with the motions of his head flung about like a flail  it was not till they observed this dangling stick that the young women were really alarmed for it revealed to them that the bull was an old one too savage to be driven which had in some way escaped the staff being the means by which the drover controlled him and kept his horns at arms length  they looked round for some shelter or hidingplace and thought of the barn hard by as long as they had kept their eyes on the bull he had shown some deference in his manner of approach but no sooner did they turn their backs to seek the barn than he tossed his head and decided to thoroughly terrify them this caused the two helpless girls to run wildly whereupon the bull advanced in a deliberate charge  the barn stood behind a green slimy pond and it was closed save as to one of the usual pair of doors facing them which had been propped open by a hurdlestick and for this opening they made the interior had been cleared by a recent bout of threshing except at one end where there was a stack of dry clover elizabethjane took in the situation we must climb up there she said  but before they had even approached it they heard the bull scampering through the pond without and in a second he dashed into the barn knocking down the hurdlestake in passing the heavy door slammed behind him and all three were imprisoned in the barn together the mistaken creature saw them and stalked towards the end of the barn into which they had fled the girls doubled so adroitly that their pursuer was against the wall when the fugitives were already half way to the other end by the time that his length would allow him to turn and follow them thither they had crossed over thus the pursuit went on the hot air from his nostrils blowing over them like a sirocco and not a moment being attainable by elizabeth or lucetta in which to open the door what might have happened had their situation continued cannot be said but in a few moments a rattling of the door distracted their adversarys attention and a man appeared he ran forward towards the leadingstaff seized it and wrenched the animals head as if he would snap it off the wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck seemed to have lost its stiffness and to become halfparalyzed whilst the nose dropped blood the premeditated human contrivance of the nosering was too cunning for impulsive brute force and the creature flinched  the man was seen in the partial gloom to be largeframed and unhesitating he led the bull to the door and the light revealed henchard he made the bull fast without and reentered to the succour of lucetta for he had not perceived elizabeth who had climbed on to the cloverheap lucetta was hysterical and henchard took her in his arms and carried her to the door  youhave saved me she cried as soon as she could speak  i have returned your kindness he responded tenderly you once saved me  howcomes it to be youyou she asked not heeding his reply  i came out here to look for you i have been wanting to tell you something these two or three days but you have been away and i could not perhaps you cannot talk now  ohno where is elizabeth  here am i cried the missing one cheerfully and without waiting for the ladder to be placed she slid down the face of the cloverstack to the floor  henchard supporting lucetta on one side and elizabethjane on the other they went slowly along the rising road they had reached the top and were descending again when lucetta now much recovered recollected that she had dropped her muff in the barn  ill run back said elizabethjane i dont mind it at all as i am not tired as you are she thereupon hastened down again to the barn the others pursuing their way  elizabeth soon found the muff such an article being by no means small at that time coming out she paused to look for a moment at the bull now rather to be pitied with his bleeding nose having perhaps rather intended a practical joke than a murder henchard had secured him by jamming the staff into the hinge of the barndoor and wedging it there with a stake at length she turned to hasten onward after her contemplation when she saw a greenandblack gig approaching from the contrary direction the vehicle being driven by farfrae  his presence here seemed to explain lucettas walk that way donald saw her drew up and was hastily made acquainted with what had occurred at elizabethjane mentioning how greatly lucetta had been jeopardized he exhibited an agitation different in kind no less than in intensity from any she had seen in him before he became so absorbed in the circumstance that he scarcely had sufficient knowledge of what he was doing to think of helping her up beside him  she has gone on with mr henchard you say he inquired at last  yes he is taking her home they are almost there by this time  and you are sure she can get home  elizabethjane was quite sure  your stepfather saved her  entirely  farfrae checked his horses pace she guessed why he was thinking that it would be best not to intrude on the other two just now henchard had saved lucetta and to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper affection for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise  the immediate subject of their talk being exhausted she felt more embarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover but soon the two figures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town the face of the woman was frequently turned back but farfrae did not whip on the horse when these reached the town walls henchard and his companion had disappeared down the street farfrae set down elizabethjane on her expressing a particular wish to alight there and drove round to the stables at the back of his lodgings  on this account he entered the house through his garden and going up to his apartments found them in a particularly disturbed state his boxes being hauled out upon the landing and his bookcase standing in three pieces these phenomena however seemed to cause him not the least surprise when will everything be sent up he said to the mistress of the house who was superintending  i am afraid not before eight sir said she you see we wasnt aware till this morning that you were going to move or we could have been forwarder  awell never mind never mind said farfrae cheerily eight oclock will do well enough if it be not later now dont ye be standing here talking or it will be twelve i doubt thus speaking he went out by the front door and up the street  during this interval henchard and lucetta had had experiences of a different kind after elizabeths departure for the muff the cornmerchant opened himself frankly holding her hand within his arm though she would fain have withdrawn it dear lucetta i have been very very anxious to see you these two or three days he said ever since i saw you last i have thought over the way i got your promise that night you said to me if i were a man i should not insist that cut me deep i felt that there was some truth in it i dont want to make you wretched and to marry me just now would do that as nothing else couldit is but too plain therefore i agree to an indefinite engagementto put off all thought of marriage for a year or two  butbutcan i do nothing of a different kind said lucetta i am full of gratitude to youyou have saved my life and your care of me is like coals of fire on my head i am a monied person now surely i can do something in return for your goodnesssomething practical  henchard remained in thought he had evidently not expected this there is one thing you might do lucetta he said but not exactly of that kind  then of what kind is it she asked with renewed misgiving  i must tell you a secret to ask ityou may have heard that i have been unlucky this year i did what i have never done beforespeculated rashly and i lost thats just put me in a strait  and you would wish me to advance some money  no no said henchard almost in anger im not the man to sponge on a woman even though she may be so nearly my own as you no lucetta what you can do is this and it would save me my great creditor is grower and it is at his hands i shall suffer if at anybodys while a fortnights forbearance on his part would be enough to allow me to pull through this may be got out of him in one waythat you would let it be known to him that you are my intendedthat we are to be quietly married in the next fortnightnow stop you havent heard all let him have this story without of course any prejudice to the fact that the actual engagement between us is to be a long one nobody else need know you could go with me to mr grower and just let me speak to ee before him as if we were on such terms well ask him to keep it secret he will willingly wait then at the fortnights end i shall be able to face him and i can coolly tell him all is postponed between us for a year or two not a soul in the town need know how youve helped me since you wish to be of use theres your way  it being now what the people called the pinking in of the day that is the quarterhour just before dusk he did not at first observe the result of his own words upon her  if it were anything else she began and the dryness of her lips was represented in her voice  but it is such a little thing he said with a deep reproach less than you have offeredjust the beginning of what you have so lately promised i could have told him as much myself but he would not have believed me  it is not because i wontit is because i absolutely cant she said with rising distress  you are provoking he burst out it is enough to make me force you to carry out at once what you have promised  i cannot she insisted desperately  why when i have only within these few minutes released you from your promise to do the thing offhand  becausehe was a witness  witness of what  if i must tell you dont dont upbraid me  well lets hear what you mean  witness of my marriagemr grower was  marriage  yes with mr farfrae o michael i am already his wife we were married this week at portbredy there were reasons against our doing it here mr grower was a witness because he happened to be at portbredy at the time  henchard stood as if idiotized she was so alarmed at his silence that she murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over the perilous fortnight  married him said henchard at length my goodwhat married him whilstbound to marry me  it was like this she explained with tears in her eyes and quavers in her voice dontdont be cruel i loved him so much and i thought you might tell him of the pastand that grieved me and then when i had promised you i learnt of the rumour that you hadsold your first wife at a fair like a horse or cow how could i keep my promise after hearing that i could not risk myself in your hands it would have been letting myself down to take your name after such a scandal but i knew i should lose donald if i did not secure him at oncefor you would carry out your threat of telling him of our former acquaintance as long as there was a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so but you will not do so now will you michael for it is too late to separate us  the notes of st peters bells in full peal had been wafted to them while he spoke and now the genial thumping of the town band renowned for its unstinted use of the drumstick throbbed down the street  then this racket they are making is on account of it i suppose said he  yesi think he has told them or else mr grower hasmay i leave you now myhe was detained at portbredy today and sent me on a few hours before him  then it is his wifes life i have saved this afternoon  yesand he will be for ever grateful to you  i am much obliged to himo you false woman burst from henchard you promised me  yes yes but it was under compulsion and i did not know all your past  and now ive a mind to punish you as you deserve one word to this brannew husband of how you courted me and your precious happiness is blown to atoms  michaelpity me and be generous  you dont deserve pity you did but you dont now  ill help you to pay off your debt  a pensioner of farfraes wifenot i dont stay with me longeri shall say something worse go home  she disappeared under the trees of the south walk as the band came round the corner awaking the echoes of every stock and stone in celebration of her happiness lucetta took no heed but ran up the back street and reached her own home unperceived     30   farfraes words to his landlady had referred to the removal of his boxes and other effects from his late lodgings to lucettas house the work was not heavy but it had been much hindered on account of the frequent pauses necessitated by exclamations of surprise at the event of which the good woman had been briefly informed by letter a few hours earlier  at the last moment of leaving portbredy farfrae like john gilpin had been detained by important customers whom even in the exceptional circumstances he was not the man to neglect moreover there was a convenience in lucetta arriving first at her house nobody there as yet knew what had happened and she was best in a position to break the news to the inmates and give directions for her husbands accommodation he had therefore sent on his twodays bride in a hired brougham whilst he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks a few miles off telling her the hour at which he might be expected the same evening this accounted for her trotting out to meet him after their separation of four hours  by a strenuous effort after leaving henchard she calmed herself in readiness to receive donald at highplace hall when he came on from his lodgings one supreme fact empowered her to this the sense that come what would she had secured him halfanhour after her arrival he walked in and she met him with a relieved gladness which a months perilous absence could not have intensified  there is one thing i have not done and yet it is important she said earnestly when she had finished talking about the adventure with the bull that is broken the news of our marriage to my dear elizabethjane  ah and you have not he said thoughtfully i gave her a lift from the barn homewards but i did not tell her either for i thought she might have heard of it in the town and was keeping back her congratulations from shyness and all that  she can hardly have heard of it but ill find out ill go to her now and donald you dont mind her living on with me just the same as before she is so quiet and unassuming  o no indeed i dont farfrae answered with perhaps a faint awkwardness but i wonder if she would care to  o yes said lucetta eagerly i am sure she would like to besides poor thing she has no other home  farfrae looked at her and saw that she did not suspect the secret of her more reserved friend he liked her all the better for the blindness arrange as you like with her by all means he said it is i who have come to your house not you to mine  ill run and speak to her said lucetta  when she got upstairs to elizabethjanes room the latter had taken off her outdoor things and was resting over a book lucetta found in a moment that she had not yet learnt the news  i did not come down to you miss templeman she said simply i was coming to ask if you had quite recovered from your fright but i found you had a visitor what are the bells ringing for i wonder and the band too is playing somebody must be married or else they are practising for christmas  lucetta uttered a vague yes and seating herself by the other young woman looked musingly at her what a lonely creature you are she presently said never knowing whats going on or what people are talking about everywhere with keen interest you should get out and gossip about as other women do and then you wouldnt be obliged to ask me a question of that kind well now i have something to tell you  elizabethjane said she was so glad and made herself receptive  i must go rather a long way back said lucetta the difficulty of explaining herself satisfactorily to the pondering one beside her growing more apparent at each syllable you remember that trying case of conscience i told you of some time agoabout the first lover and the second lover she let out in jerky phrases a leading word or two of the story she had told  o yesi remember the story of your friend said elizabeth drily regarding the irises of lucettas eyes as though to catch their exact shade the two loversthe old one and the new how she wanted to marry the second but felt she ought to marry the first so that she neglected the better course to follow the evil like the poet ovid ive just been construing video meliora proboque deteriora sequor  o no she didnt follow evil exactly said lucetta hastily  but you said that sheor as i may say youanswered elizabeth dropping the mask were in honour and conscience bound to marry the first  lucettas blush at being seen through came and went again before she replied anxiously you will never breathe this will you elizabethjane  certainly not if you say not  then i will tell you that the case is more complicatedworse in factthan it seemed in my story i and the first man were thrown together in a strange way and felt that we ought to be united as the world had talked of us he was a widower as he supposed he had not heard of his first wife for many years but the wife returned and we parted she is now dead and the husband comes paying me addresses again saying now well complete our purposes but elizabethjane all this amounts to a new courtship of me by him i was absolved from all vows by the return of the other woman  have you not lately renewed your promise said the younger with quiet surmise she had divined man number one  that was wrung from me by a threat  yes it was but i think when any one gets coupled up with a man in the past so unfortunately as you have done she ought to become his wife if she can even if she were not the sinning party  lucettas countenance lost its sparkle he turned out to be a man i should be afraid to marry she pleaded really afraid and it was not till after my renewed promise that i knew it  then there is only one course left to honesty you must remain a single woman  but think again do consider  i am certain interrupted her companion hardily i have guessed very well who the man is my father and i say it is him or nobody for you  any suspicion of impropriety was to elizabethjane like a red rag to a bull her craving for correctness of procedure was indeed almost vicious owing to her early troubles with regard to her mother a semblance of irregularity had terrors for her which those whose names are safeguarded from suspicion know nothing of you ought to marry mr henchard or nobodycertainly not another man she went on with a quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared  i dont admit that said lucetta passionately  admit it or not it is true  lucetta covered her eyes with her right hand as if she could plead no more holding out her left to elizabethjane  why you have married him cried the latter jumping up with pleasure after a glance at lucettas fingers when did you do it why did you not tell me instead of teasing me like this how very honourable of you he did treat my mother badly once it seems in a moment of intoxication and it is true that he is stern sometimes but you will rule him entirely i am sure with your beauty and wealth and accomplishments you are the woman he will adore and we shall all three be happy together now  o my elizabethjane cried lucetta distressfully tis somebody else that i have married i was so desperateso afraid of being forced to anything elseso afraid of revelations that would quench his love for me that i resolved to do it offhand come what might and purchase a week of happiness at any cost  youhavemarried mr farfrae cried elizabethjane in nathan tones  lucetta bowed she had recovered herself  the bells are ringing on that account she said my husband is downstairs he will live here till a more suitable house is ready for us and i have told him that i want you to stay with me just as before  let me think of it alone the girl quickly replied corking up the turmoil of her feeling with grand control  you shall i am sure we shall be happy together  lucetta departed to join donald below a vague uneasiness floating over her joy at seeing him quite at home there not on account of her friend elizabeth did she feel it for of the bearings of elizabethjanes emotions she had not the least suspicion but on henchards alone  now the instant decision of susan henchards daughter was to dwell in that house no more apart from her estimate of the propriety of lucettas conduct farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover that she felt she could not abide there  it was still early in the evening when she hastily put on her things and went out in a few minutes knowing the ground she had found a suitable lodging and arranged to enter it that night returning and entering noiselessly she took off her pretty dress and arrayed herself in a plain one packing up the other to keep as her best for she would have to be very economical now she wrote a note to leave for lucetta who was closely shut up in the drawingroom with farfrae and then elizabethjane called a man with a wheelbarrow and seeing her boxes put into it she trotted off down the street to her rooms they were in the street in which henchard lived and almost opposite his door  here she sat down and considered the means of subsistence the little annual sum settled on her by her stepfather would keep body and soul together a wonderful skill in netting of all sortsacquired in childhood by making seines in newsons homemight serve her in good stead and her studies which were pursued unremittingly might serve her in still better  by this time the marriage that had taken place was known throughout casterbridge had been discussed noisily on kerbstones confidentially behind counters and jovially at the three mariners whether farfrae would sell his business and set up for a gentleman on his wifes money or whether he would show independence enough to stick to his trade in spite of his brilliant alliance was a great point of interest     31   the retort of the furmitywoman before the magistrates had spread and in fourandtwenty hours there was not a person in casterbridge who remained unacquainted with the story of henchards mad freak at weydonpriors fair long years before the amends he had made in after life were lost sight of in the dramatic glare of the original act had the incident been well known of old and always it might by this time have grown to be lightly regarded as the rather tall wild oat but wellnigh the single one of a young man with whom the steady and mature if somewhat headstrong burgher of today had scarcely a point in common but the act having lain as dead and buried ever since the interspace of years was unperceived and the black spot of his youth wore the aspect of a recent crime  small as the policecourt incident had been in itself it formed the edge or turn in the incline of henchards fortunes on that dayalmost at that minutehe passed the ridge of prosperity and honour and began to descend rapidly on the other side it was strange how soon he sank in esteem socially he had received a startling fillip downwards and having already lost commercial buoyancy from rash transactions the velocity of his descent in both aspects became accelerated every hour  he now gazed more at the pavements and less at the housefronts when he walked about more at the feet and leggings of men and less into the pupils of their eyes with the blazing regard which formerly had made them blink  new events combined to undo him it had been a bad year for others besides himself and the heavy failure of a debtor whom he had trusted generously completed the overthrow of his tottering credit and now in his desperation he failed to preserve that strict correspondence between bulk and sample which is the soul of commerce in grain for this one of his men was mainly to blame that worthy in his great unwisdom having picked over the sample of an enormous quantity of secondrate corn which henchard had in hand and removed the pinched blasted and smutted grains in great numbers the produce if honestly offered would have created no scandal but the blunder of misrepresentation coming at such a moment dragged henchards name into the ditch  the details of his failure were of the ordinary kind one day elizabethjane was passing the kings arms when she saw people bustling in and out more than usual where there was no market a bystander informed her with some surprise at her ignorance that it was a meeting of the commissioners under mr henchards bankruptcy she felt quite tearful and when she heard that he was present in the hotel she wished to go in and see him but was advised not to intrude that day  the room in which debtor and creditors had assembled was a front one and henchard looking out of the window had caught sight of elizabethjane through the wire blind his examination had closed and the creditors were leaving the appearance of elizabeth threw him into a reverie till turning his face from the window and towering above all the rest he called their attention for a moment more his countenance had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity the black hair and whiskers were the same as ever but a film of ash was over the rest  gentlemen he said over and above the assets that weve been talking about and that appear on the balancesheet there be these it all belongs to ye as much as everything else ive got and i dont wish to keep it from you not i saying this he took his gold watch from his pocket and laid it on the table then his pursethe yellow canvas moneybag such as was carried by all farmers and dealersuntying it and shaking the money out upon the table beside the watch the latter he drew back quickly for an instant to remove the hairguard made and given him by lucetta there now you have all ive got in the world he said and i wish for your sakes twas more  the creditors farmers almost to a man looked at the watch and at the money and into the street when farmer james everdene of weatherbury spoke  no no henchard he said warmly we dont want that tis honourable in ye but keep it what do you say neighboursdo ye agree  ay sure we dont wish it at all said grower another creditor  let him keep it of course murmured another in the backgrounda silent reserved young man named boldwood and the rest responded unanimously  well said the senior commissioner addressing henchard though the case is a desperate one i am bound to admit that i have never met a debtor who behaved more fairly ive proved the balancesheet to be as honestly made out as it could possibly be we have had no trouble there have been no evasions and no concealments the rashness of dealing which led to this unhappy situation is obvious enough but as far as i can see every attempt has been made to avoid wronging anybody  henchard was more affected by this than he cared to let them perceive and he turned aside to the window again a general murmur of agreement followed the commissioners words and the meeting dispersed when they were gone henchard regarded the watch they had returned to him tisnt mine by rights he said to himself why the devil didnt they take iti dont want what dont belong to me moved by a recollection he took the watch to the makers just opposite sold it there and then for what the tradesman offered and went with the proceeds to one among the smaller of his creditors a cottager of durnover in straitened circumstances to whom he handed the money  when everything was ticketed that henchard had owned and the auctions were in progress there was quite a sympathetic reaction in the town which till then for some time past had done nothing but condemn him now that henchards whole career was pictured distinctly to his neighbours and they could see how admirably he had used his one talent of energy to create a position of affluence out of absolutely nothingwhich was really all he could show when he came to the town as a journeyman haytrusser with his wimble and knife in his basketthey wondered and regretted his fall  try as she might elizabeth could never meet with him she believed in him still though nobody else did and she wanted to be allowed to forgive him for his roughness to her and to help him in his trouble  she wrote to him he did not reply she then went to his housethe great house she had lived in so happily for a timewith its front of dun brick vitrified here and there and its heavy sashbarsbut henchard was to be found there no more the exmayor had left the home of his prosperity and gone into jopps cottage by the priory millthe sad purlieu to which he had wandered on the night of his discovery that she was not his daughter thither she went  elizabeth thought it odd that he had fixed on this spot to retire to but assumed that necessity had no choice trees which seemed old enough to have been planted by the friars still stood around and the back hatch of the original mill yet formed a cascade which had raised its terrific roar for centuries the cottage itself was built of old stones from the long dismantled priory scraps of tracery moulded windowjambs and archlabels being mixed in with the rubble of the walls  in this cottage he occupied a couple of rooms jopp whom henchard had employed abused cajoled and dismissed by turns being the householder but even here her stepfather could not be seen  not by his daughter pleaded elizabeth  by nobodyat present thats his order she was informed  afterwards she was passing by the cornstores and haybarns which had been the headquarters of his business she knew that he ruled there no longer but it was with amazement that she regarded the familiar gateway a smear of decisive leadcoloured paint had been laid on to obliterate henchards name though its letters dimly loomed through like ships in a fog over these in fresh white spread the name of farfrae  abel whittle was edging his skeleton in at the wicket and she said mr farfrae is master here  yaas miss henchet he said mr farfrae have bought the concern and all of we workfolk with it and tis better for us than twasthough i shouldnt say that to you as a daughterlaw we work harder but we baint made afeard now it was fear made my few poor hairs so thin no busting out no slamming of doors no meddling with yer eternal soul and all that and though tis a shilling a week less im the richer man for whats all the world if yer mind is always in a larry miss henchet  the intelligence was in a general sense true and henchards stores which had remained in a paralyzed condition during the settlement of his bankruptcy were stirred into activity again when the new tenant had possession thenceforward the full sacks looped with the shining chain went scurrying up and down under the cathead hairy arms were thrust out from the different doorways and the grain was hauled in trusses of hay were tossed anew in and out of the barns and the wimbles creaked while the scales and steelyards began to be busy where guesswork had formerly been the rule     32   two bridges stood near the lower part of casterbridge town the first of weatherstained brick was immediately at the end of high street where a diverging branch from that thoroughfare ran round to the lowlying durnover lanes so that the precincts of the bridge formed the merging point of respectability and indigence the second bridge of stone was further out on the highwayin fact fairly in the meadows though still within the town boundary  these bridges had speaking countenances every projection in each was worn down to obtuseness partly by weather more by friction from generations of loungers whose toes and heels had from year to year made restless movements against these parapets as they had stood there meditating on the aspect of affairs in the case of the more friable bricks and stones even the flat faces were worn into hollows by the same mixed mechanism the masonry of the top was clamped with iron at each joint since it had been no uncommon thing for desperate men to wrench the coping off and throw it down the river in reckless defiance of the magistrates  for to this pair of bridges gravitated all the failures of the town those who had failed in business in love in sobriety in crime why the unhappy hereabout usually chose the bridges for their meditations in preference to a railing a gate or a stile was not so clear  there was a marked difference of quality between the personages who haunted the near bridge of brick and the personages who haunted the far one of stone those of lowest character preferred the former adjoining the town they did not mind the glare of the public eye they had been of comparatively no account during their successes and though they might feel dispirited they had no particular sense of shame in their ruin their hands were mostly kept in their pockets they wore a leather strap round their hips or knees and boots that required a great deal of lacing but seemed never to get any instead of sighing at their adversities they spat and instead of saying the iron had entered into their souls they said they were down on their luck jopp in his time of distress had often stood here so had mother cuxsom christopher coney and poor abel whittle  the miserables who would pause on the remoter bridge were of a politer stamp they included bankrupts hypochondriacs persons who were what is called out of a situation from fault or lucklessness the inefficient of the professional classshabbygenteel men who did not know how to get rid of the weary time between breakfast and dinner and the yet more weary time between dinner and dark the eye of this species were mostly directed over the parapet upon the running water below a man seen there looking thus fixedly into the river was pretty sure to be one whom the world did not treat kindly for some reason or other while one in straits on the townward bridge did not mind who saw him so and kept his back to the parapet to survey the passersby one in straits on this never faced the road never turned his head at coming footsteps but sensitive to his own condition watched the current whenever a stranger approached as if some strange fish interested him though every finned thing had been poached out of the river years before  there and thus they would muse if their grief were the grief of oppression they would wish themselves kings if their grief were poverty wish themselves millionaires if sin they would wish they were saints or angels if despised love that they were some muchcourted adonis of county fame some had been known to stand and think so long with this fixed gaze downward that eventually they had allowed their poor carcases to follow that gaze and they were discovered the next morning out of reach of their troubles either here or in the deep pool called blackwater a little higher up the river  to this bridge came henchard as other unfortunates had come before him his way thither being by the riverside path on the chilly edge of the town here he was standing one windy afternoon when durnover church clock struck five while the gusts were bringing the notes to his ears across the damp intervening flat a man passed behind him and greeted henchard by name henchard turned slightly and saw that the corner was jopp his old foreman now employed elsewhere to whom though he hated him he had gone for lodgings because jopp was the one man in casterbridge whose observation and opinion the fallen cornmerchant despised to the point of indifference  henchard returned him a scarcely perceptible nod and jopp stopped  he and she are gone into their new house today said jopp  oh said henchard absently which house is that  your old one  gone into my house and starting up henchard added my house of all others in the town  well as somebody was sure to live there and you couldnt it can do ee no harm that hes the man  it was quite true he felt that it was doing him no harm farfrae who had already taken the yards and stores had acquired possession of the house for the obvious convenience of its contiguity and yet this act of his taking up residence within those roomy chambers while he their former tenant lived in a cottage galled henchard indescribably  jopp continued and you heard of that fellow who bought all the best furniture at your sale he was bidding for no other than farfrae all the while it has never been moved out of the house as hed already got the lease  my furniture too surely hell buy my body and soul likewise  theres no saying he wont if you be willing to sell and having planted these wounds in the heart of his once imperious master jopp went on his way while henchard stared and stared into the racing river till the bridge seemed moving backward with him  the low land grew blacker and the sky a deeper grey when the landscape looked like a picture blotted in with ink another traveller approached the great stone bridge he was driving a gig his direction being also townwards on the round of the middle of the arch the gig stopped mr henchard came from it in the voice of farfrae henchard turned his face  finding that he had guessed rightly farfrae told the man who accompanied him to drive home while he alighted and went up to his former friend  i have heard that you think of emigrating mr henchard he said is it true i have a real reason for asking  henchard withheld his answer for several instants and then said yes it is true i am going where you were going to a few years ago when i prevented you and got you to bide here tis turn and turn about isnt it do ye mind how we stood like this in the chalk walk when i persuaded ee to stay you then stood without a chattel to your name and i was the master of the house in corn street but now i stand without a stick or a rag and the master of that house is you  yes yes thats so its the way o the warrld said farfrae  ha ha true cried henchard throwing himself into a mood of jocularity up and down im used to it whats the odds after all  now listen to me if its no taking up your time said farfrae just as i listened to you dont go stay at home  but i can do nothing else man said henchard scornfully the little money i have will just keep body and soul together for a few weeks and no more i have not felt inclined to go back to journeywork yet but i cant stay doing nothing and my best chance is elsewhere  no but what i propose is thisif ye will listen come and live in your old house we can spare some rooms very welli am sure my wife would not mind it at alluntil theres an opening for ye  henchard started probably the picture drawn by the unsuspecting donald of himself under the same roof with lucetta was too striking to be received with equanimity no no he said gruffly we should quarrel  you should hae a part to yourself said farfrae and nobody to interfere wi you it will be a deal healthier than down there by the river where you live now  still henchard refused you dont know what you ask he said however i can do no less than thank ee  they walked into the town together side by side as they had done when henchard persuaded the young scotchman to remain will you come in and have some supper said farfrae when they reached the middle of the town where their paths diverged right and left  no no  bythebye i had nearly forgot i bought a good deal of your furniture  so i have heard  well it was no that i wanted it so very much for myself but i wish ye to pick out all that you care to havesuch things as may be endeared to ye by associations or particularly suited to your use and take them to your own houseit will not be depriving me we can do with less very well and i will have plenty of opportunities of getting more  whatgive it to me for nothing said henchard but you paid the creditors for it  ah yes but maybe its worth more to you than it is to me  henchard was a little moved isometimes think ive wronged ee he said in tones which showed the disquietude that the night shades hid in his face he shook farfrae abruptly by the hand and hastened away as if unwilling to betray himself further farfrae saw him turn through the thoroughfare into bull stake and vanish down towards the priory mill  meanwhile elizabethjane in an upper room no larger than the prophets chamber and with the silk attire of her palmy days packed away in a box was netting with great industry between the hours which she devoted to studying such books as she could get hold of  her lodgings being nearly opposite her stepfathers former residence now farfraes she could see donald and lucetta speeding in and out of their door with all the bounding enthusiasm of their situation she avoided looking that way as much as possible but it was hardly in human nature to keep the eyes averted when the door slammed  while living on thus quietly she heard the news that henchard had caught cold and was confined to his roompossibly a result of standing about the meads in damp weather she went off to his house at once this time she was determined not to be denied admittance and made her way upstairs he was sitting up in the bed with a greatcoat round him and at first resented her intrusion go awaygo away he said i dont like to see ee  but father  i dont like to see ee he repeated  however the ice was broken and she remained she made the room more comfortable gave directions to the people below and by the time she went away had reconciled her stepfather to her visiting him  the effect either of her ministrations or of her mere presence was a rapid recovery he soon was well enough to go out and now things seemed to wear a new colour in his eyes he no longer thought of emigration and thought more of elizabeth the having nothing to do made him more dreary than any other circumstance and one day with better views of farfrae than he had held for some time and a sense that honest work was not a thing to be ashamed of he stoically went down to farfraes yard and asked to be taken on as a journeyman haytrusser he was engaged at once this hiring of henchard was done through a foreman farfrae feeling that it was undesirable to come personally in contact with the excornfactor more than was absolutely necessary while anxious to help him he was well aware by this time of his uncertain temper and thought reserved relations best for the same reason his orders to henchard to proceed to this and that country farm trussing in the usual way were always given through a third person  for a time these arrangements worked well it being the custom to truss in the respective stackyards before bringing it away the hay bought at the different farms about the neighbourhood so that henchard was often absent at such places the whole week long when this was all done and henchard had become in a measure broken in he came to work daily on the home premises like the rest and thus the once flourishing merchant and mayor and what not stood as a daylabourer in the barns and granaries he formerly had owned  i have worked as a journeyman before now hant i he would say in his defiant way and why shouldnt i do it again but he looked a far different journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days then he had worn clean suitable clothes light and cheerful in hue leggings yellow as marigolds corduroys immaculate as new flax and a neckerchief like a flowergarden now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth suit of his gentlemanly times a rusty silk hat and a once black satin stock soiled and shabby clad thus he went to and fro still comparatively an active manfor he was not much over fortyand saw with the other men in the yard donald farfrae going in and out the green door that led to the garden and the big house and lucetta  at the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about casterbridge that mr farfrae already in the town council was to be proposed for mayor in a year or two  yes she was wise she was wise in her generation said henchard to himself when he heard of this one day on his way to farfraes haybarn he thought it over as he wimbled his bonds and the piece of news acted as a reviviscent breath to that old view of hisof donald farfrae as his triumphant rival who rode roughshod over him  a fellow of his age going to be mayor indeed he murmured with a cornerdrawn smile on his mouth but tis her money that floats en upward hahahow cust odd it is here be i his former master working for him as man and he the man standing as master with my house and my furniture and my whatyoumaycall wife all his own  he repeated these things a hundred times a day during the whole period of his acquaintance with lucetta he had never wished to claim her as his own so desperately as he now regretted her loss it was no mercenary hankering after her fortune that moved him though that fortune had been the means of making her so much the more desired by giving her the air of independence and sauciness which attracts men of his composition it had given her servants house and fine clothinga setting that invested lucetta with a startling novelty in the eyes of him who had known her in her narrow days  he accordingly lapsed into moodiness and at every allusion to the possibility of farfraes near election to the municipal chair his former hatred of the scotchman returned concurrently with this he underwent a moral change it resulted in his significantly saying every now and then in tones of recklessness only a fortnight moreonly a dozen days and so forth lessening his figures day by day  why dye say only a dozen days asked solomon longways as he worked beside henchard in the granary weighing oats  because in twelve days i shall be released from my oath  what oath  the oath to drink no spirituous liquid in twelve days it will be twentyone years since i swore it and then i mean to enjoy myself please god  elizabethjane sat at her window one sunday and while there she heard in the street below a conversation which introduced henchards name she was wondering what was the matter when a third person who was passing by asked the question in her mind  michael henchard have busted out drinking after taking nothing for twentyone years  elizabethjane jumped up put on her things and went out     33   at this date there prevailed in casterbridge a convivial customscarcely recognized as such yet none the less established on the afternoon of every sunday a large contingent of the casterbridge journeymensteady churchgoers and sedate charactershaving attended service filed from the church doors across the way to the three mariners inn the rear was usually brought up by the choir with their bassviols fiddles and flutes under their arms  the great point the point of honour on these sacred occasions was for each man to strictly limit himself to halfapint of liquor this scrupulosity was so well understood by the landlord that the whole company was served in cups of that measure they were all exactly alikestraightsided with two leafless limetrees done in eelbrown on the sidesone towards the drinkers lips the other confronting his comrade to wonder how many of these cups the landlord possessed altogether was a favourite exercise of children in the marvellous forty at least might have been seen at these times in the large room forming a ring round the margin of the great sixteenlegged oak table like the monolithic circle of stonehenge in its pristine days outside and above the forty cups came a circle of forty smokejets from forty clay pipes outside the pipes the countenances of the forty churchgoers supported at the back by a circle of forty chairs  the conversation was not the conversation of weekdays but a thing altogether finer in point and higher in tone they invariably discussed the sermon dissecting it weighing it as above or below the averagethe general tendency being to regard it as a scientific feat or performance which had no relation to their own lives except as between critics and the thing criticized the bassviol player and the clerk usually spoke with more authority than the rest on account of their official connection with the preacher  now the three mariners was the inn chosen by henchard as the place for closing his long term of dramless years he had so timed his entry as to be well established in the large room by the time the forty churchgoers entered to their customary cups the flush upon his face proclaimed at once that the vow of twentyone years had lapsed and the era of recklessness begun anew he was seated on a small table drawn up to the side of the massive oak board reserved for the churchmen a few of whom nodded to him as they took their places and said how be ye mr henchard quite a stranger here  henchard did not take the trouble to reply for a few moments and his eyes rested on his stretchedout legs and boots yes he said at length thats true ive been down in spirit for weeks some of ye know the cause i am better now but not quite serene i want you fellows of the choir to strike up a tune and what with that and this brew of stannidges i am in hopes of getting altogether out of my minor key  with all my heart said the first fiddle weve let back our strings thats true but we can soon pull em up again sound a neighbours and give the man a stave  i dont care a curse what the words be said henchard hymns ballets or rantipole rubbish the rogues march or the cherubims warbletis all the same to me if tis good harmony and well put out  wellheh hehit may be we can do that and not a man among us that have sat in the gallery less than twenty year said the leader of the band as tis sunday neighbours suppose we raise the fourth psaam to samuel wakelys tune as improved by me  hang samuel wakelys tune as improved by thee said henchard chuck across one of your psaltersold wiltshire is the only tune worth singingthe psalmtune that would make my blood ebb and flow like the sea when i was a steady chap ill find some words to fit en he took one of the psalters and began turning over the leaves  chancing to look out of the window at that moment he saw a flock of people passing by and perceived them to be the congregation of the upper church now just dismissed their sermon having been a longer one than that the lower parish was favoured with among the rest of the leading inhabitants walked mr councillor farfrae with lucetta upon his arm the observed and imitated of all the smaller tradesmens womankind henchards mouth changed a little and he continued to turn over the leaves  now then he said psalm the hundredandninth to the tune of wiltshire verses ten to fifteen i gie ye the words         his seed shall orphans be his wife           a widow plunged in grief         his vagrant children beg their bread           where none can give relief          his illgot riches shall be made          to usurers a prey         the fruit of all his toil shall be           by strangers borne away          none shall be found that to his wants           their mercy will extend         or to his helpless orphan seed           the least assistance lend          a swift destruction soon shall seize           on his unhappy race         and the next age his hated name           shall utterly deface  i know the psaami know the psaam said the leader hastily but i would as lief not sing it twasnt made for singing we chose it once when the gipsy stole the pasons mare thinking to please him but pason were quite upset whatever servant david were thinking about when he made a psalm that nobody can sing without disgracing himself i cant fathom now then the fourth psalm to samuel wakelys tune as improved by me  od seize your saucei tell ye to sing the hundredandninth to wiltshire and sing it you shall roared henchard not a single one of all the droning crew of ye goes out of this room till that psalm is sung he slipped off the table seized the poker and going to the door placed his back against it now then go ahead if you dont wish to have your cust pates broke  dont ee dontee take on soas tis the sabbathday and tis servant davids words and not ours perhaps we dont mind for once hey said one of the terrified choir looking round upon the rest so the instruments were tuned and the comminatory verses sung  thank ye thank ye said henchard in a softened voice his eyes growing downcast and his manner that of a man much moved by the strains dont you blame david he went on in low tones shaking his head without raising his eyes he knew what he was about when he wrote that if i could afford it be hanged if i wouldnt keep a church choir at my own expense to play and sing to me at these low dark times of my life but the bitter thing is that when i was rich i didnt need what i could have and now i be poor i cant have what i need  while they paused lucetta and farfrae passed again this time homeward it being their custom to take like others a short walk out on the highway and back between church and teatime theres the man weve been singing about said henchard  the players and singers turned their heads and saw his meaning heaven forbid said the bassplayer  tis the man repeated henchard doggedly  then if id known said the performer on the clarionet solemnly that twas meant for a living man nothing should have drawn out of my wyndpipe the breath for that psalm so help me  nor from mine said the first singer but thought i as it was made so long ago perhaps there isnt much in it so ill oblige a neighbour for theres nothing to be said against the tune  ah my boys youve sung it said henchard triumphantly as for him it was partly by his songs that he got over me and heaved me outi could double him up like thatand yet i dont he laid the poker across his knee bent it as if it were a twig flung it down and came away from the door  it was at this time that elizabethjane having heard where her stepfather was entered the room with a pale and agonized countenance the choir and the rest of the company moved off in accordance with their halfpint regulation elizabethjane went up to henchard and entreated him to accompany her home  by this hour the volcanic fires of his nature had burnt down and having drunk no great quantity as yet he was inclined to acquiesce she took his arm and together they went on henchard walked blankly like a blind man repeating to himself the last words of the singers         and the next age his hated name           shall utterly deface  at length he said to her i am a man to my word i have kept my oath for twentyone years and now i can drink with a good conscienceif i dont do for himwell i am a fearful practical joker when i choose he has taken away everything from me and by heavens if i meet him i wont answer for my deeds  these halfuttered words alarmed elizabethall the more by reason of the still determination of henchards mien  what will you do she asked cautiously while trembling with disquietude and guessing henchards allusion only too well  henchard did not answer and they went on till they had reached his cottage may i come in she said  no no not today said henchard and she went away feeling that to caution farfrae was almost her duty as it was certainly her strong desire  as on the sunday so on the weekdays farfrae and lucetta might have been seen flitting about the town like two butterfliesor rather like a bee and a butterfly in league for life she seemed to take no pleasure in going anywhere except in her husbands company and hence when business would not permit him to waste an afternoon she remained indoors waiting for the time to pass till his return her face being visible to elizabethjane from her window aloft the latter however did not say to herself that farfrae should be thankful for such devotion but full of her reading she cited rosalinds exclamation mistress know yourself down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good mans love  she kept her eye upon henchard also one day he answered her inquiry for his health by saying that he could not endure abel whittles pitying eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard he is such a fool said henchard that he can never get out of his mind the time when i was master there  ill come and wimble for you instead of him if you will allow me said she her motive on going to the yard was to get an opportunity of observing the general position of affairs on farfraes premises now that her stepfather was a workman there henchards threats had alarmed her so much that she wished to see his behaviour when the two were face to face  for two or three days after her arrival donald did not make any appearance then one afternoon the green door opened and through came first farfrae and at his heels lucetta donald brought his wife forward without hesitation it being obvious that he had no suspicion whatever of any antecedents in common between her and the now journeyman haytrusser  henchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair keeping them fixed on the bond he twisted as if that alone absorbed him a feeling of delicacy which ever prompted farfrae to avoid anything that might seem like triumphing over a fallen rivel led him to keep away from the haybarn where henchard and his daughter were working and to go on to the corn department meanwhile lucetta never having been informed that henchard had entered her husbands service rambled straight on to the barn where she came suddenly upon henchard and gave vent to a little oh which the happy and busy donald was too far off to hear henchard with withering humility of demeanour touched the brim of his hat to her as whittle and the rest had done to which she breathed a deadalive good afternoon  i beg your pardon maam said henchard as if he had not heard  i said good afternoon she faltered  o yes good afternoon maam he replied touching his hat again i am glad to see you maam lucetta looked embarrassed and henchard continued for we humble workmen here feel it a great honour that a lady should look in and take an interest in us  she glanced at him entreatingly the sarcasm was too bitter too unendurable  can you tell me the time maam he asked  yes she said hastily halfpast four  thank ee an hour and a half longer before we are released from work ah maam we of the lower classes know nothing of the gay leisure that such as you enjoy  as soon as she could do so lucetta left him nodded and smiled to elizabethjane and joined her husband at the other end of the enclosure where she could be seen leading him away by the outer gates so as to avoid passing henchard again that she had been taken by surprise was obvious the result of this casual rencounter was that the next morning a note was put into henchards hand by the postman  will you said lucetta with as much bitterness as she could put into a small communication will you kindly undertake not to speak to me in the biting undertones you used today if i walk through the yard at any time i bear you no illwill and i am only too glad that you should have employment of my dear husband but in common fairness treat me as his wife and do not try to make me wretched by covert sneers i have committed no crime and done you no injury  poor fool said henchard with fond savagery holding out the note to know no better than commit herself in writing like this why if i were to show that to her dear husbandpooh he threw the letter into the fire  lucetta took care not to come again among the hay and corn she would rather have died than run the risk of encountering henchard at such close quarters a second time the gulf between them was growing wider every day farfrae was always considerate to his fallen acquaintance but it was impossible that he should not by degrees cease to regard the excornmerchant as more than one of his other workmen henchard saw this and concealed his feelings under a cover of stolidity fortifying his heart by drinking more freely at the three mariners every evening  often did elizabethjane in her endeavours to prevent his taking other liquor carry tea to him in a little basket at five oclock arriving one day on this errand she found her stepfather was measuring up cloverseed and rapeseed in the cornstores on the top floor and she ascended to him each floor had a door opening into the air under a cathead from which a chain dangled for hoisting the sacks  when elizabeths head rose through the trap she perceived that the upper door was open and that her stepfather and farfrae stood just within it in conversation farfrae being nearest the dizzy edge and henchard a little way behind not to interrupt them she remained on the steps without raising her head any higher while waiting thus she sawor fancied she saw for she had a terror of feeling certainher stepfather slowly raise his hand to a level behind farfraes shoulders a curious expression taking possession of his face the young man was quite unconscious of the action which was so indirect that if farfrae had observed it he might almost have regarded it as an idle outstretching of the arm but it would have been possible by a comparatively light touch to push farfrae off his balance and send him head over heels into the air  elizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what this might have meant as soon as they turned she mechanically took the tea to henchard left it and went away reflecting she endeavoured to assure herself that the movement was an idle eccentricity and no more yet on the other hand his subordinate position in an establishment where he once had been master might be acting on him like an irritant poison and she finally resolved to caution donald     34   next morning accordingly she rose at five oclock and went into the street it was not yet light a dense fog prevailed and the town was as silent as it was dark except that from the rectangular avenues which framed in the borough there came a chorus of tiny rappings caused by the fall of waterdrops condensed on the boughs now it was wafted from the west walk now from the south walk and then from both quarters simultaneously she moved on to the bottom of corn street and knowing his time well waited only a few minutes before she heard the familiar bang of his door and then his quick walk towards her she met him at the point where the last tree of the engirding avenue flanked the last house in the street  he could hardly discern her till glancing inquiringly he said whatmiss henchardand are ye up so airly  she asked him to pardon her for waylaying him at such an unseemly time but i am anxious to mention something she said and i wished not to alarm mrs farfrae by calling  yes said he with the cheeriness of a superior and what may it be its very kind of ye im sure  she now felt the difficulty of conveying to his mind the exact aspect of possibilities in her own but she somehow began and introduced henchards name i sometimes fear she said with an effort that he may be betrayed into some attempt toinsult you sir  but we are the best of friends  or to play some practical joke upon you sir remember that he has been hardly used  but we are quite friendly  or to do somethingthat would injure youhurt youwound you every word cost her twice its length of pain and she could see that farfrae was still incredulous henchard a poor man in his employ was not to farfraes view the henchard who had ruled him yet he was not only the same man but that man with his sinister qualities formerly latent quickened into life by his buffetings  farfrae happy and thinking no evil persisted in making light of her fears thus they parted and she went homeward journeymen now being in the street waggoners going to the harnessmakers for articles left to be repaired farmhorses going to the shoeingsmiths and the sons of labour showing themselves generally on the move elizabeth entered her lodging unhappily thinking she had done no good and only made herself appear foolish by her weak note of warning  but donald farfrae was one of those men upon whom an incident is never absolutely lost he revised impressions from a subsequent point of view and the impulsive judgment of the moment was not always his permanent one the vision of elizabeths earnest face in the rimy dawn came back to him several times during the day knowing the solidity of her character he did not treat her hints altogether as idle sounds  but he did not desist from a kindly scheme on henchards account that engaged him just then and when he met lawyer joyce the townclerk later in the day he spoke of it as if nothing had occurred to damp it  about that little seedsmans shop he said the shop overlooking the churchyard which is to let it is not for myself i want it but for our unlucky fellowtownsman henchard it would be a new beginning for him if a small one and i have told the council that i would head a private subscription among them to set him up in itthat i would be fifty pounds if they would make up the other fifty among them  yes yes so ive heard and theres nothing to say against it for that matter the townclerk replied in his plain frank way but farfrae others see what you dont henchard hates eeay hates ee and tis right that you should know it to my knowledge he was at the three mariners last night saying in public that about you which a man ought not to say about another  is that soah is that so said farfrae looking down why should he do it added the young man bitterly what harm have i done him that he should try to wrong me  god only knows said joyce lifting his eyebrows it shows much longsuffering in you to put up with him and keep him in your employ  but i cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me how can i forget that when i came here twas he enabled me to make a footing for mysel no no as long as ive a days work to offer he shall do it if he chooses tis not i who will deny him such a little as that but ill drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till i can think more about it  it grieved farfrae much to give up this scheme but a damp having been thrown over it by these and other voices in the air he went and countermanded his orders the then occupier of the shop was in it when farfrae spoke to him and feeling it necessary to give some explanation of his withdrawal from the negotiation donald mentioned henchards name and stated that the intentions of the council had been changed  the occupier was much disappointed and straightway informed henchard as soon as he saw him that a scheme of the council for setting him up in a shop had been knocked on the head by farfrae and thus out of error enmity grew  when farfrae got indoors that evening the teakettle was singing on the high hob of the semieggshaped grate lucetta light as a sylph ran forward and seized his hands whereupon farfrae duly kissed her  oh she cried playfully turning to the window seethe blinds are not drawn down and the people can look inwhat a scandal  when the candles were lighted the curtains drawn and the twain sat at tea she noticed that he looked serious without directly inquiring why she let her eyes linger solicitously on his face  who has called he absently asked any folk for me  no said lucetta whats the matter donald  wellnothing worth talking of he responded sadly  then never mind it you will get through it scotchmen are always lucky  nonot always he said shaking his head gloomily as he contemplated a crumb on the table i know many who have not been so there was sandy macfarlane who started to america to try his fortune and he was drowned and archibald leith he was murdered and poor willie dunbleeze and maitland macfreezethey fell into bad courses and went the way of all such  whyyou old gooseyi was only speaking in a general sense of course you are always so literal now when we have finished tea sing me that funny song about highheeled shoon and siller tags and the oneandforty wooers  no no i couldna sing tonight its henchardhe hates me so that i may not be his friend if i would i would understand why there should be a wee bit of envy but i cannet see a reason for the whole intensity of what he feels now can you lucetta it is more like oldfashioned rivalry in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade  lucetta had grown somewhat wan no she replied  i give him employmenti cannet refuse it but neither can i blind myself to the fact that with a man of passions such as his there is no safeguard for conduct  what have you heardo donald dearest said lucetta in alarm the words on her lips were anything about mebut she did not utter them she could not however suppress her agitation and her eyes filled with tears  no noit is not so serious as ye fancy declared farfrae soothingly though he did not know its seriousness so well as she  i wish you would do what we have talked of mournfully remarked lucetta give up business and go away from here we have plenty of money and why should we stay  farfrae seemed seriously disposed to discuss this move and they talked thereon till a visitor was announced their neighbour alderman vatt came in  youve heard i suppose of poor doctor chalkfields death yesdied this afternoon at five said mr vatt chalkfield was the councilman who had succeeded to the mayoralty in the preceding november  farfrae was sorry at the intelligence and mr vatt continued well we know hes been going some days and as his family is well provided for we must take it all as it is now i have called to ask ee thisquite privately if i should nominate ee to succeed him and there should be no particular opposition will ee accept the chair  but there are folk whose turn is before mine and im over young and may be thought pushing said farfrae after a pause  not at all i dont speak for myself only several have named it you wont refuse  we thought of going away interposed lucetta looking at farfrae anxiously  it was only a fancy farfrae murmured i wouldna refuse if it is the wish of a respectable majority in the council  very well then look upon yourself as elected we have had older men long enough  when he was gone farfrae said musingly see now how its ourselves that are ruled by the powers above us we plan this but we do that if they want to make me mayor i will stay and henchard must rave as he will  from this evening onward lucetta was very uneasy if she had not been imprudence incarnate she would not have acted as she did when she met henchard by accident a day or two later it was in the bustle of the market when no one could readily notice their discourse  michael said she i must again ask you what i asked you months agoto return me any letters or papers of mine that you may haveunless you have destroyed them you must see how desirable it is that the time at jersey should be blotted out for the good of all parties  why bless the womani packed up every scrap of your handwriting to give you in the coachbut you never appeared  she explained how the death of her aunt had prevented her taking the journey on that day and what became of the parcel then she asked  he could not sayhe would consider when she was gone he recollected that he had left a heap of useless papers in his former diningroom safebuilt up in the wall of his old housenow occupied by farfrae the letters might have been amongst them  a grotesque grin shaped itself on henchards face had that safe been opened  on the very evening which followed this there was a great ringing of bells in casterbridge and the combined brass wood catgut and leather bands played round the town with more prodigality of percussionnotes than ever farfrae was mayorthe twohundredth odd of a series forming an elective dynasty dating back to the days of charles iand the fair lucetta was the courted of the townbut ah the worm i the budhenchard what he could tell  he in the meantime festering with indignation at some erroneous intelligence of farfraes opposition to the scheme for installing him in the little seedshop was greeted with the news of the municipal election which by reason of farfraes comparative youth and his scottish nativitya thing unprecedented in the casehad an interest far beyond the ordinary the bellringing and the bandplaying loud as tamerlanes trumpet goaded the downfallen henchard indescribably the ousting now seemed to him to be complete  the next morning he went to the cornyard as usual and about eleven oclock donald entered through the green door with no trace of the worshipful about him the yet more emphatic change of places between him and henchard which this election had established renewed a slight embarrassment in the manner of the modest young man but henchard showed the front of one who had overlooked all this and farfrae met his amenities halfway at once  i was going to ask you said henchard about a packet that i may possibly have left in my old safe in the diningroom he added particulars  if so it is there now said farfrae i have never opened the safe at all as yet for i keep ma papers at the bank to sleep easy o nights  it was not of much consequenceto me said henchard but ill call for it this evening if you dont mind  it was quite late when he fulfilled his promise he had primed himself with grog as he did very frequently now and a curl of sardonic humour hung on his lip as he approached the house as though he were contemplating some terrible form of amusement whatever it was the incident of his entry did not diminish its force this being his first visit to the house since he had lived there as owner the ring of the bell spoke to him like the voice of a familiar drudge who had been bribed to forsake him the movements of the doors were revivals of dead days  farfrae invited him into the diningroom where he at once unlocked the iron safe built into the wall his henchards safe made by an ingenious locksmith under his direction farfrae drew thence the parcel and other papers with apologies for not having returned them  never mind said henchard drily the fact is they are letters mostlyyes he went on sitting down and unfolding lucettas passionate bundle here they be that ever i should see em again i hope mrs farfrae is well after her exertions of yesterday  she has felt a bit weary and has gone to bed airly on that account  henchard returned to the letters sorting them over with interest farfrae being seated at the other end of the diningtable you dont forget of course he resumed that curious chapter in the history of my past which i told you of and that you gave me some assistance in these letters are in fact related to that unhappy business though thank god it is all over now  what became of the poor woman asked farfrae  luckily she married and married well said henchard so that these reproaches she poured out on me do not now cause me any twinges as they might otherwise have donejust listen to what an angry woman will say  farfrae willing to humour henchard though quite uninterested and bursting with yawns gave wellmannered attention  for me henchard read there is practically no future a creature too unconventionally devoted to youwho feels it impossible that she can be the wife of any other man and who is yet no more to you than the first woman you meet in the streetsuch am i i quite acquit you of any intention to wrong me yet you are the door through which wrong has come to me that in the event of your present wifes death you will place me in her position is a consolation so far as it goesbut how far does it go thus i sit here forsaken by my few acquaintance and forsaken by you  thats how she went on to me said henchard acres of words like that when what had happened was what i could not cure  yes said farfrae absently it is the way wi women but the fact was that he knew very little of the sex yet detecting a sort of resemblance in style between the effusions of the woman he worshipped and those of the supposed stranger he concluded that aphrodite ever spoke thus whosesoever the personality she assumed  henchard unfolded another letter and read it through likewise stopping at the subscription as before her name i dont give he said blandly as i didnt marry her and another man did i can scarcely do that in fairness to her  trrue trrue said farfrae but why didnt you marry her when your wife susan died farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned  ahwell you may ask that said henchard the newmoonshaped grin adumbrating itself again upon his mouth in spite of all her protestations when i came forward to do so as in generosity bound she was not the woman for me  she had already married anothermaybe  henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend further into particulars and he answered yes  the young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very readily  she had she had said henchard emphatically  he opened a third and fourth letter and read this time he approached the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest but again he stopped short the truth was that as may be divined he had quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama by reading out the name he had come to the house with no other thought but sitting here in cold blood he could not do it  such a wrecking of hearts appalled even him his quality was such that he could have annihilated them both in the heat of action but to accomplish the deed by oral poison was beyond the nerve of his enmity     35   as donald stated lucetta had retired early to her room because of fatigue she had however not gone to rest but sat in the bedside chair reading and thinking over the events of the day at the ringing of the doorbell by henchard she wondered who it should be that would call at that comparatively late hour the diningroom was almost under her bedroom she could hear that somebody was admitted there and presently the indistinct murmur of a person reading became audible  the usual time for donalds arrival upstairs came and passed yet still the reading and conversation went on this was very singular she could think of nothing but that some extraordinary crime had been committed and that the visitor whoever he might be was reading an account of it from a special edition of the casterbridge chronicle at last she left the room and descended the stairs the diningroom door was ajar and in the silence of the resting household the voice and the words were recognizable before she reached the lower flight she stood transfixed her own words greeted her in henchards voice like spirits from the grave  lucetta leant upon the banister with her cheek against the smooth handrail as if she would make a friend of it in her misery rigid in this position more and more words fell successively upon her ear but what amazed her most was the tone of her husband he spoke merely in the accents of a man who made a present of his time  one word he was saying as the crackling of paper denoted that henchard was unfolding yet another sheet is it quite fair to this young womans memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone  well yes said henchard by not giving her name i make it an example of all womankind and not a scandal to one  if i were you i would destroy them said farfrae giving more thought to the letters than he had hitherto done as another mans wife it would injure the woman if it were known  no i shall not destroy them murmured henchard putting the letters away then he arose and lucetta heard no more  she went back to her bedroom in a semiparalyzed state for very fear she could not undress but sat on the edge of the bed waiting would henchard let out the secret in his parting words her suspense was terrible had she confessed all to donald in their early acquaintance he might possibly have got over it and married her just the sameunlikely as it had once seemed but for her or any one else to tell him now would be fatal  the door slammed she could hear her husband bolting it after looking round in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs the spark in her eyes wellnigh went out when he appeared round the bedroom door her gaze hung doubtful for a moment then to her joyous amazement she saw that he looked at her with the rallying smile of one who had just been relieved of a scene that was irksome she could hold out no longer and sobbed hysterically  when he had restored her farfrae naturally enough spoke of henchard of all men he was the least desirable as a visitor he said but it is my belief that hes just a bit crazed he has been reading to me a long lot of letters relating to his past life and i could do no less than indulge him by listening  this was sufficient henchard then had not told henchards last words to farfrae in short as he stood on the doorstep had been these wellim obliged to ee for listening i may tell more about her some day  finding this she was much perplexed as to henchards motives in opening the matter at all for in such cases we attribute to an enemy a power of consistent action which we never find in ourselves or in our friends and forget that abortive efforts from want of heart are as possible to revenge as to generosity  next morning lucetta remained in bed meditating how to parry this incipient attack the bold stroke of telling donald the truth dimly conceived was yet too bold for she dreaded lest in doing so he like the rest of the world should believe that the episode was rather her fault than her misfortune she decided to employ persuasionnot with donald but with the enemy himself it seemed the only practicable weapon left her as a woman having laid her plan she rose and wrote to him who kept her on these tenterhooks  i overheard your interview with my husband last night and saw the drift of your revenge the very thought of it crushes me have pity on a distressed woman if you could see me you would relent you do not know how anxiety has told upon me lately i will be at the ring at the time you leave workjust before the sun goes down please come that way i cannot rest till i have seen you face to face and heard from your mouth that you will carry this horseplay no further  to herself she said on closing up her appeal if ever tears and pleadings have served the weak to fight the strong let them do so now  with this view she made a toilette which differed from all she had ever attempted before to heighten her natural attraction had hitherto been the unvarying endeavour of her adult life and one in which she was no novice but now she neglected this and even proceeded to impair the natural presentation beyond a natural reason for her slightly drawn look she had not slept all the previous night and this had produced upon her pretty though slightly worn features the aspect of a countenance ageing prematurely from extreme sorrow she selectedas much from want of spirit as designher poorest plainest and longest discarded attire  to avoid the contingency of being recognized she veiled herself and slipped out of the house quickly the sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid by the time she had got up the road opposite the amphitheatre which she speedily entered the interior was shadowy and emphatic of the absence of every living thing  she was not disappointed in the fearful hope with which she awaited him henchard came over the top descended and lucetta waited breathlessly but having reached the arena she saw a change in his bearing he stood still at a little distance from her she could not think why  nor could any one else have known the truth was that in appointing this spot and this hour for the rendezvous lucetta had unwittingly backed up her entreaty by the strongest argument she could have used outside words with this man of moods glooms and superstitions her figure in the midst of the huge enclosure the unusual plainness of her dress her attitude of hope and appeal so strongly revived in his soul the memory of another illused woman who had stood there and thus in bygone days and had now passed away into her rest that he was unmanned and his heart smote him for having attempted reprisals on one of a sex so weak when he approached her and before she had spoken a word her point was half gained  his manner as he had come down had been one of cynical carelessness but he now put away his grim halfsmile and said in a kindly subdued tone goodnight tye of course im glad to come if you want me  o thank you she said apprehensively  i am sorry to see ee looking so ill he stammered with unconcealed compunction  she shook her head how can you be sorry she asked when you deliberately cause it  what said henchard uneasily is it anything i have done that has pulled you down like that  it is all your doing she said i have no other grief my happiness would be secure enough but for your threats o michael dont wreck me like this you might think that you have done enough when i came here i was a young woman now i am rapidly becoming an old one neither my husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long  henchard was disarmed his old feeling of supercilious pity for womankind in general was intensified by this suppliant appearing here as the double of the first moreover that thoughtless want of foresight which had led to all her trouble remained with poor lucetta still she had come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving the risk such a woman was very small deer to hunt he felt ashamed lost all zest and desire to humiliate lucetta there and then and no longer envied farfrae his bargain he had married money but nothing more henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game  well what do you want me to do he said gently i am sure i shall be very willing my reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke and i revealed nothing  to give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or worse  so be it every scrap shall be yoursbut between you and me lucetta he is sure to find out something of the matter sooner or later  ah she said with eager tremulousness but not till i have proved myself a faithful and deserving wife to him and then he may forgive me everything  henchard silently looked at her he almost envied farfrae such love as that even now hmi hope so he said but you shall have the letters without fail and your secret shall be kept i swear it  how good you arehow shall i get them  he reflected and said he would send them the next morning now dont doubt me he added i can keep my word     36   returning from her appointment lucetta saw a man waiting by the lamp nearest to her own door when she stopped to go in he came and spoke to her it was jopp  he begged her pardon for addressing her but he had heard that mr farfrae had been applied to by a neighbouring cornmerchant to recommend a working partner if so he wished to offer himself he could give good security and had stated as much to mr farfrae in a letter but he would feel much obliged if lucetta would say a word in his favour to her husband  it is a thing i know nothing about said lucetta coldly  but you can testify to my trustworthiness better than anybody maam said jopp i was in jersey several years and knew you there by sight  indeed she replied but i knew nothing of you  i think maam that a word or two from you would secure for me what i covet very much he persisted  she steadily refused to have anything to do with the affair and cutting him short because of her anxiety to get indoors before her husband should miss her left him on the pavement  he watched her till she had vanished and then went home when he got there he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron dogs and the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle a movement upstairs disturbed him and henchard came down from his bedroom where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes  i wish said henchard you would do me a service jopp nowtonight i mean if you can leave this at mrs farfraes for her i should take it myself of course but i dont wish to be seen there  he handed a package in brown paper sealed henchard had been as good as his word immediately on coming indoors he had searched over his few belongings and every scrap of lucettas writing that he possessed was here jopp indifferently expressed his willingness  well how have ye got on today his lodger asked any prospect of an opening  i am afraid not said jopp who had not told the other of his application to farfrae  there never will be in casterbridge declared henchard decisively you must roam further afield he said goodnight to jopp and returned to his own part of the house  jopp sat on till his eyes were attracted by the shadow of the candlesnuff on the wall and looking at the original he found that it had formed itself into a head like a redhot cauliflower henchards packet next met his gaze he knew there had been something of the nature of wooing between henchard and the now mrs farfrae and his vague ideas on the subject narrowed themselves down to these henchard had a parcel belonging to mrs farfrae and he had reasons for not returning that parcel to her in person what could be inside it so he went on and on till animated by resentment at lucettas haughtiness as he thought it and curiosity to learn if there were any weak sides to this transaction with henchard he examined the package the pen and all its relations being awkward tools in henchards hands he had affixed the seals without an impression it never occurring to him that the efficacy of such a fastening depended on this jopp was far less of a tyro he lifted one of the seals with his penknife peeped in at the end thus opened saw that the bundle consisted of letters and having satisfied himself thus far sealed up the end again by simply softening the wax with the candle and went off with the parcel as requested  his path was by the riverside at the foot of the town coming into the light at the bridge which stood at the end of high street he beheld lounging thereon mother cuxsom and nance mockridge  we be just going down mixen lane way to look into peters finger afore creeping to bed said mrs cuxsom theres a fiddle and tambourine going on there lord whats all the worlddo ye come along too jopptwont hinder ye five minutes  jopp had mostly kept himself out of this company but present circumstances made him somewhat more reckless than usual and without many words he decided to go to his destination that way   though the upper part of durnover was mainly composed of a curious congeries of barns and farmsteads there was a less picturesque side to the parish this was mixen lane now in great part pulled down  mixen lane was the adullam of all the surrounding villages it was the hidingplace of those who were in distress and in debt and trouble of every kind farmlabourers and other peasants who combined a little poaching with their farming and a little brawling and bibbing with their poaching found themselves sooner or later in mixen lane rural mechanics too idle to mechanize rural servants too rebellious to serve drifted or were forced into mixen lane  the lane and its surrounding thicket of thatched cottages stretched out like a spit into the moist and misty lowland much that was sad much that was low some things that were baneful could be seen in mixen lane vice ran freely in and out certain of the doors in the neighbourhood recklessness dwelt under the roof with the crooked chimney shame in some bowwindows theft in times of privation in the thatched and mudwalled houses by the sallows even slaughter had not been altogether unknown here in a block of cottages up an alley there might have been erected an altar to disease in years gone by such was mixen lane in the times when henchard and farfrae were mayors  yet this mildewed leaf in the sturdy and flourishing casterbridge plant lay close to the open country not a hundred yards from a row of noble elms and commanding a view across the moor of airy uplands and cornfields and mansions of the great a brook divided the moor from the tenements and to outward view there was no way across itno way to the houses but round about by the road but under every householders stairs there was kept a mysterious plank nine inches wide which plank was a secret bridge  if you as one of those refugee householders came in from business after darkand this was the business time hereyou stealthily crossed the moor approached the border of the aforesaid brook and whistled opposite the house to which you belonged a shape thereupon made its appearance on the other side bearing the bridge on end against the sky it was lowered you crossed and a hand helped you to land yourself together with the pheasants and hares gathered from neighbouring manors you sold them slily the next morning and the day after you stood before the magistrates with the eyes of all your sympathizing neighbours concentrated on your back you disappeared for a time then you were again found quietly living in mixen lane  walking along the lane at dusk the stranger was struck by two or three peculiar features therein one was an intermittent rumbling from the back premises of the inn halfway up this meant a skittle alley another was the extensive prevalence of whistling in the various domicilesa piped note of some kind coming from nearly every open door another was the frequency of white aprons over dingy gowns among the women around the doorways a white apron is a suspicious vesture in situations where spotlessness is difficult moreover the industry and cleanliness which the white apron expressed were belied by the postures and gaits of the women who wore ittheir knuckles being mostly on their hips an attitude which lent them the aspect of twohandled mugs and their shoulders against doorposts while there was a curious alacrity in the turn of each honest womans head upon her neck and in the twirl of her honest eyes at any noise resembling a masculine footfall along the lane  yet amid so much that was bad needy respectability also found a home under some of the roofs abode pure and virtuous souls whose presence there was due to the iron hand of necessity and to that alone families from decayed villagesfamilies of that once bulky but now nearly extinct section of village society called liviers or lifeholderscopyholders and others whose rooftrees had fallen for some reason or other compelling them to quit the rural spot that had been their home for generationscame here unless they chose to lie under a hedge by the wayside  the inn called peters finger was the church of mixen lane  it was centrally situate as such places should be and bore about the same social relation to the three mariners as the latter bore to the kings arms at first sight the inn was so respectable as to be puzzling the front door was kept shut and the step was so clean that evidently but few persons entered over its sanded surface but at the corner of the publichouse was an alley a mere slit dividing it from the next building halfway up the alley was a narrow door shiny and paintless from the rub of infinite hands and shoulders this was the actual entrance to the inn  a pedestrian would be seen abstractedly passing along mixen lane and then in a moment he would vanish causing the gazer to blink like ashton at the disappearance of ravenswood that abstracted pedestrian had edged into the slit by the adroit fillip of his person sideways from the slit he edged into the tavern by a similar exercise of skill  the company at the three mariners were persons of quality in comparison with the company which gathered here though it must be admitted that the lowest fringe of the mariners party touched the crest of peters at points waifs and strays of all sorts loitered about here the landlady was a virtuous woman who years ago had been unjustly sent to gaol as an accessory to something or other after the fact she underwent her twelvemonth and had worn a martyrs countenance ever since except at times of meeting the constable who apprehended her when she winked her eye  to this house jopp and his acquaintances had arrived the settles on which they sat down were thin and tall their tops being guyed by pieces of twine to hooks in the ceiling for when the guests grew boisterous the settles would rock and overturn without some such security the thunder of bowls echoed from the backyard swingels hung behind the blower of the chimney and expoachers and exgamekeepers whom squires had persecuted without a cause sat elbowing each othermen who in past times had met in fights under the moon till lapse of sentences on the one part and loss of favour and expulsion from service on the other brought them here together to a common level where they sat calmly discussing old times  dost mind how you could jerk a trout ashore with a bramble and not ruffle the stream charl a deposed keeper was saying twas at that i caught ee once if you can mind  that i can but the worst larry for me was that pheasant business at yalbury wood your wife swore false that time joeo by gad she didtheres no denying it  how was that asked jopp  whyjoe closed wi me and we rolled down together close to his garden hedge hearing the noise out ran his wife with the oven pyle and it being dark under the trees she couldnt see which was uppermost where beest thee joe under or top she screeched ounder by gad says he she then began to rap down upon my skull back and ribs with the pyle till wed roll over again where beest now dear joe under or top shed scream again by george twas through her i was took and then when we got up in hall she sware that the cock pheasant was one of her rearing when twas not your bird at all joe twas squire browns birdthats whose twasone that wed picked off as we passed his wood an hour afore it did hurt my feelings to be so wronged ah welltis over now  i might have had ee days afore that said the keeper i was within a few yards of ee dozens of times with a sight more of birds than that poor one  yestis not our greatest doings that the world gets wind of said the furmitywoman who lately settled in this purlieu sat among the rest having travelled a great deal in her time she spoke with cosmopolitan largeness of idea it was she who presently asked jopp what was the parcel he kept so snugly under his arm  ah therein lies a grand secret said jopp it is the passion of love to think that a woman should love one man so well and hate another so unmercifully  whos the object of your meditation sir  one that stands high in this town id like to shame her upon my life twould be as good as a play to read her loveletters the proud piece of silk and waxwork for tis her loveletters that ive got here  love letters then lets hear em good soul said mother cuxsom lord do ye mind richard what fools we used to be when we were younger getting a schoolboy to write ours for us and giving him a penny do ye mind not to tell other folks what hed put inside do ye mind  by this time jopp had pushed his finger under the seals and unfastened the letters tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random which he read aloud these passages soon began to uncover the secret which lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried though the epistles being allusive only did not make it altogether plain  mrs farfrae wrote that said nance mockridge tis a humbling thing for us as respectable women that one of the same sex could do it and now shes avowed herself to another man  so much the better for her said the aged furmitywoman ah i saved her from a real bad marriage and shes never been the one to thank me  i say what a good foundation for a skimmityride said nance  true said mrs cuxsom reflecting tis as good a ground for a skimmityride as ever i knowed and it ought not to be wasted the last one seen in casterbridge must have been ten years ago if a day  at this moment there was a shrill whistle and the landlady said to the man who had been called charl tis jim coming in would ye go and let down the bridge for me  without replying charl and his comrade joe rose and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the gardenpath which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned beyond the stream was the open moor from which a clammy breeze smote upon their faces as they advanced taking up the board that had lain in readiness one of them lowered it across the water and the instant its further end touched the ground footsteps entered upon it and there appeared from the shade a stalwart man with straps round his knees a doublebarrelled gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him they asked him if he had had much luck  not much he said indifferently all safe inside  receiving a reply in the affirmative he went on inwards the others withdrawing the bridge and beginning to retreat in his rear before however they had entered the house a cry of ahoy from the moor led them to pause  the cry was repeated they pushed the lantern into an outhouse and went back to the brink of the stream  ahoyis this the way to casterbridge said some one from the other side  not in particular said charl theres a river afore ee  i dont careheres for through it said the man in the moor ive had travelling enough for today  stop a minute then said charl finding that the man was no enemy joe bring the plank and lantern heres somebody thats lost his way you should have kept along the turnpike road friend and not have strook across here  i shouldas i see now but i saw a light here and says i to myself thats an outlying house depend ont  the plank was now lowered and the strangers form shaped itself from the darkness he was a middleaged man with hair and whiskers prematurely grey and a broad and genial face he had crossed on the plank without hesitation and seemed to see nothing odd in the transit he thanked them and walked between them up the garden what place is this he asked when they reached the door  a publichouse  ah perhaps it will suit me to put up at now then come in and wet your whistle at my expense for the lift over you have given me  they followed him into the inn where the increased light exhibited him as one who would stand higher in an estimate by the eye than in one by the ear he was dressed with a certain clumsy richnesshis coat being furred and his head covered by a cap of sealskin which though the nights were chilly must have been warm for the daytime spring being somewhat advanced in his hand he carried a small mahogany case strapped and clamped with brass  apparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him through the kitchen door he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the house but taking the situation lightly he called for glasses of the best paid for them as he stood in the passage and turned to proceed on his way by the front door this was barred and while the landlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was continued in the sittingroom and reached his ears  what do they mean by a skimmityride he asked  o sir said the landlady swinging her long earrings with deprecating modesty tis a old foolish thing they do in these parts when a mans wife iswell not too particularly his own but as a respectable householder i dont encourage it  still are they going to do it shortly it is a good sight to see i suppose  well sir she simpered and then bursting into naturalness and glancing from the corner of her eye tis the funniest thing under the sun and it costs money  ah i remember hearing of some such thing now i shall be in casterbridge for two or three weeks to come and should not mind seeing the performance wait a moment he turned back entered the sittingroom and said here good folks i should like to see the old custom you are talking of and i dont mind being something towards ittake that he threw a sovereign on the table and returned to the landlady at the door of whom having inquired the way into the town he took his leave  there were more where that one came from said charl when the sovereign had been taken up and handed to the landlady for safe keeping by george we ought to have got a few more while we had him here  no no answered the landlady this is a respectable house thank god and ill have nothing done but whats honourable  well said jopp now well consider the business begun and will soon get it in train  we will said nance a good laugh warms my heart more than a cordial and thats the truth ont  jopp gathered up the letters and it being now somewhat late he did not attempt to call at farfraes with them that night he reached home sealed them up as before and delivered the parcel at its address next morning within an hour its contents were reduced to ashes by lucetta who poor soul was inclined to fall down on her knees in thankfulness that at last no evidence remained of the unlucky episode with henchard in her past for though hers had been rather the laxity of inadvertence than of intention that episode if known was not the less likely to operate fatally between herself and her husband     37   such was the state of things when the current affairs of casterbridge were interrupted by an event of such magnitude that its influence reached to the lowest social stratum there stirring the depths of its society simultaneously with the preparations for the skimmington it was one of those excitements which when they move a country town leave permanent mark upon its chronicles as a warm summer permanently marks the ring in the treetrunk corresponding to its date  a royal personage was about to pass through the borough on his course further west to inaugurate an immense engineering work out that way he had consented to halt halfanhour or so in the town and to receive an address from the corporation of casterbridge which as a representative centre of husbandry wished thus to express its sense of the great services he had rendered to agricultural science and economics by his zealous promotion of designs for placing the art of farming on a more scientific footing  royalty had not been seen in casterbridge since the days of the third king george and then only by candlelight for a few minutes when that monarch on a nightjourney had stopped to change horses at the kings arms the inhabitants therefore decided to make a thorough fete carillonee of the unwonted occasion halfanhours pause was not long it is true but much might be done in it by a judicious grouping of incidents above all if the weather were fine  the address was prepared on parchment by an artist who was handy at ornamental lettering and was laid on with the best goldleaf and colours that the signpainter had in his shop the council had met on the tuesday before the appointed day to arrange the details of the procedure while they were sitting the door of the council chamber standing open they heard a heavy footstep coming up the stairs it advanced along the passage and henchard entered the room in clothes of frayed and threadbare shabbiness the very clothes which he had used to wear in the primal days when he had sat among them  i have a feeling he said advancing to the table and laying his hand upon the green cloth that i should like to join ye in this reception of our illustrious visitor i suppose i could walk with the rest  embarrassed glances were exchanged by the council and grower nearly ate the end of his quillpen off so gnawed he it during the silence farfrae the young mayor who by virtue of his office sat in the large chair intuitively caught the sense of the meeting and as spokesman was obliged to utter it glad as he would have been that the duty should have fallen to another tongue  i hardly see that it would be proper mr henchard said he the council are the council and as ye are no longer one of the body there would be an irregularity in the proceeding if ye were included why not others  i have a particular reason for wishing to assist at the ceremony  farfrae looked round i think i have expressed the feeling of the council he said  yes yes from dr bath lawyer long alderman tubber and several more  then i am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially  i am afraid so it is out of the question indeed but of course you can see the doings full well such as they are to be like the rest of the spectators  henchard did not reply to that very obvious suggestion and turning on his heel went away  it had been only a passing fancy of his but opposition crystallized it into a determination ill welcome his royal highness or nobody shall he went about saying i am not going to be sat upon by farfrae or any of the rest of the paltry crew you shall see  the eventful morning was bright a fullfaced sun confronting early windowgazers eastward and all perceived for they were practised in weatherlore that there was permanence in the glow visitors soon began to flock in from county houses villages remote copses and lonely uplands the latter in oiled boots and tilt bonnets to see the reception or if not to see it at any rate to be near it there was hardly a workman in the town who did not put a clean shirt on solomon longways christopher coney buzzford and the rest of that fraternity showed their sense of the occasion by advancing their customary eleven oclock pint to halfpast ten from which they found a difficulty in getting back to the proper hour for several days  henchard had determined to do no work that day he primed himself in the morning with a glass of rum and walking down the street met elizabethjane whom he had not seen for a week it was lucky he said to her my twentyone years had expired before this came on or i should never have had the nerve to carry it out  carry out what said she alarmed  this welcome i am going to give our royal visitor  she was perplexed shall we go and see it together she said  see it i have other fish to fry you see it it will be worth seeing  she could do nothing to elucidate this and decked herself out with a heavy heart as the appointed time drew near she got sight again of her stepfather she thought he was going to the three mariners but no he elbowed his way through the gay throng to the shop of woolfrey the draper she waited in the crowd without  in a few minutes he emerged wearing to her surprise a brilliant rosette while more surprising still in his hand he carried a flag of somewhat homely construction formed by tacking one of the small union jacks which abounded in the town today to the end of a deal wandprobably the roller from a piece of calico henchard rolled up his flag on the doorstep put it under his arm and went down the street  suddenly the taller members of the crowd turned their heads and the shorter stood on tiptoe it was said that the royal cortege approached the railway had stretched out an arm towards casterbridge at this time but had not reached it by several miles as yet so that the intervening distance as well as the remainder of the journey was to be traversed by road in the old fashion people thus waitedthe county families in their carriages the masses on footand watched the farstretching london highway to the ringing of bells and chatter of tongues  from the background elizabethjane watched the scene some seats had been arranged from which ladies could witness the spectacle and the front seat was occupied by lucetta the mayors wife just at present in the road under her eyes stood henchard she appeared so bright and pretty that as it seemed he was experiencing the momentary weakness of wishing for her notice but he was far from attractive to a womans eye ruled as that is so largely by the superficies of things he was not only a journeyman unable to appear as he formerly had appeared but he disdained to appear as well as he might everybody else from the mayor to the washerwoman shone in new vesture according to means but henchard had doggedly retained the fretted and weatherbeaten garments of bygone years  hence alas this occurred lucettas eyes slid over him to this side and to that without anchoring on his featuresas gaily dressed womens eyes will too often do on such occasions her manner signified quite plainly that she meant to know him in public no more  but she was never tired of watching donald as he stood in animated converse with his friends a few yards off wearing round his young neck the official gold chain with great square links like that round the royal unicorn every trifling emotion that her husband showed as he talked had its reflex on her face and lips which moved in little duplicates to his she was living his part rather than her own and cared for no ones situation but farfraes that day  at length a man stationed at the furthest turn of the high road namely on the second bridge of which mention has been made gave a signal and the corporation in their robes proceeded from the front of the town hall to the archway erected at the entrance to the town the carriages containing the royal visitor and his suite arrived at the spot in a cloud of dust a procession was formed and the whole came on to the town hall at a walking pace  this spot was the centre of interest there were a few clear yards in front of the royal carriage sanded and into this space a man stepped before any one could prevent him it was henchard he had unrolled his private flag and removing his hat he staggered to the side of the slowing vehicle waving the union jack to and fro with his left hand while he blandly held out his right to the illustrious personage  all the ladies said with bated breath o look there and lucetta was ready to faint elizabethjane peeped through the shoulders of those in front saw what it was and was terrified and then her interest in the spectacle as a strange phenomenon got the better of her fear  farfrae with mayoral authority immediately rose to the occasion he seized henchard by the shoulder dragged him back and told him roughly to be off henchards eyes met his and farfrae observed the fierce light in them despite his excitement and irritation for a moment henchard stood his ground rigidly then by an unaccountable impulse gave way and retired farfrae glanced to the ladies gallery and saw that his calphurnias cheek was pale  whyit is your husbands old patron said mrs blowbody a lady of the neighbourhood who sat beside lucetta  patron said donalds wife with quick indignation  do you say the man is an acquaintance of mr farfraes observed mrs bath the physicians wife a newcomer to the town through her recent marriage with the doctor  he works for my husband said lucetta  ohis that all they have been saying to me that it was through him your husband first got a footing in casterbridge what stories people will tell  they will indeed it was not so at all donalds genius would have enabled him to get a footing anywhere without anybodys help he would have been just the same if there had been no henchard in the world  it was partly lucettas ignorance of the circumstances of donalds arrival which led her to speak thus partly the sensation that everybody seemed bent on snubbing her at this triumphant time the incident had occupied but a few moments but it was necessarily witnessed by the royal personage who however with practised tact affected not to have noticed anything unusual he alighted the mayor advanced the address was read the illustrious personage replied then said a few words to farfrae and shook hands with lucetta as the mayors wife the ceremony occupied but a few minutes and the carriages rattled heavily as pharaohs chariots down corn street and out upon the budmouth road in continuation of the journey coastward  in the crowd stood coney buzzford and longways some difference between him now and when he zung at the dree mariners said the first tis wonderful how he could get a lady of her quality to go snacks wi en in such quick time  true yet how folk do worship fine clothes now theres a betterlooking woman than she that nobody notices at all because shes akin to that hontish fellow henchard  i could worship ye buzz for saying that remarked nance mockridge i do like to see the trimming pulled off such christmas candles i am quite unequal to the part of villain myself or id gie all my small silver to see that lady topperedand perhaps i shall soon she added significantly  thats not a noble passiont for a oman to keep up said longways  nance did not reply but every one knew what she meant the ideas diffused by the reading of lucettas letters at peters finger had condensed into a scandal which was spreading like a miasmatic fog through mixen lane and thence up the back streets of casterbridge  the mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection the frequenters of peters finger going off mixen lanewards where most of them lived while coney buzzford longways and that connection remained in the street  you know whats brewing down there i suppose said buzzford mysteriously to the others  coney looked at him not the skimmityride  buzzford nodded  i have my doubts if it will be carried out said longways if they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close  i heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago at all events  if i were sure ot id lay information said longways emphatically tis too rough a joke and apt to wake riots in towns we know that the scotchman is a right enough man and that his lady has been a right enough oman since she came here and if there was anything wrong about her afore thats their business not ours  coney reflected farfrae was still liked in the community but it must be owned that as the mayor and man of money engrossed with affairs and ambitions he had lost in the eyes of the poorer inhabitants something of that wondrous charm which he had had for them as a lighthearted penniless young man who sang ditties as readily as the birds in the trees hence the anxiety to keep him from annoyance showed not quite the ardour that would have animated it in former days  suppose we make inquiration into it christopher continued longways and if we find theres really anything in it drop a letter to them most concerned and advise em to keep out of the way  this course was decided on and the group separated buzzford saying to coney come my ancient friend lets move on theres nothing more to see here  these wellintentioned ones would have been surprised had they known how ripe the great jocular plot really was yes tonight jopp had said to the peters party at the corner of mixen lane as a windup to the royal visit the hit will be all the more pat by reason of their great elevation today  to him at least it was not a joke but a retaliation     38   the proceedings had been brieftoo briefto lucetta whom an intoxicating weltlust had fairly mastered but they had brought her a great triumph nevertheless the shake of the royal hand still lingered in her fingers and the chitchat she had overheard that her husband might possibly receive the honour of knighthood though idle to a degree seemed not the wildest vision stranger things had occurred to men so good and captivating as her scotchman was  after the collision with the mayor henchard had withdrawn behind the ladies stand and there he stood regarding with a stare of abstraction the spot on the lapel of his coat where farfraes hand had seized it he put his own hand there as if he could hardly realize such an outrage from one whom it had once been his wont to treat with ardent generosity while pausing in this halfstupefied state the conversation of lucetta with the other ladies reached his ears and he distinctly heard her deny himdeny that he had assisted donald that he was anything more than a common journeyman  he moved on homeward and met jopp in the archway to the bull stake so youve had a snub said jopp  and what if i have answered henchard sternly  why ive had one too so we are both under the same cold shade he briefly related his attempt to win lucettas intercession  henchard merely heard his story without taking it deeply in his own relation to farfrae and lucetta overshadowed all kindred ones he went on saying brokenly to himself she has supplicated to me in her time and now her tongue wont own me nor her eyes see me and hehow angry he looked he drove me back as if i were a bull breaking fence i took it like a lamb for i saw it could not be settled there he can rub brine on a green wound but he shall pay for it and she shall be sorry it must come to a tussleface to face and then well see how a coxcomb can front a man  without further reflection the fallen merchant bent on some wild purpose ate a hasty dinner and went forth to find farfrae after being injured by him as a rival and snubbed by him as a journeyman the crowning degradation had been reserved for this daythat he should be shaken at the collar by him as a vagabond in the face of the whole town  the crowds had dispersed but for the green arches which still stood as they were erected casterbridge life had resumed its ordinary shape henchard went down corn street till he came to farfraes house where he knocked and left a message that he would be glad to see his employer at the granaries as soon as he conveniently could come there having done this he proceeded round to the back and entered the yard  nobody was present for as he had been aware the labourers and carters were enjoying a halfholiday on account of the events of the morningthough the carters would have to return for a short time later on to feed and litter down the horses he had reached the granary steps and was about to ascend when he said to himself aloud im stronger than he  henchard returned to a shed where he selected a short piece of rope from several pieces that were lying about hitching one end of this to a nail he took the other in his right hand and turned himself bodily round while keeping his arm against his side by this contrivance he pinioned the arm effectively he now went up the ladders to the top floor of the cornstores  it was empty except of a few sacks and at the further end was the door often mentioned opening under the cathead and chain that hoisted the sacks he fixed the door open and looked over the sill there was a depth of thirty or forty feet to the ground here was the spot on which he had been standing with farfrae when elizabethjane had seen him lift his arm with many misgivings as to what the movement portended  he retired a few steps into the loft and waited from this elevated perch his eyes could sweep the roofs round about the upper parts of the luxurious chestnut trees now delicate in leaves of a weeks age and the drooping boughs of the lines farfraes garden and the green door leading therefrom in course of timehe could not say how longthat green door opened and farfrae came through he was dressed as if for a journey the low light of the nearing evening caught his head and face when he emerged from the shadow of the wall warming them to a complexion of flamecolour henchard watched him with his mouth firmly set the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being unduly marked  farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket and humming a tune in a way which told that the words were most in his mind they were those of the song he had sung when he arrived years before at the three mariners a poor young man adventuring for life and fortune and scarcely knowing witherward            and heres a hand my trusty fiere              and gies a hand o thine  nothing moved henchard like an old melody he sank back no i cant do it he gasped why does the infernal fool begin that now  at length farfrae was silent and henchard looked out of the loft door will ye come up here he said  ay man said farfrae i couldnt see ye whats wrang  a minute later henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder he heard him land on the first floor ascend and land on the second begin the ascent to the third and then his head rose through the trap behind  what are you doing up here at this time he asked coming forward why didnt ye take your holiday like the rest of the men he spoke in a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon and his conviction that henchard had been drinking  henchard said nothing but going back he closed the stair hatchway and stamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame he next turned to the wondering young man who by this time observed that one of henchards arms was bound to his side  now said henchard quietly we stand face to faceman and man your money and your fine wife no longer lift ee above me as they did but now and my poverty does not press me down  what does it all mean asked farfrae simply  wait a bit my lad you should ha thought twice before you affronted to extremes a man who had nothing to lose ive stood your rivalry which ruined me and your snubbing which humbled me but your hustling that disgraced me i wont stand  farfrae warmed a little at this yed no business there he said  as much as any one among ye what you forward stripling tell a man of my age hed no business there the angervein swelled in his forehead as he spoke  you insulted royalty henchard and twas my duty as the chief magistrate to stop you  royalty be damned said henchard i am as loyal as you come to that  i am not here to argue wait till you cool doon wait till you cool and you will see things the same way as i do  you may be the one to cool first said henchard grimly now this is the case here be we in this foursquare loft to finish out that little wrestle you began this morning theres the door forty foot above ground one of us two puts the other out by that doorthe master stays inside if he likes he may go down afterwards and give the alarm that the other has fallen out by accidentor he may tell the truththats his business as the strongest man ive tied one arm to take no advantage of ee dye understand then heres at ee  there was no time for farfrae to do aught but one thing to close with henchard for the latter had come on at once it was a wrestling match the object of each being to give his antagonist a back fall and on henchards part unquestionably that it should be through the door  at the outset henchards hold by his only free hand the right was on the left side of farfraes collar which he firmly grappled the latter holding henchard by his collar with the contrary hand with his right he endeavoured to get hold of his antagonists left arm which however he could not do so adroitly did henchard keep it in the rear as he gazed upon the lowered eyes of his fair and slim antagonist  henchard planted the first toe forward farfrae crossing him with his and thus far the struggle had very much the appearance of the ordinary wrestling of those parts several minutes were passed by them in this attitude the pair rocking and writhing like trees in a gale both preserving an absolute silence by this time their breathing could be heard then farfrae tried to get hold of the other side of henchards collar which was resisted by the larger man exerting all his force in a wrenching movement and this part of the struggle ended by his forcing farfrae down on his knees by sheer pressure of one of his muscular arms hampered as he was however he could not keep him there and farfrae finding his feet again the struggle proceeded as before  by a whirl henchard brought donald dangerously near the precipice seeing his position the scotchman for the first time locked himself to his adversary and all the efforts of that infuriated prince of darknessas he might have been called from his appearance just nowwere inadequate to lift or loosen farfrae for a time by an extraordinary effort he succeeded at last though not until they had got far back again from the fatal door in doing so henchard contrived to turn farfrae a complete somersault had henchards other arm been free it would have been all over with farfrae then but again he regained his feet wrenching henchards arm considerably and causing him sharp pain as could be seen from the twitching of his face he instantly delivered the younger man an annihilating turn by the left forehip as it used to be expressed and following up his advantage thrust him towards the door never loosening his hold till farfraes fair head was hanging over the windowsill and his arm dangling down outside the wall  now said henchard between his gasps this is the end of what you began this morning your life is in my hands  then take it take it said farfrae yeve wished to long enough  henchard looked down upon him in silence and their eyes met o farfraethats not true he said bitterly god is my witness that no man ever loved another as i did thee at one timeand nowthough i came here to kill ee i cannot hurt thee go and give me in chargedo what you willi care nothing for what comes of me  he withdrew to the back part of the loft loosened his arm and flung himself in a corner upon some sacks in the abandonment of remorse farfrae regarded him in silence then went to the hatch and descended through it henchard would fain have recalled him but his tongue failed in its task and the young mans steps died on his ear  henchard took his full measure of shame and selfreproach the scenes of his first acquaintance with farfrae rushed back upon himthat time when the curious mixture of romance and thrift in the young mans composition so commanded his heart that farfrae could play upon him as on an instrument so thoroughly subdued was he that he remained on the sacks in a crouching attitude unusual for a man and for such a man its womanliness sat tragically on the figure of so stern a piece of virility he heard a conversation below the opening of the coachhouse door and the putting in of a horse but took no notice  here he stayed till the thin shades thickened to opaque obscurity and the loftdoor became an oblong of gray lightthe only visible shape around at length he arose shook the dust from his clothes wearily felt his way to the hatch and gropingly descended the steps till he stood in the yard  he thought highly of me once he murmured now hell hate me and despise me for ever  he became possessed by an overpowering wish to see farfrae again that night and by some desperate pleading to attempt the wellnigh impossible task of winning pardon for his late mad attack but as he walked towards farfraes door he recalled the unheeded doings in the yard while he had lain above in a sort of stupor farfrae he remembered had gone to the stable and put the horse into the gig while doing so whittle had brought him a letter farfrae had then said that he would not go towards budmouth as he had intendedthat he was unexpectedly summoned to weatherbury and meant to call at mellstock on his way thither that place lying but one or two miles out of his course  he must have come prepared for a journey when he first arrived in the yard unsuspecting enmity and he must have driven off though in a changed direction without saying a word to any one on what had occurred between themselves  it would therefore be useless to call at farfraes house till very late  there was no help for it but to wait till his return though waiting was almost torture to his restless and selfaccusing soul he walked about the streets and outskirts of the town lingering here and there till he reached the stone bridge of which mention has been made an accustomed haltingplace with him now here he spent a long time the purl of waters through the weirs meeting his ear and the casterbridge lights glimmering at no great distance off  while leaning thus upon the parapet his listless attention was awakened by sounds of an unaccustomed kind from the town quarter they were a confusion of rhythmical noises to which the streets added yet more confusion by encumbering them with echoes his first incurious thought that the clangour arose from the town band engaged in an attempt to round off a memorable day in a burst of evening harmony was contradicted by certain peculiarities of reverberation but inexplicability did not rouse him to more than a cursory heed his sense of degradation was too strong for the admission of foreign ideas and he leant against the parapet as before     39   when farfrae descended out of the loft breathless from his encounter with henchard he paused at the bottom to recover himself he arrived at the yard with the intention of putting the horse into the gig himself all the men having a holiday and driving to a village on the budmouth road despite the fearful struggle he decided still to persevere in his journey so as to recover himself before going indoors and meeting the eyes of lucetta he wished to consider his course in a case so serious  when he was just on the point of driving off whittle arrived with a note badly addressed and bearing the word immediate upon the outside on opening it he was surprised to see that it was unsigned it contained a brief request that he would go to weatherbury that evening about some business which he was conducting there farfrae knew nothing that could make it pressing but as he was bent upon going out he yielded to the anonymous request particularly as he had a call to make at mellstock which could be included in the same tour thereupon he told whittle of his change of direction in words which henchard had overheard and set out on his way farfrae had not directed his man to take the message indoors and whittle had not been supposed to do so on his own responsibility  now the anonymous letter was a wellintentioned but clumsy contrivance of longways and other of farfraes men to get him out of the way for the evening in order that the satirical mummery should fall flat if it were attempted by giving open information they would have brought down upon their heads the vengeance of those among their comrades who enjoyed these boisterous old games and therefore the plan of sending a letter recommended itself by its indirectness  for poor lucetta they took no protective measure believing with the majority there was some truth in the scandal which she would have to bear as she best might  it was about eight oclock and lucetta was sitting in the drawingroom alone night had set in for more than half an hour but she had not had the candles lighted for when farfrae was away she preferred waiting for him by the firelight and if it were not too cold keeping one of the windowsashes a little way open that the sound of his wheels might reach her ears early she was leaning back in the chair in a more hopeful mood than she had enjoyed since her marriage the day had been such a success and the temporary uneasiness which henchards show of effrontery had wrought in her disappeared with the quiet disappearance of henchard himself under her husbands reproof the floating evidences of her absurd passion for him and its consequences had been destroyed and she really seemed to have no cause for fear  the reverie in which these and other subjects mingled was disturbed by a hubbub in the distance that increased moment by moment it did not greatly surprise her the afternoon having been given up to recreation by a majority of the populace since the passage of the royal equipages but her attention was at once riveted to the matter by the voice of a maidservant next door who spoke from an upper window across the street to some other maid even more elevated than she  which way be they going now inquired the first with interest  i cant be sure for a moment said the second because of the malters chimbley o yesi can see em well i declare i declare  what what from the first more enthusiastically  they are coming up corn street after all they sit back to back  whattwo of emare there two figures  yes two images on a donkey back to back their elbows tied to one anothers shes facing the head and hes facing the tail  is it meant for anybody in particular  wellit mid be the man has got on a blue coat and kerseymere leggings he has black whiskers and a reddish face tis a stuffed figure with a falseface  the din was increasing nowthen it lessened a little  therei shant see after all cried the disappointed first maid  they have gone into a back streetthats all said the one who occupied the enviable position in the attic therenow i have got em all endways nicely  whats the woman like just say and i can tell in a moment if tis meant for one ive in mind  mywhytis dressed just as she dressed when she sat in the front seat at the time the playactors came to the town hall  lucetta started to her feet and almost at the instant the door of the room was quickly and softly opened elizabethjane advanced into the firelight  i have come to see you she said breathlessly i did not stop to knockforgive me i see you have not shut your shutters and the window is open  without waiting for lucettas reply she crossed quickly to the window and pulled out one of the shutters lucetta glided to her side let it behush she said perempority in a dry voice while she seized elizabethjane by the hand and held up her finger their intercourse had been so low and hurried that not a word had been lost of the conversation without which had thus proceeded  her neck is uncovered and her hair in bands and her backcomb in place shes got on a puce silk and white stockings and coloured shoes  again elizabethjane attempted to close the window but lucetta held her by main force  tis me she said with a face pale as death a processiona scandalan effigy of me and him  the look of elizabeth betrayed that the latter knew it already  let us shut it out coaxed elizabethjane noting that the rigid wildness of lucettas features was growing yet more rigid and wild with the meaning of the noise and laughter let us shut it out  it is of no use she shrieked he will see it wont he donald will see it he is just coming homeand it will break his hearthe will never love me any moreand o it will kill mekill me  elizabethjane was frantic now o cant something be done to stop it she cried is there nobody to do itnot one  she relinquished lucettas hands and ran to the door lucetta herself saying recklessly i will see it turned to the window threw up the sash and went out upon the balcony elizabeth immediately followed and put her arm round her to pull her in lucettas eyes were straight upon the spectacle of the uncanny revel now dancing rapidly the numerous lights round the two effigies threw them up into lurid distinctness it was impossible to mistake the pair for other than the intended victims  come in come in implored elizabeth and let me shut the window  shes meshes meeven to the parasolmy green parasol cried lucetta with a wild laugh as she stepped in she stood motionless for one secondthen fell heavily to the floor  almost at the instant of her fall the rude music of the skimmington ceased the roars of sarcastic laughter went off in ripples and the trampling died out like the rustle of a spent wind elizabeth was only indirectly conscious of this she had rung the bell and was bending over lucetta who remained convulsed on the carpet in the paroxysms of an epileptic seizure she rang again and again in vain the probability being that the servants had all run out of the house to see more of the daemonic sabbath than they could see within  at last farfraes man who had been agape on the doorstep came up then the cook the shutters hastily pushed to by elizabeth were quite closed a light was obtained lucetta carried to her room and the man sent off for a doctor while elizabeth was undressing her she recovered consciousness but as soon as she remembered what had passed the fit returned  the doctor arrived with unhopedfor promptitude he had been standing at his door like others wondering what the uproar meant as soon as he saw the unhappy sufferer he said in answer to elizabeths mute appeal this is serious  it is a fit elizabeth said  yes but a fit in the present state of her health means mischief you must send at once for mr farfrae where is he  he has driven into the country sir said the parlourmaid to some place on the budmouth road hes likely to be back soon  never mind he must be sent for in case he should not hurry the doctor returned to the bedside again the man was despatched and they soon heard him clattering out of the yard at the back  meanwhile mr benjamin grower that prominent burgess of whom mention has been already made hearing the din of cleavers tongs tambourines kits crouds humstrums serpents ramshorns and other historical kinds of music as he sat indoors in the high street had put on his hat and gone out to learn the cause he came to the corner above farfraes and soon guessed the nature of the proceedings for being a native of the town he had witnessed such rough jests before his first move was to search hither and thither for the constables there were two in the town shrivelled men whom he ultimately found in hiding up an alley yet more shrivelled than usual having some not ungrounded fears that they might be roughly handled if seen  what can we two poor lammigers do against such a multitude expostulated stubberd in answer to mr growers chiding tis tempting em to commit felodese upon us and that would be the death of the perpetrator and we wouldnt be the cause of a fellowcreatures death on no account not we  get some help then here ill come with you well see what a few words of authority can do quick now have you got your staves  we didnt want the folk to notice us as law officers being so shorthanded sir so we pushed our goverment staves up this waterpipe  out with em and come along for heavens sake ah heres mr blowbody thats lucky blowbody was the third of the three borough magistrates  well whats the row said blowbody got their nameshey  no now said grower to one of the constables you go with mr blowbody round by the old walk and come up the street and ill go with stubberd straight forward by this plan we shall have em between us get their names only no attack or interruption  thus they started but as stubberd with mr grower advanced into corn street whence the sounds had proceeded they were surprised that no procession could be seen they passed farfraes and looked to the end of the street the lamp flames waved the walk trees soughed a few loungers stood about with their hands in their pockets everything was as usual  have you seen a motley crowd making a disturbance grower said magisterially to one of these in a fustian jacket who smoked a short pipe and wore straps round his knees  beg yer pardon sir blandly said the person addressed who was no other than charl of peters finger mr grower repeated the words  charl shook his head to the zero of childlike ignorance no we havent seen anything have we joe and you was here afore i  joseph was quite as blank as the other in his reply  hmthats odd said mr grower ahheres a respectable man coming that i know by sight have you he inquired addressing the nearing shape of jopp have you seen any gang of fellows making a devil of a noiseskimmington riding or something of the sort  o nonothing sir jopp replied as if receiving the most singular news but ive not been far tonight so perhaps  oh twas herejust here said the magistrate  now ive noticed come to think ot that the wind in the walk trees makes a peculiar poeticallike murmur tonight sir more than common so perhaps twas that jopp suggested as he rearranged his hand in his greatcoat pocket where it ingeniously supported a pair of kitchen tongs and a cows horn thrust up under his waistcoat  no no nodye think im a fool constable come this way they must have gone into the back street  neither in back street nor in front street however could the disturbers be perceived and blowbody and the second constable who came up at this time brought similar intelligence effigies donkey lanterns band all had disappeared like the crew of comus  now said mr grower theres only one thing more we can do get ye halfadozen helpers and go in a body to mixen lane and into peters finger im much mistaken if you dont find a clue to the perpetrators there  the rustyjointed executors of the law mustered assistance as soon as they could and the whole party marched off to the lane of notoriety it was no rapid matter to get there at night not a lamp or glimmer of any sort offering itself to light the way except an occasional pale radiance through some windowcurtain or through the chink of some door which could not be closed because of the smoky chimney within at last they entered the inn boldly by the till then bolted frontdoor after a prolonged knocking of loudness commensurate with the importance of their standing  in the settles of the large room guyed to the ceiling by cords as usual for stability an ordinary group sat drinking and smoking with statuesque quiet of demeanour the landlady looked mildly at the invaders saying in honest accents good evening gentlemen theres plenty of room i hope theres nothing amiss  they looked round the room surely said stubberd to one of the men i saw you by now in corn streetmr grower spoke to ee  the man who was charl shook his head absently ive been here this last hour haint i nance he said to the woman who meditatively sipped her ale near him  faith that you have i came in for my quiet suppertime halfpint and you were here then as well as all the rest  the other constable was facing the clockcase where he saw reflected in the glass a quick motion by the landlady turning sharply he caught her closing the ovendoor  something curious about that oven maam he observed advancing opening it and drawing out a tambourine  ah she said apologetically thats what we keep here to use when theres a little quiet dancing you see damp weather spoils it so i put it there to keep it dry  the constable nodded knowingly but what he knew was nothing nohow could anything be elicited from this mute and inoffensive assembly in a few minutes the investigators went out and joining those of their auxiliaries who had been left at the door they pursued their way elsewhither     40   long before this time henchard weary of his ruminations on the bridge had repaired towards the town when he stood at the bottom of the street a procession burst upon his view in the act of turning out of an alley just above him the lanterns horns and multitude startled him he saw the mounted images and knew what it all meant  they crossed the way entered another street and disappeared he turned back a few steps and was lost in grave reflection finally wending his way homeward by the obscure riverside path unable to rest there he went to his stepdaughters lodging and was told that elizabethjane had gone to mr farfraes like one acting in obedience to a charm and with a nameless apprehension he followed in the same direction in the hope of meeting her the roysterers having vanished disappointed in this he gave the gentlest of pulls to the doorbell and then learnt particulars of what had occurred together with the doctors imperative orders that farfrae should be brought home and how they had set out to meet him on the budmouth road  but he has gone to mellstock and weatherbury exclaimed henchard now unspeakably grieved not budmouth way at all  but alas for henchard he had lost his good name they would not believe him taking his words but as the frothy utterances of recklessness though lucettas life seemed at that moment to depend upon her husbands return she being in great mental agony lest he should never know the unexaggerated truth of her past relations with henchard no messenger was despatched towards weatherbury henchard in a state of bitter anxiety and contrition determined to seek farfrae himself  to this end he hastened down the town ran along the eastern road over durnover moor up the hill beyond and thus onward in the moderate darkness of this spring night till he had reached a second and almost a third hill about three miles distant in yalbury bottom or plain at the foot of the hill he listened at first nothing beyond his own heartthrobs was to be heard but the slow wind making its moan among the masses of spruce and larch of yalbury wood which clothed the heights on either hand but presently there came the sound of light wheels whetting their felloes against the newly stoned patches of road accompanied by the distant glimmer of lights  he knew it was farfraes gig descending the hill from an indescribable personality in its noise the vehicle having been his own till bought by the scotchman at the sale of his effects henchard thereupon retraced his steps along yalbury plain the gig coming up with him as its driver slackened speed between two plantations  it was a point in the highway near which the road to mellstock branched off from the homeward direction by diverging to that village as he had intended to do farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours it soon appeared that his intention was to do so still the light swerving towards cuckoo lane the byroad aforesaid farfraes off giglamp flashed in henchards face at the same time farfrae discerned his late antagonist  farfraemr farfrae cried the breathless henchard holding up his hand  farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up he then drew rein and said yes over his shoulder as one would towards a pronounced enemy  come back to casterbridge at once henchard said theres something wrong at your houserequiring your return ive run all the way here on purpose to tell ye  farfrae was silent and at his silence henchards soul sank within him why had he not before this thought of what was only too obvious he who four hours earlier had enticed farfrae into a deadly wrestle stood now in the darkness of late nighttime on a lonely road inviting him to come a particular way where an assailant might have confederates instead of going his purposed way where there might be a better opportunity of guarding himself from attack henchard could almost feel this view of things in course of passage through farfraes mind  i have to go to mellstock said farfrae coldly as he loosened his reins to move on  but implored henchard the matter is more serious than your business at mellstock it isyour wife she is ill i can tell you particulars as we go along  the very agitation and abruptness of henchard increased farfraes suspicion that this was a ruse to decoy him on to the next wood where might be effectually compassed what from policy or want of nerve henchard had failed to do earlier in the day he started the horse  i know what you think deprecated henchard running after almost bowed down with despair as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy that he assumed in his former friends eyes but i am not what you think he cried hoarsely believe me farfrae i have come entirely on your own and your wifes account she is in danger i know no more and they want you to come your man has gone the other way in a mistake o farfrae dont mistrust mei am a wretched man but my heart is true to you still  farfrae however did distrust him utterly he knew his wife was with child but he had left her not long ago in perfect health and henchards treachery was more credible than his story he had in his time heard bitter ironies from henchards lips and there might be ironies now he quickened the horses pace and had soon risen into the high country lying between there and mellstock henchards spasmodic run after him lending yet more substance to his thought of evil purposes  the gig and its driver lessened against the sky in henchards eyes his exertions for farfraes good had been in vain over this repentant sinner at least there was to be no joy in heaven he cursed himself like a less scrupulous job as a vehement man will do when he loses selfrespect the last mental prop under poverty to this he had come after a time of emotional darkness of which the adjoining woodland shade afforded inadequate illustration presently he began to walk back again along the way by which he had arrived farfrae should at all events have no reason for delay upon the road by seeing him there when he took his journey homeward later on  arriving at casterbridge henchard went again to farfraes house to make inquiries as soon as the door opened anxious faces confronted his from the staircase hall and landing and they all said in grievous disappointment oit is not he the manservant finding his mistake had long since returned and all hopes had centred upon henchard  but havent you found him said the doctor  yesi cannot tell ee henchard replied as he sank down on a chair within the entrance he cant be home for two hours  hm said the surgeon returning upstairs  how is she asked henchard of elizabeth who formed one of the group  in great danger father her anxiety to see her husband makes her fearfully restless poor womani fear they have killed her  henchard regarded the sympathetic speaker for a few instants as if she struck him in a new light then without further remark went out of the door and onward to his lonely cottage so much for mans rivalry he thought death was to have the oyster and farfrae and himself the shells but about elizabethlane in the midst of his gloom she seemed to him as a pinpoint of light he had liked the look on her face as she answered him from the stairs there had been affection in it and above all things what he desired now was affection from anything that was good and pure she was not his own yet for the first time he had a faint dream that he might get to like her as his ownif she would only continue to love him  jopp was just going to bed when henchard got home as the latter entered the door jopp said this is rather bad about mrs farfraes illness  yes said henchard shortly though little dreaming of jopps complicity in the nights harlequinade and raising his eyes just sufficiently to observe that jopps face was lined with anxiety  somebody has called for you continued jopp when henchard was shutting himself into his own apartment a kind of traveller or seacaptain of some sort  ohwho could he be  he seemed a wellbedoing manhad grey hair and a broadish face but he gave no name and no message  nor do i gie him any attention and saying this henchard closed his door   the divergence to mellstock delayed farfraes return very nearly the two hours of henchards estimate among the other urgent reasons for his presence had been the need of his authority to send to budmouth for a second physician and when at length farfrae did come back he was in a state bordering on distraction at his misconception of henchards motives  a messenger was despatched to budmouth late as it had grown the night wore on and the other doctor came in the small hours lucetta had been much soothed by donalds arrival he seldom or never left her side and when immediately after his entry she had tried to lisp out to him the secret which so oppressed her he checked her feeble words lest talking should be dangerous assuring her there was plenty of time to tell him everything  up to this time he knew nothing of the skimmingtonride the dangerous illness and miscarriage of mrs farfrae was soon rumoured through the town and an apprehensive guess having been given as to its cause by the leaders in the exploit compunction and fear threw a dead silence over all particulars of their orgie while those immediately around lucetta would not venture to add to her husbands distress by alluding to the subject  what and how much farfraes wife ultimately explained to him of her past entanglement with henchard when they were alone in the solitude of that sad night cannot be told that she informed him of the bare facts of her peculiar intimacy with the cornmerchant became plain from farfraes own statements but in respect of her subsequent conducther motive in coming to casterbridge to unite herself with henchardher assumed justification in abandoning him when she discovered reasons for fearing him though in truth her inconsequent passion for another man at first sight had most to do with that abandonmenther method of reconciling to her conscience a marriage with the second when she was in a measure committed to the first to what extent she spoke of these things remained farfraes secret alone  besides the watchman who called the hours and weather in casterbridge that night there walked a figure up and down corn street hardly less frequently it was henchards whose retiring to rest had proved itself a futility as soon as attempted and he gave it up to go hither and thither and make inquiries about the patient every now and then he called as much on farfraes account as on lucettas and on elizabethjanes even more than on eithers shorn one by one of all other interests his life seemed centring on the personality of the stepdaughter whose presence but recently he could not endure to see her on each occasion of his inquiry at lucettas was a comfort to him  the last of his calls was made about four oclock in the morning in the steely light of dawn lucifer was fading into day across durnover moor the sparrows were just alighting into the street and the hens had begun to cackle from the outhouses when within a few yards of farfraes he saw the door gently opened and a servant raise her hand to the knocker to untie the piece of cloth which had muffled it he went across the sparrows in his way scarcely flying up from the roadlitter so little did they believe in human aggression at so early a time  why do you take off that said henchard  she turned in some surprise at his presence and did not answer for an instant or two recognizing him she said because they may knock as loud as they will she will never hear it any more     41   henchard went home the morning having now fully broke he lit his fire and sat abstractedly beside it he had not sat there long when a gentle footstep approached the house and entered the passage a finger tapping lightly at the door henchards face brightened for he knew the motions to be elizabeths she came into his room looking wan and sad  have you heard she asked mrs farfrae she isdead yes indeedabout an hour ago  i know it said henchard i have but lately come in from there it is so very good of ee elizabeth to come and tell me you must be so tired out too with sitting up now do you bide here with me this morning you can go and rest in the other room and i will call ee when breakfast is ready  to please him and herselffor his recent kindliness was winning a surprised gratitude from the lonely girlshe did as he bade her and lay down on a sort of couch which henchard had rigged up out of a settle in the adjoining room she could hear him moving about in his preparations but her mind ran most strongly on lucetta whose death in such fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was appallingly unexpected presently she fell asleep  meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in readiness but finding that she dozed he would not call her he waited on looking into the fire and keeping the kettle boiling with housewifely care as if it were an honour to have her in his house in truth a great change had come over him with regard to her and he was developing the dream of a future lit by her filial presence as though that way alone could happiness lie  he was disturbed by another knock at the door and rose to open it rather deprecating a call from anybody just then a stoutly built man stood on the doorstep with an alien unfamiliar air about his figure and bearingan air which might have been called colonial by people of cosmopolitan experience it was the man who had asked the way at peters finger henchard nodded and looked inquiry  good morning good morning said the stranger with profuse heartiness is it mr henchard i am talking to  my name is henchard  then ive caught ee at homethats right mornings the time for business says i can i have a few words with you  by all means henchard answered showing the way in  you may remember me said his visitor seating himself  henchard observed him indifferently and shook his head  wellperhaps you may not my name is newson  henchards face and eyes seemed to die the other did not notice it i know the name well henchard said at last looking on the floor  i make no doubt of that well the fact is ive been looking for ee this fortnight past i landed at havenpool and went through casterbridge on my way to falmouth and when i got there they told me you had some years before been living at casterbridge back came i again and by long and by late i got here by coach ten minutes ago he lives down by the mill says they so here i am nowthat transaction between us some twenty years agonetis that ive called about twas a curious business i was younger then than i am now and perhaps the less said about it in one sense the better  curious business twas worse than curious i cannot even allow that im the man you met then i was not in my senses and a mans senses are himself  we were young and thoughtless said newson however ive come to mend matters rather than open arguments poor susanhers was a strange experience  she was a warmhearted homespun woman she was not what they call shrewd or sharp at allbetter she had been  she was not  as you in all likelihood know she was simpleminded enough to think that the sale was in a way binding she was as guiltless o wrongdoing in that particular as a saint in the clouds  i know it i know it i found it out directly said henchard still with averted eyes there lay the sting ot to me if she had seen it as what it was she would never have left me never but how should she be expected to know what advantages had she none she could write her own name and no more  well it was not in my heart to undeceive her when the deed was done said the sailor of former days i thought and there was not much vanity in thinking it that she would be happier with me she was fairly happy and i never would have undeceived her till the day of her death your child died she had another and all went well but a time camemind me a time always does come a time cameit was some while after she and i and the child returned from americawhen somebody she had confided her history to told her my claim to her was a mockery and made a jest of her belief in my right after that she was never happy with me she pined and pined and socked and sighed she said she must leave me and then came the question of our child then a man advised me how to act and i did it for i thought it was best i left her at falmouth and went off to sea when i got to the other side of the atlantic there was a storm and it was supposed that a lot of us including myself had been washed overboard i got ashore at newfoundland and then i asked myself what i should do  since im here here ill bide i thought to myself twill be most kindness to her now shes taken against me to let her believe me lost for i thought while she supposes us both alive shell be miserable but if she thinks me dead shell go back to him and the child will have a home ive never returned to this country till a month ago and i found that as i supposed she went to you and my daughter with her they told me in falmouth that susan was dead but my elizabethjanewhere is she  dead likewise said henchard doggedly surely you learnt that too  the sailor started up and took an enervated pace or two down the room dead he said in a low voice then whats the use of my money to me  henchard without answering shook his head as if that were rather a question for newson himself than for him  where is she buried the traveller inquired  beside her mother said henchard in the same stolid tones  when did she die  a year ago and more replied the other without hesitation  the sailor continued standing henchard never looked up from the floor at last newson said my journey hither has been for nothing i may as well go as i came it has served me right ill trouble you no longer  henchard heard the retreating footsteps of newson upon the sanded floor the mechanical lifting of the latch the slow opening and closing of the door that was natural to a baulked or dejected man but he did not turn his head newsons shadow passed the window he was gone  then henchard scarcely believing the evidence of his senses rose from his seat amazed at what he had done it had been the impulse of a moment the regard he had lately acquired for elizabeth the newsprung hope of his loneliness that she would be to him a daughter of whom he could feel as proud as of the actual daughter she still believed herself to be had been stimulated by the unexpected coming of newson to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her so that the sudden prospect of her loss had caused him to speak mad lies like a child in pure mockery of consequences he had expected questions to close in round him and unmask his fabrication in five minutes yet such questioning had not come but surely they would come newsons departure could be but momentary he would learn all by inquiries in the town and return to curse him and carry his last treasure away  he hastily put on his hat and went out in the direction that newson had taken newsons back was soon visible up the road crossing bullstake henchard followed and saw his visitor stop at the kings arms where the morning coach which had brought him waited halfanhour for another coach which crossed there the coach newson had come by was now about to move again newson mounted his luggage was put in and in a few minutes the vehicle disappeared with him  he had not so much as turned his head it was an act of simple faith in henchards wordsfaith so simple as to be almost sublime the young sailor who had taken susan henchard on the spur of the moment and on the faith of a glance at her face more than twenty years before was still living and acting under the form of the grizzled traveller who had taken henchards words on trust so absolute as to shame him as he stood  was elizabethjane to remain his by virtue of this hardy invention of a moment perhaps not for long said he newson might converse with his fellowtravellers some of whom might be casterbridge people and the trick would be discovered  this probability threw henchard into a defensive attitude and instead of considering how best to right the wrong and acquaint elizabeths father with the truth at once he bethought himself of ways to keep the position he had accidentally won towards the young woman herself his affection grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his claim to her was exposed  he watched the distant highway expecting to see newson return on foot enlightened and indignant to claim his child but no figure appeared possibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach but buried his grief in his own heart  his griefwhat was it after all to that which he henchard would feel at the loss of her newsons affection cooled by years could not equal his who had been constantly in her presence and thus his jealous soul speciously argued to excuse the separation of father and child  he returned to the house half expecting that she would have vanished no there she wasjust coming out from the inner room the marks of sleep upon her eyelids and exhibiting a generally refreshed air  o father she said smiling i had no sooner lain down than i napped though i did not mean to i wonder i did not dream about poor mrs farfrae after thinking of her so but i did not how strange it is that we do not often dream of latest events absorbing as they may be  i am glad you have been able to sleep he said taking her hand with anxious proprietorshipan act which gave her a pleasant surprise  they sat down to breakfast and elizabethjanes thoughts reverted to lucetta their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had ever lain in its meditative soberness  father she said as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal it is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands and i idly asleep the while  i do it every day he replied you have left me everybody has left me how should i live but by my own hands  you are very lonely are you not  ay childto a degree that you know nothing of it is my own fault you are the only one who has been near me for weeks and you will come no more  why do you say that indeed i will if you would like to see me  henchard signified dubiousness though he had so lately hoped that elizabethjane might again live in his house as daughter he would not ask her to do so now newson might return at any moment and what elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her  when they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered till the moment arrived at which henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work then she arose and with assurance of coming again soon went up the hill in the morning sunlight  at this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking yet before the evening probably he will have come and then she will scorn me  this reflection constantly repeated by henchard to himself accompanied him everywhere through the day his mood was no longer that of the rebellious ironical reckless misadventurer but the leaden gloom of one who has lost all that can make life interesting or even tolerable there would remain nobody for him to be proud of nobody to fortify him for elizabethjane would soon be but as a stranger and worse susan farfrae lucetta elizabethall had gone from him one after one either by his fault or by his misfortune  in place of them he had no interest hobby or desire if he could have summoned music to his aid his existence might even now have been borne for with henchard music was of regal power the merest trumpet or organ tone was enough to move him and high harmonies transubstantiated him but hard fate had ordained that he should be unable to call up this divine spirit in his need  the whole land ahead of him was as darkness itself there was nothing to come nothing to wait for yet in the natural course of life he might possibly have to linger on earth another thirty or forty yearsscoffed at at best pitied  the thought of it was unendurable  to the east of casterbridge lay moors and meadows through which much water flowed the wanderer in this direction who should stand still for a few moments on a quiet night might hear singular symphonies from these waters as from a lampless orchestra all playing in their sundry tones from near and far parts of the moor at a hole in a rotten weir they executed a recitative where a tributary brook fell over a stone breastwork they trilled cheerily under an arch they performed a metallic cymballing and at durnover hole they hissed the spot at which their instrumentation rose loudest was a place called ten hatches whence during high springs there proceeded a very fugue of sounds  the river here was deep and strong at all times and the hatches on this account were raised and lowered by cogs and a winch a patch led from the second bridge over the highway so often mentioned to these hatches crossing the stream at their head by a narrow plankbridge but after nightfall human beings were seldom found going that way the path leading only to a deep reach of the stream called blackwater and the passage being dangerous  henchard however leaving the town by the east road proceeded to the second or stone bridge and thence struck into this path of solitude following its course beside the stream till the dark shapes of the ten hatches cut the sheen thrown upon the river by the weak lustre that still lingered in the west in a second or two he stood beside the weirhole where the water was at its deepest he looked backwards and forwards and no creature appeared in view he then took off his coat and hat and stood on the brink of the stream with his hands clasped in front of him  while his eyes were bent on the water beneath there slowly became visible a something floating in the circular pool formed by the wash of centuries the pool he was intending to make his deathbed at first it was indistinct by reason of the shadow from the bank but it emerged thence and took shape which was that of a human body lying stiff and stark upon the surface of the stream  in the circular current imparted by the central flow the form was brought forward till it passed under his eyes and then he perceived with a sense of horror that it was himself not a man somewhat resembling him but one in all respects his counterpart his actual double was floating as if dead in ten hatches hole  the sense of the supernatural was strong in this unhappy man and he turned away as one might have done in the actual presence of an appalling miracle he covered his eyes and bowed his head without looking again into the stream he took his coat and hat and went slowly away  presently he found himself by the door of his own dwelling to his surprise elizabethjane was standing there she came forward spoke called him father just as before newson then had not even yet returned  i thought you seemed very sad this morning she said so i have come again to see you not that i am anything but sad myself but everybody and everything seem against you so and i know you must be suffering  how this woman divined things yet she had not divined their whole extremity  he said to her are miracles still worked do ye think elizabeth i am not a read man i dont know so much as i could wish i have tried to peruse and learn all my life but the more i try to know the more ignorant i seem  i dont quite think there are any miracles nowadays she said  no interference in the case of desperate intentions for instance well perhaps not in a direct way perhaps not but will you come and walk with me and i will show ee what i mean  she agreed willingly and he took her over the highway and by the lonely path to ten hatches he walked restlessly as if some haunting shade unseen of her hovered round him and troubled his glance she would gladly have talked of lucetta but feared to disturb him when they got near the weir he stood still and asked her to go forward and look into the pool and tell him what she saw  she went and soon returned to him nothing she said  go again said henchard and look narrowly  she proceeded to the river brink a second time on her return after some delay she told him that she saw something floating round and round there but what it was she could not discern it seemed to be a bundle of old clothes  are they like mine asked henchard  wellthey are dear mei wonder iffather let us go away  go and look once more and then we will get home  she went back and he could see her stoop till her head was close to the margin of the pool she started up and hastened back to his side  well said henchard what do you say now  let us go home  but tell medowhat is it floating there  the effigy she answered hastily they must have thrown it into the river higher up amongst the willows at blackwater to get rid of it in their alarm at discovery by the magistrates and it must have floated down here  ahto be surethe image o me but where is the other why that one only that performance of theirs killed her but kept me alive  elizabethjane thought and thought of these words kept me alive as they slowly retraced their way to the town and at length guessed their meaning fatheri will not leave you alone like this she cried may i live with you and tend upon you as i used to do i do not mind your being poor i would have agreed to come this morning but you did not ask me  may you come to me he cried bitterly elizabeth dont mock me if you only would come  i will said she  how will you forgive all my roughness in former days you cannot  i have forgotten it talk of that no more  thus she assured him and arranged their plans for reunion and at length each went home then henchard shaved for the first time during many days and put on clean linen and combed his hair and was as a man resuscitated thenceforward  the next morning the fact turned out to be as elizabethjane had stated the effigy was discovered by a cowherd and that of lucetta a little higher up in the same stream but as little as possible was said of the matter and the figures were privately destroyed  despite this natural solution of the mystery henchard no less regarded it as an intervention that the figure should have been floating there elizabethjane heard him say who is such a reprobate as i and yet it seems that even i be in somebodys hand     42   but the emotional conviction that he was in somebodys hand began to die out of henchards breast as time slowly removed into distance the event which had given that feeling birth the apparition of newson haunted him he would surely return  yet newson did not arrive lucetta had been borne along the churchyard path casterbridge had for the last time turned its regard upon her before proceeding to its work as if she had never lived but elizabeth remained undisturbed in the belief of her relationship to henchard and now shared his home perhaps after all newson was gone for ever  in due time the bereaved farfrae had learnt the at least proximate cause of lucettas illness and death and his first impulse was naturally enough to wreak vengeance in the name of the law upon the perpetrators of the mischief he resolved to wait till the funeral was over ere he moved in the matter the time having come he reflected disastrous as the result had been it was obviously in no way foreseen or intended by the thoughtless crew who arranged the motley procession the tempting prospect of putting to the blush people who stand at the head of affairsthat supreme and piquant enjoyment of those who writhe under the heel of the samehad alone animated them so far as he could see for he knew nothing of jopps incitements other considerations were also involved lucetta had confessed everything to him before her death and it was not altogether desirable to make much ado about her history alike for her sake for henchards and for his own to regard the event as an untoward accident seemed to farfrae truest consideration for the dead ones memory as well as best philosophy  henchard and himself mutually forbore to meet for elizabeths sake the former had fettered his pride sufficiently to accept the small seed and root business which some of the town council headed by farfrae had purchased to afford him a new opening had he been only personally concerned henchard without doubt would have declined assistance even remotely brought about by the man whom he had so fiercely assailed but the sympathy of the girl seemed necessary to his very existence and on her account pride itself wore the garments of humility  here they settled themselves and on each day of their lives henchard anticipated her every wish with a watchfulness in which paternal regard was heightened by a burning jealous dread of rivalry yet that newson would ever now return to casterbridge to claim her as a daughter there was little reason to suppose he was a wanderer and a stranger almost an alien he had not seen his daughter for several years his affection for her could not in the nature of things be keen other interests would probably soon obscure his recollections of her and prevent any such renewal of inquiry into the past as would lead to a discovery that she was still a creature of the present to satisfy his conscience somewhat henchard repeated to himself that the lie which had retained for him the coveted treasure had not been deliberately told to that end but had come from him as the last defiant word of a despair which took no thought of consequences furthermore he pleaded within himself that no newson could love her as he loved her or would tend her to his lifes extremity as he was prepared to do cheerfully  thus they lived on in the shop overlooking the churchyard and nothing occurred to mark their days during the remainder of the year going out but seldom and never on a marketday they saw donald farfrae only at rarest intervals and then mostly as a transitory object in the distance of the street yet he was pursuing his ordinary avocations smiling mechanically to fellowtradesmen and arguing with bargainersas bereaved men do after a while  time in his own grey style taught farfrae how to estimate his experience of lucettaall that it was and all that it was not there are men whose hearts insist upon a dogged fidelity to some image or cause thrown by chance into their keeping long after their judgment has pronounced it no rarityeven the reverse indeed and without them the band of the worthy is incomplete but farfrae was not of those it was inevitable that the insight briskness and rapidity of his nature should take him out of the dead blank which his loss threw about him he could not but perceive that by the death of lucetta he had exchanged a looming misery for a simple sorrow after that revelation of her history which must have come sooner or later in any circumstances it was hard to believe that life with her would have been productive of further happiness  but as a memory nothwithstanding such conditions lucettas image still lived on with him her weaknesses provoking only the gentlest criticism and her sufferings attenuating wrath at her concealments to a momentary spark now and then  by the end of a year henchards little retail seed and grain shop not much larger than a cupboard had developed its trade considerably and the stepfather and daughter enjoyed much serenity in the pleasant sunny corner in which it stood the quiet bearing of one who brimmed with an inner activity characterized elizabethjane at this period she took long walks into the country two or three times a week mostly in the direction of budmouth sometimes it occurred to him that when she sat with him in the evening after those invigorating walks she was civil rather than affectionate and he was troubled one more bitter regret being added to those he had already experienced at having by his severe censorship frozen up her precious affection when originally offered  she had her own way in everything now in going and coming in buying and selling her word was law  you have got a new muff elizabeth he said to her one day quite humbly  yes i bought it she said  he looked at it again as it lay on an adjoining table the fur was of a glossy brown and though he was no judge of such articles he thought it seemed an unusually good one for her to possess  rather costly i suppose my dear was it not he hazarded  it was rather above my figure she said quietly but it is not showy  o no said the netted lion anxious not to pique her in the least  some little time after when the year had advanced into another spring he paused opposite her empty bedroom in passing it he thought of the time when she had cleared out of his then large and handsome house in corn street in consequence of his dislike and harshness and he had looked into her chamber in just the same way the present room was much humbler but what struck him about it was the abundance of books lying everywhere their number and quality made the meagre furniture that supported them seem absurdly disproportionate some indeed many must have been recently purchased and though he encouraged her to buy in reason he had no notion that she indulged her innate passion so extensively in proportion to the narrowness of their income for the first time he felt a little hurt by what he thought her extravagance and resolved to say a word to her about it but before he had found the courage to speak an event happened which set his thoughts flying in quite another direction  the busy time of the seed trade was over and the quiet weeks that preceded the hayseason had comesetting their special stamp upon casterbridge by thronging the market with wood rakes new waggons in yellow green and red formidable scythes and pitchforks of prong sufficient to skewer up a small family henchard contrary to his wont went out one saturday afternoon towards the marketplace from a curious feeling that he would like to pass a few minutes on the spot of his former triumphs farfrae to whom he was still a comparative stranger stood a few steps below the corn exchange doora usual position with him at this hourand he appeared lost in thought about something he was looking at a little way off  henchards eyes followed farfraes and he saw that the object of his gaze was no sampleshowing farmer but his own stepdaughter who had just come out of a shop over the way she on her part was quite unconscious of his attention and in this was less fortunate than those young women whose very plumes like those of junos bird are set with argus eyes whenever possible admirers are within ken  henchard went away thinking that perhaps there was nothing significant after all in farfraes look at elizabethjane at that juncture yet he could not forget that the scotchman had once shown a tender interest in her of a fleeting kind thereupon promptly came to the surface that idiosyncrasy of henchards which had ruled his courses from the beginning and had mainly made him what he was instead of thinking that a union between his cherished stepdaughter and the energetic thriving donald was a thing to be desired for her good and his own he hated the very possibility  time had been when such instinctive opposition would have taken shape in action but he was not now the henchard of former days he schooled himself to accept her will in this as in other matters as absolute and unquestionable he dreaded lest an antagonistic word should lose for him such regard as he had regained from her by his devotion feeling that to retain this under separation was better than to incur her dislike by keeping her near  but the mere thought of such separation fevered his spirit much and in the evening he said with the stillness of suspense have you seen mr farfrae today elizabeth  elizabethjane started at the question and it was with some confusion that she replied no  ohthats rightthats rightit was only that i saw him in the street when we both were there he was wondering if her embarrassment justified him in a new suspicionthat the long walks which she had latterly been taking that the new books which had so surprised him had anything to do with the young man she did not enlighten him and lest silence should allow her to shape thoughts unfavourable to their present friendly relations he diverted the discourse into another channel  henchard was by original make the last man to act stealthily for good or for evil but the solicitus timor of his lovethe dependence upon elizabeths regard into which he had declined or in another sense to which he had advanceddenaturalized him he would often weigh and consider for hours together the meaning of such and such a deed or phrase of hers when a blunt settling question would formerly have been his first instinct and now uneasy at the thought of a passion for farfrae which should entirely displace her mild filial sympathy with himself he observed her going and coming more narrowly  there was nothing secret in elizabethjanes movements beyond what habitual reserve induced and it may at once be owned on her account that she was guilty of occasional conversations with donald when they chanced to meet whatever the origin of her walks on the budmouth road her return from those walks was often coincident with farfraes emergence from corn street for a twenty minutes blow on that rather windy highwayjust to winnow the seeds and chaff out of him before sitting down to tea as he said henchard became aware of this by going to the ring and screened by its enclosure keeping his eye upon the road till he saw them meet his face assumed an expression of extreme anguish  of her too he means to rob me he whispered but he has the right i do not wish to interfere  the meeting in truth was of a very innocent kind and matters were by no means so far advanced between the young people as henchards jealous grief inferred could he have heard such conversation as passed he would have been enlightened thus much  heyou like walking this way miss henchardand is it not so uttered in his undulatory accents and with an appraising pondering gaze at her  sheo yes i have chosen this road latterly i have no great reason for it  hebut that may make a reason for others  she reddeningi dont know that my reason however such as it is is that i wish to get a glimpse of the sea every day  heis it a secret why  she  reluctantly yes  he with the pathos of one of his native balladsah i doubt there will be any good in secrets a secret cast a deep shadow over my life and well you know what it was  elizabeth admitted that she did but she refrained from confessing why the sea attracted her she could not herself account for it fully not knowing the secret possibly to be that in addition to early marine associations her blood was a sailors  thank you for those new books mr farfrae she added shyly i wonder if i ought to accept so many  ay why not it gives me more pleasure to get them for you than you to have them  it cannot  they proceeded along the road together till they reached the town and their paths diverged  henchard vowed that he would leave them to their own devices put nothing in the way of their courses whatever they might mean if he were doomed to be bereft of her so it must be in the situation which their marriage would create he could see no locus standi for himself at all farfrae would never recognize him more than superciliously his poverty ensured that no less than his past conduct and so elizabeth would grow to be a stranger to him and the end of his life would be friendless solitude  with such a possibility impending he could not help watchfulness indeed within certain lines he had the right to keep an eye upon her as his charge the meetings seemed to become matters of course with them on special days of the week  at last full proof was given him he was standing behind a wall close to the place at which farfrae encountered her he heard the young man address her as dearest elizabethjane and then kiss her the girl looking quickly round to assure herself that nobody was near  when they were gone their way henchard came out from the wall and mournfully followed them to casterbridge the chief looming trouble in this engagement had not decreased both farfrae and elizabethjane unlike the rest of the people must suppose elizabeth to be his actual daughter from his own assertion while he himself had the same belief and though farfrae must have so far forgiven him as to have no objection to own him as a fatherinlaw intimate they could never be thus would the girl who was his only friend be withdrawn from him by degrees through her husbands influence and learn to despise him  had she lost her heart to any other man in the world than the one he had rivalled cursed wrestled with for life in days before his spirit was broken henchard would have said i am content but content with the prospect as now depicted was hard to acquire  there is an outer chamber of the brain in which thoughts unowned unsolicited and of noxious kind are sometimes allowed to wander for a moment prior to being sent off whence they came one of these thoughts sailed into henchards ken now  suppose he were to communicate to farfrae the fact that his betrothed was not the child of michael henchard at alllegally nobodys child how would that correct and leading townsman receive the information he might possibly forsake elizabethjane and then she would be her stepsires own again  henchard shuddered and exclaimed god forbid such a thing why should i still be subject to these visitations of the devil when i try so hard to keep him away     43   what henchard saw thus early was naturally enough seen at a little later date by other people that mr farfrae walked with that bankrupt henchards stepdaughter of all women became a common topic in the town the simple perambulating term being used hereabout to signify a wooing and the nineteen superior young ladies of casterbridge who had each looked upon herself as the only woman capable of making the merchant councilman happy indignantly left off going to the church farfrae attended left off conscious mannerisms left off putting him in their prayers at night amongst their blood relations in short reverted to their normal courses  perhaps the only inhabitants of the town to whom this looming choice of the scotchmans gave unmixed satisfaction were the members of the philosophic party which included longways christopher coney billy wills mr buzzford and the like the three mariners having been years before the house in which they had witnessed the young man and womans first and humble appearance on the casterbridge stage they took a kindly interest in their career not unconnected perhaps with visions of festive treatment at their hands hereafter mrs stannidge having rolled into the large parlour one evening and said that it was a wonder such a man as mr farfrae a pillow of the town who might have chosen one of the daughters of the professional men or private residents should stoop so low coney ventured to disagree with her  no maam no wonder at all tis she thats a stooping to hethats my opinion a widow manwhose first wife was no credit to himwhat is it for a young perusing woman thats her own mistress and well liked but as a neat patching up of things i see much good in it when a man have put up a tomb of best marblestone to the other one as heve done and weeped his fill and thought it all over and said to hisself tother took me in i knowed this one first shes a sensible piece for a partner and theres no faithful woman in high life nowwell he may do worse than not to take her if shes tenderinclined  thus they talked at the mariners but we must guard against a too liberal use of the conventional declaration that a great sensation was caused by the prospective event that all the gossips tongues were set wagging thereby and soon even though such a declaration might lend some eclat to the career of our poor only heroine when all has been said about busy rumourers a superficial and temporary thing is the interest of anybody in affairs which do not directly touch them it would be a truer representation to say that casterbridge ever excepting the nineteen young ladies looked up for a moment at the news and withdrawing its attention went on labouring and victualling bringing up its children and burying its dead without caring a tittle for farfraes domestic plans  not a hint of the matter was thrown out to her stepfather by elizabeth herself or by farfrae either reasoning on the cause of their reticence he concluded that estimating him by his past the throbbing pair were afraid to broach the subject and looked upon him as an irksome obstacle whom they would be heartily glad to get out of the way embittered as he was against society this moody view of himself took deeper and deeper hold of henchard till the daily necessity of facing mankind and of them particularly elizabethjane became wellnigh more than he could endure his health declined he became morbidly sensitive he wished he could escape those who did not want him and hide his head for ever  but what if he were mistaken in his views and there were no necessity that his own absolute separation from her should be involved in the incident of her marriage  he proceeded to draw a picture of the alternativehimself living like a fangless lion about the back rooms of a house in which his stepdaughter was mistress an inoffensive old man tenderly smiled on by elizabeth and goodnaturedly tolerated by her husband it was terrible to his pride to think of descending so low and yet for the girls sake he might put up with anything even from farfrae even snubbings and masterful tonguescourgings the privilege of being in the house she occupied would almost outweigh the personal humiliation  whether this were a dim possibility or the reverse the courtshipwhich it evidently now washad an absorbing interest for him  elizabeth as has been said often took her walks on the budmouth road and farfrae as often made it convenient to create an accidental meeting with her there two miles out a quarter of a mile from the highway was the prehistoric fort called mai dun of huge dimensions and many ramparts within or upon whose enclosures a human being as seen from the road was but an insignificant speck hitherward henchard often resorted glass in hand and scanned the hedgeless viafor it was the original track laid out by the legions of the empireto a distance of two or three miles his object being to read the progress of affairs between farfrae and his charmer  one day henchard was at this spot when a masculine figure came along the road from budmouth and lingered applying his telescope to his eye henchard expected that farfraes features would be disclosed as usual but the lenses revealed that today the man was not elizabethjanes lover  it was one clothed as a merchant captain and as he turned in the scrutiny of the road he revealed his face henchard lived a lifetime the moment he saw it the face was newsons  henchard dropped the glass and for some seconds made no other movement newson waited and henchard waitedif that could be called a waiting which was a transfixture but elizabethjane did not come something or other had caused her to neglect her customary walk that day perhaps farfrae and she had chosen another road for varietys sake but what did that amount to she might be here tomorrow and in any case newson if bent on a private meeting and a revelation of the truth to her would soon make his opportunity  then he would tell her not only of his paternity but of the ruse by which he had been once sent away elizabeths strict nature would cause her for the first time to despise her stepfather would root out his image as that of an archdeceiver and newson would reign in her heart in his stead  but newson did not see anything of her that morning having stood still awhile he at last retraced his steps and henchard felt like a condemned man who has a few hours respite when he reached his own house he found her there  o father she said innocently i have had a lettera strange onenot signed somebody has asked me to meet him either on the budmouth road at noon today or in the evening at mr farfraes he says he came to see me some time ago but a trick was played him so that he did not see me i dont understand it but between you and me i think donald is at the bottom of the mystery and that it is a relation of his who wants to pass an opinion on his choice but i did not like to go till i had seen you shall i go  henchard replied heavily yes go  the question of his remaining in casterbridge was for ever disposed of by this closing in of newson on the scene henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart and being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence and haughty withal he resolved to make as light as he could of his intentions while immediately taking his measures  he surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this world by saying to her as if he did not care about her more i am going to leave casterbridge elizabethjane  leave casterbridge she cried and leaveme  yes this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both i dont care about shops and streets and folki would rather get into the country by myself out of sight and follow my own ways and leave you to yours  she looked down and her tears fell silently it seemed to her that this resolve of his had come on account of her attachment and its probable result she showed her devotion to farfrae however by mastering her emotion and speaking out  i am sorry you have decided on this she said with difficult firmness for i thought it probablepossiblethat i might marry mr farfrae some little time hence and i did not know that you disapproved of the step  i approve of anything you desire to do izzy said henchard huskily if i did not approve it would be no matter i wish to go away my presence might make things awkward in the future and in short it is best that i go  nothing that her affection could urge would induce him to reconsider his determination for she could not urge what she did not knowthat when she should learn he was not related to her other than as a stepparent she would refrain from despising him and that when she knew what he had done to keep her in ignorance she would refrain from hating him it was his conviction that she would not so refrain and there existed as yet neither word nor event which could argue it away  then she said at last you will not be able to come to my wedding and that is not as it ought to be  i dont want to see iti dont want to see it he exclaimed adding more softly but think of me sometimes in your future lifeyoull do that izzythink of me when you are living as the wife of the richest the foremost man in the town and dont let my sins when you know them all cause ee to quite forget that though i loved ee late i loved ee well  it is because of donald she sobbed  i dont forbid you to marry him said henchard promise not to quite forget me when he meant when newson should come  she promised mechanically in her agitation and the same evening at dusk henchard left the town to whose development he had been one of the chief stimulants for many years during the day he had bought a new toolbasket cleaned up his old hayknife and wimble set himself up in fresh leggings kneenaps and corduroys and in other ways gone back to the working clothes of his young manhood discarding for ever the shabbygenteel suit of cloth and rusty silk hat that since his decline had characterized him in the casterbridge street as a man who had seen better days  he went secretly and alone not a soul of the many who had known him being aware of his departure elizabethjane accompanied him as far as the second bridge on the highwayfor the hour of her appointment with the unguessed visitor at farfraes had not yet arrivedand parted from him with unfeigned wonder and sorrow keeping him back a minute or two before finally letting him go she watched his form diminish across the moor the yellow rushbasket at his back moving up and down with each tread and the creases behind his knees coming and going alternately till she could no longer see them though she did not know it henchard formed at this moment much the same picture as he had presented when entering casterbridge for the first time nearly a quarter of a century before except to be sure that the serious addition to his years had considerably lessened the spring to his stride that his state of hopelessness had weakened him and imparted to his shoulders as weighted by the basket a perceptible bend  he went on till he came to the first milestone which stood in the bank half way up a steep hill he rested his basket on the top of the stone placed his elbows on it and gave way to a convulsive twitch which was worse than a sob because it was so hard and so dry  if i had only got her with meif i only had he said hard work would be nothing to me then but that was not to be icaingo alone as i deservean outcast and a vagabond but my punishment is not greater than i can bear  he sternly subdued his anguish shouldered his basket and went on  elizabeth in the meantime had breathed him a sigh recovered her equanimity and turned her face to casterbridge before she had reached the first house she was met in her walk by donald farfrae this was evidently not their first meeting that day they joined hands without ceremony and farfrae anxiously asked and is he goneand did you tell himi mean of the other matternot of ours  he is gone and i told him all i knew of your friend donald who is he  well well dearie you will know soon about that and mr henchard will hear of it if he does not go far  he will go farhes bent upon getting out of sight and sound  she walked beside her lover and when they reached the crossways or bow turned with him into corn street instead of going straight on to her own door at farfraes house they stopped and went in  farfrae flung open the door of the groundfloor sittingroom saying there he is waiting for you and elizabeth entered in the armchair sat the broadfaced genial man who had called on henchard on a memorable morning between one and two years before this time and whom the latter had seen mount the coach and depart within halfanhour of his arrival it was richard newson the meeting with the lighthearted father from whom she had been separated halfadozen years as if by death need hardly be detailed it was an affecting one apart from the question of paternity henchards departure was in a moment explained when the true facts came to be handled the difficulty of restoring her to her old belief in newson was not so great as might have seemed likely for henchards conduct itself was a proof that those facts were true moreover she had grown up under newsons paternal care and even had henchard been her father in nature this father in early domiciliation might almost have carried the point against him when the incidents of her parting with henchard had a little worn off  newsons pride in what she had grown up to be was more than he could express he kissed her again and again  ive saved you the trouble to come and meet mehaha said newson the fact is that mr farfrae here he said come up and stop with me for a day or two captain newson and ill bring her round faith says i so i will and here i am  well henchard is gone said farfrae shutting the door he has done it all voluntarily and as i gather from elizabeth he has been very nice with her i was got rather uneasy but all is as it should be and we will have no more deefficulties at all  now thats very much as i thought said newson looking into the face of each by turns i said to myself ay a hundred times when i tried to get a peep at her unknown to herselfdepend upon it tis best that i should live on quiet for a few days like this till something turns up for the better i now know you are all right and what can i wish for more  well captain newson i will be glad to see ye here every day now since it can do no harm said farfrae and what ive been thinking is that the wedding may as well be kept under my own roof the house being large and you being in lodgings by yourselfso that a great deal of trouble and expense would be saved yeand tis a convenience when a couples married not to hae far to go to get home  with all my heart said captain newson since as ye say it can do no harm now poor henchards gone though i wouldnt have done it otherwise or put myself in his way at all for ive already in my lifetime been an intruder into his family quite as far as politeness can be expected to put up with but what do the young woman say herself about it elizabeth my child come and hearken to what we be talking about and not bide staring out o the window as if ye didnt hear  donald and you must settle it murmured elizabeth still keeping up a scrutinizing gaze at some small object in the street  well then continued newson turning anew to farfrae with a face expressing thorough entry into the subject thats how well have it and mr farfrae as you provide so much and houseroom and all that ill do my part in the drinkables and see to the rum and schiedammaybe a dozen jars will be sufficientas many of the folk will be ladies and perhaps they wont drink hard enough to make a high average in the reckoning but you know best ive provided for men and shipmates times enough but im as ignorant as a child how many glasses of grog a woman thats not a drinking woman is expected to consume at these ceremonies  oh nonewell no want much of thato no said farfrae shaking his head with appalled gravity do you leave all to me  when they had gone a little further in these particulars newson leaning back in his chair and smiling reflectively at the ceiling said ive never told ye or have i mr farfrae how henchard put me off the scent that time  he expressed ignorance of what the captain alluded to  ah i thought i hadnt i resolved that i would not i remember not to hurt the mans name but now hes gone i can tell ye why i came to casterbridge nine or ten months before that day last week that i found ye out i had been here twice before then the first time i passed through the town on my way westward not knowing elizabeth lived here then hearing at some placei forget wherethat a man of the name of henchard had been mayor here i came back and called at his house one morning the old rascalhe said elizabethjane had died years ago  elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story  now it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet continued newson and if youll believe me i was that upset that i went back to the coach that had brought me and took passage onward without lying in the town halfanhour hahatwas a good joke and well carried out and i give the man credit fort  elizabethjane was amazed at the intelligence a jokeo no she cried then he kept you from me father all those months when you might have been here  the father admitted that such was the case  he ought not to have done it said farfrae  elizabeth sighed i said i would never forget him but o i think i ought to forget him now  newson like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities failed to perceive the enormity of henchards crime notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom indeed the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious he began to take henchards part  well twas not ten words that he said after all newson pleaded and how could he know that i should be such a simpleton as to believe him twas as much my fault as his poor fellow  no said elizabethjane firmly in her revulsion of feeling he knew your dispositionyou always were so trusting father ive heard my mother say so hundreds of timesand he did it to wrong you after weaning me from you these five years by saying he was my father he should not have done this  thus they conversed and there was nobody to set before elizabeth any extenuation of the absent ones deceit even had he been present henchard might scarce have pleaded it so little did he value himself or his good name  well wellnever mindit is all over and past said newson goodnaturedly now about this wedding again     44   meanwhile the man of their talk had pursued his solitary way eastward till weariness overtook him and he looked about for a place of rest his heart was so exacerbated at parting from the girl that he could not face an inn or even a household of the most humble kind and entering a field he lay down under a wheatrick feeling no want of food the very heaviness of his soul caused him to sleep profoundly  the bright autumn sun shining into his eyes across the stubble awoke him the next morning early he opened his basket and ate for his breakfast what he had packed for his supper and in doing so overhauled the remainder of his kit although everything he brought necessitated carriage at his own back he had secreted among his tools a few of elizabethjanes castoff belongings in the shape of gloves shoes a scrap of her handwriting and the like and in his pocket he carried a curl of her hair having looked at these things he closed them up again and went onward  during five consecutive days henchards rush basket rode along upon his shoulder between the highway hedges the new yellow of the rushes catching the eye of an occasional fieldlabourer as he glanced through the quickset together with the wayfarers hat and head and downturned face over which the twig shadows moved in endless procession it now became apparent that the direction of his journey was weydon priors which he reached on the afternoon of the sixth day  the renowned hill whereon the annual fair had been held for so many generations was now bare of human beings and almost of aught besides a few sheep grazed thereabout but these ran off when henchard halted upon the summit he deposited his basket upon the turf and looked about with sad curiosity till he discovered the road by which his wife and himself had entered on the upland so memorable to both fiveandtwenty years before  yes we came up that way he said after ascertaining his bearings she was carrying the baby and i was reading a balletsheet then we crossed about hereshe so sad and weary and i speaking to her hardly at all because of my cursed pride and mortification at being poor then we saw the tentthat must have stood more this way he walked to another spot it was not really where the tent had stood but it seemed so to him here we went in and here we sat down i faced this way then i drank and committed my crime it must have been just on that very pixyring that she was standing when she said her last words to me before going off with him i can hear their sound now and the sound of her sobs o mike ive lived with thee all this while and had nothing but temper now im no more to eeill try my luck elsewhere  he experienced not only the bitterness of a man who finds in looking back upon an ambitious course that what he has sacrificed in sentiment was worth as much as what he has gained in substance but the superadded bitterness of seeing his very recantation nullified he had been sorry for all this long ago but his attempts to replace ambition by love had been as fully foiled as his ambition itself his wronged wife had foiled them by a fraud so grandly simple as to be almost a virtue it was an odd sequence that out of all this tampering with social law came that flower of nature elizabeth part of his wish to wash his hands of life arose from his perception of its contrarious inconsistenciesof natures jaunty readiness to support unorthodox social principles  he intended to go on from this placevisited as an act of penanceinto another part of the country altogether but he could not help thinking of elizabeth and the quarter of the horizon in which she lived out of this it happened that the centrifugal tendency imparted by weariness of the world was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love for his stepdaughter as a consequence instead of following a straight course yet further away from casterbridge henchard gradually almost unconsciously deflected from that right line of his first intention till by degrees his wandering like that of the canadian woodsman became part of a circle of which casterbridge formed the centre in ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as he could by means of the sun moon or stars and settled in his mind the exact direction in which casterbridge and elizabethjane lay sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hournay every few minutesconjectured her actions for the time beingher sitting down and rising up her goings and comings till thought of newsons and farfraes counterinfluence would pass like a cold blast over a pool and efface her image and then he would say to himself o you fool all this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine  at length he obtained employment at his own occupation of haytrusser work of that sort being in demand at this autumn time the scene of his hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway whose course was the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy centres of novelty and the remote wessex boroughs he had chosen the neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that situated here though at a distance of fifty miles he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote  and thus henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he had occupied a quarter of a century before externally there was nothing to hinder his making another start on the upward slope and by his new lights achieving higher things than his soul in its halfformed state had been able to accomplish but the ingenious machinery contrived by the gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration to a minimumwhich arranges that wisdom to do shall come pari passu with the departure of zest for doingstood in the way of all that he had no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a mere painted scene to him  very often as his hayknife crunched down among the sweetsmelling grassy stems he would survey mankind and say to himself here and everywhere be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves though wanted by their families the country and the world while i an outcast an encumberer of the ground wanted by nobody and despised by all live on against my will  he often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed along the roadnot from a general curiosity by any meansbut in the hope that among these travellers between casterbridge and london some would sooner or later speak of the former place the distance however was too great to lend much probability to his desire and the highest result of his attention to wayside words was that he did indeed hear the name casterbridge uttered one day by the driver of a roadwaggon henchard ran to the gate of the field he worked in and hailed the speaker who was a stranger  yesive come from there maister he said in answer to henchards inquiry i trade up and down ye know though what with this travelling without horses thats getting so common my work will soon be done  anything moving in the old place mid i ask  all the same as usual  ive heard that mr farfrae the late mayor is thinking of getting married now is that true or not  i couldnt say for the life o me o no i should think not  but yes johnyou forget said a woman inside the waggontilt what were them packages we carrd there at the beginning o the week surely they said a wedding was coming off soonon martins day  the man declared he remembered nothing about it and the waggon went on jangling over the hill  henchard was convinced that the womans memory served her well the date was an extremely probable one there being no reason for delay on either side he might for that matter write and inquire of elizabeth but his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult yet before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her wedding was not as she wished it to be  the remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not elizabeth and farfrae who had driven him away from them but his own haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired he had assumed the return of newson without absolute proof that the captain meant to return still less that elizabethjane would welcome him and with no proof whatever that if he did return he would stay what if he had been mistaken in his views if there had been no necessity that his own absolute separation from her he loved should be involved in these untoward incidents to make one more attempt to be near her to go back to see her to plead his cause before her to ask forgiveness for his fraud to endeavour strenuously to hold his own in her love it was worth the risk of repulse ay of life itself  but how to initiate this reversal of all his former resolves without causing husband and wife to despise him for his inconsistency was a question which made him tremble and brood  he cut and cut his trusses two days more and then he concluded his hesitancies by a sudden reckless determination to go to the wedding festivity neither writing nor message would be expected of him she had regretted his decision to be absenthis unanticipated presence would fill the little unsatisfied corner that would probably have place in her just heart without him  to intrude as little of his personality as possible upon a gay event with which that personality could show nothing in keeping he decided not to make his appearance till eveningwhen stiffness would have worn off and a gentle wish to let bygones be bygones would exercise its sway in all hearts  he started on foot two mornings before st martinstide allowing himself about sixteen miles to perform for each of the three days journey reckoning the weddingday as one there were only two towns melchester and shottsford of any importance along his course and at the latter he stopped on the second night not only to rest but to prepare himself for the next evening  possessing no clothes but the working suit he stood innow stained and distorted by their two months of hard usage he entered a shop to make some purchases which should put him externally at any rate a little in harmony with the prevailing tone of the morrow a rough yet respectable coat and hat a new shirt and neckcloth were the chief of these and having satisfied himself that in appearance at least he would not now offend her he proceeded to the more interesting particular of buying her some present  what should that present be he walked up and down the street regarding dubiously the display in the shop windows from a gloomy sense that what he might most like to give her would be beyond his miserable pocket at length a caged goldfinch met his eye the cage was a plain and small one the shop humble and on inquiry he concluded he could afford the modest sum asked a sheet of newspaper was tied round the little creatures wire prison and with the wrapped up cage in his hand henchard sought a lodging for the night  next day he set out upon the last stage and was soon within the district which had been his dealing ground in bygone years part of the distance he travelled by carrier seating himself in the darkest corner at the back of that traders van and as the other passengers mainly women going short journeys mounted and alighted in front of henchard they talked over much local news not the least portion of this being the wedding then in course of celebration at the town they were nearing it appeared from their accounts that the town band had been hired for the evening party and lest the convivial instincts of that body should get the better of their skill the further step had been taken of engaging the string band from budmouth so that there would be a reserve of harmony to fall back upon in case of need  he heard however but few particulars beyond those known to him already the incident of the deepest interest on the journey being the soft pealing of the casterbridge bells which reached the travellers ears while the van paused on the top of yalbury hill to have the drag lowered the time was just after twelve oclock  those notes were a signal that all had gone well that there had been no slip twixt cup and lip in this case that elizabethjane and donald farfrae were man and wife  henchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering companions after hearing this sound indeed it quite unmanned him and in pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in casterbridge street till evening lest he should mortify farfrae and his bride he alighted here with his bundle and birdcage and was soon left as a lonely figure on the broad white highway  it was the hill near which he had waited to meet farfrae almost two years earlier to tell him of the serious illness of his wife lucetta the place was unchanged the same larches sighed the same notes but farfrae had another wifeand as henchard knew a better one he only hoped that elizabethjane had obtained a better home than had been hers at the former time  he passed the remainder of the afternoon in a curious highstrung condition unable to do much but think of the approaching meeting with her and sadly satirize himself for his emotions thereon as a samson shorn such an innovation on casterbridge customs as a flitting of bridegroom and bride from the town immediately after the ceremony was not likely but if it should have taken place he would wait till their return to assure himself on this point he asked a marketman when near the borough if the newlymarried couple had gone away and was promptly informed that they had not they were at that hour according to all accounts entertaining a houseful of guests at their home in corn street  henchard dusted his boots washed his hands at the riverside and proceeded up the town under the feeble lamps he need have made no inquiries beforehand for on drawing near farfraes residence it was plain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within and that donald himself shared it his voice being distinctly audible in the street giving strong expression to a song of his dear native country that he loved so well as never to have revisited it idlers were standing on the pavement in front and wishing to escape the notice of these henchard passed quickly on to the door  it was wide open the hall was lighted extravagantly and people were going up and down the stairs his courage failed him to enter footsore laden and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency was to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved if not to court repulse from her husband accordingly he went round into the street at the back that he knew so well entered the garden and came quietly into the house through the kitchen temporarily depositing the bird and cage under a bush outside to lessen the awkwardness of his arrival  solitude and sadness had so emolliated henchard that he now feared circumstances he would formerly have scorned and he began to wish that he had not taken upon himself to arrive at such a juncture however his progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in the kitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional housekeeper during the convulsions from which farfraes establishment was just then suffering she was one of those people whom nothing surprises and though to her a total stranger his request must have seemed odd she willingly volunteered to go up and inform the master and mistress of the house that a humble old friend had come  on second thought she said that he had better not wait in the kitchen but come up into the little backparlour which was empty he thereupon followed her thither and she left him just as she got across the landing to the door of the best parlour a dance was struck up and she returned to say that she would wait till that was over before announcing himmr and mrs farfrae having both joined in the figure  the door of the front room had been taken off its hinges to give more space and that of the room henchard sat in being ajar he could see fractional parts of the dancers whenever their gyrations brought them near the doorway chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and streaming curls of hair together with about threefifths of the band in profile including the restless shadow of a fiddlers elbow and the tip of the bassviol bow  the gaiety jarred upon henchards spirits and he could not quite understand why farfrae a muchsobered man and a widower who had had his trials should have cared for it all notwithstanding the fact that he was quite a young man still and quickly kindled to enthusiasm by dance and song that the quiet elizabeth who had long ago appraised life at a moderate value and who knew in spite of her maidenhood that marriage was as a rule no dancing matter should have had zest for this revelry surprised him still more however young people could not be quite old people he concluded and custom was omnipotent  with the progress of the dance the performers spread out somewhat and then for the first time he caught a glimpse of the once despised daughter who had mastered him and made his heart ache she was in a dress of white silk or satin he was not near enough to say whichsnowy white without a tinge of milk or cream and the expression of her face was one of nervous pleasure rather than of gaiety presently farfrae came round his exuberant scotch movement making him conspicuous in a moment the pair were not dancing together but henchard could discern that whenever the chances of the figure made them the partners of a moment their emotions breathed a much subtler essence than at other times  by degrees henchard became aware that the measure was trod by some one who outfarfraed farfrae in saltatory intenseness this was strange and it was stranger to find that the eclipsing personage was elizabethjanes partner the first time that henchard saw him he was sweeping grandly round his head quivering and low down his legs in the form of an x and his back towards the door the next time he came round in the other direction his white waistcoat preceding his face and his toes preceding his white waistcoat that happy facehenchards complete discomfiture lay in it it was newsons who had indeed come and supplanted him  henchard pushed to the door and for some seconds made no other movement he rose to his feet and stood like a dark ruin obscured by the shade from his own soul upthrown  but he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved his agitation was great and he would fain have been gone but before he could leave the dance had ended the housekeeper had informed elizabethjane of the stranger who awaited her and she entered the room immediately  ohit ismr henchard she said starting back  what elizabeth he cried as she seized her hand what do you saymr henchard dont dont scourge me like that call me worthless old henchardanythingbut dont ee be so cold as this o my maidi see you have anothera real father in my place then you know all but dont give all your thought to him do ye save a little room for me  she flushed up and gently drew her hand away i could have loved you alwaysi would have gladly she said but how can i when i know you have deceived me soso bitterly deceived me you persuaded me that my father was not my fatherallowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years and then when he my warmhearted real father came to find me cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death which nearly broke his heart o how can i love as i once did a man who has served us like this  henchards lips half parted to begin an explanation but he shut them up like a vice and uttered not a sound how should he there and then set before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faultsthat he had himself been deceived in her identity at first till informed by her mothers letter that his own child had died that in the second accusation his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester who loved her affection better than his own honour among the many hindrances to such a pleading not the least was this that he did not sufficiently value himself to lessen his sufferings by strenuous appeal or elaborate argument  waiving therefore his privilege of selfdefence he regarded only his discomposure dont ye distress yourself on my account he said with proud superiority i would not wish itat such a time too as this i have done wrong in coming to eei see my error but it is only for once so forgive it ill never trouble ee again elizabethjaneno not to my dying day goodnight goodbye  then before she could collect her thoughts henchard went out from her rooms and departed from the house by the back way as he had come and she saw him no more     45   it was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter elizabethjane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation and the only difference between donalds movements now and formerly was that he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours than he had been in the habit of doing for some time  newson had stayed in casterbridge three days after the wedding party whose gaiety as might have been surmised was of his making rather than of the married couples and was stared at and honoured as became the returned crusoe of the hour but whether or not because casterbridge was difficult to excite by dramatic returns and disappearances through having been for centuries an assize town in which sensational exits from the world antipodean absences and such like were halfyearly occurrences the inhabitants did not altogether lose their equanimity on his account on the fourth morning he was discovered disconsolately climbing a hill in his craving to get a glimpse of the sea from somewhere or other the contiguity of salt water proved to be such a necessity of his existence that he preferred budmouth as a place of residence notwithstanding the society of his daughter in the other town thither he went and settled in lodgings in a greenshuttered cottage which had a bowwindow jutting out sufficiently to afford glimpses of a vertical strip of blue sea to any one opening the sash and leaning forward far enough to look through a narrow lane of tall intervening houses  elizabethjane was standing in the middle of her upstairs parlour critically surveying some rearrangement of articles with her head to one side when the housemaid came in with the announcement oh please maam we know now how that birdcage came there  in exploring her new domain during the first week of residence gazing with critical satisfaction on this cheerful room and that penetrating cautiously into dark cellars sallying forth with gingerly tread to the garden now leafstrewn by autumn winds and thus like a wise fieldmarshal estimating the capabilities of the site whereon she was about to open her housekeeping campaignmrs donald farfrae had discovered in a screened corner a new birdcage shrouded in newspaper and at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathersthe dead body of a goldfinch nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come there though that the poor little songster had been starved to death was evident the sadness of the incident had made an impression on her she had not been able to forget it for days despite farfraes tender banter and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again revived  oh please maam we know how the birdcage came there that farmers man who called on the evening of the weddinghe was seen wi it in his hand as he came up the street and tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message and then went away forgetting where he had left it  this was enough to set elizabeth thinking and in thinking she seized hold of the idea at one feminine bound that the caged bird had been brought by henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance he had not expressed to her any regrets or excuses for what he had done in the past but it was a part of his nature to extenuate nothing and live on as one of his own worst accusers she went out looked at the cage buried the starved little singer and from that hour her heart softened towards the selfalienated man  when her husband came in she told him her solution of the birdcage mystery and begged donald to help her in finding out as soon as possible whither henchard had banished himself that she might make her peace with him try to do something to render his life less that of an outcast and more tolerable to him although farfrae had never so passionately liked henchard as henchard had liked him he had on the other hand never so passionately hated in the same direction as his former friend had done and he was therefore not the least indisposed to assist elizabethjane in her laudable plan  but it was by no means easy to set about discovering henchard he had apparently sunk into the earth on leaving mr and mrs farfraes door elizabethjane remembered what he had once attempted and trembled  but though she did not know it henchard had become a changed man since thenas far that is as change of emotional basis can justify such a radical phrase and she needed not to fear in a few days farfraes inquiries elicited that henchard had been seen by one who knew him walking steadily along the melchester highway eastward at twelve oclock at nightin other words retracing his steps on the road by which he had come  this was enough and the next morning farfrae might have been discovered driving his gig out of casterbridge in that direction elizabethjane sitting beside him wrapped in a thick flat furthe victorine of the periodher complexion somewhat richer than formerly and an incipient matronly dignity which the serene minervaeyes of one whose gestures beamed with mind made becoming settling on her face having herself arrived at a promising haven from at least the grosser troubles of her life her object was to place henchard in some similar quietude before he should sink into that lower stage of existence which was only too possible to him now  after driving along the highway for a few miles they made further inquiries and learnt of a roadmender who had been working thereabouts for weeks that he had observed such a man at the time mentioned he had left the melchester coachroad at weatherbury by a forking highway which skirted the north of egdon heath into this road they directed the horses head and soon were bowling across that ancient country whose surface never had been stirred to a fingers depth save by the scratchings of rabbits since brushed by the feet of the earliest tribes the tumuli these had left behind dun and shagged with heather jutted roundly into the sky from the uplands as though they were the full breasts of diana multimammia supinely extended there  they searched egdon but found no henchard farfrae drove onward and by the afternoon reached the neighbourhood of some extension of the heath to the north of anglebury a prominent feature of which in the form of a blasted clump of firs on a summit of a hill they soon passed under that the road they were following had up to this point been henchards track on foot they were pretty certain but the ramifications which now began to reveal themselves in the route made further progress in the right direction a matter of pure guesswork and donald strongly advised his wife to give up the search in person and trust to other means for obtaining news of her stepfather they were now a score of miles at least from home but by resting the horse for a couple of hours at a village they had just traversed it would be possible to get back to casterbridge that same day while to go much further afield would reduce them to the necessity of camping out for the night and that will make a hole in a sovereign said farfrae she pondered the position and agreed with him  he accordingly drew rein but before reversing their direction paused a moment and looked vaguely round upon the wide country which the elevated position disclosed while they looked a solitary human form came from under the clump of trees and crossed ahead of them the person was some labourer his gait was shambling his regard fixed in front of him as absolutely as if he wore blinkers and in his hand he carried a few sticks having crossed the road he descended into a ravine where a cottage revealed itself which he entered  if it were not so far away from casterbridge i should say that must be poor whittle tis just like him observed elizabethjane  and it may be whittle for hes never been to the yard these three weeks going away without saying any word at all and i owing him for two days work without knowing who to pay it to  the possibility led them to alight and at least make an inquiry at the cottage farfrae hitched the reins to the gatepost and they approached what was of humble dwellings surely the humblest the walls built of kneaded clay originally faced with a trowel had been worn by years of rainwashings to a lumpy crumbling surface channelled and sunken from its plane its gray rents held together here and there by a leafy strap of ivy which could scarcely find substance enough for the purpose the rafters were sunken and the thatch of the roof in ragged holes leaves from the fence had been blown into the corners of the doorway and lay there undisturbed the door was ajar farfrae knocked and he who stood before them was whittle as they had conjectured  his face showed marks of deep sadness his eyes lighting on them with an unfocused gaze and he still held in his hand the few sticks he had been out to gather as soon as he recognized them he started  what abel whittle is it that ye are heere said farfrae  ay yes sir you see he was kindlike to mother when she wer here below though a was rough to me  who are you talking of  o sirmr henchet didnt ye know it hes just goneabout halfanhour ago by the sun for ive got no watch to my name  notdead faltered elizabethjane  yes maam hes gone he was kindlike to mother when she wer here below sending her the best shipcoal and hardly any ashes from it at all and taties and suchlike that were very needful to her i seed en go down street on the night of your worshipfuls wedding to the lady at yer side and i thought he looked low and faltering and i followed en over greys bridge and he turned and zeed me and said you go back but i followed and he turned again and said do you hear sir go back but i zeed that he was low and i followed on still then a said whittle what do ye follow me for when ive told ye to go back all these times and i said because sir i see things be bad with ee and ye wer kindlike to mother if ye wer rough to me and i would fain be kindlike to you then he walked on and i followed and he never complained at me no more we walked on like that all night and in the blue o the morning when twas hardly day i looked ahead o me and i zeed that he wambled and could hardly drag along by the time we had got past here but i had seen that this house was empty as i went by and i got him to come back and i took down the boards from the windows and helped him inside what whittle he said and can ye really be such a poor fond fool as to care for such a wretch as i then i went on further and some neighbourly woodmen lent me a bed and a chair and a few other traps and we brought em here and made him as comfortable as we could but he didnt gain strength for you see maam he couldnt eatno appetite at alland he got weaker and today he died one of the neighbours have gone to get a man to measure him  dear meis that so said farfrae  as for elizabeth she said nothing  upon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper with some writing upon it continued abel whittle but not being a man o letters i cant read writing so i dont know what it is i can get it and show ye  they stood in silence while he ran into the cottage returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper on it there was pencilled as follows   michael henchards will  that elizabethjane farfrae be not told of my death or made to grieve on account of me  that i be not buryd in consecrated ground  that no sexton be asked to toll the bell  that nobody is wished to see my dead body  that no murners walk behind me at my funeral  that no flours be planted on my grave  that no man remember me to this i put my name  michael henchard   what are we to do said donald when he had handed the paper to her  she could not answer distinctly o donald she cried at last through her tears what bitterness lies there o i would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting but theres no alteringso it must be  what henchard had written in the anguish of his dying was respected as far as practicable by elizabethjane though less from a sense of the sacredness of last words as such than from her independent knowledge that the man who wrote them meant what he said she knew the directions to be a piece of the same stuff that his whole life was made of and hence were not to be tampered with to give herself a mournful pleasure or her husband credit for largeheartedness  all was over at last even her regrets for having misunderstood him on his last visit for not having searched him out sooner though these were deep and sharp for a good while from this time forward elizabethjane found herself in a latitude of calm weather kindly and grateful in itself and doubly so after the capharnaum in which some of her preceding years had been spent as the lively and sparkling emotions of her early married live cohered into an equable serenity the finer movements of her nature found scope in discovering to the narrowlived ones around her the secret as she had once learnt it of making limited opportunities endurable which she deemed to consist in the cunning enlargement by a species of microscopic treatment of those minute forms of satisfaction that offer themselves to everybody not in positive pain which thus handled have much of the same inspiring effect upon life as wider interests cursorily embraced  her teaching had a reflex action upon herself insomuch that she thought she could perceive no great personal difference between being respected in the nether parts of casterbridge and glorified at the uppermost end of the social world her position was indeed to a marked degree one that in the common phrase afforded much to be thankful for that she was not demonstratively thankful was no fault of hers her experience had been of a kind to teach her rightly or wrongly that the doubtful honour of a brief transmit through a sorry world hardly called for effusiveness even when the path was suddenly irradiated at some halfway point by daybeams rich as hers but her strong sense that neither she nor any human being deserved less than was given did not blind her to the fact that there were others receiving less who had deserved much more and in being forced to class herself among the fortunate she did not cease to wonder at the persistence of the unforeseen when the one to whom such unbroken tranquility had been accorded in the adult stage was she whose youth had seemed to teach that happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain
