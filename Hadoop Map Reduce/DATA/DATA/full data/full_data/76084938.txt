steamy littoral of the caribbean sea the spanishindian town of rio frio lay sweltering in the heat of afternoon the flattopped white houses surrounding the plaza reflected a dazzling glare and the heat shimmered mercilessly upon the rough pavingstones flakes of plaster had fallen from the buildings a few of them were mere ruins relics of a past age for the town had been built when conquistadores from spain first plunged into the tropic forest to search for el dorado here and there dilapidated green lattices shaded upper windows and nearer the ground narrow openings were guarded by rusty iron bars but some of the houses showed blank outer walls and the plaza had rather an eastern than an american look spain has set upon the new world the stamp the moors impressed on her  at one end of the plaza stood the café four nations a low opensided room with a row of decaying pillars dividing it from the pavement it was filled with flies which stuck in black clusters to the papers hanging from the tarnished lamps and crawled about the dusty tables the hot air was tainted with aniseed picadura tobacco and the curious musky smell which is a characteristic of ancient spanish towns on the righthand side of the square rose the twin towers of the church of san sebastian wide steps led up to the patch of shadow where a leather curtain left uncovered part of the door and a niche above sheltered an image of the martyr with an arrow in his breast the figure was well modeled and grimly realistic  opposite the café the calle mercedes cut a cool dark gap through the dazzling town on its outskirts the hillside fell sharply to a wide green level beyond this a silver gleam indicated the sea  the café was in shadow and at its inner end a number of citizens lounged half asleep in low cane chairs the hour of the siesta had slipped away but it was not yet time for dinner and having read the newspaper and guardedly discussed politics the leading inhabitants of rio frio had nothing else to do they were men with formal manners a few dressed in rusty black and some in white cotton but all were not of pure european blood one or two indeed plainly showed their negro descent others the melancholy of the indian aboriginal  near the front pillars a priest and two men of lighter color were seated at a table father agustin wore a threadbare cassock and clumsy rawhide shoes but he had an air of quiet dignity and his sharply cut features were of the gothic type which is not uncommon in spain his accent was also clean peninsular james grahame who sat opposite across the chessboard wore the same vague but recognizable stamp of breeding though his duck suit was getting ragged and his red silk sash was obviously cheap he had steady gray eyes and light hair a rather prominent nose and a firm mouth he looked older than his thirty years the lines on his forehead hinted at stern experience and his alertness was partly masked by an easy selfcontrol walthew was younger and dressed with scrupulous neatness in duck with smart tan shoes his face was mobile his glance quick but open and his mouth sensitive he had the look of an aristocratic american  father agustin made a deprecatory gesture as his thin longnailed hand moved across the board and grahame smiled  yes he said filling the tiny glass before the priest it is mate this time padre when you had made a few moves i foresaw defeat but while the candle burns one plays out the game  it is so but not with all father agustin replied in his fine castilian the losing game needs courage  experience helps getting beaten does not hurt so much when one grows used to it  ah said the priest that is the way to the greatest victory man can win but i am your guest and will not moralize i must compliment you on the game you play it is bold and well thought out but perhaps somewhat lacking in finesse  i am afraid finesse is not a virtue of mine grahame smiled  father agustin studied him quietly when the briton spoke he lost something of his reserve his glance got keen and his eyes had a curious hawklike look the priest could imagine him as swift and determined in action quick to seize an advantage but not a good plotter  for all that it is a quality that is useful when one deals with the latins at rio frio or elsewhere the priest said  with apologies padre that is certainly true walthew agreed  so you have some business here perhaps like the others you seek a mineral concession  no our host don martin is of course out of office and doesnt deal in them  he never will the priest said quietly the natural wealth of this country belongs to its people but it is stolen from them piece by piece and given to foreigners  the foreigners pay for what they get  yes said the priest but where does the money go if it were spent on the development of the country one would not complain but it is gamblers and courtezans who benefit those who hold office here fill their pockets from the public purse and what is left when they are satisfied is needed to keep the government in power  then why do you not reform your administration and put in straight men  father agustin indicated the drowsy group at the back of the café  these are our politicians they meet every day and ruminate over the affairs of the nation think of it  well said walthew they do not look busy but things do happen here now and then  it is true a clique breaks up there is a new coalition and those who plotted each others downfall are united again we latins have seldom a continuous policy sometimes there is a tumult in the streets and disaffection among the troops then the man who rules us uses the whip one hears of no trial but a malcontent is missing an officers duty takes him to the fever jungles where he cannot live sometimes before the morning mist has lifted one is wakened by a volley in the ditch behind the citadel  you are a patient race grahame remarked  not so said father agustin we often dream when we should act but sometimes we act too soon it is our misfortune that we do not know how to wait for the right moment he paused and indicated the thinnedout ranks of pawns on the chessboard it is like that in the game of politics the fight is between the greater pieces but these others fall  grahame lighted a cigarette and glanced about the square for rio frio was waking up here and there a woman of mixed blood crouched beside a castiron pot fanning the handful of charcoal in it ready for cooking the evening meal a team of mules hauled a heavy load across the hot paving stones a gaunt darkfaced man in ragged cotton walking at the leaders heads then came a pack train with jingling bells a cloud of flies following the burdened animals and dusty barefooted peasants plodding by their side a group of women appeared from the mouth of a narrow street their faces wet with perspiration and straps across their foreheads supporting the big cane baskets on their backs after them came a negro with a great tray of fruit upon his head next three or four lean barefooted fellows with ragged palmleaf hats seated themselves on the pavement in a strip of shadow they sat there silent and motionless contemplating the scene with listless eyes the crowd looked dully apathetic there was languor in the air they breathed but after all they claimed descent from spanish stock and grahame thought they could be roused it does not need much fanning to wake the smoldering fire in the iberians veins  my sheep said father agustin but they have other shepherds who do not always lead them well  shear the flock instead of guarding it one would imagine that there is not much wool  none is so poor that he has nothing to give if not goods his voice his sullen clamor and savage rage the unthinking passion of the mob is terrible but it is used by those who must answer for the deed some day my people have their wrongs but one cannot build the state on foundations of revenge and cruelty  but you have some honest men who hate the present government  it is possible that their honesty lessens their influence at rio frio one does not follow the ideal it is remote and elusive the feet get weary and many things that please the eye lie nearer to hand father agustin rose and bowed with grave courtesy and now i have talked enough and have some duties i thank you and take my leave  they watched him cross the plaza in his rusty cassock  guess weve struck the wrong place walthew said were more likely to find trouble than money here well theres a prospect of new experiences and a little excitement and anyway we cant go back on our bargain with don martin  i never quite understood what led you to join me grahame remarked you know the risk we run if the government catches us well be hanged or shotwhichever suits their fancy  walthew laughed  thats the attraction but we wont be caught i guess my yankee ingenuity will count for something if these sleepylooking dagoes should trap us we can find a way to give em the slip  optimism is a great asset grahame smiled but in this country it must have a handmaidena convenient revolver  walthew leaned forward on the table  weve gone into a risky business together i know nothing about you except that you seem to understand these dagoes and are a handy man to have around when they pull their knives you know almost nothing about me  he paused and smiled and grahame stirred uneasily walthew looked so boyish when he smiled like that would he have that carefree look in say two months at times grahame regretted letting the boy join him in a venture that might try the heart of even a very strong man  i say old chap you arent listening walthew expostulated im telling you that the paters a moneymaking machine when i left harvard he was for working me up into a partnership in the walthew factory but i couldnt stand ittoo monotonous i took ten thousand dollars instead on condition that if i hadnt made good in my own way when two years were up id go back and start as clerk  well grahame returned with a smile i havent much to tell i have no family business to fall back on as my means were not large enough to let me live as i liked at home i went abroad to increase them so far i havent succeeded but on the whole ive had a pretty good time and i dont see much reason for grumbling about my luck  this was correct so far as it went for grahame did not think it worth while to explain that the fiery blood of the borderers ran in his veins and his people had been soldiers and explorers until economic changes impoverished the family nor could he add that because his name still counted for something in the north he had left home to avoid being skilfully led into a marriage his friends thought suitable he had indeed run away from a wellborn girl with money who he suspected was relieved to see him go since then he had known trouble and it had hardened him yet he was honest and was marked by some polish  at first sight and by contrast with his comrade walthew looked callow but he improved on acquaintance it was not for nothing that he was the son of a shrewd manufacturer who had built up a great business from a humble beginning walthew was cool in a crisis and though outwardly careless he was capable of looking ahead so far his talents were undeveloped but grahame suspected them  while they sat talking the scene in the square gained animation groups of men moving quickly emerged from the side streets there was a murmur of voices and a crowd began to gather women called from the flat housetops doors were opened and naked darkskinned children dragged in from the pavement the concourse thickened about the steps of the church gesticulating men chattered in the native patois  grahames eyes grew keen  somethings going to happen he said quietly  then he pressed his comrades arm as a man appeared on the highest step of the church and the murmur of the crowd swelled into a roar  viva castillo viva el libertador  the tall figure bowed and held up a hand and for a moment there was silence then a clear voice rang out and grahame tried to catch the sonorous castilian words he was too far off and some escaped him but he heard enough to gather that it was a grim indictment of the rulers of the country the man spoke with fire and passion using lavish gestures and the cries that answered showed that he could work upon the feelings of the crowd  the café had emptied and its stout proprietor lounged napkin in hand near grahames table  sounds pretty drastic if i heard him right walthew remarked its obvious that the authorities dont use halfmeasures did he say they had the deputation arrested and its leader shot  so i understood said grahame how did you come to learn castilian  a notion of the old mans he made me study languages its his ambition to ship the walthew manufactures all over the world and he got a footing in cuba some time ago  they were silent for a few minutes and then grahame turned to the landlord  are these things true  it is possible the other answered cautiously  then are you not afraid of a revolution  no señor why should i fear when there is a revolution the wine trade is good  but suppose your customers get killed  the landlord smiled  they are philosophic politicians señor it is the untaught rabble that fights these others drink their wine and argue over the newspapers besides there will be no revolution yet some talk perhaps possibly a supporter of the government stabbed in the dark  and that will be all grahame asked with a keen glance  there will be nothing more the president waits and watches until he knows his enemies then he gives an order and there is an end of them  the man turned away and when shortly afterward the plaza rang with fierce applause a voice was raised in alarm others joined in the crowd began to stream back from the steps and the orator disappeared then the mass broke into running groups and through the patter of their feet there came a steady measured tread it drew nearer short swarthy men in dirty white uniforms marched into the plaza the strong light gleaming on their rifles they wheeled and stopped in ranks extended across the square and the rifles went up to their shoulders warning shouts fell from the roofs the patter of feet grew faster the shadowy streets were choked with fugitives and the place was empty except for the line of quiet men then an officer laughed and called out and the rifles came down with a clang  i suspect that were up against a big man in the president walthew remarked perhaps wed better light out before these fellows ask us questions     chapter ii  the adventures begin   a half moon hung over the flat roofs and the air was very still walthew and grahame sat on a balcony surrounding the patio of don martin sarmientos house the lattice windows that opened onto the balcony had old but artistic hinges of bronze and the crumbling hardwood rails showed traces of skilful carving below a small fountain splashed in a marble basin surrounded by palmettos and a creeper covered a trellis with trails of dusky purple a faint smell of decay mingled with the more pungent odors of garlic and olive oil from the kitchen in the courtyard where a clatter was going on but no sound from outside broke the silence rio frio was very quiet now  cups of black coffee and a plate of fruit stood on a table in front of the men and the señorita blanca sarmiento sat in a low chair opposite with her duenna a few yards away blanca was then nineteen and walthew watching her with unobtrusive admiration wondered how it was that her relatives had not already arranged a marriage for her unless perhaps her fathers political opinions stood in the way one ran a risk in opposing the government at rio frio the girl was attractive with a finely molded figure the grace of which was displayed by her languid pose her hair was dark and coiled in heavy masses on a small wellshaped head her lips were full and very red but her eyes were a deep blue and her skin fairer than that of the spanishamerican women walthew hitherto had met nor did she use the powder they lavishly employ  with a crimson rose in her hair and a fine blacklace mantilla draped about her shoulders and emphasizing the whiteness of her neck and halfcovered arms she reminded walthew of carmen she had something of the latters allurement but he thought it was an unconscious attraction that she exercised the art of the coquette was missing the girl had a certain dignity and there was no hint of sensuality in her beauty she had no doubt spanish fire in her blood but the lad thought it burned with a clear and pure flame  how do you come to speak english so charmingly he asked in the hope of satisfying his curiosity about her  do i speak it charmingly she laughed prettily well the explanation is that it was my mothers tongue she was irish you must know  ah said walthew now i understand  blanca gave him a glance of languid amusement  your interest is flattering señor but what is it you understand  thats an awkward question walthew answered grinning frankly still theres something about you that i havent noticed in spanishamerican girls charming as they are  im afraid youre evasive do you know many of my countrywomen  id like to know more but i believe im good at reading character it is a gift i inherited my father was never mistaken about a man and he has made use of a good many  blanca studied him he had a smooth fresh face and looked very young but while she thought he was direct and perhaps impulsive something suggested that he was shrewd  women are supposed to be more puzzling she answered then the sarmientos come from andalusia and the peninsulares are complex people on the surface we are often cheerfully inconsequent but underneath theres a strain of melancholy we live in the shadow of a fatalism we got from the moors she glanced at grahame i think you can understand  grahame made a sign of assent sitting thoughtfully silent his lean but powerful frame displayed by the thin white duck and his strong brown face impassive he had a somber look the man was reckless and sparkled with gay humor now and then but it was the passing brightness of the north  yes he said i understand but the irish are optimists and you are irish too  then perhaps thats why i keep hopeful it is not always easy at rio frio and life was not very joyous when we were exiles in america  you know my country walthew broke in  i know your southern states we lived there in poverty wandering up and down my father is what his friends call a patriot and his enemies a dangerous agitator he had to choose between ruin and acquiescence in corrupt tyranny and his course was plain but the seed he had sown sprouted the dictator was driven out and we came back to our own then for a time there was rest and safety until the new ruler began to follow the old he tried to bribe my father who had helped to put him in power but our honor was not for sale and we had to leave the capital there are men who trust my father and look to him for help but i think you know something of this  yes said grahame this afternoon we heard castillo speak in the plaza  the girls eyes flashed angrily  castillo is a fool he pulls down what others have carefully built up  tries to fire the mine before things are ready walthew suggested a premature explosions apt to blow up the men who prepared it  blanca gave him a keen glance  that is what nearly happened this afternoon i believe you are to be trusted señores  grahame bowed  i am an adventurer not a patriot and my partner is out for money but we made a bargain with don martin and we keep our word  then said the girl quietly castillo is hiding here  in the casa sarmiento isnt that dangerous wont the presidents friends suspect  i think they do but they are afraid of my fathers hold on the people and there is only a handful of troops when it is late they may make a search but castillo will leave soon it is possible that you are in some danger  walthew laughed  that makes things interesting ive never been in serious danger yet but i suppose you have don martins permission to be frank with us  you are shrewd she answered smiling he has some confidence in my judgment i spent the years that should have been happiest in poverty and loneliness are you surprised that im a conspirator if you value your safety you will beware of me  you might prove dangerous to your enemies but i believe youd be very staunch to your friends  gracias señor im sure i can at least hate well  a mulatto boy came out on to the balcony and the girls stout duenna who had been sitting silent and apparently half asleep rose and approached the table  don martin is disengaged she said to blanca and when the girl waited a moment grahame imagined that something had been left for her to decide  he did not see any sign exchanged but he thought with some amusement that he and his companion had passed a test when the duenna said to them  don martin would speak with you  walthew turned to blanca saying in castilian  until our next meeting i kiss your hands señorita  the girl rose with a grave curtsy and there was a touch of stateliness in her manner  may you go in safety señores we expect much from you  the mulatto led them away and passing through the house they found their host and another man sitting by a dim lamp in a room with the shutters carefully closed don martin sarmiento wore an alpaca jacket a white shirt and a black silk sash round the waist of his duck trousers he was darkhaired and sallow lightly built and thin but his expression was eager and his eyes were penetrating one could have imagined that his fiery spirit had worn down the flesh  the other man was of coarser type his skin was very dark his face hot and fleshy and grahame noticed that his hands were wet with perspiration his glance was restless and he had a rather truculent air though there was something in it that hinted at uneasiness grahame thought that while he might show a rash boldness now and then his nerve was not very good  with your permission i present my comrade señor castillo said don martin should any disaster overtake me señor castillo or another whom he appoints will carry out our contract our funds are in safe hands the rifles will be paid for  they will be delivered grahame answered quietly  good the word of a gentleman is sufficient and now there is something more to be said my house is my friends particularly if he is in trouble but one has higher duties than hospitality  yes agreed grahame turning to castillo the interests of ones country come first there are only three of us and don martin is the head of an important organization  it was not for my personal safety that i came here castillo broke in hotly i carried papers lists of names compromising details it was unthinkable that they should fall into the presidents hands they must be made safe and then it does not matter what happens to methough i may perhaps claim to have been of some help to the cause of freedom  grahame saw his hosts halfimpatient smile  and so you gave them to don martin he remarked dryly  he is not watched as i am castillo answered i am hunted among the sierras i hide in the fever swamps but where i pass i leave a spark that tyranny cannot trample out it burns and spreads by and by there comes the purging conflagration  yes said grahame im told however that your president has a keen scent for smoke and i dont mean to scatter more sparks than i can help he turned to don martin since our business is finished we can leave rio frio in an hour  i too exclaimed castillo it is not good for the cause that the soldiers find me but there are difficulties the house may be watched  don martin looked thoughtful but not disturbed and grahame saw that he could calmly take a risk danger and his host obviously were old acquaintances  it is better that you go he answered sometimes i entertain an american traveler and englishmen now and then visit rio frio i do not think you are suspected yet and you may be able to help us by drawing off the watchers attention when you leave we will see what can be done but it would be safer for señor castillo not to come with us  he took the others to the roof where he walked to the edge and looked over the low parapet a narrow dark street divided sarmientos house from the next but a lattice in a high wall was open and grahame imagined that he made out a mans head which was however promptly withdrawn  once or twice a guest of mine has reached the calle by a rope but the presidents friends take precautions tonight don martin remarked there remain the windows on the other side but castillo is heavy and fat i think the door into the plaza would suit him best  wouldnt the small one at the back be safer walthew suggested  that will be watched but it might be of some help if you went that way possibly you would not mind wearing a sombrero and a spanish cloak  not at all grahame assured him still there are two of us  that is an advantage if one leaves shortly after the other those who keep watch and expect a single man will be puzzled  walthew chuckled  good id a hankering after adventures and now it looks as if id be gratified but you had better not give us clothes with a name on them  in this country people out of favor with the government are modest about their names don martin rejoined  ten minutes later grahame wearing a wide black hat and a dark spanish cloak stepped quietly out into the shadowy street he had seen that his automatic pistol was ready to his hand having had more than one experience of the halfbreeds dexterity with the silent knife for all that his hurried stealthy gait was assumed and not natural to the man whose heart beat calmly though he cast quick glances about the houses were high and the street seemed to get narrower and darker as he went on then he imagined he heard soft steps behind him walking faster he stopped at a corner and listened somebody was certainly following him  grahames first impulse was to hide in a dark doorway and wait for his pursuer but he reflected that this would not fall in with his hosts plan and he went on keeping in the shadow while he made for the hotel at which he had left his mules there were he imagined two men following him now  a few moments afterward he reached the end of the dark street and the empty plaza lay before him the moon shed a faint light upon the stones and the high white walls and grahame was glad of this now if it were needful he could defend himself the walk through the shadow had been trying still he must not hurry for he never promised more than he meant to perform and he knew that don martin relied upon his playing out his part perhaps he overdid it when he stopped to light a cigarette for looking up as he dropped the match he saw two dark figures stop at the corner he had left then there was a low whistle and one of them disappeared grahame smiled because he knew that walthew had divided the attention of the spies the remaining man however walked quickly after him and when grahame was half way across the plaza he waited his pursuer seemed to hesitate for he came on more slowly and stopped a few yards off  the american he exclaimed  english said grahame calmly the difference is no doubt not important  the man looked hard at him and grahame carelessly dropped his hand upon his pistol  i am going to the fonda if you are going that way i would rather you walked in front one is careful at night my friend  though the fellow had a sinister look he smiled and went off with an apology and grahame going on to the hotel waited outside until walthew came up the boy looked hot and breathless but grahame noticed that he had a flower in his hand  ive been followed walthew laughed the fellows dropped back soon after i came into the moonlight guess they saw they were after the wrong man  very possibly it happened to me i wonder whether castillo got away  they listened but the town was quiet one or two citizens crossed the plaza but no sound that indicated anything unusual going on rose from the shadowy streets  it seems likely walthew replied i dont think they could have arrested him without some disturbance why didnt they search sarmientos house  perhaps they were afraid of starting a riot that would spread the president seems to be a capable man and don martin obviously enjoys the confidence of the citizens on the whole i think he deserves it  so do i walthew agreed what do you think of the other fellow  i wouldnt trust him hes no doubt sincere but im not sure of his nerve but where did you get the rose  on the pavement outside the casa sarmiento walthew answered with some embarrassment  mmm dropped from a window such things happen in spanishamerican towns and its possible that the presidents spies have noted it against you however youll be too busy to think of the señorita when we get back to the coast grahame paused and added it might be wise to remember that youre engaged in a dangerous business and cant run the risk of any complications neither of us can indulge in philandering until this jobs finished  ill take no risk that could get us into difficulties but thats all ill promise walthew said quietly  grahame gave him a steady glance  well i suppose i must be satisfied  they entered the hotel and half an hour later they left rio frio and rode down the hillside toward the misty swamps that fringed the coast     chapter iii  high stakes   the green shutters were half closed to keep the dazzling sunshine out of henry cliffes private sittingroom at the smart florida hotel but the fresh sea breeze swept in and tempered the heat the scent of flowers mingled with a delicate perfume such as fastidious women use but mrs cliffe was enjoying an afternoon nap and her daughter had gone out so that cliffe and robinson had the room to themselves they sat opposite each other at a small table on which stood a bottle and a cigar box but there was only iced water in the tall glass at cliffes hand  he had lunched sparingly as usual and now leaned back in his chair looking thoughtful his hair was turning gray and his face was thin and lined but there was a hint of quiet force about him his dress was plain but in excellent taste and he looked what he was a good type of the american business man who had however as sometimes happens to his kind sacrificed his health to commercial success he was a financier and a floater of companies which generally paid  robinson was tall with a high color a prominent hooked nose and a face of jewish cast his clothes were well cut but their adherence to the latest fashion was rather pronounced and he wore expensive jewelry he was favorably known on wall street and sometimes heard of when a corner was being manipulated in the chicago wheat pit cliffe had proposed a joint venture because he knew that robinson did not fear a risk and he had learned that a jew can generally be relied upon when the reckoning comes  well said robinson i see a chance of trouble if president altiera goes down we lose our money  a sure thing cliffe agreed it will be our business to keep him on his feet and it may cost us something in a way thats an advantage he must have our help and is willing to bid high for it  the revolutionaries may beat him  if hes left alone but a little money goes a long way in his country and the dissatisfied politicians would rather take some as a gift than risk their lives by fighting for it altiera can buy up most of them if he has the means and hes capable of quieting the rest in a more drastic way cliffe smiled as he continued its not my habit to plan a deal without carefully considering what i may get up against  then its your honest opinion the things a good business chance  i call it that one gets nothing for nothing if you expect a prize you must put up the stakes  very well suppose you get the concession is there gold worth mining in the country  i cant tell cliffe answered frankly the spaniards found a good deal three hundred years ago and now and then a halfbreed brings some out of the bush guess we could get enough to use as a draw in the prospectus  youd have to make the prospectus good robinson said with a thoughtful air not an invariable rule of course but our names stand for something with the investing public  i generally do make good if we dont strike gold theres rubber and the soil will grow highgrade cane and coffee give me the concession and ill make it pay  robinson nodded cliffes business talent was particularly marked in the development of virgin territory though he never undertook the work in person he knew where to find the right men and how far to trust them  i suppose we wont be required to meddle with dago politics robinson suggested  certainly not thats altieras affair and hes capable of looking after it a number of his people are getting tired of him but so long as he can pay his soldiers up to time and buy support where he cant use force hell keep control  a bit of a brute ive heard  hes not a humanitarian cliffe agreed still countries like his need a firm hand  guess thats so said robinson  he and cliffe were respected in business circles they met their obligations and kept the rules that govern financial dealings that they might now be lending their support to tyrannical oppression and helping to stifle the patriotic aspirations of a downtrodden people did not enter their minds that was not their affair they were out for money and their responsibility ended with the payment of dividends to those who bought their stock they would fulfill this duty if the thing were possible although their standard of morality was not of the highest they had prosperous rivals who fell short of it  ill stand in robinson decided after a few moments silence you can let me know how much you will need to carry you through when you get your plans worked out  very well its over the first payments we take a risk the money will so to speak vanish well have nothing to show for it except the good will of the men in power some of it may even get into the wrong hands  robinson made a sign of comprehension he knew something about official graft for he now and then found it needful to smooth the way for a new venture by judicious bribery  therell be no trouble after weve bought the concession cliffe continued the cash will then go to the treasury and whichever party gets control will have to stand to the bargain and now i guess we can let the matter drop until i fix things up  they went out to a seat on the veranda which looked across a row of dusty palmettos and a strip of arid lawn that the glistening showers from the sprinklers could not keep green an inlet of blue water ran up to its edge and beyond the curve of sheltering beach the long atlantic swell rolled into the bay flecked with incandescent foam for the sunshine was dazzling and the breeze was fresh two or three miles away there was a stretch of calmer water behind a long point on which the surf beat and in the midst of this a small steamer gently rolled at anchor nearer the inlet a little sailingboat stood out to sea her varnished deck and snowy canvas gleaming in the strong light  miss cliffes boat isnt it robinson remarked looks very small i spose shes safe  new york canoe club model cliffe replied had her brought down on a freightcar evelyns fond of sailing and smart at the helm shes all rightthough the breeze does seem pretty fresh  while they talked about other matters evelyn cliffe sat in the stern of the tiny sloop enjoying the sense of control the grasp of the tiller gave her and the swift rush of the polished hull through the sparkling foam there was also some satisfaction in displaying her nerve and skill to the loungers on the beach who were for the most part fashionable people from the northern states among these was a young man upon whom evelyn knew her mother looked with approval  though he had much to recommend him and had shown a marked preference for her society evelyn had come to no decision about reginald gore but she was willing that he should admire her seamanship and it was perhaps in the expectation of meeting him afterward that she had dressed herself carefully she wore wellcut blue serge that emphasized her fine pinkandwhite color and matched her eyes and the small blue cap did not hide her redgold hair  as the breeze freshened she forgot the spectators and began to wish she had taken a reef in the mainsail before starting hitherto she had had somebody with her when it was necessary to shorten canvas but it was unlike a sport to turn back because of a little wind she would stand on until she had weathered the point and was out on the open atlantic and then run home the strain on the helm got heavier the foam crept level with the lee deck and sometimes sluiced along it when the boat dipped her bows in a sea then the spray began to beat upon the slanted canvas and whipped evelyns face as she braced herself against the tiller  the boat was sailing very fast plunging through the sparkling ridges of water there was something strangely exhilarating in her speed and the way the foam swirled past evelyn had an adventurous temperament and being then twentythree was young enough to find a keen relish in outdoor sport now she was matching her strength and skill against the blue atlantic combers which were getting steeper and frothing on their crests the point was falling to leeward it would be a fair wind home and she determined to stand on a little longer casting a quick glance astern she saw that the figures on the beach had grown indistinct and small she felt alone with the sea at last and the situation had its charm but when she fixed her eyes ahead she wished that the rollers were not quite so large she had to ease the boat over them sometimes let the sheet run in the harder gusts and then it was not easy to get the wet rope in  when the point shut off the beach she saw she must come round and after waiting for a patch of smooth water put up the helm to jibe the strain on the sheet was heavier than she thought the rope bruised her fingers as it ran through them the boat rolled wildly and then the big sail swung over with a crash evelyn saw with alarm that the gaff along its head had stopped at an unusual angle to the canvas something had gone wrong but her nerve was good she could lower the mainsail and run home under the jib  when she left the helm the boat shot up into the wind with the long boom banging to and fro and the spray flying across her evelyn loosed the halyards but found that the gaff would not come down its end worked upon a brass slide on the mast and the grips had bent and jambed things now looked awkward it was blowing moderately fresh the sea was getting up and the sail she could not shorten might capsize the boat  with difficulty she got the sloop round but as the gaff was jambed she would not steer a course that would take her to the inlet and evelyn remembered with alarm that there was some surf on the beach she could swim but she shrank from the thought of struggling ashore from the wrecked craft through broken water still it was some comfort to see the point drop astern and the beach get nearer she was on the way to land there were boats on the inlet and somebody might notice that she was in difficulties no boat came off however and she realized that from a distance nothing might appear to be wrong with the sloop when she was near enough to signal for help it would be too late  a small steamer lurched at anchor not far away but evelyn could not reach her the sloop was like a bird with a broken wing and could only blunder clumsily in danger of capsizing before the freshening wind in another quarter of an hour she would be in the surf which now looked dangerously heavy  while she was trying to nerve herself for the struggle to land she saw a boat leave the steamers side it was a very small dinghy and there was only one man on board but he waved his hand as if he understood her peril and then rowed steadily to intercept her this needed judgment if he miscalculated the distance it would be impossible for him to overtake the sloop and evelyn could do nothing to help she must concentrate her attention upon keeping her craft before the wind if she jibed bringing the big sail violently over with its head held fast would result in a capsize  five minutes later she risked a glance the dinghy was close at hand lurching up and down lost from sight at intervals among the combers the man coatless and hatless seemed to be handling her with caution easing her when a roller with a foaming crest bore down on him but evelyn thought he would not miss her boat her heart beat fast as she put the helm hard down the sloop swung round slackening speed as she came head to wind there was a thud alongside and the man jumped on board with a rope in his hand  then things began to happen so rapidly that the girl could not remember exactly what was done but the man showed a purposeful activity he scrambled along the narrow deck got a few feet up the mast and the sail came down then he sprang aft to the helm and the sloop headed for the steamer with his dinghy in tow and only the jib set  they were alongside in a few minutes and he seized a rope that some one threw him  our gigs hauled up on the beach for painting and im afraid we couldnt reach the landing in the dinghy now the seas getting up he said youd better come on board and ill see if macallister can put your gaff right  evelyn hesitated for she suspected that it would take some time to mend the damaged spar it was not an adventure her mother would approve of but as she could see no way of reaching land she let the man help her through the gangway     chapter iv  the enchantress   on reaching the steamers deck evelyn glanced with curiosity at her rescuer he was a tall lightly built man dressed in an old blue shirt paintstained duck trousers and ragged canvas shoes but he had an easy manner that was not in harmony with his rough clothes evelyn liked his brown face it had a hint of force in it though now he was watching her with a halfamused smile he fell short of being handsome but on the whole his appearance made a good impression on the girl  then she looked about the vessel the deck finely laid with narrow planks was littered with odd spars rusty chain coal bags and pieces of greasy machinery as if repairs and refitting were going on she was a very small twomasted steamer carrying some sail for smokegrimed canvas was furled along the booms and evelyn thought she had been built for a yacht her narrow beam her graceful sweep of teakwood rail and the long tapering counter suggested speed a low leadgray funnel stood just forward of the mainmast and a teak house rising three or four feet above the deck occupied part of her length the brass boss of the steering wheel bore the name enchantress the after end of the house however was built of iron with raised lights in the top and the hammering and the pointed remarks that came up indicated that somebody below was grappling with refractory metal after one exclamation evelyns companion walked to the skylights  mack he said in a warning tone theres a lady on board  one o they halfdressed hussies from the hotel man i thought ye had mair taste a hoarse voice replied  evelyn was glad that her boating costume was not in the extreme of fashion for sleeves and skirts were severely curtailed then but she waited with some amusement  come up and dont talk said the man who had brought her on board heres a job for you  thats one thing ill never die for the want of the voice below went on ive got jobs enough already and no help wi them ye cannot make a mechanic out o a dago muleteer and the gangrel son o a rich american is no much better theyre wrecking the bonny mill and when i had them strike at a bit forging the weariful deevils smashed my finger i telt them  it wont stand for repeating let up youve the voice of a bull somebody broke in grahames waiting with a lady cant you get a move on  whats the lady wantingis it her watch mending the scot asked with a hint of eagerness a passion for tampering with the works of watches not infrequently characterizes the marine engineer  come and see called evelyns companion and a few moments later the mechanic appeared  he was big rather gaunt and very dirty but he carried himself well and had obviously just put on a smart blue jacket with brass buttons that bore the crest of an english mail line evelyn thought his age was between forty and fifty but his eyes had a humorous twinkle and his air was rakish behind him came a much younger man in greasy overalls  the engineer bowed to evelyn with some grace  yell be miss cliffe i ken ye by sight he said they telt me who ye were in the bar at the hotel  do they talk about me in such places evelyn asked with a touch of haughtiness  what would ye expect when yere born goodlooking ye must take the consequences but as grahame has nae manners ill present myselfandrew macallister extra chiefs ticket and noo through speaking my mind to a director engineer o this barge he indicated his greasy companion mr walthew who though ye might not think it by his look was taught at harvard if my temper stands the strain i may make a useful greaser o him yet the other ye nae doot ken  no said evelyn half amused he kindly came to my help when i was in trouble with my boat  then hes skipper they call him grahame and its a good scottish name but i was hoping ye had maybe some difficulty with your watch  why did you hope so evelyn asked laughing  on no account let him have it walthew interposed he brought back the last watch a confiding visitor left him with the gold case badly crushed i had to screw her in the vice but a bit rub with a file will smooth her off he told the owner  he was a fastidious beast o a custom house grafter macallister explained but if its no a watch what way can i serve ye  grahame took him to the sloop and showed him the gaff and a few minutes later he came back with the bent jaws  its no a bad piece o work your people have an eye for design but they make things too light he said noo ill cut ye a new grip out o solid brass but it will take an hour  i suppose i must wait theres no other way of getting back evelyn answered dubiously  macallister went below and grahame put a deck chair for evelyn under the awning in the stern where he sat down on a coil of rope while walthew leaned against the rail near by the girl felt interested in them all she had heard that walthew had been to harvard and his appearance suggested that he belonged to her own world if so what was he doing in the enchantresss engine room then macallisters random talk had some piquancy his manners were not polished but they were good in their way  the steamer is yours i suppose she remarked  yes said grahame we bought her cheap and are getting her ready for sea as i dare say you have noticed she needs refitting  but wouldnt that have been easier at new orleans or galveston  perhaps if we were able to hire professional assistance but we have to do the work ourselves and this place is quiet and clean for painting  arent you painting her an unusual color white would have been prettier than this dingy gray  whites conspicuous walthew answered and evelyn noticed grahames warning glance a neutral tint stands better and doesnt show the dirt you see we have to think of our pockets  then it isnt to be a pleasure trip where are you going  up the gulf stream to cuba first and then south and west wherever theres a chance of trade  but the boat is very small what do you think of trading in  anything that comes along walthew answered with a thoughtful air we might catch turtles for example  one understands that turtles are now farmed for the market  it would be cheaper to catch them we might get mahogany  but mahogany logs are big you couldnt carry many  we could tow them in a raft then the english and american tourists who come out in the mail boats might charter us for trips  im afraid youd find them exacting theyd expect nice berths and a good table do you carry a good cook  grahame chuckled and walthew grinned  modesty prevents my answering because my partners leave me to put up the hash ill admit it might be better but our passengers wouldnt find that out until we got them away at sea  evelyn was frankly amused she could not imagine his cooking very well but she liked his humorous candor  your plans seem rather vague she said  they are but one doesnt want a cut and dried program for a cruise about the spanish main one takes what comes along in the old days it used to be rich plate ships and windfalls of that kind and i guess theres still something to be picked up when you get off the liners track one expects to find adventures on the seas that drake and frobisher sailed  evelyn mused she was shrewd enough to perceive that the men were hiding something and they roused her curiosity but she thought walthew was right romance was not dead and the spanish main was a name to conjure with it brought one visions of desolate keys where treasure was hidden the rush of the lukewarm gulf stream over coral reefs of palmfringed inlets up which the pinnaces had crept to cut out spanish galleons and of old white cities that the buccaneers had sacked tragic and heroic memories haunted that blue sea and although luxurious mail boats plowed it now the passions of the old desperados still burned in the hearts of men  walthew was smoothfaced somewhat ingenuous and marked by boyish humor but evelyn had noticed his athletic form and thought he could be determined he was no doubt proficient in sports that demanded strength and nerve for all that it was grahame and his hawklike look that her thoughts dwelt most upon for something about him suggested that he had already found the adventures his comrade was seeking he was a soldier of fortune who had taken wounds and perhaps still bore their scars she remembered the cool judgment he had shown when he came to her rescue  walthew disturbed her reflections  it will be some time before andrew fixes your gaff and theres no use in trying to hurry him he said hes an artist in metal and never lets up until hes satisfied with a job so as you must wait and we have a kettle on the forge below i can offer you some tea and id like your opinion of the biscuit ive been baking for supper  evelyn felt doubtful she was spending the afternoon in a way her mother would certainly not approve of but she could not get ashore until the gaff was mended besides it was pleasant to sit under the awning with the fresh sea breeze on her face and listen to the splash of the combers on the bows then she was interested in her companions they were different from the rather vapid loungers she would have been talking to had she stayed at the hotel  she let walthew go and then turned to grahame  have you known your partner long she asked  no i met him for the first time in new orleans a few months ago  i asked because hes a type that im well acquainted with evelyn explained  and you would not have expected to find him cooking and cleaning engines on a boat like this  no theyre rather unusual occupations for a conventionally brought up young american  grahame smiled  i understand that walthew might have enjoyed all the comforts your civilization has to offer but he preferred the sea perhaps im prejudiced but i dont blame him theres a charm in freedom and the wide horizon  yes she agreed thoughtfully looking across the blue water i suppose thats true if a man has the courage to break away he can follow his bent its different with women were securely fenced in our corral walls are high  they keep trouble out hardship and danger arent pleasant things and after a time the romance of the freelances life wears off one sometimes looks longingly at the sheltered nooks that men with settled habits occupy  and yet you follow your star  stars too idealistic my bent is better whats born in one must have its way this is perhaps most convenient when its an inherited genius for making money  its useful to oneself and others evelyn agreed but do these talents run in the blood  it seems so grahame answered and was quiet for a time languidly watching the girl and wondering how far his statement was true  it might be argued that the strongest family strains must be weakened by marriage and their salient characteristics disappear in a few generations but he felt strangely akin to the mosstroopers of his name who scourged the scottish border long ago their restlessness and lust of adventure were his this however was not a matter of much consequence chance had thrown him into the company of a pretty and intelligent girl and he must try to entertain her  youre fond of the sea and adventurous or you wouldnt have driven that little sloop so far out under full sail he said  oh she admitted smiling that was partly because i wanted to show my skill and was ashamed to turn back when the breeze freshened  grahame laughed he liked her frankness  after all he said its a feeling that drives a good many of us on a weakness perhaps but it may be better than excessive caution  a matter of opinion of course if you determine never to do anything foolish youre apt to do nothing at all but im afraid i cant throw much light upon these subjects here comes our tea  it was drinkable but evelyn thought the biscuit could undoubtedly have been better for all that she enjoyed the meal and when it was over macallister appeared with the mended gaff  im thinking yon will never bend or jamb he said indicating the beautifully finished pieces of brasswork  evelyn thanked him and soon afterward grahame helped her into the boat and hoisted the reefed sail the wind was still fresh but the sloop ran shoreward safely with the sparkling seas ranging up on her quarter and grahame admired the grace of the neat blueclad figure at the helm the rushing breeze and the flying spray had brought a fine color into the girls face and a brightness to her eyes  as they neared the beach a gasolene launch came plunging out to meet them and evelyn laughed as she turned to grahame  ive been missed at last she said thats my father coming to look for me  the launch swung round close alongside and grahame recognized that he was being subjected to a keen scrutiny by a man on board the broken water however made explanations impossible and the launch followed the sloop to the inlet where evelyn neatly brought the craft up to the landing on getting ashore she spoke to cliffe and he thanked grahame and invited him to the hotel grahame politely declined but agreed to borrow the launch to take him on board  as he was leaving evelyn held out her hand  it was fortunate that my difficulties began when i was near your boat and i dont altogether regret them i have spent a pleasant afternoon she said  grahame bowed and turned away but somewhat to his surprise he found his thoughts return to his guest as the launch carried him back to the steamer the girl was cultured and intelligent perhaps a little romantic and unspoiled by luxury but this was nothing to him there were times when he felt lonely and outcast from his kind for until he met walthew his comrades had generally been rough and broken men some years ago he had been a favorite with wellbred women but he never met them on terms of friendship now he was poor and would no doubt remain so since he had not the gift of making money but an untrammeled wandering life had its advantages  with a smile at his brief relapse into sentiment he resolved to forget miss cliffe but he found it strangely difficult to occupy his mind with calculations about stores for the coming voyage  evelyn related her adventure to her mother who listened with strong disapproval mrs cliffe was a thin keeneyed woman with social ambitions and some skill in realizing them  if you hadnt been so rash as to go out alone this wouldnt have happened she remarked you must really be more careful  i couldnt prevent the gaffs jambing evelyn replied  that is not what i meant after all nobody in the hotel knows much about the matter and there is of course no need to do more than bow to the men if you meet them at the landing though it would be better to avoid this if possible a small favor of the kind they did you does not justify their claiming your acquaintance  father wanted to bring one of them here  your father is a man of business and has very little discretion in social matters mrs cliffe replied if reggie cannot go with you take the hotel boatman when you next go sailing  evelyn did not answer but she disagreed with the views her mother had expressed and she resolved to leave reggie ashore for one thing he was not of much use in a boat yet it was curious that she had once been pleased to take him out     chapter v  the call of the unknown   the sea breeze had fallen and the air was hot and still a full moon rested low in the eastern sky and against its light the tops of the royal palms cut in feathery silhouette evelyn was sitting in the hotel garden with reginald gore a dusky rose arbor hid them from the veranda where a number of the guests had gathered but evelyn imagined that one or two of the women knew where she was and envied her this once would have afforded her some satisfaction but it did not matter now and although the spot seemed made for confidential talk she listened quietly to the rollers breaking on the beach the roar of the surf had a disturbing effect she felt that it called urging her to follow her star and launch out on the deep her companion was silent and she wondered what he was thinking about or if as seemed more likely his mind was vacant she found him irritating tonight  gore was the finished product of a luxurious age wellbred welltaught and tastefully dressed his father had made a fortune out of railroad stock and although reginald had not the ability to increase it he spent it with prudence he had a good figure and a pleasant face but evelyn suspected that his highest ambition was to lounge through life gracefully  evelyn knew her mothers plans regarding him and had to some extent fallen in with them reggie had much that she valued to offer but she now and then found him tiresome he stood for the luxurious but in a sense artificial life with which she was growing dissatisfied she felt that she wanted stirring and must get into touch with the real things  youre not talkative she remarked watching the lights of the enchantress that swung and blinked with the tossing swell  no he agreed goodhumoredly doesnt seem to be much to talk about  there was silence for a few moments then evelyn put into words a train of thoughts that was forming indistinctly in her mind  you have never done anything very strenuous in life you have had all the pleasure money can provide one are you content  on the whole yes arent you  no said evelyn thoughtfully i believe i havent really been content for a long time but i didnt know it the mind can be doped but the effect wears off and you feel rather startled when you come to yourself  gore nodded  i know doesnt last but its disturbing when i feel like that i take a soothing drink  evelyn laughed for his answer was characteristic he understood to some extent but she did not expect him to sympathize with the restlessness that had seized her reggie would never do anything rash or unconventional hitherto she had approved his caution she had enjoyed the comfortable security of her station had shared her mothers ambitions and looked upon marriage as a means of rising in the social scale her adventurous temperament had found some scope in exciting sports and in an occasional flirtation that she did not carry far but she was now beginning to feel that life had strange and wonderful things to offer those who had the courage to seize them she had never experienced passionperhaps because her training had taught her to dread it but her imagination was now awake  her visit to the enchantress had perhaps had something to do with these disturbing feelings but not she argued because she was sentimentally attracted by her rescuer it was the mystery in which grahames plans were wrapped that was interesting he was obviously the leader of the party and about to engage in some rash adventure on seas the buccaneers had sailed this of course was nothing to her but thinking of him led her to wonder whether she might not miss much by clinging too cautiously to what she knew was safe  with a soft laugh she turned to gore  tell me about the dance theyre getting up i hear you are one of the stewards she said  it was a congenial topic and as she listened to her companions talk evelyn felt that she was being drawn back to secure familiar ground  cliffe in the meanwhile had come out in search of her and seeing how she was engaged had strolled into the hotel bar a tall bigboned man dressed in blue serge with brass buttons on his jacket was talking at large and cliffe stopping to listen thought the tales he told with dry scottish humor were good  you are the engineer who mended the gaff of my daughters boat cliffe said i must thank you for that it was a firstrate job  it might have been worse macallister modestly replied are ye a mechanic then  no but i know good work when i see it  im thinking thats a gift though ye may not use it much its no good work the worlds looking for  true agreed cliffe perhaps were too keen on what will pay  ye mean what will pay the first user an honest job is bound to pay somebody in the end  well i guess thats so youre a philosopher  macallister grinned  i have been called worse names and maybe with some cause consistency gets monotonous its better to be a bit of everything as the humor takes ye  what kind of engines has your boat cliffe asked he was more at home when talking practical matters  as fine a set o triples as ive clapped my eyes upon though they have been shamefully neglectit  and what speed can you get out of her  a matter o coal macallister answered with a twinkle a sevenknot bat will suit our purse best  cliffe saw that further questions on this point would be injudicious but the man interested him and he noted the flag on his buttons  well he said the enchantress must be a change from the liners you have sailed in  i find that but theres aye some compensation i have tools a man can work with and oil that will keep her running smooth yell maybe ken theres a difference in engine stores  ive heard my manufacturing friends say something of the kind  cliffe ordered refreshment and quietly studied his companion the man had not the reserve he associated with the scot but a dash and a reckless humor which are nevertheless essentially scottish too cliffe wondered curiously what enterprise he and his companions were engaged upon but he did not think macallister would tell him if the others were like this fellow he imagined that they would carry out their plans for he read resolution as well as daring in the scots character besides he had been favorably impressed by grahame  after some further talk macallister left and cliffe joined his wife and daughter  the next morning evelyn getting up before most of the other guests went out on the balcony in front of her room and looked across the bay the sun was not yet hot and a fresh breeze flecked the blue water with feathery streaks of white while the wet beach glistened dazzlingly there was a refreshing salty smell and for a few minutes the girl enjoyed the grateful coolness then she felt that something was missing from the scene and noticed that the enchantress had vanished the adventurers had sailed in the night on the whole she was conscious of relief they had gone and she could now get rid of the restlessness that their presence had caused after all there was peril in the longing for change it was wiser to be satisfied with the security and solid comfort which surrounded her  looking down at a footstep she saw gore strolling about the lawn faultlessly dressed in light flannel with a panama hat there was not a crease in his clothes that was out of place the color scheme was excellenteven his necktie was exactly the right shade he stood for all her mother had taught her to value wealth leisure and cultivated taste reggie was a man of her own kind she had nothing in common with the bronzed tarstained grahame whose hawklike look had for the moment stirred her imagination  you look like the morning gore called up to her wont you come down and walk to the beach the sun and breeze are delightful and well have them all to ourselves  evelyn noticed the hint of intimacy but it did not jar upon her mood and she smiled as she answered that she would join him  a few minutes later they walked along the hard white sand breathing the keen freshness of the spray  what made you get up so soon evelyn asked  its not hard to guess i was waiting for my opportunity youre in the habit of rising in good time  well she said with a bantering air i think waiting for opportunities is a habit of yours of course you have some excuse for this  gore looked puzzled for a moment and then laughed  i see what you mean as a rule the opportunities come to me  dont they i wonder whether youre much happier than the men who have to make or look for them  i cant say because i havent tried that plan i cant see why i should look for anything when i dont have to anyway i guess im a pretty cheerful person and easy to get on with its the strivers whore always getting after something out of reach that give you jars  youre certainly not a striver evelyn agreed however you seem to have all a man could want  not quite he answered ill confess that im not satisfied yet but i try to make the most of the good things that come alongand im glad i got up early its a glorious morning  evelyn understood reggie was not precipitate and feared a rebuff she believed that she could have him when she liked but he would look for some tactful sign of her approval before venturing too far the trouble was that she did not know if she wanted him  she changed the subject and they paced the beach engaged in goodhumored banter until the breakfast gong called them back to the hotel  in the afternoon however evelyns mood changed again the breeze died away and it was very hot everybody was languid and she found her friends dull although gore tried to be amusing his conversation was unsatisfactory and the girls about the hotel seemed more frivolous and shallow than usual none of these people ever did anything really worth while evelyn did not know what she wished to do but she felt that the life she led was unbearably stale  when dark fell and the deep rumble of the surf filled the air she sat with her father in a quiet corner of the garden  didnt you say you might make a short business trip to the west indies she asked him  yes i may have to spend a week in havana  then i wish you would take me  it might be arranged said cliffe he seldom refused her anything your mother wouldnt come but she has plenty of engagements at home why do you want to go  evelyn found this hard to answer but she tried to formulate her thoughts  cuba is of course a new country to me and i suppose we all feel a mysterious attraction toward what is strange had you never a longing for something different something out of the usual run  i had when i was young  but you dont feel it now  one learns to keep such fancies in their place when business demands it cliffe answered with a dry smile i can remember times when i wanted to go off camping in the canadian rockies and join a canoe trip on labrador rivers now and then in the hot weather the traffic in the markets and the dusty offices make me tired ill confess that ive felt the snowpeaks and the rapids call  we went to banff once said evelyn it was very nice  but not the real thing you saw the high peaks from the hotel garden and the passes from an observation car then we made one or two excursions with packhorses guides and people like ourselves where it was quite safe to go that was as much as your mother could stand for shed no sympathy with my hankering after the lone trail  evelyn could see his face in the moonlight and she gave him a quick look her father it seemed had feelings she had never suspected in him  but if you like the mountains couldnt you enjoy them now  no he said rather grimly the grip of my business grows tighter all the time it costs a good deal to live as we do and i must keep to the beaten tracks that lead to places where money is made  i sometimes think we are too extravagant and perhaps more ostentatious than we need be evelyn said in a diffident tone  we do what our friends expect and your mother has been accustomed to then its my pleasure to give my daughter every advantage i can and when the time for her to leave us comes to see she starts fair  evelyn was silent for a few moments feeling touched she had formed a new conception of her father who she had thought loved the making of money for its own sake now it was rather startling to find that in order to give her mother and herself all they could desire he had held one side of his nature in subjection and cheerfully borne a life of monotonous toil  i dont want to leave you she said in a gentle voice  he looked at her keenly and she saw that her mother had been speaking to him about gore  well he responded i want to keep you as long as possible but when you want to go i must face my loss and make the best of it in the meanwhile well go to cuba if your mother consents  evelyn put her hand affectionately on his arm  whatever happens she said softly you wont fail me im often frivolous and selfish but its nice to know i have somebody i can trust     chapter vi  on the spanish main   there had been wind but it had fallen toward evening and the enchantress rolled in a flat calm when her engines stopped as she swung with the smooth undulations blocks clattered booms groaned and the water in her bilges swirled noisily to and fro it was difficult to move about the slanted deck and two darkskinned barefooted seamen were seated forward with their backs against the rail a comrade below was watching the engine fires and with the exception of her spanish helmsman this was all the paid crew the enchantress carried  she drifted east with the gulf stream around her there hung a muggy atmosphere pervaded with a curious hothouse smell grahame stood in the channels heaving the lead he found deep water but white patches on the northern horizon where the expanse of sea was broken by spouts of foam marked a chain of reefs and keys that rose a foot or two above the surface a larger streak of white was fading into the haze astern but grahame had carefully taken its compass bearings because dusk which comes suddenly in the bahama channel was not far away he dropped the lead on deck and joined macallister who stood in the engineroom doorway rubbing his hands with cotton waste  no sign o that steamboat yet the scot asked  its hazy to the east said grahame we mightnt see her until shes close if theyre not making much smoke still she ought to have turned up last night  shell come a tornado wouldna stop her skipper when he had freight to collect but ye were wise in no paying it in advance  you havent seen the fellow  ive seen his employers macallister replied with a chuckle weel i ken what sort o man would suit them gang canny when ye meet him and see ye get the goods before ye sign the bill o lading  i mean to take precautions no firstclass firm would touch our business  verra true and when ye find men whore no particular about one thing ye cannot expect them to be fastidious about another when i deal wi yon kind i keep my een open  wheres walthew  macallister grinned  asleep below wi his hair full o coaldust looking more like a nigger than the son o a rich american human natures a verra curious thing but if he can stand another month ill hae hope o him  i think the lads right he wants to run his life on his own lines and he is willing to pay for testing them by experience  grahame glancing forward suddenly became intent for in one spot a dingy smear thickened the haze it slowly grew more distinct and he gave a seaman a quick order before he turned to his companion  that must be the miranda you can start your mill as soon as we have launched the dinghy  by the time the boat was in the water the steamer had crept out of the mist she came on fast a small twomasted vessel with a white wave beneath her full bows and a cloud of brown smoke trailing across the sea astern she was light floating high above the water which washed up and down her wet side as she rolled a few heads projected over the iron bulwark near the break of the forecastle and two men in duck stood on the bridge studying them through the glasses grahame saw they had an unkempt appearance and he was not prepossessed in favor of the one whom he took to be the captain  he rang the telegraph and when the engines stopped he jumped into the dinghy with walthew and one of the seamen five minutes later they ceased rowing close to the steamers side which towered high above them red with rust along the waterline the black paint was scarred and peeling higher up the white deckhouses and boats had grown dingy and there was about her a povertystricken look the boat swung sharply up and down a few lengths away for the sea broke about the descending rows of iron plates as the vessel rolled  enchantress ahoy shouted one of the men on her bridge this is the miranda spose youre ready for us  weve been ready for you since last night grahame replied  then you might have got your gig over we cant dump the stuff into that cockleshell  you cant grahame agreed the gigs hardly big enough either and i wont risk her alongside in the swell thats running  then what do you expect me to do wait until its smooth  no said grahame well have wind soon youll have to take her in behind the reef as your owners arranged its not far off and youll find good anchorage in six fathoms  and lose a day what do you think your few cases are worth to us  the freight agreed upon grahame answered coolly you cant collect it until you hand our cargo over ill take you in behind the reef and bring you out in three or four hours therell be a good moon  the skipper seemed to consult with the man beside him and then waved his hand  all right go ahead with your steamer and show us the way  id better come on board grahame answered its an awkward place to get into but i know it well  a colored seaman threw them down a rope ladder and pulling in cautiously grahame waited until the rolling hull steadied when he jumped walthew followed and in a few moments they stood on the mirandas deck walthew had been wakened when the boat was launched and he had not had much time to dress but he wore a fairly clean duck jacket over his coaly shirt his bare feet were thrust into greasy slippers and smears of oil darkened the hollows round his eyes  one or two slouching deckhands watched the new arrivals with dull curiosity and a few more were busy forward opening the hatch grahame thought the vessel a rather unfavorable specimen of the small cheaply run tramp but when he reached the hatch the skipper came up he was a little man with a bluff manner a hard face and cunning eyes  theyll have the cover off in a minute and you can see your stuff he said and called to a man with a lantern stand by with the light  when the tarpaulin was rolled back grahame went down with a mate and counted the wooden cases pointed out to him after this he examined their marks and numbers and going up declared himself satisfied  now said the skipper you can take us in the sooner the better because it will be dark before long would you like a drink before you start  grahame said that he would wait until he had finished his work he followed the skipper to the bridge and rang the telegraph  the miranda went ahead her propeller hurling up the foam as it flapped round with half the blades out of the water while the enchantress crept slowly up her frothstreaked wake grahame standing at the wheelhouse door was glad that walthew had come with him although this reduced his vessels crew macallister however was capable of managing his engines without assistance for a time and could be trusted to take charge of the enchantress if necessary for grahame did not think the hands would give him trouble one was a canary spaniard whom they had picked up at matanzas a very simple and grahame thought honest fellow the other three were stupid but apparently goodhumored halfbreeds grahame would have preferred white seamen but for the danger of their getting into trouble in parts where wine was cheap and perhaps betraying the object of the voyage in drunken boasts his business would not bear talking aboutand that was why he distrusted the mirandas captain  the moon rose before the short twilight had changed to dark and the steamer moved on across the dimly glittering sea until a long white line grew plainer ahead as they drew near the line could be seen to waver gaining breadth and distinctness and then fading while a dull roar which had a regular beat in it mingled with the thud of the engines though the miranda rolled and plunged the surface of the water was smooth as oil and in the deep calm the clamor of the surf had an ominous sound then another white patch appeared to starboard and a few moments later a third to port  the captain was pacing up and down his bridge  its a puzzling light he said stopping near grahame with a frown i suppose you do know the place  oh yes said grahame carelessly we made a rough survey and took soundings but slow her down and use your lead if you like  thats what i mean to do the captain replied  he rang the telegraph and when the beat of engines slackened a man stood on a footboard outside the bridge where a broad canvas belt was fastened round his waist whirling the heavy plummet round his head he let it shoot forward to the break of the forecastle and steadied the line a moment when it ran vertically up and down  by the deep eight he called  starboard said grahame and there was silence except for the rumble of the surf while the quartermaster turned his wheel in the glassfronted house  in a few minutes the lead plunged down again  by the mark seven was announced  the captain gave grahame a quick glance and then looked ahead where there was something to occupy him for at regular intervals the sea was torn apart and a spout of foam and a cloud of spray shot up moreover the vessel was heading directly toward the dangerous spot it was not needful for grahame to take her so close as he meant to do but he had reasons for letting the nearness of the reef appeal to the captains imagination  and a quarter six the leadsman called  the captain grasped the telegraph  if you mean to go any closer ill stop her and back out he said then you can tranship your goods outside or ill take them on as you like  we can let her come round now grahame answered and beckoned to the quartermaster starboard steady at that  the miranda swung until the frothy confusion on the reef where the swell broke in cascades of phosphorescent flame bore abeam and then a similar troubled patch grew plain on the opposite bow there was however a smooth dark strip between and she followed it shouldering off a spangled wash with the propeller beating slow ahead a low hazy blur rose out of the sea and when grahame spoke to the captain the windlass began to clank and indistinct figures became busy on the forecastle then a gray strip of sand came into sight and grahame nodded to the anxious captain  you can let go here but dont give her much cable  the anchor splashed from the bows there was a roar of running chain the throb of the screw slowly turning astern and a screaming of startled birds she brought up the noise died away and the silence was emphasized by the clamor of the surf on the opposite shore of the key the captain looked about with a frown for the desolation of the spot and the nearness of the reefs had their effect on him  hail them to get your gig over at once and then well have a drink he said  macallister answered grahames shout for the enchantress had anchored close astern and the boat was hanging from her davits when he followed the captain into his room the vessels rolled lazily and the swell broke with a languid splash upon the beach for the bight was sheltered by the reefs the small room was lighted by an oil lamp and was very hot a pilot coat damp with salt and a suit of oilskins swung to and fro across the bulkhead and a pair of kneeboots stood in a corner two or three bad photographic portraits were tacked against the teakwood paneling but except for these all that the room contained suggested stern utility  unlocking a cupboard the captain took a bottle and some glasses from a rack and walthew coughed as he tasted the fiery spirit  thats powerful stuff but the flavors good he said with an attempt at politeness  a big greasy man who the captain informed the others was mr james his chief engineer came in he sat down with his feet on the locker and helped himself liberally to the spirits in the meanwhile the captain put an inkstand on the small folding table  you have the bill of lading endorse it that youve got delivery and ill give you a receipt for the freight  grahame glanced at walthew who sat nearest the door and the lad looked out  the gigs alongside ready for the cases he said  well heave them up as soon as weve finished this business the captain replied  grahame wrote a check and put it on the table with some american paper currency  your owners have satisfied themselves that this will be met i thought id better keep the other amount separate  thats all right the captain returned but youre a hundred dollars short  i guess youre mistaken walthew said weve paid the freight and a bonus to yourself as we promised because it was an awkward job what else do you want  a bonus for the engineer the greasy mechanic answered with a grin  precisely said the captain  then im afraid youll be disappointed grahame said and walthew picked up the check which still lay on the table  there was silence for a few moments while the mirandas officers looked hard at their visitors grahames face was impassive but there was a gleam of amusement in walthews eyes  now you listen to me said the captain mr james is entitled to his share and he means to get it you dont suppose hed take a hand in a risky job like this entirely for the benefit of the owners  mr james said walthew runs no risk that i can see however if you think he has a right to something you can divide with him  no sir what you have given me is mine but theres another point youve overlooked the crew expect a few dollars and it might be wise to satisfy them  grahame smiled  they certainly struck me as a hard crowd but seamen dont rob cargoshippers nowadays then its difficult to imagine that you told them whats in the cases in fact the way they obeyed your mate suggested that theres not much liking between men and officers on board this packet if there was any trouble i dont know that theyd take your side  the captain frowned and james drained his glass again and then struck the table  think something of yourselves i reckon but weve come out on top with smarter folks than you put down your money like gentlemen and say no more  its good advice the captain added meaningly  guess we disagree walthew said putting the check into his pocket you havent got your freight payment yet  do you think you can keep that check  well said walthew coolly we could cable the bank to stop payment from the nearest port for that matter im not certain that you could take it back  were willing to try the big engineer scowled  and you dont get the goods until were satisfied the captain added  may i ask what you would do with the cases theyre consigned to us and youd have some trouble in passing them through a foreign customs house they open things and inspect the contents when the dutys high  we could dump them overboard better do the fair thing by us and get delivery  i dont think were unfair walthew replied we engaged with your owners to pay a stipulated freight and added a bonus for the skipper now we put down the money and want our goods  the winch that heaves them up doesnt start without my order james said with an ugly laugh  grahame turned to the captain with a gesture of weariness  we dont seem to get much farther i suspect youve forgotten something how much a day does it cost you to run this ship  what has that got to do with it the captain asked curtly  well said grahame coolly theres a risk of your stopping here for some time its an awkward place to get out of unless you know it well particularly when its blowing fresh the northers hardly reach so far but they unsettle the weather and when the winds from seaward a strong eddy stream runs through the bight perhaps you may have noticed that the glass is falling fast  the captain looked disturbed but he was not to be beaten so easily  you dont get back on board your boat until youve taken us out he threatened  i can take you out tonight but if you miss your chance and have to wait we can afford it best our expenses arent heavy but youll have to account to your owners for the delay that wont cost us much besides youd be forced to keep steam up in case she dragged its bad holding ground  there was silence for a few moments and then the captain made a sign of surly acquiescence  very well we wont argue about the bonus give me the check  i think well wait until the cases are transhipped walthew said with a smile  give them steam for the winch mr james the captain ordered and the engineer slouched away  the winch began to rattle and an hour or two later grahame went up to the bridge while the anchor was broken out when the men were stowing it the engines throbbed and the miranda turned her head toward open water in another half hour the propeller stopped and the captain turned to his guests with a grin as the enchantresss gig came alongside  i expect the dagoes youre shipping those rifles for will find you hard to beat he said     chapter vii  mangrove creek   there was not a ripple on the sea when the enchantress steaming slowly closed with the coast the glittering water broke with a drowsy murmur at her bows and turned from silver to a deep blue in the shadow of the hull her wake was marked by silky whirls on the back of the swell it was four oclock in the afternoon the sea flung back a dazzling light and grahames eyes ached as he searched the approaching land with his glasses  far back blue mountains loomed through haze and the foreground was blurred and dim one could not tell where the low expanse began or ended though a broad dark fringe which grahame knew was forest conveyed some idea of distance in one or two spots a streak of white indicated surf upon a point but the picture was flooded with a glare in which separate objects lost distinctness blue and gray and silver melted into one another without form or salient line  grahame put down the glasses and turned to the seaman near him miguel was getting old but his tall figure was strong and he stood finely posed with a brown hand on the wheel his face was rugged but he had clear blue eyes that met one with a curious childlike gaze he was barefooted and his thin cotton trousers and canvas jacket were spotlessly clean though grahame imagined he had made the latter out of a piece of old awning they had meant to throw away  you come from the canaries dont you miguel grahame asked in castilian it is not so hot there  from san sebastian señor where the tradebreeze blows and the datepalms grow my house stands among the tunafigs beside the muletrack to the mountains  then you have a house who takes care of it while you are away  my señora she packs the tomatoes they send to england it is hard work and one earns a peseta a day  then why did you leave her grahame asked for he knew that a peseta which is equal to about twenty cents will not buy much of the coarse maizeflour the canary peasants live upon  there came a great tempest and when my three boats were wrecked something must be done my sons were drawn for the navy they had no money to send for years señor i was captain of a schooner fishing bacalao on the african coast and when i came home to catch tunny for the italian factory things went very well then the gale swept down from the peaks one night and in the morning the boats were matchwood on the reef  ah said grahame he could sympathize for he too had faced what at the time had seemed to be overwhelming disaster so you sailed to look for better fortune somewhere else you hope to go back to san sebastian some day  if my saint is kind but perhaps it is well that he is a very great angel for fortune is not always found when one looks for it at sea  there was no irony in miguels answer his manner was quietly dignified indeed though he had been taught nothing except rudimentary seamanship he had the bearing of a fine gentleman  wages are good in english and american ships grahame resumed feeling that he was guilty of impertinence sometimes you are able to send the señora a few dollars  i send all but a little to buy clothes when i go where it is cold and my señora buries the money to buy another boat if it is permitted that i return once or twice a year comes a letter written by the priest and i keep it until i find a man who can read it to me  grahame was touched there was something pathetic in the thought of this untaught exiles patiently carrying the precious letters until he met somebody who could read his language  well he said if things go well with us you will get a bonus besides your wages which should make it easier for you to go home but you understand there is danger in what we may have to do  miguel smiled  señor there is always danger on the sea  grahame turned and saw walthew standing in the engineroom door he wore dirty overalls and a singlet torn open at the neck there was a smear of oil across his face and his hands were black and scarred  what on earth have you been doing grahame asked  lying on my back for two hours trying to put a new packing in the gland of a pump  well who would have predicted a year ago that you would be amusing yourself this way now  walthew laughed  do you know where we are he asked  i imagine were not far off the creek in fact we might risk making the signal smoke it will be dark enough to head inshore in a few hours  then well get to work with the fires said walthew promptly disappearing below  soon afterward a dense black cloud rose from the funnel and trailing away behind the enchantress spread across the sky grahame knew that it might be seen by unfriendly watchers but other steamers sometimes passed the point for which he was steering after a while he signaled for less steam and only a faint widening ripple marked the enchantresss passage through the water as she closed obliquely with the land it was still blurred and in an hour grahame stopped the engines and took a cast of the lead dark would come before long when if they had reached the right spot signals would be made in the meanwhile it would be imprudent to venture nearer  walthew and one of the seamen set out a meal on deck and when it was eaten they lounged on the stern grating smoking and waiting there was dangerous work before them and to make things worse it must be done in the dark because the moon now shone in the daytime it was very hot and a steamy spicy smell drifted off the coast which grew less distinct as the darkness settled down a faint rumble of surf reached them from an unseen beach rising and falling with a rhythm in it the black smoke had been stopped and thin gray vapor rose straight up from the funnel the quietness and the suspense began to react upon the mens nerves they felt impatient and highly strung but they talked as carelessly as they could  then in the quietness the roar of the sea on sandy shoals reached them ominously clear grahame glanced shoreward but could see nothing for the sun had gone and a thin mist was spreading across the low littoral  were drifting inshore he said as soon as i get four fathoms well steam out try a cast of the lead  walthew swung the plummet and they heard it strike the sea  half a fathom to the good he called as he coiled up the wet line then he stopped looking toward the land whats that he said yonder abreast of the mast  a twinkling light appeared in the mist and grew brighter  a fire i think grahame answered quietly still ones not enough  a second light began to glimmer and soon another farther on  macallister chuckled  yere a navigator our friends are ready ive seen many a worse landfall made by highlytrained gentlemen with a big mail companys buttons  a lucky shot but you had better stand by below start her easy  he blew three blasts on the whistle and the fires went out while the enchantress moved slowly shoreward through the gloom miguel held the wheel and grahame stood near by watching the halfbreed who swung the lead presently another light twinkled and listening hard grahame heard the splash of paddles stopping the engines he waited until a low gray object crept out of the mist and slid toward the steamers side ropes were thrown and when the canoe was made fast the first of the men who came up ceremoniously saluted grahame  you bring the goods all right he asked  theyre ready if it makes no difference id rather wait until tomorrow before delivering them i understand the beach is mostly mangrove swamp and its a dark night to take the steamer up the creek  tomorrow she be seen the coast is watch by spy said the other in his quaint english then indicated his companion dese man he takes her anywhere  grahame hesitated  secrecy was essential and if he waited for daylight and was seen by watchers who had noticed the smoke in the afternoon he might not have an opportunity for landing another cargo for all that knowing nothing about his pilots skill he imagined he ran some risk of grounding if he took the steamer in risks however could not be avoided  very well he decided send him to the wheel  he kept the lead going as the enchantress crept forward and was relieved to find that the water got no shallower it looked as if the pilot were following a channel for the wash of the sea on hidden shoals began to rise from both sides except for this and the measured throb of the engines there was deep silence but after a while the vessel which had been rolling gently grew steady and grahame thought he could hear the water she threw off splash upon a beach he looked about eagerly but there was nothing to be seen this creeping past invisible dangers was daunting but he felt comforted as he glanced at the motionless dark figure at the helm the fellow showed no hesitation it was obvious that he knew his business  through the darkness low trees loomed up ahead and shortly afterward another clump abeam mist clung about them there was not much space between and the absence of any gurgle at the bows indicated that the enchantress was steaming up the inlet with the tide the lead showed sufficient water but grahame had misgivings for the creek seemed to be getting narrower it was however too late to turn back he must go on and trust to luck  some time later a light appeared among the trees and the pilot ordered the engines to be stopped then he pulled the helm over and waved his hand as the enchantress swung inshore  la ancla he cried let her go  there was a splash and a sharp rattle of chain and when the enchantress stopped the beat of paddles came out of the gloom then the cargolamp was lighted and in a few minutes a group of men climbed on board some were dusky halfbreeds but two or three seemed to be of pure spanish extraction grahame took these below where they carefully examined the cases when they were satisfied they followed him to the deckcabin and walthew brought them some wine one man gave grahame a check on an american bank and shortly afterward the work of getting up the cargo began  everybody became suddenly busy shadowy figures dragged the cases about the shallow hold and fixed the slings darkskinned men dripping with perspiration slackened guys and swung the derrickboom while canoes crept into the light of the cargolamp and vanished loaded into the dark the stir lasted for some time and then after the cases had all been hoisted over the side the white men among the shore party shook hands with their hosts  it is all right said the spokesman we are ready for the next lot when you get back  i suppose your man will be here in the morning to take us out grahame asked because he had been told that it was too late to leave the creek that tide  if nothing is happen he certainly come  the visitors got on board their canoe and it slid off into the mist when the splash of paddles died away an oppressive silence settled down on the vessel and the darkness seemed very thick for the big cargolamp had been put out after the keen activity a reaction had set in the men were tired and felt the heat  its lonesome macallister remarked and sniffed disgustedly like a hothouse in a botanic garden when theyve full steam on with a dash o glasgow sewer thrown in in fact ye might call the atmosphere a wee bit high  i dont suppose you found it very fresh in west africa walthew replied  i did not thats maybe the reason the ague grips me noo and then yell learn something about handling engines when it takes me bad this is a verra insidious smell  the mosquitos are worse grahame said i wonder whether there are many of them about anyway id like a warp taken out and made fast to the trees theres not much room to swing and though the flood generally runs harder than the ebb in these places one cant count on that  walthew got into the boat with miguel and one of the crew and came back half an hour later smeared with mire and wet to the waist  weve made the rope fast but this creek has no beach he said the trees grow out of the water and you slip off their roots into holes filled with slime couldnt feel any bottom in one or two and i was mighty glad i caught a branch in fact weve had a rather harrowing experience  get your wet clothes off and take some quinine before you go to sleep grahame advised and when walthew left him he watched the men heave the warp tight  soon afterward the crew went below except for one who kept anchorwatch the ebb tide was running strong and grahame was not quite satisfied about the way the vessel was moored it was however impossible to make her more secure in the dark and getting sleepy presently he left his seat on the stern grating and went to his berth     chapter viii  the traitor   grahame was awakened by a crash springing half asleep from his berth he scrambled out on deck thick darkness enveloped the steamer and at first he could see nothing then as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom he made out indistinct black trees in the mist they were sliding past and he knew the warp had broken and the enchantress would swing inshore before her cable brought her up this must be prevented if possible for the creek was narrow and shoal  jumping on the stern grating he gave his orders and they were obeyed he saw macallister in pajamas dive into the engineroom and the screw began to throb then barefooted men sprang into the boat alongside and a heavy rope ran out across the rail there was nothing more to be done for a few moments and lashing the wheel grahame hurriedly lighted a pyrotechnic flare the strong blue radiance drove back the gloom and the water glittered among cakes of floating scum then the bright beam picked out the boat with walthew toiling halfnaked at an oar and miguels tall figure bending to and fro as he sculled astern another man was rowing forward and his tense pose told of determined effort but he vanished as the light moved on  the rope the crew were taking out fixed grahames attention it crawled through the water in heavy coils like a snake holding the boat back while the stream swept her sideways he did not think she could reach the opposite bank though the enchantress was sheering that way to help her then the light forced up a patch of greasy mud in which crawling things wriggled and passing on picked out foul dark caves among the mangrove roots after that it touched the rows of slender trunks and was lost in impenetrable gloom  a few moments later the flare burning low scorched grahames fingers and he flung it over the rail it fell with a hiss into the creek and bewildering darkness shut down there was now no guide but the strain on the helm and grahame began to be afraid of breaking out the anchor for a time the splash of oars continued telling of the tense struggle that went on in the gloom but it stopped suddenly and he knew the men were beaten ringing off the engines he ran forward with a deckhand to drop the kedge anchor it was heavy an arm was foul of something and they could not drag it clear until a dim object appeared close by  heave cried a breathless voice handy noo away she goes  there was a splash and a rattle as the chain ran out a thud as the returning boat came alongside and then the vessel quivered listed down on one side and became motionless  im thinking shes hard and fast but well try to shake her off macallister said and vanished and soon the engines began to turn  the enchantress trembled straining hard and rattling but when somebody lighted the cargolamp which still hung from a boom it could not be seen that she moved the light showed a narrow stretch of water sliding past blotched with foul brown foam then it fell upon the boats crew who had come on board and grahame saw that walthew was gasping for breath his flushed face was wet and drawn with effort and his bare arms and neck were marked by small red spots  sorry we couldnt manage to reach the bank he panted warp kept getting across her and the stream was running fast but id better help mack  sit still a minute grahame said what are those marks on your neck  mosquito bites i guess hadnt time to swat the brutes they were pretty fierce  the deck was now slanting steeply and grahame looking over the rail saw a wet strip a foot broad between the dry planks and the water  you can tell mack to shut off steam he said shes here until next tide and im not certain we can float her then  the engines stopped there was by contrast a curious stillness and the men went below but grahame spent some time studying a chart of the coast and a nautical almanac before he went to sleep                                       when the cases had been safely landed the little group of spaniards and halfbreeds separated some following the coastline going south others finding a narrow path that led through the jungle beyond the mangrovetrees bio the peon pilot lingered behind there was no moon but the night was not really dark for the sky was jeweled with stars which covered the earth with a soft mystic radiance  when the footsteps of the others had died away and the night was quiet bio started slowly down the jungle path it opened out into a flat stretch of sandy land and then was lost in a plantation of coffeetrees beyond the coffee plantation was an uncultivated space known to the natives as la colina del sol the hill of the sun because of the many broad rocks upon which the sun beat down in all its intensity here and there a wild datepalm grew and an occasional clump of bananas but except for that the hill was covered with low shrubbery and a blanket of trailing vines which now were wet with the dew  bio went directly to one of the rocks and stood upon it looking upward at the stars the warmth that still remained in the rock was pleasant to his damp bare feet the air about him was filled with the soft flutter of moths and other honeyseekers the heavy perfume of a white jasmine came to him mingled with the sweet odor of the nightblooming cereus at his side an insect chirped and above him a whistling frog gave answer  these wild night sounds found quick response in bios indian blood with an odd little smile of content he stretched out on the rock to listenand to sleep at high tide he would have to return to take the boat out of mangrove creek what better place to wait than la colina del sol  he awakened shortly after daybreak very hungry but he knew where he could get a pleasant breakfast before returning to the boat with a comfortable yawn and stretch he left the rock and pattered off down the hill to a path that led to the main road a half mile down this stood a little adobe house owned by a spaniard who was suspected of sympathizing with the revolutionists although he had many friends among the rurales  when bio reached the house he gave his customary signala stick drawn harshly across the iron gratings at the window and the door was soon opened by filodomo himself a hasty conversation followed and bio went back to the kitchen while filodomo aroused his daughter and when the blackeyed rosita came tripping out with the flush of sleep still on her bio all but forgot the yanqui señores and their boat which waited in mangrove creek  he was enjoying his breakfast so much indeed that he did not hear filodomo talking loudly in the front room rosita was more alert she paused a moment to listen and then the laughter in her eyes changed to quick alarm  los rurales she whispered  bio was on his feet instantly the rurales had several counts against him and he knew what his life would be worth if he were caught rosita too seemed to know she led him quickly to the low window and pointed to a narrow path that led through a field of cane bio lost no time as he disappeared among the green stalks the girl gave a sigh of relief and then hurried into the front room to put the rurales off his path  bio made his way quickly but cautiously through the canefield meaning to double back to la colina del sol but as he left the cane and rounded a gigantic calabashtree he ran directly into the arms of two young rurales  not so fast my friend said one of them grabbing him  bio exclaimed the other  and bio knew there was no hope of escape the rurales were only too eager for the credit of capturing him and taking him to headquarters  four days later he found himself in a military camp and was led at once to the officer in charge during all the questions of the rurales he had maintained a sullen silence but now he was forced to speak  we are told that the revolutionists are getting rifles from a little boat that lands them at impossible places the officer said only a pilot with your knowledge of the coast could bring in such a boat tell us what you know  bio did not answer  the officer leaned forward threateningly  we have enough charges against you to warrant our shooting you on the spot he said you will never see another sunrise unless you tell usand tell us quickly and truthfully  a gleam of hope crept into bios eyes  and if i tell youall  then if i believe you you will be set at liberty  there was a sneer in the conditional clause that made bios blood run cold for an instant but it seemed his only chance of escape and he began haltingly but in a tone that they could not doubt was the truth  i left the boat far up in mangrove creek he ended i think the yanqui señores cannot take her out  tell morales to have the mules ready at once the officer ordered the quickest road he asked bio  the pilot answered without faltering the road he told them was twice as far as over la colina del sol and through the jungle path  the officer consulted a few moments with the rurales who had brought bio in and then gave his decision  my men will not need you you will be held in camp for one day and then set at liberty i am a man of my word  bio could hardly believe his good luck although he frowned anxiously at that one days detention silently he followed his guards but as he expected he found them very lax after the first hour or two long before midnight he was snaking his way noiselessly through the underbrush that surrounded the camp  and in the meantime the rurales were riding furiously along the road that led to mangrove creek     chapter ix  stranded   the sun was high above the mangroves when walthew joined grahame and macallister at breakfast the morning after they landed the rifles no wind entered the gap in the forest the smoke went straight up from the slanted funnel and the air was still and sour the steamer lay nearly dry among banks of mire though a narrow strip of dazzling water sluggishly flowed inland past her fifty yards outshore there was a broader channel and beyond it the dingy palestemmed mangroves rose like a wall some were strangely spotted and walthew glanced at them with disgust as he drank his coffee  i guess ive never seen such repulsive trees he said this place takes away ones appetite even the coffees bitter youve been doctoring it  its weel to take precautions macallister replied ye got a few nibbles last night from a dangerous bit beastie they ca anopheles  i suppose it doesnt manufacture the malaria germ and from the looks of the place one wouldnt imagine there was anybody else about for it to bite  thats what were hoping were no anxious for visitors but when ye meet a smell like what we noo enjoy ye take quinine till it makes ye hear church bells ringing in your head  walthew turned to grahame  can you get her off  well try the sooner we get out the better but the tides are falling  do you reckon the halfbreed pilot meant to pile her up  no said grahame thoughtfully for one thing it would be a dangerous game because his employers wouldnt hesitate about knifing him they gave us a check which ive reason to believe will be honored and they wouldnt have wasted their money if theyd meant treachery i imagine theyre all too deep in the plot to turn informer  do you think the pilot will turn up to take us out then  i believe hell be here at highwater unless hes prevented  what could prevent him  its possible that our friends have been followed by the oppositions spies the man who rules this country is not a fool  then it seems to me we must do our best to heave the boat off this tide  mack and i agree with you grahame said meaningly  breakfast was soon finished for nobody had much appetite and they sat smoking in the thin shade while the water got deeper in the creek when the enchantress slowly rose upright macallister went down to stir the fires but though the others listened anxiously no splash of paddles broke the silence  our pilots not coming grahame said at last ill try to take her out if we can get her afloat  whats likely to happen to him if hes been corralled by the dictators ruralguards  on the whole said grahame id rather not speculate they have a drastic way of dealing with rebels here  an hour later the screw shook the vessel while the windlass strained at the cable once or twice a few links of chain ran in and she moved but the mud had a firm hold and she stuck fast again then the water began to fall and grahame reluctantly told macallister to draw the fires  were here for the next six days he said  its to be hoped the governments spies dont find us out before we get her off walthew remarked  we could put the coal and heavier stores ashore if ye can find a bit dry beach to land them on macallister suggested it would lighten her  i thought of that grahame answered on the other hand it might be safer to keep them on board as long as possible we could strip her and land everything in a day  macallister agreed and for four days they lounged in such shade as they could find it was fiercely hot not a breath of wind touched the dazzling creek and the sun burned through the awning the pitch bubbled up from the deckseams the water in the tanks was warm and innumerable flies came off from the mangroves and bit the panting men to make things worse there was no coolness after sunset when steamy mist wrapped the vessel in its folds bloodthirsty mosquitos came down in swarms buzzing insects dimmed the lamps and the smell of festering mire grew nauseating sleep was out of the question and when the mosquitos drove them off the deck the men lay in their stifling berths and waited drearily for another day of misery to begin  among other discomforts walthew who was not seasoned to the climate was troubled by a bad headache and pains in his limbs but he said nothing about this and accompanied grahame when the latter took the soundings in the dinghy at last they rose at daybreak one morning to lighten the vessel and although he felt shaky and suffered from a burning thirst walthew took charge of the gig which was to be used for landing coal  the work was hard for when they reached a sand bar up the creek they were forced to wade some distance through mud and shallow water with the heavy bags on their backs while the perspiration soaked their thin clothes and the black dust worked through to their skin at noon they stopped for half an hour and walthew lay in the sternsheets of the gig where there was a patch of shade he could not eat and after drinking some tea tried to smoke but the tobacco tasted rank and he put his pipe away up to the present his life had been luxurious he had been indulged and waited on and had exerted himself only in outdoor sports now he felt very sick and worn out but knew that he must make good having declined to enter his fathers business he must prove his capacity for the career he had chosen moreover he suspected that macallister and grahame were watching him  when the clatter of the winch began again he hid the effort it cost him to resume his task and stubbornly pulled his oar as the gig floated up the creek with her gunwale near awash his back hurt him almost unbearably when he lifted a heavy bag and it was hard to keep upon his feet while he floundered through the mire sometimes his head reeled and he could scarcely see the blisters on his hands had worked into bleeding sores this however did not matter much by comparison with the pain in his head  after the coal was landed they loaded loose ironwork and towed heavy spars ashore and walthew held out somehow until darkness fell when he paddled back to the enchantress with a swarm of mosquitos buzzing round his face  he could not eat when they sat down to a frugal meal and afterward lay in his berth unable to sleep and yet not quite awake lost in confused thoughts that broke off and left him conscious of intolerable heat and pain when he went languidly on deck the next morning grahame looked hard at him  you had better lie down in the shade he said  i may let up when we reach open water walthew answered with a feeble smile theres not much enjoyment to be got out of a layoff here  grahame reluctantly agreed he knew something about malaria and walthew did not look fit for work but every man was needed and this foul swamp was no place to be ill the sooner they got out the better  steam was up when the enchantress rose with the tide and shortly afterward the engines began to throb muddy foam leaped about the whirling screw flame mingled with the smoke that poured from her funnel and steam roared from the blowoff pipe then the clatter of winch and windlass joined in and grahame stood tense and anxious holding a rope that slipped round the spinning drum the winch could not shorten it though the vessel was shaking and working in her muddy bed it was highwater the tide would soon begin to fall and the sweat of suspense and strain dripped from the man as at the risk of breaking the warp he tightened the turns on the drum it gripped to his surprise a little slack came off and he nodded to walthew who was watching him eagerly from the windlass  give her all if you burst the chain he cried  the windlass clanked for a few moments stopped and clanked again the enchantress trembled and crept a foot or two ahead then she stuck while the cable rose from the water rigid as a bar and the messengerchain that drove the windlass creaked and strained at breaking tension while grahame expected to see links and gearwheels fly there was a long shiver through the vessels frame a mad rattle of liberated machinery and she leaped ahead  five minutes later walthew walked shakily aft scarcely seeing where he went because a confused sense of triumph had brought a mist into his dazzled eyes this was the first big thing in which he had taken a leading part he had made good and played the man but there was still much to be done and he pulled himself together as he stopped near grahame  shes moored where she wont ground again but perhaps you had better see that the chaincompressors and warp fastenings are right  if youre satisfied its enough said grahame  then ill take the gig and get the coal on board  if you feel equal to it grahame answered  walthew got into the boat with a sense of elation his eyes had met grahames while they spoke and a pledge of mutual respect and trust had passed between them but this was not quite all he felt he had won official recognition from a leader he admired he was no longer on trial but accepted as a comrade and equal the thought sustained him through a day of murderous toil during which his wornout muscles needed constant spurring by the unconquered mind it was not dainty and in a sense not heroic work in which he was engaged but it must be done and he dimly saw that human nature rose highest in a grapple with obstacles that seemed too great to overcome whatever the odds against him were he must not be beaten  the heat was pitiless in the afternoon but walthew pulled his oar and carried the hundredpound coal bags across a stretch of mire that grew broader as the tide ebbed he could scarcely pull his feet out and keep the load upon his aching back and he sometimes sank kneedeep in the softer spots the air was heavy with exhalations from the swamps he had thrown off his jacket and the coal wore holes in his shirt and rubbed raw places on his skin he was wet from the waist downward and black above while the gritty dust filled his eyes and nostrils still he held out until the work was finished when the enchantresss cargolight began to twinkle through the dusk and then losing his balance he fell forward into the boat with his last heavy load miguel pushed her off and with oars splashing slackly she moved downstream when she ran alongside the steamer grahame saw a limp black figure lying huddled on the floorings the others lifted it gently but walthew did not speak when he was laid on deck and macallister bending over him looked up at grahame  fever and exhaustion i allow that ye were right about the lad but we must do the best we can for him  they washed off the coaldust and when walthew wrapped in thick blankets lay unconscious in his berth they debated earnestly over the medicine chest before administering a dose that experience in the unhealthy swamps of the tropics alone justified they forced it drop by drop between his clenched teeth and then macallister waited with a grimy finger on his pulse while grahame sat down limply on the edge of the berth his hands were bruised his thin clothes were torn and he felt the reaction after the days strain he had now an hour or two in which to rest and then he must pull himself together to take the vessel down the creek  when at last macallister nodded as if satisfied grahame went wearily up on deck except for a faint hiss of steam everything was quiet tired men lay motionless about the deck and the mist that clung to the mangroves did not stir after a while the lap of the floodtide against the planks made itself heard and the moon which was getting large rose above the trees  grahame sitting limply on the grating half dozing while he waited suddenly jumped to his feet startled out of the semidarkness came distinctly the splash of oars faint at first and then nearer  miguel lay nearest him the spaniard quickly grasping the danger shook his men awake while grahame ran below to macallister  the government spies he said briefly our pilots turned traitor     chapter x  the peon pilot   grahame and macallister stood on deck peering into the moonlit jungle of mangroves so far as they could judge there was only one pair of oars making the splashes that had aroused them but they could hear the blades dig deep into the water with an intense effort that could mean only haste on the part of the boatsman  they waited and presently the small boat appeared in the moonlight and they saw a single figure who dropped one oar and crossed himself religiously  gracias a dios he said  the pilot macallister gasped  grahame waited tense and alert until the pilot climbed on board the instant the halfbreed touched the deck he began gesticulating wildly and talking so rapidly that grahame had difficulty in grasping his meaning miguel who was more at home in the peon spanish explainedin english for macallisters sake  the government men catch him make him tell he escape take short pathindian senda get here first soldados coming we hurry  miguel had worked himself up to a state of great excitement and when he finished his bare feet went pattering off across the deck almost before grahame could give the order  tired as the men were they realized the necessity for haste and they lost no time in getting under way there was a clatter in the stokehold as the fires were cleaned the dinghy crept across the creek and halfseen men forward hurriedly coiled in a wet rope then the boat came back and the windlass rattled while the propeller floundered slowly round the anchor rose to the bows and the enchantress moved away against the flood tide  the pilot took the wheel while grahame stood beside him there were broad light patches where the water dazzled grahames eyes and then belts of gloom in which the mangroves faded to a formless blur still they did not touch bottom miry points round which the tide swirled rotting logs on mudbanks and misty trees crept astern and at last they heard the rumble of the swell on beaten sand  she glided on lifting now and then with a louder gurgle about her planks when a white beach gleamed in the moonlight where the trees broke off the enchantress stopped to land the faithful pilot who had first betrayed and then saved them  it was a risky thing he did grahame said as the halfbreed standing easily in his boat swaying with the rhythm of his oars rowed off into the moonlight suppose they had caught him coming to usor with us  im thinking yon pilots a bit of a hero macallister responded laconically albeit a coward first  oh it was all for don martins sake that he risked his own hide to warn us don martin has a wonderful hold on those peons theyd go through fire and water for him  the enchantress skirted a point where two sentinel cedartrees stood out blackly against the sky then the spray leaped about the bows as she dipped to the swell and the throb of engines quickened as she left the shore behind                                       two weeks later the enchantress was steaming across a sea that was flecked with purple shadow and lighted by incandescent foam macallister lounged in the engineroom doorway grahame sat smoking on a coil of rope and walthew wrapped in a dirty blanket lay under the awning his face was hollow his hair damp and lank and his hands with which he was clumsily rolling a cigarette were very thin the deck was piled with a load of dyewood which they had bought rather with the object of accounting for their cruise than for the profit that might be made on it  its good to feel alive on a day like this but i suspect it was doubtful for a time whether id have that satisfaction walthew remarked languidly guess i owe you both a good deal  they had stubbornly fought the fever that was wasting him away and had felt that they must be beaten but macallister grinned  ill no deny that ye were an interesting case and gave us a chance o making two or three experiments as ye seem none the worse for them ye must be tougher than ye look  i thought tampering with other peoples watches was your specialty  whats a watch compared with the human body macallister asked  you do know something about springs and wheels but its different with drugs i expect you gave way to an unholy curiosity to see how they would work  maybe theres something in the notion an engineer canna help wanting to find out how things act its a matter o temperament and theres no a great difference between watching the effect o a new oil on your pistonrings and seeing what happens when a patient swallows your prescription ill say this for ye ye were docile  ive survived said walthew from my point of view thats the most important thing  and now you had better think about the future grahame interposed some people are practically immune from malaria others get it moderately now and then and some it breaks down for good at first its difficult to tell which class one belongs to but you have had a sharp attack theres some risk of your spending the rest of your life as an aguestricken invalid if you stick to us  how heavy is the risk  nobody can tell you that but its to be reckoned with i understand that your father would take you back  hed be glad to do so on his terms said walthew thoughtfully still its hard to admit that youre beaten and i suspect the old man would have a feeling that i might have made a better show he wants me to give in and yet hed be sorry if i did  suppose you go home in twelve months with a profit on the money he gave you grahame suggested  then im inclined to think hed welcome me on any terms i cared to make  think it over well and leave us out of the question grahame said  you cant be left out walthew answered with a gleam in his eyes but ill wait until i feel better i may see my way then  they left him and he lighted his cigarette though the tobacco did not taste good hardship and toil had not daunted him the risk of shipwreck and capture had given the game a zest but the foul mangrove quagmires where the fever lurks in the tainted air had brought him a shrinking dread one could take ones chance of being suddenly cut off but to go home with permanently broken health or perhaps as sometimes happened with a disordered brain was a different thing since he took malaria badly the matter demanded careful thought in the meanwhile it was enough to lie in the shade and feel his strength come back  a few days later they reached havana where they sold the dyewood and had arranged to meet don martin sarmiento whose affairs occasionally necessitated a visit to cuba  one evening soon after his arrival grahame stood in the patio of the hotel international the international had been built by some longforgotten spanish hidalgo and still bore traces of ancient art the basin in the courtyard with the stone lions guarding its empty fountain was moorish the balconies round the house had beautiful bronze balustrades cast three hundred years ago and the pillars supporting them were delicately light  the building had however been modernized for part of the patio was roofed with glass and wide steps tiled in harsh colors led to a lounge through which one entered the diningroom where everything was arranged on the latest american plan there was a glaring café in the front of the building and an archway at the back led to the uncovered end of the patio where porters pedlers and the like importuned the guests  just then this space was occupied by a group of chinamen halfbreeds and negroes and grahame was watching them carelessly when he heard a step behind him turning abruptly he stood facing evelyn cliffe he imagined that she looked disturbed but she frankly gave him her hand  you she exclaimed this is something of a surprise  thats what i felt he answered i hope the pleasures also mutual but you see i get my meals here and walthew has a room he has been down with fever and isnt quite better yet  and ive just arrived with my father who has some business in the town evelyn said and laughed i nearly missed meeting you because i thought you were a stranger and i meant to slip past but you were too quick do you generally swing round in that alert manner when you hear somebody behind you  i admit its a habit of minethough i must have been clumsy if you noticed it a number of people go barefooted in these countries and the business im engaged in demands some caution  then its lucky you have selfcontrol because you might run a risk of injuring a harmless friend by mistake  one does not mistake ones friends theyre not too plentiful he replied smiling  but what is the business that makes you so careful  i think i could best call myself a general adventurer but at present im engaged in trade in fact im living rather extravagantly after selling a cargo  evelyn gave him a quick glance his manner was humorous but she imagined he wished to remind her that he did not belong to her world this jarred because there was an imperious strain in her and she felt that she could choose her acquaintances as she liked besides it was mocking her intelligence to suggest that the man was not her equal by birth and education for all that she had been disconcerted to find him in the hotel he had exerted a disturbing influence when they first met and she had had some trouble in getting free from it that the influence was unintentional made things no better because evelyn did not want her thoughts to center on a man who made no attempt to please her yet she felt a strange pleasure in his society  i suppose you are waiting for dinner now she said  yes he answered shall we look for a seat here a fellow who sings rather well sometimes comes in  he led her to a bench near the marble basin under the broad leaves of a palm evelyn noticed that the spot was sufficiently public to offer no hint of privacy and she admired his tact it got dark while they engaged in casual talk and colored servants lighted lamps among the plants and flowers then the soft tinkle of a guitar and a clear voice trilling on the higher notes with the spanish tremolo came out of the shadow one or two others joined in and evelyn listened with enjoyment  the campanadas grahame said its a favorite of mine the refrain states that grapes eaten in pleasant company taste like honey  isnt that a free translation im not a spanish scholar but i imagine it means something more personal than company in general  yes said grahame slowly it really meanswith you  the music changed to a plaintive strain which had something seductive and passionate in its melancholy  las aves marinas said evelyn that means the seabirds doesnt it what is the rest  i wont paraphrase this time the song declares that although the seabirds fly far across the waves they cannot escape the pains of love these people are a sentimental lot but the ideas poetical  i wonder whether its true evelyn said with a smile perhaps you ought to know  the seabirds are fierce wild things that live by prey one associates them with elemental strifethe white tidesurge across desolate sands and the pounding of the combers on weedy reefsand not with domestic peace thats the lot of the tame landbirds that haunt the sheltered copse  and cannot one have sympathy with these  oh yes ive often stopped to listen while a speckled thrush sang its lovesong among the bare ashboughs in our rainswept north the joyful trilling goes straight to ones heart  and lingers there  where our thrushes sing you can if you listen hear the distant roar of the sea its a more insistent call than the other  but only if you listen cannot you close your ears  that might be wiser it depends upon your temperament  evelyn was silent for the next minute or two and grahame mused he had felt the charm of the girls beauty and suspected in her a spirit akin to his she had courage originality and he thought a longing hitherto curbed by careful social training to venture beyond the borders of a tame conventional life it was possible that he might strengthen it but this would not be playing a straight game for all that he was tempted and he smiled as he recalled that in earlier days his ancestors had stolen their brides  why are you amused evelyn asked  an idle thought came into my mind he said awkwardly  evelyn smiled  my father has come to look for me but i shall see you again you will be here some time  a few days  he watched her join cliffe in the archway that led from the patio and then he sat down again on the bench under the palmtree but he no longer heard the strum of the guitars nor the tinkle of the mandolins he was thinking of evelyn there seemed to be some peculiar bond of sympathy between them he felt that she understood him even when nothing much was said  mooning all alone came walthews voice  grahame laughed and joined his comrade and macallister who had entered the patio with don martin and blanca     chapter xi  a modern don quixote   the diningroom of the international hotel was modern but while noisy powerdriven fans stirred the heavy air and the decoration was profuse traces of more austere ancient art remained stone pillars and the fretted arch at one end had an eastern grace and lightness among the gaudy modern lamps hung one or two finelymodeled in copper and burning scented oil the glass and nickeled knives were american but curious old carafes filled with red and yellow wine stood among the flowers and fruit on the long table  evelyn looking down the room from its opposite end was conscious of faint displeasure when grahame entered with a very attractive girl the feeling could not be jealousy but she studied blanca with a curiosity that was half hostile the girl was dressed in parisian fashion but she walked with a grace that only spanish women show there was no fault to be found with her supple figure but her black hair was rather coarse and her blue eyes too languishing yet she was well bred and the man in dark clothes who followed and was no doubt her father had an air of dignity grahame seemed to be on friendly terms with them for they talked and laughed when they sat down and evelyn noticed that the girl sometimes touched him coquettishly with her fan  walthew sat opposite with a thoughtful expression and soon macallister joined in the talk it was obvious that he was amusing for evelyn saw those who sat near smile and then hearty laughter rose from his end of the table the spanish girl and grahame no longer spoke to each other and the engineers voice came up through the clink of glass and the hum of conversation sometimes in broad scots and sometimes in stumbling and uncouth castilian  when the guests were leaving the diningroom grahame met cliffe in the corridor  glad to see you i didnt expect to find you in havana the american said cordially i want a smoke will you come along  they found a seat in the patio and cliffe gave grahame a cigar  hows business he asked  we cant complain so far grahame answered cautiously the boat of course does not carry much but her light draught allows her to get into harbors that larger vessels can only enter on big tides and we sold our last cargo at a satisfactory price just now im looking out for a few passengers to kingston theres no boat across for some time  i might go with you if you have two good rooms to spare theres a fruitgrowing estate i want to look at in jamaica  the suggestion was welcome to grahame he promised to give cliffe part of the deckhouse and they afterward talked of something else  in the meanwhile walthew was sitting with blanca sarmiento he was quiet for he still felt languid and the patio was hot but he was conscious of his companions charm indeed he had thought of her often since he left rio frio and she had had a place in the fantastic dreams the fever brought him  you do not speak much but you have been ill she said presently with a sympathetic glance it was a grief to us to hear it but you have suffered in a good cause  im not sure of that walthew answered you see i was out for money  and that was all blanca exclaimed in a halfcontemptuous tone  i think so walthew admitted my people are traders and i suppose moneymaking runs in the family still i might claim to be a soldier of fortune if you like that better its more romantic anyhow  ah she said with a sparkle in her eyes there were great soldiers of fortune among the liberators one thinks of bolivar lafayette and garibaldi but the brave italian had wounds and prison not money for his reward  these fellows are too near the top notch for me to follow i know my limits walthew modestly owned  one should follow the highest and chivalry is not dead even commerce cannot kill it there are still knights errant who see visions and leave everything to right the wrong and help the downtrodden it has been my good fortune to meet one or two  your cervantes wrote about one such seems to me that although he meant well don quixote did more harm than good  ah the sad sad book but you think like cervantes you sneer at romance  im young señorita but i try to keep my head he gave her a steady glance sometimes i find it difficult  she laughed with a sparkle of coquetry and touched him with her fan  then there is hope for you and we will labor for your conversion the man who always keeps his head never does anything great the power that moves the world comes from the heart lowering her voice she went on our cause is just señor but we need trustworthy friends even if they are not idealists quixote failed because he used rusty armor and the lance we will use rifles  walthew was trying to be cautious but was swept away he had been attracted by the girl at their first meeting though he had then felt something of the anglosaxons prejudice against the southern races which is not unmarked in the united states this had gone however and he now wondered whether blanca meant to use him only to further her fathers objects or if she had any personal interest in him her patriotism was he thought a burning flame and she would not stick at trifles where she saw a chance of serving her country still it would be his fault if she were willing to get rid of him when he had done his work  i wonder why you thought i could be trusted he said  it is difficult to explain señor but one can tell perhaps by instinct when a man rings true  it would hurt to find you had been deceived  it might be so she answered slowly  walthew wondered if this were mere flirtation designed to gain an end blanca was playing with her fan which lay in her lap he could not see her eyes he felt that he had been given an opportunity however and he meant to seize it leaning forward toward her he waited until she raised her eyes to his and then he spoke in a low tense voice  when i was leaving rio frio i found a crimson rose on the pavement i picked it up because i ventured to think it was meant for me  blanca was again playing with her fan opening and shutting it slowly  señor it is possible the flower was dropped by mistake she said giving him a sidewise glance that made his heart beat fast  howif it was really meant for me  she hesitated a moment and then raising her head she met his insistent look with a curious smile  it was given because i thought you were perhaps in a way and as far as it was possible for you like the great soldiers of fortune we talked about  walthew made her a ceremonious bow  you set me a pretty big task señorita but as far as its possible for me i will try to make good  he was thrilled by the look she gave him as she rose and held out her hand  your conversion begins she said with a strange new note in her voice it is a chivalrous resolve andyou will live up to it señor  when she left him walthew found grahame alone in the hotel lounge  i promised to let you know whether the malaria would send me home or not he said ive made up my mind to see the business through  grahame grasped his hand cordially  i dont know that you are wise old man but i am glad to have you just the same he gave walthew a whimsical look havent you come to a decision rather suddenly  that doesnt matter said walthew i mean to stick to it     chapter xii  baiting the smugglers   it was late and the dew was heavy macallisters thin clothes were getting damp as he walked impatiently up and down the mole the enchantresss gig lay near the steps but her crew had not arrived although macallister had waited half an hour for them this by no means pleased him because while not a tyrant he expected his orders to be obeyed besides he resented the ingratitude of the men he had agreed with grahame that it was prudent to moor the enchantress out in the harbor and keep the crew short of money they had behaved well and during the afternoon macallister had given them a few pesetas and allowed them a run ashore although he imagined he had kept within a limit that would ensure their sobriety  they had however not returned and he felt disturbed as he watched the twinkling anchorlights and the ripples flash in the silvery track the moon cast across the water boats were coming and going and when one approached the landing macallister drew back into the shadow he had made the acquaintance of the captain and the engineer of the vessel from which the boat came and he did not want to be found waiting for his unpunctual crew the footsteps of those who landed were growing faint when he heard singing farther up the mole the voice was unsteady and the patter of bare feet that accompanied it suggestively uneven  macallister knew the song and was not surprised that his men who were obviously coming back the worse for liquor should show a taste for good music for this is common among spanishamericans it was however difficult to understand how they had made the money he had given them go so far  where kept ye ye drunken swine he asked when they lurched into sight  no savvy answered his fireman pepe and macallister explained what he thought of them in the most virulent epithets used along the clyde  this relieved his feelings and satisfied his sense of discipline but he did not think it wise to translate his remarks spanish halfbreeds have fiery tempers and carry knives  get into the boat before i kick ye off the mole he concluded when he was breathless and the men clumsily obeyed though one came near to falling into the water they had some trouble in getting out the oars but at last they rowed away macallister noted that one man placed a small cane basket under a thwart and he suspected what was inside  when they reached the enchantress he was first on deck but he waited by the gangway until the man who carried the basket climbed up macallister held out his hand for the basket and when the fellow gave it to him confidingly he hurried aft to examine it by the engine lamp it contained two bottles of anisado a spirit flavored with aniseed in favor in spanish countries he felt tempted to throw them overboard but refrained because such waste went against the grain and the liquor might be doled out when the men had been forced to work unusually hard he imagined they had forgotten the matter and was lighting his pipe when he heard them coming and stepped out of the engineroom to meet them  there was a small basket señor one said civilly though his voice was thick  it is possible you dropped it overboard macallister suggested in his best castilianwhich was very bad  no señor one does not drop such baskets over  what was in it then  the man was obviously not sober but it looked as if he had not lost his senses  a small present to me and the others don andres you will give it back to us  no said macallister sternly presents of that kind are not allowed on board this ship  he watched them while they murmured together they were active wiry fellows obedient as a rule but liable to passionate outbreaks like most of their mixed race now they looked drunkenly determined and he knew the strength of his fireman pepe  the basket is ours said one we will take it  i think not said macallister shortly stand back  their halfrespectful mood changed in a flash and they came at him with a rush they could wrestle and use the knife and macallister knew that pepe who came first must be stopped he supposed that miguel whom he had left on board was asleep but to summon help would be subversive of authority and the affair would be over before miguel arrived lunging forward he put the weight of his body into his blow and pepe reeled when it landed on his jaw before he could recover macallister sprang upon him and with a strenuous effort flung him backward through the gangway  there was a splash in the water and the others stopped daunted by the vigor of the attack but pepe did not strike out for the gig as macallister expected indeed for there was shadow along the vessels side he did not seem to come up and after a moments pause macallister jumped into the sea the water closed above him but when he rose a whiteclad figure was struggling feebly near by and he seized it pepe seemed unable to swim and macallister had some trouble in dragging him to the gig into which the others had jumped they pulled both men out of the water and in another few minutes macallister stood dripping on board the enchantress sternly regarding his fireman the shock had apparently sobered him and the others with the instability of their kind had become suddenly docile  now said macallister where did you get the anisado  a gentleman gave it to us in a café  macallister shook his head  try again a gentleman does not give drunken sailors bottles of liquor  we were not drunk then one of them answered naïvely and he was a gentleman he spoke castilian like the peninsulares  ah said macallister thoughtfully for the use of good peninsular spanish indicates a man of education so he gave you all some wine and put the bottles in the basket  it was so don andres another answered with a readiness that invited belief  but why  who can tell pepe rejoined perhaps the señor was generous then he said he liked sailors and tales of the sea  you told him some no doubt macallister remarked dryly  we did don andres herman told him of the great shark that bites off the fishermens oars at punta anagan and i about the ghost caravela that beats to windward in jaurez strait  and what else  pepe shook his head  then there was some cognac and afterwardi do not remember  get below except the anchorwatch macallister said sternly well consider whats to be done with you tomorrow  they slouched away and while macallister was talking to miguel a splash of oars grew louder and presently grahame clambered up from a shore boat he heard what had happened and then sitting down thoughtfully lighted his pipe  you must see what this points to he remarked  its no difficult somebody has made the wasters drunk and i ken what sea stories he would start them telling a gran señor they said  one of president altieras spies but why do you think he gave them the anisado afterward  he might have wanted them to make trouble so wed put them ashore and he could get hold o them again then its possible it would have suited him if theyd knifed you or me  there may be something in that anyhow your going overboard after pepe ended the matter well theyre not ungrateful it gives us a hold on them  i see that noo but i did no stop to think before i jumped macallister modestly admitted it was what ye might call a stroke o natural genius then ye see i threw him in  grahame laughed  well we must keep our eyes open and get away as soon as we can i expect to finish with don martin tomorrow                                       on the following evening cliffe was sitting with evelyn in his private room at the international when a mulatto boy brought him in a card  señor gomez he remarked the fellow has kept me hanging round three days and id made up my mind to sail with grahame tomorrow whether he came or not  who is señor gomez evelyn asked  i understand his official title is secretario general and hes next in power to the president of the country im trying to do business with my opinion is that theyre both slippery rascals  he broke off as the door opened and a darkskinned gentleman came in gomez bowed ceremoniously to evelyn and cliffe and then waited with his hat in his hand he was dressed all in black except for his spotless linen he wore a number of valuable rings and evelyn noticed that his nails were unusually curved and long she shrank from the glance of bold admiration he gave her but resentment and halfinstinctive dislike conquered this feeling and she returned his greeting politely when cliffe presented him she thought no better of him when she withdrew after some general talk  now cliffe said when evelyn had left them well get down to business ive been waiting three days for you and am not sure the deal is worth it  gomez spread out his hands with a deprecatory air  it was impossible to come sooner affairs of state you understand may i suggest that the concessions we offer you are valuable  so it seems cliffe rejoined bluntly the price you asked was high enough and now when we have half fixed things you want to raise your terms  gomez looked pained he was rather stout and greasy but his dress and manners were unexceptionable  señor that is a grief to us but the affairs of my country necessitate the change we only ask for a little more money in advance it is to the advantage of all parties that you agree  i cant see how it is to my advantage to part with money i can make a good use of cliffe replied  i must speak frankly señor gomezs manner became confidential these concessions have already cost you something and there are dissatisfied people who are anxious to rob the president of his power  ive heard that some of them are anxious to shoot him but thats not my business  with your pardon señor we must disagree if the president loses office before the papers are signed the concessions go i imagined you understood this  i suppose i did understand something of the kind cliffe admitted still if the revolutionists prove too strong for you ill lose any additional money i may let you have  gomez smiled a slow and rather cruel smile  if we can get the money there will be an end of the discontent we know how to deal with it and now with apologies i must remark that while we give you the first opportunity there are others  ah said cliffe sharply id thought this business wouldnt have much attraction for my rivals whom am i up against  gomez gave him a letter from a german syndicate and cliffe examined it closely he knew the principal and recognized the signature  i see theyre bolder than i thought he said if i dont come up to the line youll make the deal with them  we should be forced the political situation demands it  you mean you must have the money well you have got a good deal of mine already what becomes of it if the thing falls through  it was a gift gomez answered with an apologetic smile your generosity will be gratefully remembered  cliffe was silent for a few minutes he had not been tricked because he had known that when one negotiates a transaction of that sort with a spanishamerican country a certain amount of money must first be spent in clearing the ground and this going into the pockets of venal officials offers no direct return gomez and his master had however been smarter than cliffe thought for after exacting all they could from him they had opened negotiations with another party and would force him to come up to his rivals bid they could do so because if he drew back he would lose the money he had already put in he distrusted them but he thought he would be safe when he secured the concessions  i guess ill have to meet you he said but well get everything fixed up now  half an hour afterward he lighted a fresh cigar and put some papers into his pocket he was not altogether satisfied and neither was gomez but they had by mutual compromise arrived at a workable arrangement and each had some respect for the others astuteness  how will you get across to jamaica gomez asked  a little boat sails in the morning  the very small leadcolored steamer the señorita may find the accommodation rude why not wait for a passenger boat  its fine weather and the man who owns her is a friend of mine  gomez was puzzled he was suspicious of the enchantress and had taken trouble to find out something about her it surprised him to learn that her owner and cliffe were friends  then he is in havana  hes in this hotel i noticed him sitting half asleep in the far corner of the lounge just before you came in do you want to see him  oh no gomez said in a careless tone for he feared he had been incautious i imagined you meant he was somebody you knew in america  he made an excuse for leaving but cliffe noticing his interest was not satisfied and went out to the landing with him gomez however did not go straight to the lounge he was afraid of rousing cliffes curiosity and men of his stamp are seldom direct in their methods it seemed wiser to spend a while sauntering about the patio where cliffe could see him but grahame in the meantime came up the stairs and cliffe beckoned him  do you know señor gomez he asked  no said grahame immediately on his guard ive heard about him clever politician but a bit of a rogue i believe  cliffe gave him a keen glance  i thought he was interested in you but i may have been mistaken anyway i told him you were taking a siesta in a corner of the lounge  grahame smiled carelessly  inquisitiveness becomes a habit with fellows like gomez and i dare say its needful the cafés in these ports are full of political refugees and intriguers  seeing macallister in the hall below grahame went down to him and told him what he had learned  weel said the engineer dryly after that present o anisado to the men im thinking it would no be desirable that ye should meet señor gomez for a that i would not have him disappointed and ill daunder along to the lounge  it would be almost as bad if he saw you  macallister chuckled  hell have hard work to recognize me afterward come away to the hatrack  grahame followed him feeling puzzled but suspecting that his comrade had some ingenious plan seeing nobody about macallister borrowed one or two articles from the rack but neither he nor grahame noticed that miss cliffe watched the proceedings with interest from a shadowy passage  shortly afterward gomez entered the lounge and saw only one person there but this individuals appearance surprised him as the light was not good he strolled toward the drowsy gentleman who lay negligently in a big chair with a newspaper dangling from his hand he wore a soft hat pulled down upon his forehead as if to shade his eyes and a loose dark cloak hung over his shoulder he looked like a cuban and although gomez noticed that his nails were short and broken this might be accounted for by his having something to do with sugarmaking machinery  perhaps you are not using the diario gomez said  the man did not look up but held out the paper with a drowsy grunt  gomez was too clever to make a poor excuse for starting a conversation with a man who obviously did not wish to be disturbed and taking the paper he moved away after a few minutes he put it down and strolled out of the room when he had gone macallister left by another door and replacing the things he had borrowed rejoined grahame in the patio  it worked he said chuckling if señor gomez was on our track hes weel off it noo but its fortunate we sail the morn  he mustnt meet don martin grahame answered thoughtfully ill go to his room and warn him  he found that sarmiento was out and none of the hotel servants knew where he had gone grahame felt disturbed by this but there was nothing he could do     chapter xiii  the emerald ring   grahame went in to dinner feeling anxious sarmiento had not returned but he would probably come in before the meal was over and gomez was sitting by cliffe near the head of the table blanca sat opposite walthew and grahame found a place next to evelyn who had not joined cliffe because she disliked gomez though his manners were polished there was something sinister about him a hint of craft and cruelty and she did not approve of his association with her father  have you met the gentleman yonder she asked grahame  señor gomez i know who he is but have not spoken to him  thats curious because he has been looking at you as if he were interested  this confirmed grahames suspicion and he felt uneasy he did not want gomez to study him and he would not have come in to dinner only that he must warn sarmiento if he and his friends were to succeed in their undertaking their connection with don martin must remain unknown for it would not be difficult to catch them landing arms should their object be suspected he wondered where macallister was for the engineer could be trusted in an emergency and presently he saw him coming in there was no vacant place near grahame and macallister sat down some distance off  you may have been mistaken miss cliffe grahame suggested somehow i imagine that gomez is not a favorite of yours  thats true though i hardly know him she answered with a smile one is now and then seized by a quick prejudice and i think the reason i mentioned the man was because i wanted your opinion  did you think it worth having  i cant judge perhaps i really wanted to be agreed with when you have no good ground for making up your mind about a thing its pleasant to find your conclusions confirmed  well i believe you can trust your feelings gomez cant be a nice man if all one hears is true but what turned you against himthe dash of dark blood  no not altogether i felt repelled as one feels repelled by a snake or a toad  grahame made a sign of understanding there was he thought something very refined in the girls character an instinctive fastidiousness she walked in the light and shrank from all that lurked in the shadow it was her inner self that had recoiled from the swarthy politician and reason had nothing to do with the matter  your father seems to be on good terms with the fellow he remarked  yes it puzzles me however i suppose he is forced to deal with all kinds of people  she paused and grahame changed the subject he might have obtained some information by judicious questions but he could not take advantage of the girls frankness by leading her to reveal anything she knew about her fathers affairs this would taint their friendship which he valued  after a time she looked at him with a twinkle of amusement  i watched a little comedy shortly before dinner  did you said grahame comedies are not unusual when one knows how to look for them but they dont catch everybodys eye  this one was rather obvious i mean the transformation of a staid scottish engineer into a cuban sugarplanter of convivial habits  mack isnt really staid it looks as if you didnt quite understand the scottish character under its surface sobriety ones apt to find a very reckless humor im a borderer and rather proud of it you know but how did the beginning of the first act strike you  it seized my interest the plot was not unusual confused identity is a favorite theme but i noticed some histrionic cleverness the rake of the sombrero and the hang of the big cloak were good they carried a hint of mild dissipation one recognizes artistic talent in these light touches  grahame laughed  im not sure it was all art experience may have had something to do with it macks not an ascetic  but how did the play go off  it was a success i think  in one act  no said grahame thoughtfully i imagine it isnt played out yet and the other acts may not be in so light a vein  as you didnt expect an audience perhaps id better promise not to talk about your play you may have felt some diffidence about asking that  thank you said grahame quietly youre very quick  evelyn smiled there was something about the man which appealed to her perhaps it was the mystery that seemed to shroud him and the enchantress she noticed now that he was casting furtive glances about the diningroom  as a matter of fact grahame was worried about don martin the flowers plates of fruit and tall wine carafes obstructed his view but he could see that sarmiento had not come in gomez was talking to cliffe but his eyes wandered about the table for a moment they rested on blanca and grahame felt angry as if the fellows glance were an insult to the girl then it was fixed observantly upon himself and he hid his antagonism  dinner was a lengthy function but the last course was served and some of the guests were smoking and some leaving their places to speak to their friends when sarmiento came in he walked toward grahame who was glad of the general movement which might help him to deal with the situation looking round quickly he noted that gomez had turned to cliffe and then getting up carelessly he stood between the secretary and don martin he faced sarmiento and the latter stopped when he saw grahames frown a life of political intrigue had made him keenwitted and with a negligent movement he turned and went back speaking to a waiter as he passed  evelyn rose and waited by her chair something she did not understand was going on and the hint of intrigue excited her she trusted grahame and she thought his object was good moreover she guessed that it had something to do with thwarting gomez and she meant to help him if she had an opportunity  the secretary suddenly pushed back his chair and grahame felt his heart beat sarmiento was not far from the door and his back was toward his enemy but he would have to turn at the end of the table and that would bring his profile into view it seemed that he recognized the danger though grahame did not think he had seen gomez for he bent down turning his head as he tightened his sash his face was still hidden when he reached the door but grahame looking round saw gomez walk quickly down the room other people were now leaving and grahame joined them hoping that he might get out before his antagonist he was unaware that evelyn who guessed his intention was close behind him  there was more room on gomezs side of the table and grahame was delayed by several ladies whom he could not push aside he would have risked some apparent rudeness but dared not make a disturbance gomez had almost reached the door when a man collided with him and barred the way and grahame smiled as he heard an apology in bad castilian for he saw that macallister had given sarmiento a few more seconds start  evelyn had slipped round the group of women while grahame was trying to avoid one of them and she was now in front of gomez who was hurrying along the passage the man was close to her when she stopped and bent down with a warning cry  take care señor i have dropped a ring  gomez could not get past her and his eyes blazed with fury his polish was superficial and evelyn saw something of the savagery beneath she flinched but plucked up her courage  it is a valuable ring and will break if you tread on it she said  move then gomez commanded harshly and when she stepped back her dress uncovered the ring its setting was of small emeralds and diamonds and might easily have been crushed  gomez picked up the ring and gave it to her with a bow then he hurried on but when he reached the patio it was empty and grahame standing at the other end of the passage heard his ugly exclamation the next moment evelyn passed him coming back but her manner indicated that she did not wish to speak  after a time grahame strolled out from the front of the hotel and looked round as he turned a corner nobody followed him and as he expected he found sarmiento waiting in the shadow some distance farther on  what was the danger the spaniard asked  gomez was in the diningroom  ah said sarmiento did he recognize me  i dont think so but i cant be sure he was suspicious but its hardly prudent to stand talking in the street  they entered a shabby café and choosing a quiet corner ordered wine  if our friends suspicions are aroused hell lose no time in following them up sarmiento said and grahame noticed that although the café was almost empty he avoided the secretarys name a pinillo boat sails at daybreak and passengers go on board tonight it seems to me that id better embark  but the pinillo liners dont call at your port grahame said  sarmiento smiled  it may puzzle our friend if he watches the mole when i have been on board i will return quietly but not to the hotel i know this city where i have trustworthy acquaintances i may be able to learn the business that has brought him here  but what about your daughter  i do not think our friend knows her and our name is not on the hotel book there is a cuban lady i can leave her with  one would imagine that watching the fellow might be dangerous there are halfbreed rascals in the port who wouldnt hesitate about sandbagging or stabbing you for a few dollars but after all you run some risk at rio frio  i am safe there for a time said sarmiento the opposition dare not arrest me and the citizens would have to be satisfied if i disappeared there would be a riot and the government is not ready to use force yet  i see said grahame its evident that you are popular but the leaders of movements like yours are sometimes willing to sacrifice a comrade for the good of the cause it might not suit them to have their hand forced by a tumult  such things happen but my hold is on the people they would not be appeased  may i ask how you got that hold  i will tell you señor my family is of some importance and at first i was not an active liberator the peons on my fathers estate were in a sense his subjects ignorant superstitious people with childish passions but they trusted him and it was our tradition that they should be treated well as i grew up however i saw that much had not been done they wasted effort suffered needless pains and died of diseases that might be stamped out in my inexperience i resolved that i would teach them to live healthily and well  i dare say you found it hard  sarmiento smiled  that is very true i was young and an enthusiast and it hurts to be misunderstood even the poor i tried to benefit regarded me with suspicion but this was not the worst one is not supposed to be disinterested in my country the man who works for others is a dangerous person his aim is to gain power and those who have it watch him with a jealous eye well i found my schemes thwarted by corrupt officials money one could do much good with must be spent in bribes and at last i saw that before improvement was possible our government must be reformed i am not naturally a politician señor i was forced to become one  grahame made a sign of agreement  i think i understand he said  it was uphill work but the peasants i had helped began to trust me thoughtful men gave me their support and some joined because they hated all in authority i was becoming an influence and it was supposed i could be bought petty honors were offered and an official post when it was found that these things did not tempt me i became a danger to the state  and the president tried a different plan  sometimes i feared for my liberty and sometimes for my life i have had to take refuge in cuba and the united states much of my money has been spent but the determination to win freedom and good government spreads we are growing strong and soon the reckoning with our oppressors will come  will things be very much better afterward  sarmiento spread out his hands  who can tell one strives and hopes for the best it is all that is possible some day perhaps comes a small instalment of what one fights for  grahame did not answer and his companion sank into the melancholy that often characterized him he was engaged in an arduous struggle and grahame suspected that disappointment would meet him even in hardly won victory the man was sincere and had sacrificed much for his countrys sake but he could not work alone and it might happen that his helpers tasting power would restore the abuses he had destroyed it looked as if he knew this but did not let it daunt him  after a long silence sarmiento took out his watch  i think i had better go on board the pinillo boat now he said our business is done and it is well that you sail tomorrow when we are ready for the next cargo you will hear from us  pulling down his hat he left the café with his cloak thrown loosely over his shoulder but grahame noticed that he was careful to keep his right hand free     chapter xiv  smooth water   there was no wind except the draught the steamer made as she lurched across the dazzling swell cuba floated like a high blue cloud over the port hand cut off from the water by a blaze of reflected light and the broad yucatan channel glimmering like silver stretched ahead the deck had been holystoned and well sluiced before sunrise and was not quite dry and there was a slight coolness in the air where evelyn cliffe sat under the awning  macallister leaned on the rail near by wearing a white cap with a mail companys badge and a blue jacket over his greasy duck he had given his dress some thought since the passengers came on board miguel stood at the wheel barefooted tall and picturesque in spotless white with a red cap and a red sash round his waist a few big logs of hardwood that gave out an aromatic smell were made fast amidships  i suppose that lumbers valuable evelyn remarked  it depends upon whether ye want to buy or sell macallister replied they telt us good logs were scarce in cuba but i doubt well find demand is slack when we come to part wi them  then the trade cant be very profitable  its just changing a shilling sometimes ye get a hapenny over  evelyn laughed  which one of you looks after business matters  im thinking it will have to be walthew the lad shows a natural ability  but hes younger than mr grahameand probably has not had as much experience  macallister gave her a halfamused glance  the skippers no a fool but when he makes a bargain hes frank and quick states the fair price and sticks to it he will not spend time in scheming how he can screw a few more dollars out o the other man yons a gift ye must be born with  do you mean mr grahame rather despises moneymaking  no that exactly macallister replied in a confidential tone but ye see hes a grahame o calder ha  oh is that a great distinction  it depends on how ye look at things his branch o the family is maybe no o much importance noo but in the old wild days the lairds o calder ha were chiefs on the border they guarded the moss roads they kept the fords and the kings at stirling and westminster noo bought their goodwill with presents and noo hanged a few o the clan  and calder hall is it one of the rude stone towers you see pictures of  macallister smiled  calder has bonny the old tower stands with the coat o arms above the door but a low gray house with stoneribbed windows runs back where was once the bailly wall belows a bit ragged orchard the bent trees gray with fog and then the lawn dropping to the waterside nae soft southern beauty yonder but ye feel the charm o the cold rugged north he paused and resumed with a reminiscent air i mind how i went to calder ha when i was a young and romantic laddie fired by scott and him who taught the wandering winds to sing the tales o the ettrick shepherd were thought good reading then after a bit plain speaking to the foreman o a clydeside engine shop i was fitting spinning gear in a new woolen mill and i left the narrow border town on a holiday dawn  there was mist along the alders and a smell o wet dust where the white road followed the waterside but as the sun came ower the hills i took to the moor red it was like crimson velvet with the light upon the ling rolling on to cheviotfoot with the brown grouse crying and the clear sky above at noon i came down a bit water that tumbled in a linn where rowans grew among the stones and the eddies were amber with the seeping from the peat the burn got wider the bare hills closed in and then i came on calder ha at a turning o the glen black firs behind it standing stiff like sentinels the house with the tower in the middle on the breast o the brae and the lawn running doon to a pool then i kent why the grahames loved it and would never sell though many a rich man would have bought the place from them  did you tell mr grahame this evelyn asked  maybe it makes things easier that he thinks i dinna ken said macallister  evelyn agreed for she saw that his reticence was caused by tactful sympathy afterward she was silent for a time the scots admiration for the old border house appealed to her he had shown a taste and a halfpoetical imagination that she had not suspected when they first met but it was not of macallister she was thinking after all it must be something to belong to a family with such traditions as clung about calder hall but she must not dwell too much on this  arent we going slowly she asked  coals dear in the west indies and the slower ye go the less ye use but if ye are tiring o the trip i might drive her a bit faster  evelyn glanced across the long undulations that were deepblue in the hollows and touched upon their summits with brilliant light she liked to feel the easy lift as the enchantress shouldered off the swell the drowsy murmur at the bows and the rhythmical throb of engines were soothing then there was a pleasant serenity in the wide expanse but she was honest with herself and she knew that the beauty of the calm sea did not quite account for the absence of any wish to shorten the voyage  oh she said please dont burn more coal than is necessary im quite content i love the sunshine and the smooth water  macallister strolled away but she saw his twinkling smile and wondered whether he was satisfied with her excuse  evelyn lay back in her steamerchair looking out over the glistening water and idly watching the whitecaps far out at sea she felt rather than saw grahame approach when she turned to him smiling he was close beside her leaning against the rail his pose was virile and his expression marked by the quiet alertness she had learned to know it suggested resolution selfreliance and power of command these qualities were not obtrusively indicated but evelyn recognized them and wondered how much he owed to his being a grahame of calder hall hereditary influences must be reckoned on  this is the first chance ive had to see you alone he said i want to thank you for your help at the international  was it useful  very useful your quickness and resourcefulness were surprising  thats a doubtful compliment she laughed to me the affair was quite exciting to feel that youre engaged in a conspiracy gives you a pleasant thrill  i wonder grahame remarked rather grimly but may i ask  oh i cant dissect the impulses that prompted me no doubt the hint of intrigue was attractiveand perhaps friendship counted too  and you took the excellence of my intentions on trust  well there really was no time to question you and judge if they were good as a matter of fact im no wiser now  no he said on the whole i think its better that you shouldnt know  it looks as if im more confiding than you  grahame studying her face suspected disappointed curiosity and a touch of pique  your confidence is yours to give or withhold as you think best mine however belongs to others  then there are a number of people in the plot  grahame laughed  if its any comfort for you to know when you came to our rescue that night in havana you helped a man who has made many sacrifices for a good cause  as youre too modest to mean yourself you must be speaking of the gentleman with the pretty daughter  yes doña blanca is pretty but i prefer the anglosaxon type theres a charm in tropical languor but one misses the bracing keenness of the north he quoted with a smile     oh dark and true and tender  we may be true one likes to think so but im not sure that tenderness is a characteristic of ours  its not lightly given but it goes deep and lasts grahame answered  when he left her a few minutes afterward evelyn sat thinking languidly she found him elusive he was frank in a way but avoided personal topics then remembering the scrap of verse he had quoted she reflected that he was certainly a northerner in feeling but was truth after all an essential feature of the type to be really true one must be loyal to ones inner self and follow ones heart but this was risky it might mean sacrificing things one valued and renouncing advantages to be gained prudence suggested taking the safe conventional course that would meet with the approval of ones friends but romance stood veiled and mysterious beckoning her and she thrilled with an instinctive response now however she felt that she was getting on to dangerous ground and she joined cliffe who sat in the shade of the deckhouse talking to walthew but they did not help her to banish her thoughts her father was a practical business man and walthew had enjoyed a training very similar to hers it was strange that he should now seek adventures instead of riches and stranger still that her father should show some sympathy with him  an hour later grahame found macallister leaning on the rail contentedly smoking his pipe  shes only making seven knots youre letting steam down he said  weel rejoined macallister were saving coal and well be in kingston soon enough then miss cliffes no in a hurry shes enjoying the smooth water she telt me so  grahame looked hard at him  you have a dangerous love of meddling mack he said  ill no deny it for a that ive had thickheaded friends whove been grateful to me noo and then what ye have no is the sense to ken an opportunity  what do you mean by that  macallisters manner grew confidential  shes thinking about ye and when a lassie goes so far  grahame stopped him with a frown  id sooner you dropped this nonsense its a poor joke  weel if ye have no ambition selling guns to revolutionists is no a remarkably profitable business particularly if yere caught and i was thinking ye might do better the girls no bad to look at ive seen ye watching her  not bad to look at grahame checked himself well talk about something else  as ye like  macallister took out a small tapered piece of steel  this ye ken is a cotter and the dago from the foundry put it in he was a good fitter but the pins a sixtyfourth too small for the slot maybe it was carelessness but there would have been trouble when the cotter shook out if walthew hadna heard her knocking yon lad has the makings o an engineer  grahame looked thoughtful  gomez was in havana and i dare say he has his agents and spies still if he suspected anything it would have been a better stroke to have watched and seized us when we had the arms on board id expect him to see it  weel said macallister grimly if i meet yon dago another time ill maybe find out something before i throw him off the mole a good engines nearer life than anything man has made and wrecking her is as bad as murder  i dont think our opponents would stick at that grahame replied as he turned away  toward evening the barometer fell and it grew very hot there was no wind the sky was cloudless and the sea rolled back to the horizon without a ripple for all that there was a curious tension in the atmosphere and evelyn noticed that soon after macallister came up for a few minutes and looked carefully about thick smoke rose from the funnel the girls head felt heavy and her skin prickly and she saw that grahames hawk look was more noticeable than usual he was however not fidgety and after dinner he sat talking to her and cliffe under the awning the air was oppressively still and a halfmoon hung like a great lamp low above the sea  about nine oclock cliffe went to his cabin to look for a cigar and evelyn and grahame sat silent for a while wrapped in the mystery of the night  evelyn was the first to speak  i suppose you dont expect this calm to last she asked in a hushed voice  id like it to last while youre with us but i cant promise that grahame answered if we do get a breeze it will probably soon blow itself out  evelyn glanced at the sea  it doesnt look as if it could ever be ruffled she said one likes smooth waterbut its apt to get monotonous  thats a matter of temperament or perhaps experience when youve had to battle with headwinds you appreciate a calm  i dont know so far ive had only sunshine and fine weather but then ive always clung to the sheltered coast its nice to feel safe but one sometimes wonders what there is farther out  breaking seas and icy gales that drive you off your course now and then islands of mystic beauty but more often surfbeaten reefs on the whole its wiser to keep in smooth water  perhaps evelyn said skeptically still theres a fascination in adventure if its only as a test of courage and one feels tempted to take a risk  she rose with a laugh  i dont know why i talk like this im really a very practical girlnot a sentimentalist  she moved away and grahame calling one of the men to furl the awning went into the deckhouse and deliberately pored over a chart there were times when it was not safe to permit himself to think of evelyn     chapter xv  the tornado   evelyn was wakened by a peal of thunder and as she drowsily lifted her head a blaze of lightning filled the narrow room it vanished and there was another deafening crash the darkness was now impenetrable but the startled girl had seen that the deck was sharply slanted and her clothes hung at a wide angle to the paneling of the bulkhead it was obvious that the enchantress was listed down nearly on her beam ends a confused uproar was going on and evelyn thought she could distinguish the beating of heavy rain upon the deckhouse this however was only for a few moments because the other noises swelled into an overwhelming din  dropping from her berth she began to dress in the dark but found it difficult to keep her footing on the slanted deck which lurched and threw her against the lockers while the planking worked and shook with the throb of engines evelyn could not hear them but the strong vibration showed that they were running fast  it cost her an effort to refrain from rushing out on deck buttons baffled her nervous fingers the pins she tried to use instead doubled up but she persevered she would not leave her room until she was ready if the worst came she could not make an openboat voyage in a disheveled state that this should seem of importance did not strike her as curious then but she afterward blushed as she remembered her determination to look as well as possible  at last she opened the door and stepped out ankledeep in water she was to lee of the deckhouse and seizing the handrail tried to look about the rain did not seem so heavy now and the house sheltered her although clouds of spray were flying across its top a few feet away the low bulwark was faintly distinguishable but outside this there was only a dim glimmer of foam in the dark the enchantress had the wind and sea on her broadside this surprised evelyn because it was not a safe position if the gale were as bad as it seemed then a shower of sparks leaped from the funnel and by the momentary light they gave she saw a white streak cleanly cut off and slanting downward at the crown of the escape pipe evidently macallister had raised more steam than he could use  wondering why grahame had not brought the vessel head to wind she moved aft cautiously clinging to the rail until she saw that the awning had broken loose from its lashings part of it thrashed about the deck making a furious noise but the rest blown forward had fouled the foresail boom and was stretched tight but distended like a halffilled balloon acting as a sail it prevented the steamer from answering her helm one or two very indistinct figures struggled with the canvas but they seemed unable to master it and evelyn crept on until she could look through the skylight into the engineroom it was here the real battle must be fought for the cylinders that strained under top pressure were the vitals of the ship she could see them shake as if about to burst their fastening bolts and leap from the columns as the big crossheads banged up and down  the iron room was well lighted though the lamps hung at an alarming angle to the beams and there was a confused glimmer of steel that flashed through the light and plunged into shadow a halfnaked man lay on a narrow grating leaning down and touching a ponderous mass of metal as it swept past in the momentary intervals before it came back he rubbed the bright slide it traveled on with a greasy swab and the girl knew how important it was that nothing should get hot the work was dangerous because the least clumsiness might cost him his arm when he stopped and turned sideways on the grating the light touched his face and evelyn started as she recognized walthew  he had enjoyed all the comforts and refinements to which she was accustomed and it was from choice and not necessity that he was doing this rough hazardous work there were obviously people who did not attach an undue value to the ease that wealth could buy this boy for example had left the safe beaten track and now when still weak from fever was taking the consequences without dismay it looked as if there might be something wrong with her mothers philosophy but she could think of this better when there was less risk of the steamers foundering  a man came along the deckhouse and put his arm round her waist as the ship gave a wild lurch evelyn laughed as she recognized her father for a moment she had thought it was grahame holding her tight cliffe moved on a yard or two and then stopped at the corner of the house where they could see something of what was going on  it was lighter now that the rain had stopped and presently a ray of moonlight traveled across the sea and touched the laboring vessel hove down by the pressure of the wind on deckhouse and awning she had buried her lee bulwarks and lifted her weather side sheets of water blew across her and the sea looked white as snow it was not running high the heavy rain had beaten down the swell but it would soon rise and unless the vessel could be brought head to wind the combers would sweep her deck  as the beam of moonlight widened the figures of the toiling men grew clear one was clinging to the top of a tall stanchion in a grotesque monkeylike attitude trying to cut loose the awning for a knife sparkled in his hand another crouched on the deck with folds of the canvas in his arms miguel was bent over the wheel the tenseness of his pose and his hardset face suggested heavy muscular strain  grahame stood near by his hand on a stay swaying with the movement of the steamer he was bareheaded and the spray lashed his face but there was something that reassured the girl in his tranquillity  it was useless to speak the voice would have been drowned by the roar of the gale while wireshroud and chainguy shrilled in wild harmonies evelyn stood fascinated watching the quick tense movements of the crew  presently grahame turned his head and seeing them against the deckhouse pointed toward the sea following his gesture evelyn saw a blurred object leap out of the dark it grew suddenly into definite form as it drove across the belt of moonlight a small wooden barque with a deckload of timber staggering before the hurricane  fluttering rags showed where her maintopsail had blown from the ropes curved ribands held fast at head and foot marked what was left of her forecourse and puny figures dotted the yards struggling futilely with clewedup canvas that bulged out as if inflated hard she had a torn jib and topsails setstrips of sail that looked absurdly small by comparison with the foamlapped hull but they were bearing her on at tremendous speed caught no doubt lightly manned by the sudden gale they had had no time to shorten sail and bring her head to sea she must run with what canvas was left her until the tornado broke unless she broached to and her heavy deckload rolled her over  so far evelyn had not felt much fear there was something in the mad fury of the elements that for a time banished thought of personal danger she was overwhelmed and yet conscious of a strange excitement but the sight of the helpless ship had a daunting effect belted with leaping foam bows up poop down the dripping hull drove by plowing a snowy furrow through the tormented sea when she plunged into the dark evelyn was glad that she had gone she wondered what could be done in this wild weather if the enchantress would not come round but she had confidence in grahame as she looked at him he commandingly raised his hand  two men scrambled forward and a dark patch rose at the bows it swelled and emptied but the canvas held and grahame struggled forward to help the others the sail might stand if they could hoist it before it split it ran higher up the stay the enchantress slowly fell off before the wind and then leaped ahead with her bows lifted out of the foam  evelyn drew a deep breath of relief for the immediate danger was over and the vessel might run out of the worst of the storm cliffe nodded when she looked at him and with some trouble they made their way into the house where with the door shut they could hear themselves speak evelyn was wet with spray but there was a high color in her face and her eyes shone as she sat down the house shook beneath a blow and there was a savage flapping on the roof then something seemed driven across it and they could hear only the wind and the sea again  the awning cliffe said theyve managed to cut it loose now that shes before the wind i guess grahame would rather have brought her headon but he wont have much trouble if they can keep her from broaching to were you scared  no evelyn answered thoughtfully i suppose it was so appalling that i couldnt realize the danger i really feel that id be sorry if id missed it  cliffe made a sign of comprehension  well this is the first time youve seen men hard up against a big thing its an illuminating experience though a large number of people never get it some of them seem to imagine things go right of themselves and theres no call now for strength and nerve anyhow i was glad to feel that grahame knew his business  evelyn was silent for a few moments her clothes were wet and ought to be changed but the tension on her nerves had not slackened much and she felt restless and unwilling to be alone besides there was a mild satisfaction in doing something imprudent and she thought the storm had roused her father into a talkative mood while indulgent to her he was often marked by a certain reserve which she had noticed her mother never tried to penetrate  i wonder why you decided to cross in this little boat when we could have gone by one of the big passenger liners she said  saved waiting for one thing cliffe answered in a deprecatory tone then ill confess that i felt id like to do something that wasnt quite usual  evelyn laughed  it isnt a wish one would suspect you of  well cliffe said with a twinkle i guess it was boyish but we all have our weaknesses though i dont often indulge mine i find it doesnt pay im a sober business man but theres a streak of foolishness in me sometimes it works out and i feel that i want a frolic for a change  then you must have exercised some selfcontrol  when i was a young man i found my job square in front of me i had to sit tight in the office straighten out a business that had got rather complicated and expand it if possible it wasnt quite all i wanted to do but id a notion that i could make my pile and then let myself go it took me some years to get things straight the pile was harder to make than i reckoned and your mother had a use for all the money i could raise her ambition was to put the family high up in the social scaleand shes done it  so you stifled your longings and went on making money that we might have every advantage evelyn said with a guilty feeling i feel ashamed when i realize it  ive been repaid cliffe replied then after a time my job became congenial and got hold of me the work became a habit i didnt really want to break away he paused and resumed with a humorous air its only at odd moments i play with the notion that id like something different i know it would jar me if i got it and im getting old  evelyn mused her fathers story had its pathetic side though they had not much in common he had been her mothers willing slave toiling in the city to further plans which evelyn suspected he would not have made in a sense his life had been bare and monotonous there was something he had missed evelyn thought that he recognized this though not with regret  she started as grahame came in salt water dripped from him and gathered in a pool on the floor but he turned to them with a smile  the wind is dropping fast and the sea hadnt time to get up we had some trouble at first when the awning blew out of its lashings and stopped her coming round but she steered all right as soon as we got her before the sea  we were on deck most of the time evelyn said  grahame laughed as he recalled their conversation in the early evening  after what you must have seen he asked dont you agree that there are advantages in keeping in smooth water  oh one cant deny it for all that my experience tonight strengthens my belief that theres something very exhilarating in taking a risk  she went out on deck and stood for a minute or two holding on by a shroud there was now no fury in the wind and the moon was bright the swell had gathered itself up into tumbling combers that shook their crests about the rail as the enchantress lurched over them a few torn clouds drove across the southern sky but the rest of the wide sweep was clear and the scene was steeped in harmonies of silver and dusky blue by daybreak the vessel would be steaming on an even keel but evelyn knew that she would not again be content with glassy calm and languorous tranquillity the turmoil of the storm had made a subtle change in her it was as if she had heard a call in the elemental clamor and her heart had answered     chapter xvi  the ruse   cliffe and his daughter were landed at kingston and three weeks later grahame put into a centralamerican port the propeller was not running well and macallister suspecting it was working loose on the shaft declared that he must put the vessel on a beach where she would dry at lowwater grahame had a few days to spare for he could not land his cargo before the time don martin had fixed but as the arms were on board he would have preferred to wait at sea outside the regular steamers track  it happened that there was no repairshop in the town but while macallister thought over the difficulty a tramp steamer dropped anchor and he went off to her remarking that he might find a friend on board in an hour or two the gig came back and grahame hearing my boat rocks at the pier o leith sung discordantly saw that macallisters expectations had been fulfilled this did not surprise him for the scots engineer is ubiquitous and to have wrought at clydebank or fairfield is a passport to his affection  macallisters face was flushed and his air jaunty but the tall gaunt man who accompanied him looked woodenly solemn he began by emptying a basket of greasy tools on the enchantresss white deck with the disregard for the navigating officers feelings which the engineroom mechanic often displays after this he went down a rope and sat on the sand under the boats counter studying the loose screw while he smoked several pipes of rank tobacco but without making any remark then he got up and slowly stretched his lanky frame  weel he said well make a start  it was eleven oclock on a very hot morning when he and macallister lighted a blowlamp the flame of which showed faint and blue in the strong sunshine and they labored on until dusk fell between six and seven in the evening offers of food and refreshment were uncivilly declined and watson ignored grahames invitation to spend the evening on board  ill be back the morn was all he said as he was rowed away  a new type grahame laughed  hes unique walthew agreed only addressed me twice and then in a very personal strain but the fellows an artist in his way spent two hours softening and filing up a taper key but it fitted airtight when we drove it in something roman about that man means his work to last forever  operations were resumed the next morning and grahame had no doubt of the excellence of the job when the scots seemed satisfied late in the afternoon then watson said he would come back to dine when he had cleaned himself and would bring his skipper and grahame dubiously inspected his small stock of wine he imagined it had not sufficient bite to please his guests  the tramp skipper presently arrived a short stout man with a humorous eye when dinner was over and the wine finished the party adjourned to the café bolívar but grahame went with misgivings he knew something about the habits of tramp captains and had seen trouble result from the eccentricities of scotch engineers the garrison band was playing in the plaza they crossed and citizens promenaded up and down with their wives and daughters the clear moonlight fell upon gaylycolored dresses and faces of various shades while here and there a jingling officer lavishly decorated with goldlace added an extra touch of brightness nobody however showed a friendly interest in grahames party for americans and english were not just then regarded with much favor in the ports of the spanish main indeed grahame fancied that a group of slouching soldiers meant to get into his way but as a brawl was not desirable he tactfully avoided them  the café was situated at the end of the square and the party sitting at a small table among the pillars that divided its open front from the pavement could look down upon the moonlit harbor the inlet was long and shallow with an old spanish fort among the sands at its outer end and another commanding it from a height behind the town a cathedral stood opposite the café and narrow dark streets radiating from the plaza pierced the square blocks of houses  walthew and grahame drank black coffee but this had no attraction for the rest the tramp captain soon becoming genial put his feet on a chair and beamed upon his neighbors while macallister as usual entered into talk with them he discoursed at random in very bad castilian but his remarks were humorous and in spite of the citizens prejudices laughter followed them watson sat stonily quiet drinking fiery caña and frowning at the crowd  ye were aye a dumb stirk at clydebank macallister said to him can ye no talk instead o glowering like a deathshead  i can when im roused watson replied maybe yell hear something frae me when im through wi this bottle  its the nature o the man macallister informed the others and then addressing the company asked if anybody could sing  no one offered to do so and beckoning a darkcomplexioned lounger who had a guitar hung round his neck he brought him to their table and gave him wine then he borrowed the guitar and somewhat to grahames surprise began a passable rendering of a spanish song  the captain beat time with a bottle some of the company sang the refrain and after finishing amidst applause macallister tried the music of his native land in this he was less successful for the wild airs written for the bagpipes did not go well upon the melancholy guitar  its no the thing at all watson remarked yere just plodding through it like a sevenknot tramp against the tide can ye no open the throttle and give her steam  before macallister could answer a neatly dressed gentleman brought a bottle of vermouth from a neighboring table and joined the group  you like a drink he asked politely  watson nodded and taking the small bottle emptied half of the liqueur into his glass  yons no so bad he commented when he had drained the glass  the stranger smiled as he poured out the rest of the vermouth for watson  you mend the steamboat screw he asked carelessly  yes my friend watson replied regarding the stranger out of sleepy looking eyes  how it come loose  tailnut slacked up when the engines ran away in heavy weather  you get bad weather then  bad enough watson answered  grahame gave him a cautious glance but his face was expressionless it was obvious that the stranger had mistaken him for the enchantresss engineer watson must have realized this but he had given the fellow misleading answers and grahame thought he need not run the risk of trying to warn him he wondered though how far macallister had taken watson into his confidence  small boat said the stranger you find her wet when it blow what you load  mahogany and dyewood when its to be got  then you go to manzanillo perhaps to honduras but she not carry much not room for big logs below  the big ones sit on deck said watson stolidly  the man ordered some cognac but grahame imagined that he was wasting his hospitality though the scots legs might grow unsteady his head would remain clear  there is cargo that pay better than wood his companion suggested with a meaning smile  maybe agreed watson but ye run a risk in carrying it  ver true and when you go to sea  i canna tell the highpress piston must come up shes loosened a ring  the stranger made a few general remarks and then strolled away he had learned at the cost of a bottle of vermouth and some brandy that watson was the enchantresss engineer and the vessel would not sail for a day or two  grahame chuckled he meant to leave port the next morning  having spent some time at the café he felt that he could now leave his guests they might perhaps indulge in boisterous amusements but he did not think they would come to harm indeed if anybody were hurt in a row it would more likely be the citizens who came into collision with them  all right ive had enough walthew said when grahame touched him macks going to sing again and i cant stand for that  the moon had sunk behind the white houses as they crossed the plaza and grahame kept down the middle avoiding the crowd near the bandstand and the narrow mouths of the streets  who was that fellow talking to watson walthew asked  i dont know but he was interested in our affairs they have a good secret service in these countries and were open to suspicion were obviously not yachtsmen and the boats too small for a regular trader  do you think the mans an agent of the government were up against  i dont know id hardly expect them to send their spies along the coast but then these states may keep each other informed about the movements of dangerous people anyway thered be an excuse for trouble if they searched us and found the rifles  sure said walthew thoughtfully its fortunate we light out tomorrow  he looked round as they reached the end of the plaza the band had stopped and the ring of lights round its stand was broken as the lamps went out but a broad illuminated track extended from the front of the café the thinning crowd moved across it a stream of black figures silhouetted against the light everything else was dark and except for the soft patter of feet the city was quiet but it had a sinister look and walthew instinctively kept away from the trees in the small alameda they skirted he was an anglosaxon and would not shrink from a danger that could be faced in daylight but he hated the stealthy attack in the dark and the hidden intrigues the latin halfbreeds delight in  when they reached the beach he stumbled over a small anvil lying near highwater mark and after another few steps trod upon a hammer  they have left all their tools about he said shall we call the boys and put the truck on board  i think not grahame replied its the marine engineers privilege to make as much mess as he likes and he generally resents its being cleaned up without his permission besides their leaving the things suggests that the jobs not finished  they pushed off the dinghy and boarded the steamer the tide had flowed round her but she would not float for an hour or two and walthew sitting on the rail glanced down the harbor it was now very dark but the water had a phosphorescent gleam the enchantresss cable was marked by lambent spangles and there was a flicker of green fire along the tramps dark side her ridinglights tossed as she swung with the languid swell and away at the harbor mouth two bright specks pierced the dark a small gunboat had anchored at dusk and as the fort had fired a salute she was evidently a foreigner walthew felt curious about her nationality and wondered why she lay where she commanded the entrance instead of mooring near the town grahame however did not seem disturbed and they presently sat down to a game of chess in the saloon  although the ports were open it was very hot and when the kerosene lamp flickered in the draughts an unpleasant smell filled the room the men felt languid and their attention wandered from the dragging game at last walthew threw the pieces roughly into the box  youd have seen what i was getting after with the bishop if you hadnt been thinking of something else he said its been a mighty long game mack ought to have come back  grahame nodded agreement and they went out on deck the town was quiet and so far as they could see only one light burned in it between the plaza and the alameda then an uproar broke out the clamor reaching them distinctly over the night water grahame running to the engineroom shook the drowsy halfbreed on watch and ordered him to stir the fires which had been lighted and damped then he dropped over the rail into the dinghy with walthew and as soon as they jumped ashore they started for the plaza on a run  sounds like a jamboree walthew said when things begin to hum youll find mack somewhere around and that tramp captain looked as if he could get on a jag  he had a wicked eye grahame breathlessly agreed  as they entered the plaza a noisy crowd which seemed to be getting larger rapidly surged toward them in the background the café bolívar was still lighted and close at hand a lamp burned at the top of a tall pole for all that it was difficult to make out anything except a mass of people pressing about a smaller group and grahame roughly flung two or three excited citizens aside before he could see what was going on then he was not surprised to note a party of three britons retreating in good order before an obviously hostile mob the tramp captain had lost his hat and his jacket was torn but he carried a champagne bottle like a club and his hot red face had a pugnacious look macallister trailed the leg of a broken iron chair and watson seemed to have armed himself with part of the chairs back he was hurling virulent epithets at the throng while macallister sang a sentimental ballad in an unsteady voice  as grahame and walthew drew nearer the crowd closed in as if to cut off the others retreat but a shout from watson dominated the growing uproar  oot o the way ye dirt drap yon deevil wi the knife  macallister still singing swung the leg of the chair and a man went down upon the stones the knife he held flying from his hand there was a thud as the captains champagne bottle descended on somebodys head and watson sprang forward whirling the broken casting the crowd gave back before his rush and then scattered as grahame and walthew appeared in the gap the fugitives stopped and during the moments breathing space grahame noticed that a smashed guitar adorned with gaudy ribbons hung round macallisters neck  it was yon fool thing made the trouble watson explained he racked her till she buckled but she would not keep the tune and we had to pit her owner below the table then an officer wi a sword would interfere and when he got a bit tap wi a bottle we were mobbed by the roomful o swine  he paused as somebody threw a stone at him and then addressed the crowd in warning  well no be responsible for what may happen til ye if we lose our tempers  the mob had been closing in again but it fell back when two whiteuniformed rural guards with pistols drawn pushed through grahame spoke to them in castilian and they stopped while they asked him questions another man whom they saluted with respect joined them  it is not permitted to make a disturbance in this city the official said to grahame we will inquire into the matter tomorrow you will go on board your vessel now  im no going watson declared when grahame translated the order took a room at hotel sevillana and i want to see the dago who would pit me oot  better humor him advised the captain obstinate beast when he gets a notion into his head if hes not on board in the morning ill send a boatful of deckhands for him  grahame explained that the engineer wished to spend the night ashore and the official looked thoughtful  very well he said one of the guards will see him to his hotel it is necessary for him to go now  ye can tell him im ready watson replied and added in a low voice as he passed grahame get away to sea as soon as she floats  he went off with his escort and the official said something aside to the remaining guard who saluted and told the others to follow him the crowd had scattered and nobody interfered with the party on their way to the harbor  i will wait until i see you go on board the guard said when they reached the beach you will be called upon some time tomorrow  theyd have been wiser if they had begun their investigations now grahame remarked as they launched the dinghy shell be afloat in half an hour do you feel up to running the engine mack if not walthew must do the best he can  i could take her oot if i was drunk and im far frae that macallister declared looks as if ye had no allooed for the steadiness o the scottish head noo theres watson and ill no say he was quite sober but he could spoil yon dagos game maybe yere beginning to understand why he would sleep ashore they think ye canna get away withoot him  i see that said grahame better send your fireman to collect your tools when miguel looses the stern mooring and try to restrain your feelings if things are not quite right below its important that we should get away quietly  they reached the enchantress and preparations for departure were silently begun  they must first slip past the watching fort and then elude the foreign gunboat they knew the consequences if they were caught     chapter xvii  eluding the gunboat   the night was very dark here and there a lone star peeped out bravely but it could shine but faintly through the heavy mist that was settling down over the enchantress  grahame the leadline in his hand leaned anxiously on the rail watching the foam boil about the vessels side her keel stirred in the sand and the propeller was beating hard but she did not move to make things worse the disturbed water broke noisily on the beach and the thud of engines could be heard at some distance grahame had not complied with the formalities required before leaving port but he carried a dangerous cargo and he feared that he might be detained unless he got away at once the enchantress however was not yet afloat and he reluctantly signaled for steam to be shut off  walthew came up when the engines stopped and grahame sat down on the ledge of the door it was very quiet when the splash of water died away and the darkness and silence reacted upon the mens tense nerves they found inaction singularly hard  you have got to take her out the minute shes off the ground walthew said to be caught getting ready to leave would give us away  sure thing the port captains guard watches the beach theyve sentries at the fort and a wire to the town and theres a gunboat in the entrance our job doesnt look easy  ye have quarter o an hour yet but thats all macallister said as he joined them if i canna give the engines steam then shell blow off and rouse the town  they waited anxiously grahame glancing at his watch and walking to the rail where he felt the leadline but the water rose with exasperating slowness then suddenly a jet of steam broke with a muffled throb from the escapepipe and macallister jumped up  ye have got to start her noo he said  walthew followed him below the engines clanked the propeller spun and grahame hauled the lead in with a breath of relief for the line grew taut as the vessel moved then he stood in the main rigging where he could see better and where miguel at the helm could watch his signaling hand with screw throbbing gently the enchantress crept away into the dark her gray hull would be invisible from the shore but phosphorescence blazed about her bows and her wake was a trail of fire  the tramp steamer rode not far ahead a mysterious shadowy bulk with the gleam of her anchorlights on the water but as the enchantress stole past a voice called out to her  good luck  grahame did not answer but he was grateful the tramp captain understood why his engineer had stayed ashore macallisters friends were staunch the scots stood by one another  the light in the plaza grew dim astern and the blurred dark beach was rapidly slipping by there was a lift on the water as they drew near the harbor mouth but the fort had yet to be passed and grahame searched the shore with his glasses little by little he made out a formless mound which grew more distinct there was no light in the building but he knew that sentries were supposititiously keeping watch beside the guns one or two of these were modern and no vessel was allowed to leave port at night without official permission and a notification to the commandant if the steamer were seen refusal to stop would be followed by the roar of a gun but grahame did not mean to stop so long as she was not struck  for the next few minutes he felt his nerves tingle but the fort was dark and silent and only the soft splash along the beach broke the stillness the shadowy building dropped astern and he turned his glasses upon the harbor mouth two lights showed where the gunboat lay and some distance beyond them a dim pulsating radiance glimmered this marked where the open water swell broke upon the shoals grahame hoped that it would cover the enchantresss luminous wake besides the roar of the surf might drown the thud of engines which carries far on a calm night  jumping down from the rigging he rapped sharply on the enginehatch and walthew ran quickly up the ladder  throttle her down grahame said if i knock once stop her if twice give her all the steam you can  walthew nodded to show that he understood for it might be dangerous to use the telegraph gong and then he disappeared below while grahame stood still steadying the glasses on the deckhouse top  with screw spinning slowly the enchantress glided on and the gunboats hull grew into shape against the sky grahame was glad that he had the land behind him and his vessel was small but he beckoned miguel to let her swing inshore there was a shoal on that side marked by a line of foam but he must take the risk of going too close  a phosphorescent flicker played about the vague blackness of the gunboats bows the light from the lamp on her forestay showed part of the deck and then receded as she rolled grahame could make out an anchor hanging ready to let go and a man standing by her rail until the light reeled and the figure was lost in gloom it seemed to him that the enchantress must be seen and he wondered whether the other vessel had her boats in the water he suspected that she belonged to the government which don martin meant to overthrow and it would be difficult to get away from her if she had steam up she was now abreast of him but there was no sign of activity on board the enchantress crept on the gunboat dropped back to her quarter then there was a sudden harsh rattle and grahame gasped but a splash relieved the tension because he knew it was only the ashhoist bringing up furnace cinders  she drew further aft and began to fade but grahame now saw danger ahead the enchantress was throwing fiery spray about her bows and rolling as she forged slowly through broken water the shoal was close ahead and taking a sounding he found scarcely a fathom under the keel this was enough however and beckoning to miguel he let her go until the darkness astern was broken only by the gunboats lights then finding deeper water he struck the enginehatch  were clear he called down in an exultant voice drive her but make no sparks  the enchantress began to tremble and a few moments later loose stanchions rattled and deckplanks shook as she leaped through the long swell with green fire blazing in the wake of her thudding screw grahame laughed softly and sat down to light a cigarette he imagined that when morning came there would be several badly disappointed intriguers in the port he had left  he thought it best however not to proceed directly to his destination and it was three days later when he ran in behind a point and anchored in shallow water it was daylight but the enchantresss gray hull and slender spars would be hard to see against the land and there was no sign of habitation on the sweep of desolate coast a cliff rose behind the steamer and then for some miles the dazzling sea broke in a fringe of lacelike foam on a beach of yellow sand on the landward side of this glossygreen jungle rolled away and merged into taller forest that was presently lost in haze no smoke streaked the horizon and there was not a boat on the beach but while grahame carefully watched two appeared from behind a reef and he put down his glasses with a smile  our friends he said to walthew you might get the winch ready while we take the hatches off  an hour later a small party sat in the shade of the new stern awning the boats had gone away loaded but they had left don martin and three companions on board father agustin whose rusty black cassock jarred upon the blaze of light and color leaned back in a canvas chair with a wineglass in his olivetinted hand  im surprised to find you in such company father grahame said to him  the priests eyes twinkled  it is not only the rich and respected we are sent out to seek though i think they need us as much as the others  you might find their help useful walthew suggested  true if one could buy it as a rule they do not give but sell and the price they ask is often high  some bribes are hard to resist when they are offered in the name of charity for example hospitals founded and new churches built grahame interposed these are things you can make good use of  father agustin looked at him steadily  an honest man does not take a bribe as you my son should know he said  ah grahame returned carelessly i did not think you had heard ofa certain affair  walthew gave him a surprised glance but father agustin smiled  i hear many curious things besides my companions take precautions sometimes they find them needed  i suppose if i had done what i was asked and pocketed the reward i should have met with an accident shortly afterward grahame suggested  one does not talk of such matters señor among trusted friends one of the men interposed  your intelligence department seems to be well organized but theres ground for believing the oppositions is quite as good grahame said and related what had happened at their last port  care will be needed after this said don martin now that they know your boat it is fortunate we changed the landing place but you are safe here this coast is low and unhealthy the presidents friends are prosperous and do not live in the swampy jungle  one can understand that grahame responded your appeal is to those who must live how and where they can no doubt they suffer now and then for helping you  ah exclaimed one of the spaniards how they suffer if you give me leave señores i can tell you startling things  they listened with quickening interest and he kept his promise well for there is in southern peoples contaminated by darker blood a vein of sensual cruelty that sometimes leads to the perpetration of unutterable horrors grahames face grew quietly stern walthews hot and flushed and macallister clenched his hand for the tales they heard fired their blood  you have told us enough walthew said at last i went into this business because i was looking for adventure and wanted to make some moneybut i mean to see it through if it costs me all i have he turned to his comrades how do you feel about it  much as you do grahame answered quietly and macallister put his hand on sarmientos arm  im with ye if ye mean to make a clean sweep o yon brutes  i believe their reckoning will come but our bargain stands said don martin we need arms and will pay for all you bring still i am glad your hearts are with us it is sentiment that carries one farthest  how have you been getting on since we last met walthew asked  we make progress though there are difficulties one must fight with the purse as well as the sword and the dictators purse is longer than ours of late he has been getting money and spending it with a free hand  do you know where he gets it grahame asked thoughtfully  so far we have not found out but it is foreign money and he must give what belongs to the country in exchange  an easy plan walthew said makes the country pay for keeping him in power i guess youll have to meet the bill when you get in  that is so don martin agreed it forces our hand we must get in before he leaves us no resources at all  grahame thought of cliffe and wondered about his business with gomez but he decided to say nothing of this  is castillo still at liberty he asked  he is watched but we have been able to protect him a man of passion and fervor who will rouse the people when the right time comes  but perhaps not a good plotter  father agustin gave grahame a shrewd glance  we do not all possess your northern selfrestraint though one admits its value señor castillo follows a poetical ideal  so i imagined cold conviction sometimes leads one farther  they were silent for a minute or two and then one said  we have been anxious about castillo it is not that we doubt his sincerity  you doubt his staying power  father agustin made an assenting gesture  our friend is ardent but a fierce fire soon burns out the danger is that when warmth is needed there may be no fuel left  i think you should try to guard him from pressure he is unfit to stand grahame suggested one cannot always choose ones tools but if you are careful he may last until his work is done  it is so father agustin agreed one loves the ring of fine true steel but it is fortunate that metal of softer temper has its use though it sometimes needs skillful handling  he kens exclaimed macallister ye may rake stuff that will serve ye weel from the scrap heap o humanity and theres times when its a comfort to remember that but im surprised to find ye meddling with politics  i am not a politician it is not permitted but i may hate injustice and there is no canon that bids me support what is evil i came here as your guest with other friends and if they honor me with their confidence i cannot refuse nor do i think it a grave offense to give them a word of advice  good advice may prove more dangerous to their enemies than rifles grahame said  father agustin mused for a few moments  our friends real task begins with their triumph he said gravely for that at best can but mean a clearing of the ground man builds slowly but to destroy is easy and many see no farther  but when the building is tottering and rotten  sometimes it may be repaired piece by piece but that is not your plan father agustin spread out his hands if you build on a sound foundation your new work will stand but the edifice of the state cannot be cemented with hatred and envy this responsibility is yours and not your enemies but one looks to the future with hope as well as doubt  they then discussed the landing of the next cargo and the general course of operations but while they plotted with spanish astuteness grahame imagined that the quiet priest was the brain of the party  after a time the boats came back for another load and when sunset streaked the water with a lurid glow the guests took their leave and the enchantress steamed out to sea     chapter xviii  the test of love   the hot summer day was over and the light beginning to fade when evelyn came down the steps of a country house in northern maine banners post stood at the foot of a hillside among the dark pines and the murmur of running water echoed about its walls it belonged to mrs willans mrs cliffes sister for willans who had bought the house at his wifes command seldom came there and did not count mrs willans wanted a peaceful retreat where she and her friends when jaded by social activities could rest and recuperate in the silence of the woods she had many interests and what she called duties but she had of late felt called upon with her sisters full approval to arrange a suitable marriage for her niece henry cliffe was not really rich  evelyn was dressed in the latest summer fashion and the thin light clothes became her the keen mountain breezes had given her a fine color and she looked very fresh and young by contrast with the jaded business man at her side cliffe wore an old gray suit that evelyn had never seen and shabby leggings a creel hung round his shoulders and he carried a fishingrod his face was lined and pale but when they left the garden and entered the woods evelyn was surprised to note that his thin figure harmonized with the scattered boulders and the ragged pines to some extent this might be accounted for by the neutral tint of his clothes but he somehow looked at home in the wilderness though he had once or twice gone off with an old friend on a shooting trip she had never thought of her father as a sport  it is curious that you make me feel you belong to the bush she said  i used to go fishing when i was a boy cliffe replied with a deprecatory smile ive never had much time for it since but theres nothing im fonder of  evelyn found something pathetic in his answer he had very few opportunities for indulging in the pastimes he liked and now he was going out to fish with a keen eagerness that showed how scarce such pleasures were his enjoyment was essentially natural her friends enthusiasm for the amusements mrs willans got up was artificial and forced they had too much and her father not enough  i hope the trout will rise well she said we were surprised to hear that you were coming down  i found i could get away for the weekend have you been having a good time  yes in a way i have everything i ought to like something amusing to do from morning to night the kind of people ive been used to about me and aunt margaret sees that nobody is dull  she had had more than she mentioned for gore was staying at banners post and had devoted himself to her entertainment with a frank assiduity that had roused the envy of other guests evelyn admitted feeling flattered for gore had many advantages and his marked preference had given her an importance she had not always enjoyed  and yet youre not quite satisfied cliffe suggested with a shrewd glance  perhaps im not but i dont know is one ever satisfied  one ought to be now and then when one is young make the most of the pleasures you can get but aim at the best  evelyn mused for a few minutes she could treat her father with confidence he understood her as her mother seldom did  what is the best she asked  to some extent it depends on your temperament but it goes deeper than that theres success that palls and gratification that doesnt last one soon gets old and the values of things change you dont want to feel when its too late that theres something big and real you might have had and missed  have you felt this  no cliffe answered quietly i get tired of the city now and then and long for old clothes a boat and a fishingrod but these are things it doesnt hurt a man to go without i have a home to rest in and a wife and daughter to work for an object of that kind helps you through life  my trouble is that i dont seem to have any object at all i used to have a number but im beginning now to doubt whether they were worth much but im afraid you have made a sacrifice for our sakes  cliffe looked at her thoughtfully  my belief is that you always have to make some sacrifice for anything thats worth while he laughed but right now fishing is more in my line than philosophy  he followed the little path that led to the stream and evelyn turned back slowly through the quiet woods her fathers remarks had led her into familiar but distasteful thought it was perhaps true that one must make some sacrifice to gain what was best worth having but she had been taught to seize advantages and not to give things up now she could have wealth a high position and social influence which were of value in her world and in order to gain them she had only to overcome certain vague longings and the rebellious promptings of her heart gore wanted her and she had been pleasantly thrilled to realize it perhaps she had to some extent tried to attract him it was foolish to hesitate when the prize was in her reach but she did not feel elated as she went back to the house  she lingered among the last of the trees they lifted their black spires against the sky the air was filled with their resinous scent and faint elfin music fell from their tops far above the bald summit of long mountain shone a deep purple though trails of mist that looked like lace were drawn about its shoulders then the pines rolled down straggling at first but growing thicker and taller until they merged into the dark forest that hid the giants feet the wild beauty of the scene and the calm of the evening reacted upon the girl she felt it was a trivial life that she and her friends led  rousing herself with an effort she left the woods and entered the wellkept garden it had an exotic look the brightcolored borders that edged the lawn jarred upon the austere beauty of the wilderness banners post was tamely pretty and nature had meant the spot to be grand still the nickeled sprinklers that flung glistening showers across the smooth grass and the big gasolene mower belonged to her world in which nature was kept in her place by civilized art  she saw gore at the bottom of the steps in the midst of a group which included two attractive girls and she was conscious of some satisfaction when he left his companions and came toward her  luck has been against me all day he said when he came up it seemed impossible to find you except in the center of what was going on now well run away for a little while  his manner suggested a right to her society and he turned toward the woods without waiting for her consent but evelyn thought he would have acted more wisely had he chosen a quiet nook on the veranda reggie was a product of his luxurious age he was in his right place in a comfortable chair or moving gracefully about a polished floor with smartly dressed people in the background though not wholly artificial and having some force of character he failed to harmonize with the note of primitive grandeur struck by the rugged pines  it was different with evelyn when they sat down on a boulder her dress was in the latest fashion but she had the gift of revealing something of her real personality through her attire its bluegray tint matched the soft coloring of the lichened rock and the lines of her tall figure were marked by a classical severity of grace then her eyes were grave and her face was calm it was her misfortune that she had not yet realized herself but had accepted without much question the manners of her caste and the character mrs cliffe had so to speak superimposed upon her  its good to be quiet for a change gore said when im with you i feel that i neednt talk unless i want to thats a relief because its when i feel least that i talk the most youre tranquilizing  im not sure youre complimentary nowadays a girl is expected to be bright if she cant be brilliant  thats not your real line brilliance is often shallow a cold reflected sparkle one has to get beneath the surface to understand you  perhaps its true of everybody evelyn answered with a smile still were not taught to cultivate virtues that cant be seen  you cant cultivate the best of them theyve got to be an inherent natural part of you but im getting off the tracki do now and then  evelyn guessed what he meant to say but although it would mark a turningpoint in her life and she did not know her answer she was very calm while she had for the most part allowed her mother to direct her actions she had inherited cliffes independence of thought and force of will so far she had not exerted them but she meant to do so now  looking up she saw long mountains towering crest cut in lonely grandeur against the fading green and saffron of the sky the mist upon its shoulders shone faintly white against blue shadows the pines had grown taller and blacker and the sound of running water alone broke the silence the resinous smells were keener and there was a strange repose in the long ranks of stately trees nature had filled the stony wilds with stern beauty and evelyn instinctively felt the call of the strong fruitful earth one must be real and in a sense primitive here  this she said indicating the shadowy landscape is very grand we dont give much thought to it but it has its influence  i guess its all quite fine gore agreed absently it would make a great summerresort if they ran in a branchrailroad in fact ive imagined that willans had something of the kind in view he has a genius for developing real estate  an unthinkable desecration evelyn exclaimed  well he said in a quiet voice if it would please you id buy banners post and all the land back to the lake and nobody but my gamewardens should disturb it except when you let me come up here with you then you could teach me to appreciate the things you like  the girl was touched for he belonged to the cities and had nothing in common with the rocky wilds but she knew that he would keep his word and indulge her generously nor was she offended by the touch of commercial spirit though she would rather he had offered something that would cost him effort of body or mind  im afraid you wouldnt find me worth the sacrifice you would have to make she said your tastes dont lie that way  he made a gesture of dissent  none of them are very strong and i know that you go farther in everything than i can youre elusive but ive felt for a long time that if i could reach and win you youd help me along thats my strongest argument and what i really meant to say surely you have seen that i wanted you  evelyn felt guilty because she had seen this and had not repulsed him she did not love the man but love was not thought essential in her circle and she had never been stirred by passion  i felt that i couldnt get hold of you he went on you were not ready we were friends and that was something but i was looking for a change in you some hint of warmth and gentleness  and do you think i am ready now  no i only hoped so i feared i might be wrong but i began to find holding myself back was getting too hard and i was afraid somebody else might come along who had the power to rouse you i believe you can be roused  i wonder she said in a curious tone  you make people love you he broke out thats a proof that when the time comes youre capable of loving but i only ask to be near you and surround you with what you like best theres a rare aloofness in you but youre flesh and blood when you have learned how i love you you cant hold out  evelyn was silent hesitating with a troubled face she liked him he was such a man as her mother meant her to marry and until the last few weeks she had acquiesced in her obvious fate now however something prompted her to rebel although prudence and ambition urged her to yield  as he watched her in keen suspense gore suddenly lost his head the next moment his arm was round her and he drew her forward until she was pressed against him with her face crushed against his at first she did not struggle and he thought she was about to yield until he felt her tremble and her face was suddenly turned away then she put her hand on his shoulder and firmly held him back while she slipped from his relaxing grasp gore knew that he had blundered letting his arms drop he waited until she turned to him without anger although her eyes were very bright and her color was high  im sorry reggie but its impossible for me to marry you  you are sure he asked rather grimly this is important to me you know  yes she said with signs of strain i am sure i think i wish it had been possible but it isnt you have convinced me  he was silent for a moment  it cuts pretty deep he said slowly ive been afraid all along that even if you took me youd never be really within my reach i guess ive got to bear it and let you go  he rose and stood looking at her irresolutely and then with a gesture of acquiescence abruptly turned away  when he had gone evelyn sat still in the gathering dusk she had at first submitted to his embrace because she wished to find in any emotion he was capable of arousing an excuse for marrying him but she had felt nothing except repulsion then in a flash the truth was plain any closer relationship than that of friend would make her loathe the man she in some ways admired this was disturbing but little by little she began to realize that his touch had a strange aftereffect it had stirred her to warmth but not toward him longings she had not thought herself capable of awoke within her she was conscious of a craving for love and of a curious tenderness only reggie was not the man he had roused her but she did not know whether she ought to be grateful for that she blushed as she struggled with her rebellious feelings and then resolutely pulled herself together her mother must be told  mrs cliffe was resting before dinner when evelyn entered her room and sat down without speaking  what is the matter mrs cliffe asked with a premonition that something had gone wrong why do you come in in this dramatic way  i didnt mean to be dramatic evelyn answered quietly still perhaps i was rather highly strung reggie asked me to marry him and i told him i could not  mrs cliffe sat up suddenly and there was an angry sparkle in her eyes  then i think you must be mad what led you to this absurd conclusion  its hard to explain evelyn answered with a faint smile i suppose i couldnt give you any very logical reasons  then it may not be too late to put things right mrs cliffe saw a ray of hope  im afraid it is i think reggie knows thathe was very considerate there is no use in your trying to do anything i must have my own way in this  mrs cliffe was painfully surprised the girl had suddenly developed and revealed unsuspected capacities she had grown like her father who for all his patience was sometimes immovable there was inflexibility in evelyns attitude her face was hard and determined  very well she acquiesced your father must be told and i dont know what he will do about it  i would rather tell him myself evelyn said  this was not what mrs cliffe wanted but the girl moved to the door as she finished speaking and her mother sat down burning with indignation her authority had been outraged she felt overcome and did not leave her room all evening  evelyn found cliffe on the veranda and took him down the steps before she told him what she had done he listened without surprise indeed she thought his manner was rather curiously sympathetic  well he said in a way im sorry reggies a good fellow as far as he goes but i imagined you liked him why did you refuse  it isnt very plain evelyn answered i felt i had to perhaps long mountain had something to do with it  cliffe smiled but not with amusement and evelyn saw that he understood somehow she had expected him to do so and she was touched when he gently pressed her arm  after all youre the person most interested and you must please yourselfthough your mother will be badly disappointed he said its possible were wiser in the woods than in the city one sees the things that matter more clearly away from the turmoil     chapter xix  the cuban spy   gore left banners post abruptly to evelyns relief and on the morning after his departure she and cliffe stood on the steps before the other guests had come down to breakfast it had rained all night the mist hung low about long mountains side and a fresh wind woke waves of sound from the rustling pines a creel hung round cliffes shoulders and he contemplated the dripping woods with a smile of halfapologetic satisfaction  the fishing should be great today he exclaimed but i feel that im playing truant i ought to be back at the office guess the trout i catch will cost me high but the temptation is pretty strong when i see the water rise  im glad you have been rash for once evelyn replied besides you have an office full of people who can look after things for you  cliffe shook his head  thats the excuse i tried to make but it wont quite work if you want to be a successful operator you have to sit tight with your finger on the pulse of the market a beat or two more or less makes a big difference finance soon gets feverish  and you are one of the doctors who send its temperature up or down  no thats a wrong idea once on a time the big men did something of the kind but now the dollars a worldforce thats grown too strong for them we gave it a power we cant control it drives us into combines and mergers we didnt plan its a blind force that rolls along undirected over our bodies if we get in its way all we can do is to try to guess its drift the successful man is the one who does so first  i wonder whether youre to be pitied or envied the work must be absorbing and its simple in a way  simple cliffe exclaimed  well you have an object your aims are definite and you know more or less how to carry them out we others who have no purpose in life spend our time in amusements that leave us dissatisfied when we stop to think we feel that we might do something better but we dont know what it is the outlook is blank  cliffe gave her a sharp glance evelyn had changed in the last few months and she had been strangely quiet since her refusal of gore seeing his interest she laughed  im not asking for sympathy and i mustnt keep you from the trout go and catch as many as you can it must be nice to feel that you have only to pick up a fishingrod and be young again  she walked to the gate with him but cliffe stopped when they reached it for a big automobile was lurching down the uneven road the mud splashed about the car indicated distance traveled at furious speed but it slowed at the bend near the gate and cliffe sighed as he recognized robinson  i guess this stops my fishing he said in a resigned tone dropping his rod and creel he jumped on to the footboard as the driver cautiously took the gate and evelyn smiled as the car rolled up the drive she was sorry that her father had lost his favorite sport but his prompt surrender of it was characteristic he was first of all a man of business  wired for an auto to meet me when i left the train robinson told him it was raining pretty hard and they dont do much grading on these mountain roads but i made the fellow rush her along as fast as he could he took some letters from his wallet read these and think them over while i get breakfast  half an hour afterward they sat in a corner of the veranda where mrs willans guests left them alone these quiet intent men of affairs obviously did not belong to their world  well robinson said  one of two things has got to be done theres no middle course  robinson nodded  thats true middle courses generally lead to nothing  very well we can cut out our deal with president altiera lose the money we have spent and let the concessions go or we can pay up again hang on and put the matter through  whats your opinion the fellow asks for more  do you mean to be guided by me  yes robinson said take which you think is the right line ill stand in  its pretty hard to see well make good if we get the concessions but the presidents up against a bigger thing than he thought its going to cost him and us some money to head off the revolutionists but if we dont drop out right now weve got to brace up and put it over well as im fixed its a big risk my moneys making good interest and if i go on ive got to sell out stock i meant to hold a setback would be a serious thing for me i want a few minutes to think it over  robinson had confidence in cliffes integrity and judgment  an hour if you like he said then well have to pull out whatever you decide  for a long while cliffe sat silent with knitted brows his wife made claims upon his means that he sometimes found it hard to satisfy and it was his ambition that his daughter should be rich after carefully pondering the letters he saw that he might be involved in a conflict with forces whose strength he could not estimate and defeat would cost him the fruit of several years labor yet the prize to be won was tempting and he could take a risk besides they already had put a good deal of money into it  well he said at last ive made up my mind  to hold on i guess robinson suggested with a smile  thats so cliffe answered in a quiet voice whats more im going out to look into things myself we can talk it over on the way to town ill be ready as soon as ive told my wife  robinson took out his watch  give you half an hour if were to catch the train he said  cliffe met evelyn in the broad hall and told her that he would have to go south at once  take me with you wont you she begged i want to get away from banners post  cliffe hesitated a moment  why yes he then said i see no reason why you shouldnt goparticularly as your mother means to stay with margaret willans  when a half hour later the car started from the bottom of the steps and mrs cliffe turned away with a wave of her hand evelyn stood in the drive asking herself bluntly why she wished to accompany her father a longing for change had something to do with it she was getting tired of an aimless and in a sense uneventful life for it was true that occupations that had once been full of pleasurable excitement had begun to pall but this was not her only object grahame was somewhere on the coast she meant to visit and she might meet him evelyn admitted with a blush that she would like to do so  the next morning a telegram arrived from cliffe directing her to join him in town and ten days later she stood at evening on a balcony of the hotel international in havana it was getting dark but a few lamps were lighted in the patio and the moonlight touched one white wall the air was hot and heavy and filled with exotic smells and the sound of alien voices gave evelyn the sense of change and contrast she had sought yet she knew that so far the trip had been a failure it had not banished her restlessness havana was as stale as new york she remembered with regret how different it had been on her first visit grahame and his companion had been with her then and she knew that she missed them  she turned as a man came out on the balcony that ran along the end of the house he did not look like a cuban and she started when the moonlight fell upon him for she saw that it was grahame he was making for the stairs at the corner where the two balconies joined and did not notice her evelyn realized that as she wore a white dress her figure would be indistinct against the wall and if she did not move in the next few moments he would go down the stairs and disappear among the people in the patio if he had meant to enter the hotel he would not have come that way  she felt that if she let him go they might not meet again after all this might be wiser yet her heart beat fast and she thrilled with a strange excitement as she stood irresolute knowing that the choice she had to make would be momentous  grahame reached the top of the stairs without turning and was going down when she leaned over the balustrade she did not consciously decide upon the action it was as if something had driven her into making it  mr grahame she called softly  he looked up with the moonlight on his face and she saw the gleam she had expected in his eyes then he came swiftly toward her and her indecision vanished when she gave him her hand  this is a remarkably pleasant surprise but i didnt see you until you spoke he said have you just come out of one of the rooms  no ive been here some time i saw you as soon as you appeared on the balcony  grahame gave her a quick look and she knew he was wondering why she had waited until the last moment he was shrewd enough to see that the delay had some significance but this did not matter  well he said im glad you didnt let me pass because i was going out into the street and its doubtful if id have come back  yes said evelyn i seemed to know that  he was silent for a moment but his expression was intent and a faint glow of color showed in his brown face evelyn let him make what he liked of her admission she had not been influenced by coquetry but by a feeling that it was a time for candor  i was thinking about an interview id just finishedthat is why i didnt look round he explained i came from matanzas this afternoon  then the enchantress isnt here  no shes at matanzas but i cant get back tonight will you be here long  a day or two waiting for a boat i wonder whether you would stay and dine with us this evening then a thought struck evelyn and she added that is if it isnt undesirable for you to be seen here  she had not expected him to hesitate and was prepared for his reckless twinkle  of course ill stay but did you meanif it was not unsafe  i suppose i did she admitted with a smile you know i helped you in a mysterious plot the last time i was here now it would be selfish of me to ask you to wait if you think youd better not  theres no risk worth counting and id take it if there was when you have a temperament like mine its hard to deny yourself a pleasure  i shouldnt have thought you selfindulgent evelyn smiled  well he said ones fortitude has its limits i suppose it depends upon the strength of the temptation  he had answered in a light vein and evelyn followed his lead  its a relief to know you mean to stay my father will be pleased to see you but he may not have finished his business when dinner is ready and i rather shrink from going down alone  they talked about matters of no importance for a time and then went through the patio to the diningroom it was not full and evelyn imagined that grahame was glad there were several unoccupied chairs between them and the rest of the company she noticed moreover that when people came in he glanced up quietly as if he did not want her to notice his action and she had a guilty feeling that she had made him take a risk that was greater than he would own yet she was glad that he had taken it  where are you going when you leave havana he asked presently  to valverde and afterward perhaps to rio frio  grahame looked thoughtful and evelyn quietly studied him her training had made her quick at guessing what lay behind the reserve of people who were not quite frank with her and she saw that he was disturbed  why should i not go there she asked  i dont know any good reason if your fathers willing to take you but the countrys in a rather unsettled state just now grahame paused for a moment and added earnestly dont trust gomez  do you think we shall meet him  yes he said with a dry smile i think it very likely  then you must know something about my fathers business and what is going on in the country  i believe i know more about the country than your father does in fact id like to warn him against gomez only that i imagine hes a good judge of character and already knows his man  grahame wrote an address on a leaf of a small notebook and tearing it out put it on her plate  im going to ask a favor if you should meet with any difficulty at rio frio will you send me a message through the man whose name ive written down i might perhaps be of some use  do you expect us to get into any difficulty  no but one cant telltrouble might arise  and if it did you could help us  well he said gravely id do my best  evelyns eyes sparkled  i know you could be trusted but all this mystery gives the trip an extra interest then you have made it obvious that the enchantress will be on the coast  may i hope that this adds to your satisfaction grahame said smiling  now youre frivolous and i was pleasantly excited however ill promise that if anything very alarming seems to threaten us ill send you word  grahame looked up an elderly cuban gentleman three or four places off had once or twice glanced at them carelessly and then resumed his conversation with a lady beside him but grahame noticed that he stopped when evelyn spoke  am i to tell my father what i have promised she asked  you must use your own judgment about that  evelyn understood him he would not ask her to keep a secret from her father and she liked his delicacy but he looked thoughtful she did not know that the cuban gentleman engaged his attention  well she said ill tell him if it seems necessary that is if theres any reason for sending you word otherwise of course there would be no need to mention it  no he agreed with a smile that seemed to draw them closer because it hinted at mutual understanding  one doesnt feel forced to explain things to you evelyn said impulsively  thats an advantage explanations are a nuisance and sometimes dangerous when theyre important i find them easiest when they dont matter  cliffe came in and greeted grahame cordially and grahame glancing down the table without turning his head saw the cuban studying them something in the mans manner suggested that cliffes friendliness had surprised him he made a few hasty pencil marks on the back of an old letter and then looking up suddenly caught grahame watching him curiously the cuban pushed back his chair and left the room although grahame suspected that his dinner was not more than half finished  evelyn surprising the alert look on grahames face was now more disturbed than ever on his account evidently there was danger for him here  her fears would have been increased had she known the few words the spy wrote on his envelope     chapter xx  the arrest of castillo   on a hot evening not long after he left havana cliffe sat in a room of the old spanish presidio at valverde the building was in harmony with the decayed town for it had been begun in more prosperous times and its lower courses were solidly laid with stone molded doors and windows spoke of vanished art and the gallery round the central patio was raised on finely carved pillars but valverde had fallen on evil days and the presidio had been finished with adobe mud it had served at different times as the seat of the government the barracks and the jail and now when part had fallen down the rest had been rudely repaired and gomez was quartered there when he visited the port  outside the ruinous building still retained a certain dignity but this was not so within where degenerate taste was shown in the tawdry decoration and gomezs sittingroom frankly offended cliffe with its suggestion of effeminate luxury gaudy silk hangings hid the old adobe walls a silver lamp with a smoked chimney hung from the ceiling by tarnished chains and highly colored rugs were spread upon the dirty floor there were inartistic but heavily gilded french clocks and mirrors and over all a sickening scent of perfume  cliffe found it more pleasant to look out through the open window at the town which lay beneath him bathed in moonlight the closemassed squarefronted houses glimmered white and pink and yellow with narrow gaps between them where a few lights burned a break from which dusky foliage rose marked the alameda in front ran a curving beach where wet sand glistened below a bank of shingle and a fringe of surf broke with a drowsy roar though it was not late there was no stir in the streets an air of languorous depression brooded over the town gomez seemed to feel that it needed an explanation  our trade he said is prosperous but we do not encourage the people to gather in the plaza and the cafés are watched they are the storm centers it is there the busybodies talk the man who stays at home and minds his business is seldom a danger to the state he dislikes change and has no time to waste on idealistic theories  i guess thats true up to a point cliffe agreed the industrious citizen will stand for a good deal but hes a man to reckon with when things get too bad he doesnt talk like the others hes been trained to act and there are developments when he makes up his mind about what he wants however this is not what were here to discuss  no but the state of the country has something to do with the matter we admit that there have been manifestations of discontent and disturbances caused by mischievous persons who love disorder and we must enforce quietness and respect for authority this you will understand costs some money  ive subscribed a good deal cliffe reminded him im anxious to learn when im going to get it back  the wish is natural may i point out that in generously offering help you threw in your lot with the government and made our interests yours  i see that pretty clearly cliffe replied with a touch of grimness for he recognized the skill with which he had been led on until he could not draw back without a heavy loss anyway as you seem to have weathered the storm i want my reward in short ive come to find out when your president means to sign the concessions  it will be as soon as possible there is a small difficulty we have an elective legislature an encumbrance señor which hampers the administration but in times of discontent it has some influence our people are jealous of foreigners and there are interested persons ready to work upon their feelings this is why the president hesitates about granting fresh concessions until he has found a way of silencing his enemies among the representatives you perceive that i am frank with you  its what i like but you havent told me yet what i want to know now unless i can find out exactly when i may expect the papers signed ill feel compelled to shut off supplies id rather cut my loss than go on enlarging it  gomez looked pained  i must remind you with some diffidence that others have offered their help he said  they offered it they havent paid up i expect youll find theyll insist on knowing when you mean to deliver the goods thats my position i stand firm on it  very well before answering i must inform the president  you neednt im going to take this matter to headquarters  unfortunately the president has gone to villa paz for a short rest i fear he would not like to be disturbed  he will see me he has to cliffe declared  after all it is possible but i see a difficulty there is no inn at villa paz where the señorita could find accommodation and the president is like myself a bachelor he could receive you but not the señorita our conventions are antiquated but they must be considered it is this which prevents me from offering my hospitality  cliffe pondered for a few moments the conventions gomez mentioned were justified because women are not treated in his country as they are in the united states and cliffe could not leave evelyn alone in the valverde hotel for all that he must see the president and he imagined that although gomez had made some difficulties the fellow was willing that he should go gomez was a clever rogue but cliffe thought he could be trusted so long as their interests did not clash  he looked up sharply for there was a sudden stir in the town cliffe was conscious of no definite sound but he felt that the quietness had been broken and he saw that gomez was listening the mans fleshy face was intent the stamp of indulgence had gone and given place to a look of fierce cruelty he had become alert and resolute this struck cliffe as significant as there was so far nothing to cause alarm  in a few moments a murmur broke out and swelled while gomez walked to the open window the streets were suddenly filled with the patter of hurrying feet and the confused outcry became a menacing roar cliffe jumped up he had heard something like it when a mob of desperate strikers drove the police through an american manufacturing town and now his daughter was alone at the hotel  what is it he asked  a tumult gomez answered i do not think it will be serious we have placed a guard about the hotel so the señorita is safe but you will excuse me for a few minutes  he went into an adjoining room and cliffe standing by the window heard a telephone call after this all sounds inside the house were drowned by the growing uproar outside cliffe could see nothing of the riot but he thought he could locate it in one of the dark gaps that pierced a block of houses some distance off the clamor gained in effect from the mystery that surrounded its cause  two pistol shots rang out and there was a wild shouting but the note of fury had changed to alarm cliffe thought he could hear men running and he pictured the mob pouring down the narrow street in flight for the cries grew less frequent and receded at last they died away and a group of men moving in regular order came out of the mouth of a street they seemed to have a prisoner in their midst and four peons plodded behind carrying something on a shutter then they all vanished into the gloom and when their measured steps were getting faint gomez returned with an unpleasant smile  it is nothing he said we had planned the arrest of a troublesome person called castillo who is a favorite with the mob there was some excitement and a few stones were thrown but only one attempt at a rescue the leader of which was shot by the rural guards as he was a man we suspected of sedition this has saved us some trouble  cliffe looked at him as one who might study a new species of animal or some rare and ugly plant  gomez spread out his hands  it is worth noting that the affair proves our strength he said gloatingly we have seized a popular leader of the discontented and there was no determined resistance one may consider it an encouraging sign  cliffe nodded agreement and gomez changed the subject  i have been thinking he said if you are resolved to see the president señora herrero wife of the alcalde whom you have met would take care of the señorita while you are away they are people of some importance and she would be safe with them  this struck cliffe as a good suggestion and when gomez accompanied him to the alcaldes house the matter was arranged with evelyns consent the next morning cliffe set off with a relay of mules and three or four days later was received by the president at a little town among the hills nothing was said about business until he had rested and dined and then he sat with his host on a veranda half hidden by bougainvillea looking down on the dim littoral that ran back to the sea  president altiera differed from his secretary he looked more of an autocratic soldier than a diplomatist there was a hint of brutality about him and cliffe thought he would rather use force than guile the man had a coarse strong face and his eyes were stern but he was rather reserved than truculent  señor he said since i understand you were determined to see me it is an honor to welcome you and my house and self are at your command i imagine however that neither of us often wastes much time on compliments  my excuse is that i find one does best by going to headquarters when any difficulties arise it seemed possible that your secretary might smooth down my remarks before transmitting them  and you do not wish them smoothed down altiera dryly suggested  i think it best that we should understand each other  that is so what do you wish to understand  when i may expect the sealed grant of the concessions  in two months provided that my enemies do not kill me first which i think is hardly probable  one hopes not but there is another risk not large perhaps but to be reckoned with  altiera laughed  that the people may choose another president no señor i rule this country when i cease to do so it will be because i am dead let us be candid your concessions depend upon the luck that may attend some assassins attempt and i take precautions  cliffe thought this was true altiera carried a pistol and could use it remarkably well and two armed guards were posted outside the veranda  there is a condition altiera said the concessions will be yours in two months but payment of the money my secretary asked for must be made in a fortnight or if this is impossible as soon as you get home  it would suit me better to take the concessions in a fortnight and pay in two months cliffe retorted coolly  i am not a trader señor i do not dispute and haggle over a bargain  neither do i said cliffe still its necessary for a trader to state his terms  there was silence for a few moments and cliffe studying his antagonists face thought his statement justified the man might use brutal means to gain his end but he would not contend about a small advantage  very well the president conceded though it will cause me some embarrassment i make another offer you shall have the grant in a month  a month is too long to wait  altiera rose and stood with his brown hand clenched upon the back of his chair and his brows knitted it seemed to cost him an effort to maintain his selfcontrol and cliffe saw that he had pressed him hard for all that he did not mean to yield he had gone farther than was prudent and knew when to stop  you understand what you risk by your exactions altiera asked menacingly  señor gomez made that plain i have no security for the money already paid except your honor  altiera bowed  though the situation is difficult and you make it worse i believe your confidence is not misplaced well since one or two of my ministers must be consulted i cannot give you an answer for a week but the country is healthful in this neighborhood and you may be interested in studying its resources my house is at your disposal and your comfort will be provided for while i see what can be done  it took cliffe a minute or two to make up his mind he would rather have gone back to valverde at once but he felt that he must finish his business before returning although he had some misgivings he agreed to stay  in reaching his decision he thought evelyn safe with the alcalde but he had not reckoned on the cunning of secretary gomez     chapter xxi  a halfbreeds trick   evelyn found the time pass heavily at valverde the town was hot and uninteresting although she did not see much of it for it was only when the glaring sunshine had faded off the narrow streets that she was allowed a leisurely stroll in company with the alcaldes wife señora herrero who was stout and placid and always dressed in black spoke no english and only a few words of french after an hours superintendence of her halfbreed servants work she spent most of the day in sleep yet she was careful of her guests comfort and in this respect evelyn had no cause for complaint  it was the monotony the girl found trying after the ten oclock breakfast there was nothing to be done until dinner was served at four the adobe house was very quiet and was darkened by lattices pulled across the narrow windows and there was no stir in the town between noon and early evening evelyn patiently tried to grasp the plot of a spanish novel and when she got tired of this sat in the coolest spot she could find listening to the drowsy rumble of the surf hitherto her time had been occupied by strenuous amusements and the lethargic inaction jarred  it was better when the shadows lengthened because there were then voices and footsteps in the streets one could watch the languid traffic but when night came valverde instead of wakening to a few hours joyous life was silent again sometimes a group of people went by laughing and now and then a few gathered round a singer with a guitar but there was no noisy talk in the cafés and no band played in the alameda an ominous quietness brooded over the town  all this reacted on evelyns nerves and one hot afternoon she felt ready to welcome any change as she sat in a shaded room her hands were wet with perspiration the flies that buzzed about her face exasperated her and she found the musky smell that filled the house intolerable señora herrero lay in a big cane chair looking strangely bulky and shapeless in her tight black dress with her eyes half closed and no sign of intelligence in her heavily powdered face evelyn longed to wake her and make her talk  then there were steps outside and gomez came in he bowed and señora herrero grew suddenly alert indeed it struck evelyn that her hostess felt disturbed but she paid no attention to this she was glad of a break in the monotony and it was not until afterward her mind dwelt upon what took place  señor cliffes business with the president will keep him longer than he thought he may be detained for a fortnight gomez said  evelyn had no reason for being on her guard and her disappointment was obvious  i was looking forward to his return in a day or two she answered  the señor cliffe is to be envied for having a dutiful daughter gomez smiled still i need not offer my sympathy because it is his wish that you should go to him  when evelyn asked eagerly  as soon as you are ready i have ordered the mules and you can bring what you think needful we could start after dinner and i offer myself as escort for part of the way  but this is impossible señora herrero exclaimed in horrified protest  gomez spread out his hands deprecatingly  with apologies señora i think not my plan is that you should go with your guest until i can place her in some other ladys hands  but it is years since i have ridden a mule and exercise makes me ill besides i cannot leave my husband and my household  evelyn remembered afterward that her hostesss indignant expression suddenly changed as if gomez had given her a warning look but he answered goodhumoredly  i have seen don josé he feels desolated at the thought of losing you for two or three days but he agrees that we must do all we can to suit the wishes of our american friends besides you can travel to galdo where we stay the night in a coach i will see that one is sent but it may take an hour or two to find mules  they must be good said the señora i am heavy and the road is bad  we will pick the best but until you overtake us the señorita cliffe will no doubt be satisfied with my escort we should reach galdo soon after dark the señora romanez will receive us there and we start early the next morning on our journey to the hills  gomez turned to evelyn  this meets with your approval he asked suavely  oh yes she agreed though she afterward realized that there was no obvious reason why she should not have waited for the coach and that it was curious her hostess did not suggest this  gomez returned after dinner before evelyn was quite ready and she was somewhat surprised that he made no remark about the luggage she wished to take it was skilfully lashed on the broad packsaddles and they set off when she mounted a handsome mule there were two baggage animals driven by darkskinned peons and two mounted men brought up the rear gomez said this explained the delay in getting mules for the coach but added that the girl would find the journey pleasanter in the saddle  evelyn agreed with him as they rode down the roughly paved street it was a relief to be moving and the air had got pleasantly cool halfbreed women with black shawls round their heads looked up at her from beside their tiny charcoal cooking fires and she saw dark eyes flash with hostility as her escort passed here and there a woman of pure spanish blood stood on a balcony and glanced down with shocked prudery at the bold american but evelyn smiled at this she distrusted gomez who obviously was not a favorite with the poorer citizens but as a traveling companion she did not find much fault with him  after a while they left the houses behind and turned into a dusty rutted track the murmur of the sea followed them until they reached a belt of forest where the sound was cut off and evelyn felt as if she had lost a friend the measured beat of the surf and the gleam of spray were familiar things the forest was mysterious and oppressively silent in places a red glow shone among the massive trunks but for the most part they were hung with creepers and all below was wrapped in shade the track grew soft and wet the air was steamy and filled with exotic smells evelyn felt her skin get damp and the mules fell into a labored pace  strange noises began to fill the gathering gloom the air throbbed with a humming that rose and fell deep undertones and shrill pipings that it was hard to believe were made by frogs and insects pierced the stagnant air specks of phosphorescent light twinkled among the leaves but the fireflies were familiar and evelyn welcomed them she felt suddenly homesick and wished they were not leaving the coast but she remembered that her father had sent for her and brushed her uneasiness away  after a time gomez stopped  we have not gone fast and the señora ought to overtake us soon he said will you get down and wait for her  the forest with the thin mist drifting through it had a forbidding look and for the first time that she could recollect evelyn felt afraid of the dark  let us go on she said  gomez hesitated a moment and then acquiesced  the road got steep and the mist thicker drooping creepers brushed them as they passed and now and then evelyn was struck by a projecting branch her mule however needed no guidance and she sank into a dreamy lethargy there was something enervating and soporific in the steamy atmosphere  at last the gloom began to lighten and they came out into the luminous clearness of the tropic night in front lay a few flat blocks of houses surrounded by fields of cane and here and there a patch of broadleafed bananas passing through the silent village they reached a long building which gomez said was the romanez hacienda  lights gleamed in the windows but they knocked twice before a strong arched door was unfastened and they rode through into the patio it was obvious that they were expected a gentleman dressed in white his stout wife in black and a girl who wore a thin yellow dress came down to welcome them they were hospitable but evelyn speaking only a few words of castilian and feeling very tired was glad when her hostess showed her to her room  she soon went to sleep and wakening early felt invigorated by the cool air that flowed in through the open window and the sight of the blue hills that rose cleancut against the morning sky then she had a drowsy recollection of something being wrong and presently remembered that the señora herrero had not arrived this however was not important because gomez could no doubt arrange for her hostess to accompany them on the next stage of their journey  evelyn found gomez apologetic when they met at breakfast he was much vexed with the alcaldes wife but the señorita romanez and her duenna would take her place and he expected to put evelyn in her fathers care in two more days this he added would afford him a satisfaction that would be tempered by regret  they started after breakfast but evelyn did not feel drawn to her new companion luisa romanez was handsome in a voluptuous style with dark hair a powdered face and languishing black eyes but so far as she could make her meaning clear she banteringly complimented evelyn on having won the admiration of a distinguished man evelyn declared that this was a mistake and gomez had offered his escort as a duty to which doña luisa returned a mocking smile her amusement annoyed evelyn on the whole she was glad that conversation was difficult the sour elderly duenna who rode behind them said nothing at all  after traveling all day they stopped at a lonely hacienda where evelyn soon retired to rest she slept well and wakening rather late the next morning found that doña luisa and her duenna had left an hour before this was embarrassing because evelyn knew something about spanish conventions but after all she was an american and they did not apply to her  gomez appeared annoyed and extremely apologetic  there has been a misunderstanding he explained i thought the señorita romanez would go with us to rio frio but she told me last night that she must return early this morning i expostulated and implored but the señorita was firm she declared she had not promised to come farther than the hacienda you see my unfortunate position one cannot compel a lady to do what she does not wish  when shall we reach rio frio evelyn asked  if all goes well late this afternoon  evelyn thought for a moment she was vexed and vaguely alarmed but her father was waiting for her at rio frio  then let us start as soon as possible she said  gomez bowed  when breakfast is over i go to give my men their orders  leaving the hacienda they rode by rough steep tracks that wound through belts of forest and crossed sunscorched slopes although it was hot the air was clear and evelyn was pleased to see that gomez kept the mules at a steady pace at noon they reached a cluster of povertystricken mud houses and gomez called one of the ragged halfbreed peons they talked for some time in a low voice and then gomez turned to evelyn  i am afraid we shall have to wait here for two or three hours he said it might be dangerous to go any farther now  but i must get on evelyn answered sharply  your wishes would be a command only that i must think of your safety first there is an inn in the village and while you rest i will explain why we cannot go forward  evelyn found the small fonda indescribably dirty but it offered shelter from the sun openings in its bare walls let in puffs of breeze and decaying lattices kept out the glare but the room was full of flies and rustling sounds showed that other insects lurked in the crevices the place reeked with the smell of caña and kerosene and evelyn had to force herself to eat a little of the greasy mess that was set before her in rude sunbaked crockery when the meal was over gomez began his explanation  you have heard that the country is disturbed there are turbulent people who want a revolution and i am not popular with them  evelyn smiled for she had learned something about the countrys politics and she thought he had expressed the feeling of its discontented citizens very mildly she distrusted him but so far his conduct had been irreproachable  i see you understand he resumed the worst is that you too are an object of suspicion it is known that your father is a friend of the president and has business with him well i have been warned that some of our enemies are in the neighborhood and they might rouse the peons to attack us they will know when we left the hacienda and watch for us but we can outwit them by waiting a while and then taking another road  this was plausible and evelyn agreed to the delay although she did not feel quite satisfied when gomez left her the dirty room was very hot and its atmosphere unspeakably foul but she could not sit outside in the sun and taking up a soiled newspaper she tried to read her knowledge of castilian did not carry her far but she made out that the government was being urged to deal severely with a man named sarmiento  evelyn put down the paper feeling that she ought to know the name sarmiento had some connection with grahame and his friends perhaps they had spoken of him this led her to think of them it looked as if grahame were interested in the countrys politics remembering the promise she had made she wondered whether the enchantress was then on the coast as he seemed to be opposing gomez he must be helping the revolutionaries while her father had business with the president this was puzzling and she sat thinking about it for some time and then looked up with a start as gomez came in  so you have been reading the diario he remarked  i dont understand very much but who is don martin sarmiento  a dangerous person who goes about making trouble  its curious but i think i have met him  gomez gave her a searching glance and then smiled  he is not worth remembering but you did meet him at havana  ah said evelyn sharply  gomez laughed  must i remind you señorita of a little affair at the hotel international  evelyn remembered it well and guessed that it was sarmiento whom gomez had been pursuing when she stopped him by dropping her ring she could now understand his look of baffled rage and she recalled her shrinking from the savagery it displayed  one imagines that you did not know don martin gomez said lightly although there was a keen look in his narrowed eyes  no evelyn answered i only saw him at dinner  then perhaps you have heard your father speak of him  i am not sure i have heard his name somewhere but i dont think my father ever met him  well i dont know that it is of much importance i came to tell you that i think we can start  they set off and reached rio frio without trouble some time after dark people in the streets turned and gazed at them and although some saluted gomez evelyn thought that for the most part they watched the party with unfriendly curiosity she was eager to meet her father but when they dismounted in the patio of a large white house she got a shock a darkskinned woman and several halfbreed servants came down from a gallery to welcome them but cliffe was not there     chapter xxii  held for ransom   gomez once more apologized the señor cliffe had not yet arrived from villa paz he explained but was expected in the morning in the meantime the good señora garcia would look after the señoritas comfort  evelyn had to be content with that indeed she was too tired to feel much disturbed on getting up the next morning however she was troubled by unpleasant suspicions it had been a shock to find cliffe absent and she began to review the misadventures which had marked her journey to begin with it now seemed curious that her father had not written instead of sending a message then the señora herrero had not kept her promise to overtake them and luisa romanez had unexpectedly gone back while she wondered whether all this had any sinister meaning evelyn felt for a packet of paper currency which she had at her fathers advice sewn into her dress she found that it was gone a hurried search showed that the stitches had been neatly cut  for a few moments she felt unnerved and then resolutely pulled herself together this was no time for hysteria it was obvious that she had been duped the lost sum was not large but with the exception of a few coins it was all she had and it had not been stolen by a common thief somebody had searched her clothes while she slept and taken the money with the object of embarrassing her  going to the window she looked out at the town it had a mean dilapidated air the few inhabitants she saw slowly moving about looked povertystricken and furtive their harsh voices jarred one could expect no sympathy or help from these foreigners hitherto she had been indulged and carefully protected but she was now alone and in danger and the novel experience was daunting still she saw that it was unwise to give her imagination rein she must keep her head and try to grapple with the situation  she finished dressing and without waiting for the morning chocolate found her way to the room in which she had been received on the previous evening it stretched across one end of the house on the second floor and was furnished in rather barbarous taste although there was a profusion of colored silk and a hint of sensual luxury it was obviously a mans room and evelyn studied the woman who joined her when the majordomo brought in breakfast  señora garcia was coarsely handsome but she had not the easy manners of a lady of rank and her dark color hinted at indian blood her expression was arrogant and evelyn felt that she was hostile besides she spoke an uncouth spanish that the girl could not understand at all breakfast was a trial of nerve but evelyn knew that she must eat and hide her fears when breakfast was over she would have a talk with gomez  he soon came in and dismissed the señora garcia with a commanding glance her servile obedience was significant  buenos días señorita he greeted evelyn smilingly  when do you expect my father she asked bluntly  i regret that i cannot answer positively it may be a week before he comesperhaps longer  but you brought me here to meet him  gomez smiled and spread out his hands in a way that always irritated evelyn  it now appears that the señor cliffes business with the president is not finished he said  it would not prevent his coming to meet me if he had promised  you should know best gomez answered with a shrug still it looks as if the señor cliffe put his business first and is not very anxious about you  that is not true evelyn said vehemently if he had any cause to be anxious he would let no business stand in the way  ah i admit i find this interesting  gomez looked so satisfied that evelyn feared she had blundered though she could not see how her heart beat fast and her nerves were tensely strung but she knew that she must be calm the man was her antagonist and she was fighting in the dark  well she said since my father has not arrived i will go to him  i am afraid that is impossible it is a long way to villa paz and the country is disturbed  do you mean to prevent my going  far from it señorita you are at liberty to do what you wish but unfortunately i cannot provide mules and an escort there are some dangerous revolutionaries among the hills then i must remind you that our people dislike foreigners and a lady cannot travel alone and without money  evelyn felt trapped  how do you know i havent money because it was stolen in this house you must lend me somemy father will repay it  your pardon señorita but you are mistaken i can answer for the honesty of my servants i would lend you money only that i cannot permit you to make a journey i know is dangerous  the girl sat still and there was silence for a few moments while she tried to brace herself she felt that she was at the mans mercy for there was something threatening behind his suave politeness and his smile indicated that he was amused by her futile struggles for all that she must keep up the fight  then what is to be done she asked  i suggest that you write to the señor cliffe and tell him where you are if you add that you do not feel safe he will no doubt join you as soon as possible although it may reflect upon our care of you we will see that he gets the letter  it seemed a simple course but evelyn was on her guard she must match her wits against the mans and he had shown a hint of eagerness that she thought suspicious having brought her to rio frio by trickery why did he wish her father to know that she felt alarmed  i should be glad to write to him but i do not see why i should make him uneasy on my account she said  there was something in gomezs expression which indicated that he felt baffled and she knew it might be dangerous to provoke him but he exercised selfcontrol  that is for you to judge but are you not inconsistent señorita you show some anger and alarm when you do not find your father here and now when i suggest an easy way of bringing him you will not take it  do you want him to come here evelyn asked bluntly  gomez gave her a steady thoughtful look  on the whole that would suit us he paused and added in a meaning tone it would facilitate your return to the coast  evelyn knew she had been given a hint that was half a threat and it cost her something to refuse it although she felt that to do what the man wished might not be the safest plan  after all it might interfere with his business if i made him leave villa paz before he is ready  watching gomez closely she thought his calm was forced but he bowed  as you wish señorita but you will think over it and now i must leave you  for some minutes after he had gone evelyn sat with relaxed muscles and vacant mind for the strain had told then by degrees her courage came back she was an american and must show no weakness to an antagonist of alien and she felt baser blood besides it looked as if she had won the first encounter and she had resources which should prove useful she had inherited her fathers intelligence and her social training had given her restraint and the power to conceal her thoughts while a womans quick instinctive perception was an advantage  all this however was not directly to the point she had been decoyed to rio frio for some purpose she shrank as she remembered luisa romanezs hints still she did not think gomez was in love with her the fellow was a sensualist but he had some advantage in view and she had already suspected what it was now she began to understand the matter more clearly gomez and the president meant to use her as a means of getting her father into their power she did not think his personal safety was threatened but they would insist on his agreeing to their terms as the price of restoring her to him and it was plain that she would play into their hands by writing a letter that would cause him anxiety evelyn determined that they should not have her help but although she sat for some time with brows knitted and hands clenched she could make no better plan than to remain quietly obstinate  it was impossible to reach villa paz without money and although she shrank from being left in the power of a man like gomez she thought his selfinterest would secure her safety she might perhaps get some one to carry a message to grahame if he were on the coast but she was reluctant to do so unless the need were urgent  after a while she got up and went out into the plaza people gazed at her curiously some smiled at one another as she passed and a number of the women looked suspicious and hostile for all that she was neither molested nor followed and when the sun got hot she returned to the house where she spent the day drearily improving her knowledge of castilian it promised to become useful but the fine language jarred her long afterward  the week that followed tried her courage she was in reality a prisoner though subject to no open restraint and treated well except that the señora garcia regarded her with badly disguised hatred now and then she saw gomez but he was suavely courteous and said nothing of importance she got nervous and lost her color and her appetite but there was nothing to do but wait until gomez who apparently meant to wear her out made some fresh demand  one evening he came into the room where she sat and after a ceremonious greeting stood with his head slightly bent in an attitude of respect he was dressed in a white uniform which emphasized his stoutness and the dark color of his greasy skin  you look tired señorita he remarked  i am very tired of rio frio have you come to tell me that i can go away  that you should be eager to do so grieves me but i can perhaps make it possible there is a proposal i wish to make  yes evelyn answered as carelessly as she could  you may find what i propose surprising but i must beg you to think over it and you will see that it is not so strange as it seems i have the honor to ask you to be my wife  evelyn shrank back in horror as if he had struck her and then with an effort recovered her selfcontrol  this is impossible señor indeed it is absurd  your pardon he said with ominous grimness i cannot agree it is i think the best way out of an embarrassing situation but this is an argument i do not wish to use i would rather speak of the charm you exercise and my respectful admiration  we can leave that out i do not value nor desire it  the mans dark eyes flashed and evelyn knew the danger of rousing him his spanish polish was only skindeep and the savage lurked beneath for all that she was desperate and meant to force the conflict  very well he said i must take another course to begin with it looks as if your father did not care what became of you it is now some time since he left you at valverde and he has not troubled to inquire if you are safe  i do not believe that  well we will let it go the rest is more important it is known in valverde that you did me the honor to run away with me  evelyn jumped up with the color rushing to her face and her hands clenched the prudence she tried to exercise had given place to imperious anger  you scoundrel she cried do you think it matters to me what your blackblooded countrymen and women think your moorish customs may be necessary for them but i am an american  gomez chuckled  there were two american comisionistas at valverde and they must have heard the story in the cafés it is you understand a romantic episode the daughter of a wellknown financier elopes with a foreign soldier the comisionistas talk about it when they return and your newspapers make the most of the tale some of them are not reserved or fastidious it is possible they print your portrait one can imagine the astonishment of your friends but the story would be incomplete if it did not end with a romantic wedding  the girl drew back in horror if the tale reached home the shock would break her mother down but it was possible that gomez was lying she had heard of no american drummers in the town  he gave her no time to recover  then i must show you how what followed our flight from valverde fits in we arrive together at rio frio after dark you find shelter in my house  evelyn started for this was worse  your house she exclaimed then who is señora garcia  gomez smirked in an ugly manner  a woman of the town who comes at my bidding  the jealous hatred of the coarse but handsome woman was now explained and evelyn grew hot with humiliation as she saw that the señora garcia regarded her as a favored rival it was unendurable but in spite of her anger she was getting calm besides there was some hope in the thought that gomez could not be moved by passion he was a sensual brute and her beauty had perhaps caught his roving eye but it was some material advantage he sought  it was a clever plot one that only a mind like yours could conceive she said with quiet scorn  the important thing is that it succeeded but may i ask why you object to me i am a man of influencein reality the second in power the country is disturbed and discontented before long i may be first  your hopes would probably come to a sudden end if your master guessed them evelyn answered with a mocking smile  she saw that she had touched him for he cast a quick glance at the door as if to make sure that nobody had heard his boast as he did so evelyn thought she heard a faint movement outside but she knew she might be mistaken and gomez did not seem to notice anything to distract his attention she flung another jibe at him  señor she said though you think i am in your power i will never marry you it is an insult to suggest it even if you were not repulsive in person and character you are not a white man  the blood rushed to his face and his eyes flashed  you are rash señorita in trying to provoke me but you may take a wiser course before i have finished with you it pains me deeply to be compelled to remind you that you are in my house in my power i repeat to you my offer señorita i give you one more chance to marry me of your own free will and now i leave you to think it over  before evelyn could more than gasp he was gone she fell limply into a chair and dropped her head into her hands she must think think but the strain had been unbearable and the reaction threatened to overwhelm her     chapter xxiii  the intercepted note   when she was able to think calmly evelyn found herself confronted by familiar troubles she was not a prisoner and yet she could not run away because she had no money and could not understand the barbarous castilian spoken among the hills moreover she could not appeal even by signs for help for it was generally believed that she had eloped with gomez his friends would no doubt send her back to him his enemies would treat her with rude contempt sooner than be forced to marry him she would steal away and starve but she had a conviction that things would not come to the worst it would suit gomez best to break down her resistance by moral pressure  she was young but not altogether inexperienced and during the past week her mental powers had suddenly developed besides she was supported by a deeprooted national pride it was a privilege to be an american or as her countrymen sometimes expressed it to be white the sentiment might not be quite free from prejudice but it was founded on truth and carried an obligation one must respect ones birthright and never submit to be trampled on by a foreigner  it was however obvious that she must seek outside help and in her need she thought of grahame he would come if she sent for him and she knew now that he would be welcome if he came as her lover he was a white man it was an unspeakable relief to dwell upon his fine athletic symmetry and his strong brown face with its stamp of semiascetic restraint after the tainted grossness of her persecutor she had thought of him often and had indeed found it hard not to do so oftener but the turningpoint had come and flinging aside ambition she opened her heart to the love that had been waiting this was not because she was in danger although danger had hastened the crisis  for a time she forgot gomez and listened vacantly to the patter of feet in the hot streets while she sat quietly in a corner of the shaded room lost in alluring dreams then she roused herself and going to her apartment wrote a short message stating that she needed help she could not find an envelope and dare not ask for one so she folded the note and wrote across it the address grahame had given her then she stole from the house  no one interfered with her as she went up a street that led to the outskirts of the town where she was less likely to be watched the unsealed note could not be posted because it would no doubt be given to gomez but she might find somebody who would arrange for its conveyance by hand it would be better if the person were a revolutionary but she imagined that the presidents enemies would not make themselves conspicuous some risk must be taken but after all very few people could read english  after a time she met a peon and showed him the note he seemed surprised to see the spanish name on the back and at first vigorously shook his head but when evelyn held out two or three coins he began to ponder and presently made a sign of understanding and took the note evelyn felt reckless as he moved away for she had given him all her money and had no resource left  returning by a different way she entered the house gomez did not seem to be about but the building was large and she seldom saw him except when he paid her a formal visit the man was a ruffian but it was her money he wanted and he would act discreetly his boast had thrown some light upon his treacherous schemes he meant to make himself president if he could compel her father to provide the necessary funds  the peon carrying the note set out on foot for the next village where he had a friend who sometimes went to the coast the friend however was not at home and evelyns messenger being tired and in possession of more money than usual entered a little wineshop and ordered refreshment the caña was strong and after drinking more than was good for him he forgot his caution when one of the villagers asked what had brought him there to satisfy the fellows curiosity he produced the note and the loungers in the wineshop grew interested for the man to whom it was addressed was known as an enemy of the government  one tried to take it from the peon another interfered and as both political parties were represented a tumult broke out it was stopped by the arrival of two rural guards the note was seized and one of the guards set off for rio frio at dawn the next morning  gomez started when he was given the note for evelyn had made an unexpected move but he saw the importance of what it implied and lighted a cigarette while he thought the matter out he had suspected the enchantress for some time and knew that grahame was her owner since the yanqui was in communication with a dangerous revolutionist he must be engaged in smuggling arms and if he had landed many the rebels would be ready to fight for all that gomez was puzzled grahame was a friend of the señorita cliffesperhaps even her loverand he was helping the rebels while her father had spent a good deal of money to support the president this suggested that cliffe might be playing a crooked game and bore out some suspicions gomez had entertained the president must be informed at once but in the meantime gomez saw how the note could be made use of  after some thought he summoned a confidential clerk who had learned english in the united states and gave him the note  it seems that the señorita does not like rio frio and means to leave us he remarked  the clerk discreetly contented himself with a sign of agreement  well gomez resumed i think we will let her message go  would that be wise the other ventured we do not know when and which way the englishman will come and he may be joined by some of sarmientos followers  gomez smiled  the señorita cliffe is artless and has made a mistake her note covers only half the paper and leaves room for something to be added underneath  ah the clerk was a skillful penman and had once or twice successfully imitated the signatures of hostile politicians  you understand said gomez the writing must not look different and you must use the same kind of pencil now give me some paper  he smoked a cigarette before he began to write for the space at the foot of evelyns note was limited grahame probably knew the girls hand but would be deceived by a clever imitation of it in the form of a postscript under her signature the note was dated at rio frio and left it to be understood that evelyn expected him there but the postscript directed him to land on the beach near valverde where a guide would look out for him for several nights  there are two words we had better alter the americans do not often use them said the clerk cautiously and gomez agreed to the change  you will have it sent off and make arrangements for the englishman to be met he added with a smile and now i must start for villa paz to tell the president  half an hour later he mounted in the patio and evelyn hearing the clatter of hoofs looked out through the halfopened lattice and watched him ride away as he had an armed escort and a spare mule she imagined he meant to make a long journey and grahame might arrive before he returned  soon after the party had gone the señora garcia came in and stood looking at the girl as if she had something to say her air of sullen dislike was less marked than usual and evelyn remembering the sound she had heard during her interview with gomez suspected that she had listened at the door now the woman looked anxious and embarrassed and while she hesitated evelyn studied her the señora must have possessed unusual beauty and was handsome yet although she was getting stout and losing her freshness as women of spanish blood do at an early age in hot climates her skin had been spoiled by cosmetics and her face was clumsily touched with paint and powder evelyn felt a half contemptuous pity there was something pathetic in her crude attempts to preserve her vanishing charm  the señora made signs which evelyn supposed to mean that gomez had gone away and then she took out some silver and paper currency putting it into the girls hand she pointed to the door  evelyn started for the hint was plain the señora was anxious to get rid of her rival evelyn grasped at the chance to go the money could be repaid it might be some time before grahame arrived and the woman could be trusted to convey a note to him because she could not give it to gomez without betraying her complicity in the girls escape  for a time they struggled to grasp each others meaning but at last the señora garcia showed she understood that she was to deliver a note to an englishman who would come in search of the girl evelyn was to find a peon who lived outside the town and would put her on the way to villa paz it would no doubt prove a difficult journey but she was determined to make it  she was soon ready and walked carelessly across the plaza as if she had no object the townspeople knew her and she met with no troublesome curiosity after a time she entered a shady street where she stopped once or twice to look into a shop leaving it at the other end she came out into a hot stony waste dotted with tall aloes and clumps of cactus and presently reached a dilapidated adobe hut  as she stood hesitating before it a man came out to meet her and she felt her heart beat fast for she was now confronted by her first danger the fellow might rob her or perhaps take her back his white clothes were threadbare but they were clean and on the whole she liked his look and the sight of a woman peeping through the door was somehow reassuring  it was not easy to make him understand what she wanted but he looked thoughtful when she repeated a word the señora garcia had taught her then he went in apparently to consult the woman and returning signified that he would do what she wished she must however go on alone to a village some distance off on the way he would overtake her with a mule evelyn thought it curious that he had not asked for money but as he seemed anxious that she should not delay she set off so far her escape had proved easier than she had imagined  the sun was at its highest and it was very hot the road was a rough track where loose stones lay among the heavy dust where water ran down the hillside in artificial channels there were palms and belts of foliage elsewhere outcropping rock and stones flung up a dazzling brightness in the background rugged peaks rose against a sky of intense blue and far off on the opposite hand a misty gleam indicated the sea  evelyn soon began to get tired and she found her thin shoes badly suited to the roughness of the ground the dust that rose about her gathered on her skin she got hot and thirsty but the water she tried to drink was slimy and she toiled on it seemed wiser to press forward while she could for there was nobody at work in the scattered fields her eyes ached with the glare and her feet were sore but the peon did not come and when she looked back the road wound along the hillside white and empty here and there tall trees filled the hollows among the rocks but the country seemed deserted and she could not see a house anywhere  at last when the sun was low and the shadows were long and cool she saw a cluster of small white patches shining amid a belt of green ahead and supposed this was the aldea the peon had meant limping on wearily she came within half a mile of it and then finding a place where she was hidden by a clump of cactus she sat down to watch the road she might run some risk of being robbed or stopped if she entered the village alone for it was obvious that a welldressed foreigner traveling on foot could not hope to escape notice and the hill peasants would probably not understand her few words of castilian  the shadows lengthened until they covered the hillside and the air got cool but her guide did not come and evelyn began to wonder what had delayed him he had seemed willing to assist in her escape and she suspected that he must sympathize with the revolutionaries but if so it was strange that the señora garcia should have known the password which had apparently decided him she had however been told that these people were fond of intrigue and that a general plot was often accompanied by minor conspiracies so to speak one inside the other the señora garcia had perhaps some object of her own to serve but this did not matterit was more important that the peon did not arrive  it began to get dark the dew soaked evelyns thin dress and she felt hungry and achingly tired then a light or two twinkled among the trees and some one began to sing to a guitar the lights and the music with their suggestions of home and rest after the days toil troubled the girl she was alone and apparently deserted with enemies behind her and the way ahead unknown for a few minutes her courage failed and she was in danger of breaking down then with a determined effort she recovered her calm and roused herself to listen  the music had grown plainer and she recognized an air she had heard when she sat with grahame in the patio of the international the contrast was too great and brought her poignant memories she was no longer a person of consequence indulged in every wish but a homeless fugitive then she thought of grahame who had translated the song they were singing for the plaintive refrain of las aves marinas carried clearly through the cooling air had the wild seahawk got her message and was he already coming to her rescue but even this was not of first consequence what about the peon had he betrayed her  everything was silent upon the hillside but a faint breeze was getting up and sighed among the stones there was a splash of water in the distance but no sound came from the road it ran back a dim white streak into the deepening gloom and then faded out of sight upon the shoulder of a hill there was no movement on it as far as the girl could see  she waited what seemed an interminable time and then a faint drumming caught her attention and grew into a welcome beat of hoofs some one was coming along the road she watched eagerly straining her eyes to catch a glimpse of the rider at last an object emerged from the shadow and as it drew nearer she could see that it was a man riding a mule  with her nerves at high tension and her heart beating fast evelyn left her hiding place in the cacti and stepped out into the middle of the road the man must see her now and she had involved herself in fresh difficulties if he were not the peon she expected  he came on fast he had caught sight of her and was urging his mule when he pulled up beside her and dropped from the animal muttering exclamations in an unknown tongue evelyn staggered it was an indian from the hills     chapter xxiv  in the camp of the hillsmen   evelyn instinctively drew back a few paces through her brain was beating insistently the admonition that had helped her much in the past few days  keep calm dont let him think you are afraid  her first thought had been flight to the village but reason told her that was impossible here alone on the silent hillside in the early night a white woman with this strange indian there came over her again a pride in her american blood she felt that she was a match for him in wits if not in strength and with the thought came courage  she pointed to the mule then to herself then to the village and explained in spanish  the indian shook his head and stood stolidly beside his mount after his first exclamations he had remained silent watching evelyn intently but she felt reassured when he made no move to approach her as a matter of fact his mind at that moment was a chaos of conjectures and possibilities and while he hesitated evelyn gasped with relief down the road carrying distinctly over the night air came the sound of furious ridingfaint at first and then growing nearer quickly nearer even if it were not the peon at least two strangers would be safer than one  with a guttural grunt that might have meant anything the indian jumped upon his mule and started off toward the village urging the animal along and evelyn stepped farther back into the shadow of the cacti she felt that she had reached the breakingpoint yet she must nerve herself this once more for without her guide she could not go on  the hoofbeats drew near in a minute they would pass and the rider be swallowed up in the gloom beyond evelyn opened her mouth and tried to call to him but her voice failed her her wornout body and her overtaxed nerves were holding her powerless to move or cry she could only stand helpless and watch him sweep past  but the peons keen eyes had caught sight of the white dress fluttering against the dark outline of the cacti and even as he passed he reined in his mule a few moments later he was beside her holding his battered hat in his hand  your servant señorita he said courteously  evelyn never could remember distinctly what happened after that she had only a hazy recollection of climbing upon the mule and trying to cling there while the man trotted beside her carrying a long ironpointed staff somewhere near the village they had turned off the main road and followed a rough path that led up into the hills and there they had stopped at a small hacienda where evelyn was hospitably received  when she woke the next morning in a clean little adobe room and found a neatlooking spanish woman smiling upon her evelyn smiled in return every muscle in her body ached and the soles of her feet were blistered but for the first time in many days she felt a sense of perfect security still smiling she murmured the password of the revolutionaries it meant much to her now  confianza                                       they had a hasty breakfast and started again but rested for some time in a belt of forest during the heat of the day in the early evening they approached a white aldea perched high upon the edge of a ravine evelyns guide made her understand that they might not be allowed to pass he implied that she was in no danger but it was with some anxiety that she rode toward the village  they skirted the side of the ravine which was fretted with tumbling cataracts steep rocks ran up from the edge of the trail and were lost in climbing forest a hundred feet above but after a time the chasm began to widen and small square houses straggled about its slopes a barricade of logs however closed the road and as evelyn approached two men stepped out from behind it they were ragged and unkempt but they carried good modern rifles  halt ordered one of them  confianza the guide answered smiling and they let him pass  beyond the barricade the guide stopped in front of an adobe building that seemed to be an inn for a number of saddled mules were tied around it men were entering and leaving and a hum of voices came from the shadowy interior but the peon motioned to evelyn that she must get down and wait finding a stone bench where she was left undisturbed she sat there for half an hour while it grew dark and then a man came up and beckoned her to enter she went with some misgivings and was shown into a room with rough mud walls where a man sat under a smoky lamp at a table upon which a map and a number of papers were spread he wore plain white clothes with a wide red sash and two others dressed in the same way stood near as if awaiting his orders evelyn knew the man for she had seen him at the international  confianza she said i believe you are don martin sarmiento  he gave her a quick glance and answered in good english  it is a surprise to receive a visit from miss cliffe but i must ask who gave you the password  señora garcia at rio frio  that sounds strange but sit down there is something we must talk about  he waited until one of the men brought her a chair  i understand you were going to villa paz he then said  yes i am anxious to join my father  i am not sure that will be possible but we will speak of it again first of all i must know why you left valverde sarmiento indicated the others these are officers of mine but they do not speak english and it is not necessary that you should know their names you have nothing to fear from us but i must urge you to be frank  evelyn tried to think calmly she was in the mans power and he wore the stamp of command but she liked his look and did not feel afraid of him it might be wiser to be candid but she had an embarrassing story to tell and she began with some hesitation sarmiento helped her now with a nod of comprehension as she slurred over an awkward passage and now with a look of sympathy while the others stood silent with expressionless faces  gomez is of course a scoundrel and you were wise to run away he commented when she stopped there are however matters i do not quite understand for example it would not be to the presidents interest that he should quarrel with your father nor do i think altiera would approve of an alliance between his secretary and you  evelyn blushed and tried to meet the mans searching look  i cannot explain these things i have told you what happened and i came to you withconfidence  sarmiento bowed  we respect our password you are safe with us but you cannot continue your journey the roads will be closed before you get through and there will be fighting in the next few days when it seems less dangerous we must try to send you on but in the meantime i must put you into my daughters hands  he gave one of the officers some instructions and the man beckoned evelyn but she hesitated  i must pay my guide and send him back  we will give him the money but he will not go back we shall no doubt find a use for him sarmiento smiled meaningly as he added it looks as if he could be trusted  evelyn followed the officer to the back of the house where creepers trailed about a rude pergola a sheet of cotton had been stretched among the poles making a tent in which a light burned her companion saying a few words in castilian motioned to evelyn to go in she did so and then stopped abruptly  the lamp was small and the light was dim loops of vines falling about it cast puzzling shadows but evelyn knew the girl who rose to meet her she had seen her talking confidentially to grahame at the international and was seized by jealous suspicion a stout elderly lady in a black dress who was apparently the girls duenna sat farther back in the shadow blanca gave evelyn a friendly smile of recognition but it cost her an effort to respond the spanish girl seemed to understand that something was wrong and there was an awkward silence while they stood with their eyes fixed on each other then blanca said with a touch of haughtiness  i have been told to make you as comfortable as possible but i am sorry there is not much comfort here one cannot expect it in a camp  she presented evelyn to her duenna and the señora morales indicated a folding chair  you come at a bad time she remarked in awkward french languidly opening a fan it seems we are to have more fighting it is the way of men  they must fight said blanca the cause is good  the señora morales waved her fan she wore a black silk mantilla fastened tightly round her head like a cowl and her dark fleshy face was thickly smeared with powder her eyes were lazily contemptuous  there are two causes niña and it is hard to see how both can be right but since men quarrel about them it is not impossible that both may be wrong  evelyn smiled the duennas remarks saved the situation from becoming strained the woman was obviously shrewd in spite of her heavy face  they are always quarreling in this country the señora continued those who will not pay their taxes call themselves liberators those who expect favors from the president are patriots if he does not give them enough they conspire with the others to turn him out since everybody cannot be satisfied there is always trouble  but our friends are not fighting for rewards blanca objected indignantly  a few are disinterested the señora conceded she paused and turned to evelyn with an authoritative air you must tell me why you ran away from rio frio i can guess something but want to know the rest  after a moments hesitation evelyn thought it prudent to comply and the señora seemed to listen with sympathy  to run away was the simplest plan but sometimes the simplest plan is not the best she said did you think of nothing else  i sent a message to mr grahame of the enchantress telling him i was in difficulties evelyn replied watching blanca  the girl looked up with quick interest but there was no hint of jealousy in her expression  you thought he would come to help you  i knew he would come if it was possible evelyn answered  blanca looked her in the face with a smile of understanding and evelyn saw that her suspicions had been unfounded grahame was nothing to the girl  my father must know this at once she said and hurried away  don martin came back with her and questioned evelyn and then he stood thoughtfully silent for some moments  it is fortunate i heard this news he said your message may be intercepted and we must try to warn grahame that you are in our hands he gave evelyn a steady look i believe he will be satisfied with that  you can tell him that i feel safe evelyn answered  don martin left her with a bow and shortly afterward they heard somebody riding hard along the edge of the ravine when the beat of hoofs died away blanca touched evelyns arm  there will be some supper after a while but let us walk a little way up the path  they went out into the dark passing slowly between shadowy rows of bushes which evelyn thought were young coffee plants she waited believing that her companion meant to take her into her confidence  you were rash in sending for mr grahame blanca began we must hope our messenger arrives in time to stop him but for all that  do you wish him to come evelyn asked  blanca smiled  in a sense it does not matter to me whether he comes or not though i would not wish him to run into danger but he would not come alone  evelyn started it was not grahame but walthew in whom blanca was interested somehow she had not thought of that  of course you met mr walthew in havana she said  and at rio frio there was a hint of triumphant coquetry and something deeper in blancas voice indeed mr grahame should be grateful to me because it was i who kept him his companion mr walthew had been dangerously ill and was thinking of going homethough of course he did not tell me this  but if he did not tell you  how did i know blanca laughed cariña mia how do we know such things is a mans face a mask have we no guide except what he says  evelyn thought of carmen for blanca had something of the great coquettes allurement and power it was not an unconscious attraction she exercised but the skill with which it was directed was primitive and instinctive rather than intelligent  and you persuaded mr walthew to stay she said did you find it hard  hard oh no it is not hard to persuade a young man unless one is a fool a word or two is enough and i told him he might become a great libertador like bolívar and garibaldi  evelyn laughed she liked walthew but he was a very modern american and the thought of his emulating garibaldi tickled her then although it was dark she was aware of a change in her companions mood blancas pose was different it had somehow hardened and her head was lifted high  you find this amusing she asked in a haughty tone  i suppose i do in a way evelyn admitted deprecatingly you see i know my countrymen and were not romantic as a rule  then it is clear you do not know mr walthew he is young but he has the spirit of these others the great libertadores  ive no doubt thats true evelyn agreed putting her hand on blancas arm indeed i like and admire him very much  they turned back to the house presently on friendly terms for the spaniards anger flares up quickly but soon burns down evelyn however saw that matters had gone farther than she thought and she imagined that walthew would have some trouble with his relatives when he went home  but how did you and your father come to meet mr walthew and what is the enchantress doing on the coast she asked  you do not know there was a hint of gratified superiority in the girls tone she is bringing us the rifles that we need  evelyn asked no more questions because her talk with blanca had given her much to think about and when supper was over she sat outside the tent alone the moon was rising above the tall sierra that ran in a rugged line across the sky the air was warm and still and she could hear water splashing down in the bottom of the ravine now and then there was a clatter of hoofs as a messenger rode up and sometimes an order was followed by a patter of feet then for a time everything was silent except for a murmur of voices in the inn  the girl noticed this vacantly for her mind was busy and she was filled with a strange excitement for the last week or two she had borne a heavy strain and her thoughts had been concentrated on finding a means of escape now they were free to dwell upon a greater matter the struggle that began when she boarded the enchantress was ended and she could rejoice in her own defeat as she had not been quite able to do when on first surrendering she had written her note at rio frio prudence ambition and selfinterest were driven from the field love had utterly routed them she loved grahame and she knew that he loved her though he had not avowed it yet blanca had spoken truly words were not needed it was easy to read a mans heart  evelyn knew what he thought he was a poor adventurer and she was rich she blushed with shame remembering how this had once weighed with her now it did not matter at all nothing mattered except that he belonged to her but while this had never been so plain it had not dawned on her with a sudden flash the light had been steadily creeping in for a long time while she stubbornly tried to shut it out until she abandoned her futile efforts and let the warming brightness flood her  then she thought of grahames danger don martin had not received the note suppose it had fallen into gomezs hands what use might not that halfbreed make of it  evelyn shuddered and breathed a halfconscious prayer that don martins messenger might reach her lover in time     chapter xxv  a trial of speed   night was falling over the troubled water and there were threats of a tropical storm the enchantress with her anchor down rolled uneasily on the broken swell a sandy point ran out to windward but the combers that beat upon its seaward side with a thunderous roar swirled in a white turmoil round its end and filled the lagoon with an angry heave the palms on the landward shore bent in the wind and the dense green jungle behind them rolled in tossing waves of green to the north the sky was barred by leaden clouds and the seatops cut against it lividly white  a trail of smoke whirled about the funnel now streaming out to lee now eddying down for a quantity of ammunition and contraband material had just been landed and grahame was ready to go to sea again there was some danger in remaining but the weather was bad and he half expected fresh instructions from don martin  while he sat smoking in the lee of the deckhouse and walthew leaned against the rail macallister looked out of the engineroom door  i can give ye steam enough to take her out at half an hours notice but if yere no likely to need it ill bank my fires he said  we wont heave anchor unless were forced to its not an enticing night grahame replied and walthew nodded as in the pause that followed he heard the rumble of the surf upon the shoals  what do you reckon has been going on inland he asked the fellows who took the guns ashore didnt seem to have much news but they believed you were right in thinking this might be the last important cargo wed have to run  the government has arrested castillo and no doubt brought pretty strong pressure to bear on him im afraid he couldnt stand up against it and has given his fellow conspirators away the president seems no fool and gomez is a cunning rascal but im not sure they could keep their plans dark because the opposition have their spies and sympathizers everywhere the consequence is that both parties may be driven into prompt action instead of quietly finishing their preparations  i expect thats so said walthew thoughtfully i wish i knew because i must see don martin and make a trip to rio frio before we leave the coast for good  you know best but i imagine it means trouble with your people when you go home  it may for a time walthew answered with a dogged look still theyll come round and im glad to think that considering this job as a business proposition we have done pretty well that will appeal to the old man gunrunnings not the line he wanted me to take but hell be tickled when he sees that ive made good at it  i wouldna say but he might like miss sarmiento as weel as yin o they hussies at the florida hotel macallister remarked encouragingly there was yin in blue but no much o it with a flagpole in her hat that gave me what ive heard ye call the googly eye  walthew chuckled  that girl has roomsful of money  then she might hae bought some clothes the scotsman retorted  they were silent for a few minutes and through the quietness they heard the splash of canoe paddles  we may get some news walthew said  the canoe ran alongside and a halfbreed handed up a dirty note grahame opened it and his jaws set and a curious glint came into his eyes when he read evelyns message  where did this come from he called sharply to the waiting halfbreed in his anxiety he had spoken in english  the messenger shook his head  no entiendo  grahame repeated the question in spanish and added tell me quickly  a man brought it down from the hills a halfhour ago thats all i know the halfbreed explained  all right you may go  grahame turned to walthew and macallister and showed them the crumpled note  i dont think our partnership agreement covers a risky private undertaking of this kind and you can turn me out if you like but im going he said  and im coming with you walthew replied cheerfully ive some business of my own at rio frio  you cant come how is mack to run the boat alone  weel said macallister im thinking thats no impossible onyway yell take him well quarrel about whos to command her if ye leave him on board  grahame saw they were both determined his comrades meant to stand by him if it cost them the vessel he was touched but there was no time to indulge in sentiment  well talk of it later start the windlass and stir the fires ill want all the steam you can give me  yell get it macallister replied and vanished below while grahame went forward when the windlass began to clank and the cable tightened  speed was urgently needed it was several days since the note had been written and he dared not speculate about what might have happened in the meanwhile evelyn was not easily frightened she would not have sent for him unless the danger was imminent then the postscript stated that a guide would look out for him between midnight and three oclock in the morning at a place mentioned and the enchantress must be driven hard to get there in time if she arrived too late he must steam out to sea before dawn broke and wait for another night  the windlass rattled faster the chain ran in as the anchor left the ground and seeing miguel ready with the tackle at the cathead grahame went aft to the wheel the gong clanged the signal full ahead and the screw began to throb there was a crash forward as the swinging anchor struck the bow but miguel had men enough to stow it and grahame fixed his eyes ahead as he turned his wheel rolling across the broken swell the enchantress stemmed the strong floodtide bending palms and shadowy beach were sliding past and the turmoil on the shoals drew nearer ahead was a narrow channel with about a fathom of water to the good but the leading marks were obscured and grahame doubted if he could find it if the boat struck she would be washed up badly damaged among the sands but the tide was rising and before long macallister would have raised full steam it was unthinkable that they should lose time and grahame meant to take his chance  spray flew about her forward as the swell got steeper she dipped to the knightheads and miguel running aft began to use the lead grahame did not stop him although sounding was a matter of form because she would drive aground before he could bring her head round if he missed the narrow deep  she crept past the point rolling wildly and lifting out her screw while the air got thick with spray and the thud of engines was drowned by the turmoil of the sea some distance off white ridges leaped out of the gathering dark but nearer at hand they were broken by the shoals and raged in foaming confusion the enchantress must cross this belt without much steam to help her but it was obvious that macallister was hard at work below for thick smoke with fiery sparks in it poured from the funnel  miguels whiteclad figure swaying in the channels cut against the gloom but grahame could not hear his hail though he glanced at the compass now and then he was feeling his way rather by instinct than definite guidance and so far the upward sweep of the bows showed there was sufficient water under the vessel sometimes a sea came on board and poured aft in a frothing flood but she was steadily forging ahead and a few minutes would take her across the worst of the shoals  suddenly she stopped with a crash lurched sideways and lay still while a foamtipped mass of water rolled up ahead it broke on board burying her forward half and the next moment grahame was wet to the waist but she lifted as the roller surged by and then struck the shoal again a few more blows of that kind would crush in her bilge but grahame set his teeth and clung grimly to his wheel there was nothing to be done but wait the crash would warn macallister what was required of him and if he could not drive her off they must cut the boats adrift and leave her to her fate  another sea came tumbling in but while its crest broke across the rail it picked her up and she moved on slowly with the water sluicing aft down her inclined deck for a few seconds grahame held his breath waiting for the shock but she went on and lifted her head buoyantly as the next comber rolled up when she had lurched over it and the spray had blown away he saw that the sea was more regular and the worst of the turmoil lay astern five minutes afterward she reeled out into open water and macallister came on deck  weve started the bilgepump but its no drawing much he said i dinna think shes the waur for the knocks she got  thats satisfactory you know what you have to do  macallister smiled with quiet enjoyment  weve no had the need to drive her yet but noo ill let ye see  he went below and grahame gave miguel an order for in swinging round after leaving the lagoon the enchantress had brought the wind on her quarter and she carried a good spread of sail he would not however luff her off her course to make the work easier the crew must hoist the canvas as best they could and there was a furious banging and clatter of flying blocks as forestaysail foresail and mainsail went up then she listed down with her rail in the white surges that boiled up to lee while tall hollowfronted combers ranged up astern and sped after her  wire shrouds strung to the breakingpoint shrieked in wild harmonies as the blasts struck them chain funnelguys roared in deeper tones and there was a confused groaning of masts and booms spray swept her lashing grahames back and blowing past his head in clouds and now and then a seatop broke on board but she drove on furiously before the wind  after a while grahame called miguel to the helm and stood in the lee of the deckhouse pipe in mouth for he had now time to think he could make no plans until he landed but it was plain that he must go to rio frio and if possible he must leave walthew behind he could not allow the lad to run the risk and macallister would need him some help might be had from the revolutionaries and he must try to find don martin if he failed to do so much would have to be left to chance  grahame looked at another side of the matter suppose he rescued miss cliffe what then though the gunrunning had been profitable he was an adventurer with very limited means he could not trade upon cliffes gratitude though he loved the girl he did not know when he began to love her but he had for some time made stern efforts to drive the thought of her out of his mind perhaps he might have succeeded had nothing unusual happened for he knew his disadvantages but now his determination suddenly had been swept away evelyn was in danger somehow this made clear the strength of the feelings with which he had grappled the future was clouded there were difficulties to be faced but he felt that if she had any love for him he could not give her up  the gale freshened but grahame would not shorten sail there was not much time to spare and the gear was standing well he could trust the helm to miguel and might have slept but although he imagined his strength might be severely taxed during the next few days it was impossible for him to rest in spite of his anxiety he was sensible of an exultant excitement the girl he loved was in danger but she had sent for him then the adventure he was embarking on had a fascination of its own and he smiled as he remembered that his ancestors had often in past days ridden across the dark marches leading the border spears it was not for nothing the hot blood of the old mosstroopers ran in his veins  swept by the seas on her quarter the enchantress drove on and grahame lurched about the slanted deck and stood amidst the spray that whirled across her stern she was going fast his glances at the recording log astonished him for he had not believed her capable of the speed it showed his fierce impatience seemed to have inspired thudding engines and quivering hull and he thrilled when a great whitetopped comber rolled up and swept her on flame blew from the funnel wet canvas straining in black curves reeled through the dark and the sea sped back snowy white toward the plunging bows  at last however lights shone in the gloom and grahame ordered the canvas to be lowered it cost the crew an arduous struggle but they made all fast and grahame ringing for halfspeed took the wheel there was a point a short distance from the town that would break the sea and by steaming in behind it he might get a boat away landing would be difficult and it was important that he should find the right spot  he watched the beach with his glasses as the enchantress swung inshore and when presently the combers changed to a steep troubled swell that ended in a white band of surf he stopped the engines and told miguel to hoist out the gig the navigation lights had been extinguished but he thought that anybody carefully watching for the steamer could see her the men had some trouble in lowering the boat but as soon as she was in the water grahame jumped on board and told the men to push off then as they got out their oars a dark figure leaped from the steamers rail and walthew alighting in the sternsheets turned to his comrade with a grin  im here and youll smash the boat if you try to send me back he said you see i suspected what you were getting after when you put me at a job it was awkward to leave  well i did my best anyway grahame laughed  walthew took an oar for the swell was high enough to make progress difficult but they found smoother water near the land and stopped pulling just outside the fringe of surf waiting for a slacker interval in the shoreward rush of hissing rollers they drove her in as fast as she could go and jumped overboard when she touched the sand a wave broke into her but they ran her up safely and grahame turned to walthew after they had emptied the water out  i dont think im straining my authority by telling you to go off with miguel he said  anyhow im not going walthew replied doggedly our association is a partnership and i mean to come along i dont know that ill be of much help to you but the job youve undertaken is too big for one  grahame saw that objections would be useless and feeling that his pistol was loose he walked up the beach with walthew following a few yards behind     chapter xxvi  trapped   for a few minutes the men toiled silently across loose wet sand and then on reaching a belt of shingle near highwater mark stopped to look about lights gleamed in the town across the bay but except for that it was very dark a clump of trees that fringed the end of a ridge of higher ground could barely be distinguished but grahame decided that this must be the spot evelyn had mentioned in her note though the shingle rolled beneath his feet the sound it made was lost in the roar of the surf upon the point dry sand blew past pricking his face and when he turned toward the sea he saw a group of indistinct objects still standing about the boat  what are they waiting for he asked i told them to push off  i guess old miguel takes an interest in us and wants to see were all right he knows something about these fellows tricks and may not share our confidence  well i guess those are the trees where we should meet our guide  the fellow might have come down to the beach walthew remarked i was busy helping mack during the run and hadnt much time to think but it now strikes me as curious that miss cliffe was able to send the note and arrange for a guide when she was a prisoner  she must have got into touch with some of don martins spies and his friends would be ready to help but we had better get on  they crossed the shingle seeing nothing that suggested there was anybody about but walthew grew uneasy as they approached the trees the belt of timber was wrapped in gloom and rolled back up the rising ground in shadowy masses that rustled in the wind it had somehow a forbidding look and the nearer he got the less he liked it he was not daunted and meant to go on but his nerves were highly strung and his glances suspicious as he tried to pierce the dark  they found a trail through tall grass and reeds and followed it across a patch of boggy soil until it led them to an opening in the trees here a shadowy object rose out of the gloom and walthew instinctively felt for his pistol the abrupt movement dislodged a small bundle of clothes which he carried by a strap across his shoulder and it fell to the ground then he saw the man come forward waving his hand  this way señor he called to grahame who was some yards in front  walthew felt tempted to leave the bundle he wanted to watch the man but there was a packet of cartridges among the clothes he had dropped and he thought they might prove useful stooping down he felt among the grass but had to move once or twice before he found the bundle then springing to his feet he saw that grahame and the other had vanished the next moment his comrades voice reached him hoarse and breathless  run  that grahame said nothing more was ominous but walthew did not run back to the boat drawing his pistol he plunged in among the trees but as he reached them he felt a stunning blow on his head he staggered and fell into a thicket blinded by blood that ran into his eyes a struggle seemed to be going on near by and getting upon his knees he fired at random he thought a man ran toward him and he fired again but his mind was confused and he could hardly see for all that he got upon his feet and stumbled forward dazed but determined to rescue his comrade  a few moments afterward it dawned on him that he was going the wrong way for he seemed to have come out on the beach two or three men were hurrying toward him but the pistol would not go off stumbling on with his hand clenched on the barrel ready to use the butt he tripped and fell among the rattling shingle then his senses left him  the next thing of which he was conscious was a cool splash on his face and while he wondered what it was he felt that he lay upon something that moved in an erratic manner it was not shingle for it was smooth when he touched it but a minute or two passed before he realized that he was lying in the sternsheets of the gig she was plunging sharply the spray flew aft in showers and when he wiped his eyes he saw that the men were pulling hard with some trouble he got to his knees and the top of a wave that washed across the gunwale struck his face  where is the señor grahame he asked faintly  who knows somebody answered it seems the rurales have him we came too late  walthew groaned for his head was getting clearer his comrade had fallen into a trap  pull her round he said were going back  for a moment or two nobody replied the gig lurched wildly and a seatop broke on board walthew dimly saw the men swing to and fro at the oars their blurred figures cut the sky as the bow went up and then stood out against white foam as the craft plunged into a hollow  it is not possible señor miguel said breathlessly  walthew scrambled to his feet and stood swaying awkwardly with the violent motion in danger of going overboard the sea had got worse and the savage wind lashed his wet face it was blowing very hard and the turn of the tide had brought broken water nearer inshore he could hear the roar of the surf upon the beach it would now be dangerous to land but he must try to rescue his comrade he seized the oar the man nearest to him pulled the fellow pushed him back and losing his balance as the boat plunged over a comber he fell heavily upon the floorings  we will smash the boat if we land and there are rurales on the beach he heard miguel say the sea is bad perhaps we cannot reach the steamer  walthew realized that miguel was right the men were unarmed except for their knives and something had gone wrong with his pistol even if they escaped being swamped by the surf it would be impossible to cross the beach in face of a hostile force he lay still with a groan he felt faint his head ached excruciatingly and blood still trickled into his eyes he had not seen the enchantress when he stood up and the desperate way the men were rowing showed that they found it hard to drive the boat offshore  after a while however a hail came out of the dark the men pulled furiously and then threw down their oars there was a crash and a rope fell into the boat which surged violently forward grinding against the steamers side walthew did not know how he got on board and he imagined that he fainted soon afterward for the next thing he remembered was trying to get up from the top grating in the engineroom where macallister sat beside him holding a rag and a can of hot water  keep still while i tie up the cut he said  but theyve got grahame walthew exclaimed trying to rise  macallister gently pushed him back  i ken a bad job but we might have lost ye both then he took up a piece of linen its lucky yell no need stitching but maybe this will nip  walthews head smarted intolerably after the bandage was applied but the dazed feeling left him when macallister gave him something to drink and he began to ask questions  miguel heard a shot and ran back up the beach with the others macallister told him they found ye reeling aboot and brought ye down to the gig with two or three rurales no far behind the rest must have gone off with grahame before our men came up they had just time to launch her before the rurales began to shoot but nobody was hit looks as if ye had been knocked oot with a carbine butt  where are we now walthew asked  steaming back to the lagoon as fast as i can drive her and thats aboot four knots against the gale the best thing we can do is to send don martin word but yell go to sleep in the meanwhile i canna look after ye i hae my hands full  the clanging of harddriven engines which quickened to a furious rattle when the screw swung out made the need for watchfulness plain and walthew crept away to his berth he wanted to help but knew that to attempt this would probably result in his falling among the machinery dazed by the blow on his head he soon fell asleep and when he wakened the vessel was at rest there was no pounding of engines and the water no longer gurgled along her side but he heard voices behind the bulkhead  scrambling awkwardly out of the berth he made his way on deck with some difficulty the fresh air revived him and he saw that the enchantress was anchored in the lagoon but he opened a door close by instead of stopping to look about two or three of the revolutionaries whom he knew were sitting round a table in the saloon and as walthew came in whitefaced with staring eyes and a red bandage round his head one of them threw up his hands  ave maria he exclaimed  walthew sat down with a jerk and nodded to macallister  im better  then he turned to the others  what are we going to do  nothing until tonight said one we must wait for dark before it is safe to move they will not keep your comrade at valverde and we must try to find out where they have taken him  ill be quite well in a few hours walthew declared but what is likely to happen to grahame  the man shrugged  who knows the regular course would be to try him for smuggling arms but i do not think the president will follow that plan they may send him to rio frio because it is some distance from the coast and it is possible he will be given a chance of escaping on the way  do you mean that they may let him go walthew asked eagerly  he would not go very far you must understand that the rurales have authority to shoot a prisoner who tries to escape and the government finds this useful sometimes they arrest a man whom they think the court could not convict and an excuse is found for not watching him very closely when he is being taken to the nearest jail perhaps a guard is called away when they stop for food there is cover near and the prisoner makes a dash for freedom then the guard who has been hiding fires and the administration is rid of an enemy sometimes the rurales break into the house of an obnoxious person and taken by surprise he gets angry a threatening movement is enough he is shot down it is simpler than taking him before a judge who may be bribed to let him go  a gang o bloodthirsty scoundrels im thinking its time ye turned on them macallister said while walthew sat silent with a tense face and fury in his eyes but so far as we ken they havena shot mr grahame  no señor said another i think he is safe for a time he might prove too useful for them to shoot at least not until they have tried other means  if ye believe they can frighten or buy him macallister began savagely but the man waved his hand  señor i only think we must set him free as soon as possible and you will agree about the need for that  im coming with you said walthew grimly if im not satisfied with your plans ill do the thing in my own way  macallister gave him a sharp glance walthew did not look fit to travel but macallister knew that objections would be futile the boy had grown older and sterner in a night  the revolutionaries began to talk about what had better be done and it was decided that macallister must remain in charge of the vessel which he would hide in a creek so as to provide a means of escape if this should be needed the others would start for rio frio as soon as it was dark and if they could gather a strong enough force try to overtake and attack grahames escort on the march failing this they would follow the rurales to rio frio and be guided by circumstances when they got there walthew took no part in the discussion but when it was finished he got up and stood looking at the others sternly  we are going to save my partner and not to do something that may help you in your political schemes he said it may save trouble if you bear this in mind  they assured him that grahames rescue was a matter of importance to them and when shortly afterward they left the ship walthew went to his berth and slept until the afternoon he was getting better for it was not the cut but the jar on his skull that had dazed him and the effect of this was passing  when the evening mist began to creep across the lagoon a canoe came off and a halfbreed stood up in her as she approached the gangway  the señores are waiting he announced  walthew shook hands with macallister  ill either bring him back or stop with him he said grimly your business is to be ready to take us off  good luck to ye returned macallister in a rather hoarse voice if yere long aboot it ill come after ye myself  when walthew got into the canoe and vanished in the haze macallister went down to his engineroom and fiercely set about some work that might as well have been left undone     chapter xxvii  hands down   cliffe had spent some time at villa paz when president altiera sent for him one morning it was with mixed feelings that cliffe obeyed the summons for his business had proved longer and more difficult than he expected and he was anxious about evelyn indeed he wondered whether he should let the concessions go and return to the coast but he determined to be guided by what took place during the interview  it was getting hot when altiera received him and a glare of reflected light shone through the unshuttered window cliffe looking out over the little town thought there was an ominous quiet an hour earlier he had watched a company of slouching dusty soldiers equipped as if for service march through the narrow streets but there was now no one about it struck him as significant that all the green shutters were closed and the entrances to the patios barred this might have some bearing on his business but it was not of the first importance and he turned to the president and studied him closely  there was a subtle change in altiera since their last meeting his manner was somehow less cordial and suspicion seemed to lurk in his dark eyes when he had indicated a chair he looked at cliffe steadily  you have no doubt thought over the matter we talked about not long ago he began it is necessary that i should know when we may expect the loan  that as i think you understand depends on when i may expect the concessions  i cannot sign the papers yet it would provoke a storm of indignation that i cannot risk my enemies have taught the people that i am robbing them when i make a grant to foreigners  in short you mean to put down the rebels before you conclude the deal with me  you have guessed right there will be no complaints when i have shown that i have the upper hand  if i had known your plans at the beginning id have acted differently cliffe said  altiera gave him a piercing glance  señor i do not think you are justified in charging us with a want of candor because there is evidence that you have not been quite honest with us our most dangerous enemy is martin sarmiento and we find him staying at your hotel in havana where the señorita cliffe helps him in an attempt to escape observation  i do not know the man cliffe protested with a puzzled air  then it is strange that we should have caught a messenger bringing you a note from him altiera answered i think we shall gain nothing by fencing señor  cliffe frowned  ive just got to say that ive never to my knowledge met don martin what was the note about  we will talk of that later in the meanwhile i understand you have decided not to let me have the money that we need  not without a written promise that the papers will be signed and handed to me in a fortnight unless you consent i must start for valverde at once  altiera pondered for a few moments knitting his brows  you are no doubt anxious to rejoin your daughter he said slowly perhaps i had better tell you that she is not at valverde  not at valverde cliffe exclaimed then where has she gone  i cannot tell you  cliffe clenched his hand but would not let his alarm master him he suspected treachery and knew that he must be cool  your secretary assured me that miss cliffe would be safe with the alcaldes wife i shall hold him responsible why did she leave valverde  it seems the señorita got tired of waiting and set off to rejoin you this is most likely but it is said in the cafés that she ran away with the señor gomez  cliffe looked up with his face set and an ominous sparkle in his eyes  that is a lie  personally i think so but having some knowledge of the sex i would not care to predict what a romantic young woman might do  get on with your tale  altiera regarded cliffe calmly  the señorita had my secretarys escort but finding the road dangerous he made for rio frio where he put her in safe hands her liberty was not interfered with and one morning she left the house and did not come back  cliffe got up and advanced a yard or two across the floor  you mean she ran away why did she do so  your pardon señor altiera spread out his hands with a mocking smile there is no reason to believe she had any cause to run away but not knowing your daughters character i cannot tell you why she went  very well said cliffe restraining himself with an effort i must ask you for an armed escort to rio frio where i will make inquiries i want the men at once  i am afraid that is impossible we have news that there are rebels in the mountains if i gave you a guard the peons might be incited to attack you and the trouble would spread before we are ready to deal with it as president of this country it is my business to think of its welfare first  i understand cliffe said very dryly if i promised to let you have the money you want you might see your duty differently  altiera looked at him with thoughtful eyes the american was shrewd but did not seem as eager as he had expected  señor the need of funds that would ensure the maintenance of order and firm government justifies a risk one would not take without such a reason i will give you a guard and send soldiers to make a thorough search for the señorita if we can agree about the loan  this means you really do not know where my daughter is i was not sure of it until now  altiera saw he had blundered in admitting that the girl was no longer in his hands but while he considered how his mistake could be covered cliffe resumed  it was a cunning plot but you put it through clumsily and youre going to find that kidnapping an american woman is a dangerous game for the president of a thirdrate republic  one must make allowances for the excited imagination of an anxious father altiera answered with an indulgent smile i deny the plot there is no need for one we have a charming young lady left alone in a foreign town who finds waiting tedious and determines to join her relative this is a simple and satisfactory explanation without the other that she forms a romantic attachment for an officer of rank we provide an escort because the country is disturbed and part of the journey is accomplished it is not safe for her to go farther but she is rash and disregarding our advice ventures too far from the house then she loses her way and is perhaps seized by the rebels with the object of embarrassing the government we cannot be held responsible but we are willing to attempt her rescue when we see an opportunity  the explanation was plausible and could not be disproved until cliffe heard his daughters account but what he wanted was to find her  the opportunity is now before the rebels begin to move he said you refuse to seize it  you understand why it is impossible i cannot do anything that might plunge my country into a conflict unless you show me some reason that would justify the risk  i cannot give you such a reason  altiera shrugged  it is for you to decide we come to a deadlock our negotiations break off  very well said cliffe i leave villa paz in an hour and it wouldnt be wise of you to interfere with my movements my business with you is known to people who have some political influence in the united states and if i dont turn up in good time inquiries will be made  he turned abruptly and went out it seemed safer to move quickly though he imagined the hint he had given altiera would prevent any attempt to stop him the president had found a plausible excuse for evelyns disappearance but he would hesitate about detaining an american citizen whose friends could bring pressure to bear at washington this supposition was borne out when cliffe found no trouble in hiring a guide and mules but while he made the arrangements his brain was working  he would willingly have met the demand for money only that altiera had incautiously admitted that he did not know where evelyn was cliffe had acted on impulse in refusing to submit to further exaction but calm reflection justified the course having a deep distrust of the man he thought he might take the money and then not undertake the search for the girl cliffe determined to set about it himself and make a bid for the help of the revolutionaries this would involve him in a serious loss but that did not count he must rescue his daughter whatever it cost  then he remembered that the president had admitted having intercepted a message to him from the rebel leader he had meant to insist on learning what it was about but had somehow omitted to do so and it was now too late to reopen the matter there was however a ray of hope in the thought that sarmiento had tried to communicate with him  when his baggage had been strapped on a packmule he mounted and rode out of villa paz as if making for valverde but as soon as they had left the last of the houses behind he pulled up and quietly studied his guide he was a sturdy brownfaced peon dressed in ragged white cotton with rawhide sandals and a colored blanket strapped round his shoulders but he looked trustworthy moreover cliffe thought his willingness to assist a foreigner who was leaving the presidents house without an escort which must have shown that he had lost the autocrats favor had some significance it was unfortunate that he could not speak much castilian but he knew that money talks in a language that is generally understood  i have changed my mind we will not go to the coast he said stumbling over the words and helping out his meaning by pointing to the mountains  the peon nodded  to me it is equal where the señor goes so long as i am paid for the days we spend upon the road  very well said cliffe taking out a handful of silver do you know don martin sarmiento  the peon looked doubtful and cliffe saw that as he had suspected the fellow had some dealings with the presidents enemies  don martin is known to many he replied cautiously  cliffe jingled the silver and awkwardly explained that he was no longer a friend of the presidents and wished to see sarmiento as soon as he could  for a time the muleteer did not speak then he looked up with an air of decision  it may be difficult señor but we will try he said and jerking the packmules bridle abruptly left the road  they passed through a coffee plantation and a field of sugarcane and then as they reached thick forest the muleteer stopped and indicated the road that wound in loops down the hillside  it is well the president should think we have gone that way he remarked with a smile he has no doubt been told how we left the town  cliffe looked back across the wide sweep of sunscorched country to the shining streak on the horizon his path led into the mountains and he longed for the sea then he thought of grahame and wondered where he was cliffe felt sure the man would help him if he knew his need he was beginning to suspect what business grahame had on the coast he asked his guide about the enchantress but the fellow did not seem to understand and it was obvious that he had not heard of grahame then cliffe urged his mule on and plunged into the steamy shade  two days later they rode into a deep gorge filled with giant creeperfestooned trees and the guide moved forward slowly glancing into the shadow that shut in the winding track it appeared that his caution was justified for presently a hoarse voice bade them halt and as they pulled up two men with rifles stepped out into the sunlight  for some time the muleteer disputed with them using emphatic gestures and pointing to cliffe and then he went on with one while the other sat down watching the american with his rifle across his knees it was very hot for the sun struck down through an opening in the branches but although the perspiration dripped from him cliffe did not think it wise to move indeed he was glad that his mule stood quiet whisking off the flies  at last some one called in the forest and cliffes guard told him to ride on though the man followed at a short distance as if to prevent his escape a few hundred yards farther on the gorge widened into a level hollow and cliffe saw that he was in a camp  it was not marked by military order men of various shades of color lay about smoking cigarettes some were barefooted and most were poorly dressed but all wore red sashes and good rifles lay ready to their hands they looked more like brigands than soldiers and it was hard to imagine they had been drilled but while their attitudes were slackly negligent their faces were resolute in the background climbing forest choked with fallen trees and trailing vines rolled up the steep hillside it was very hot and the hum of insects mingled with the sound of drowsy voices  two men better dressed than the others came forward and cliffe dismounted and followed them to a seat in the shadow where they gave him some cigarettes  now señor you will tell us why you came here said one  cliffe had not expected to be addressed in good english and he looked at the man with surprise  the spaniard smiled  with us the consequences of trying to serve ones country is that one finds it safer to live somewhere else but we will keep to the point  i am looking for don martin sarmiento cliffe said i expect you know where he is  that is so but it would be difficult to reach him and we leave this place tonight in fact it is hard to see what we ought to do with you but it might help if you told us what your business is with don martin  i guess youre surprised i should want to see him cliffe remarked with some dryness  it is natural said the other we know you are a friend of the presidents and we suspect that you have been financing him the money you gave him would be used to put us down  cliffe thought for a few moments the man seemed a person of some consequence and apparently commanded the band of rebels his permission must be obtained before cliffe could proceed and since he meant to ask don martins help there was perhaps no cause for reticence  very well he said i will tell you why i am going to your leader  he related what had led to his quarrel with the president and when he had finished the man translated the narrative to his comrade  it is fortunate señor you refused the loan because you will never get the concessions altieras rule will be over in a day or two but you believed him when he said he did not know where your daughter is  yes he seemed to speak without thinking and was sorry afterward  then as the señorita is not in his hands she is probably in ours but our forces are scattered and at present we cannot make inquiries however i imagine you will find her quickest by remaining with usand you will excuse my saying that it would not suit us to let you go if you were seized by the presidents soldiers he might make some use of you have i your promise that you will not try to escape  although the man was courteous cliffe thought an attempt to run away would lead to trouble but this was not what decided him to stay he had been bred to business but now deeprooted impulses were stirring the president and gomez had cheated him and he felt very sore about it but they had moreover carried off and no doubt terrorized evelyn the thought of this filled him with a fierce desire to get even with them  señores he said grimly you not only have my word not to attempt to escape but you have my pledge to help you in every way i can  we start for rio frio tonight the rebel answered in a significant tone  good cliffe said and glanced about at the little groups of determined looking men ill confess im curious to know how you got such good rifles he added  the rebel studied him keenly for a moment and seemed satisfied  a countryman of yours bought and landed them for us in small quantities  grahame cliffe exclaimed and laughed for he found the situation ironically humorous he liked grahame and suspected that evelyn was interested in him and now it was obvious that the man had helped the revolutionaries to ruin his plans  i know him he said as a matter of fact hes an englishman  at present he is gomezs prisoner that is one reason we strike the first blow at rio frio  ah well if you mean to rescue him you can rely on my doing the best i can  the rebel changed the subject but cliffe imagined he had gained his confidence he was invited to the officers frugal four oclock dinner and afterward sat talking with them while the shadows filled the hollow although still anxious about evelyn he felt less disturbed and was sensible of a strange but pleasant thrill feelings he thought he had long grown out of were reawakening there would be no more trucking with the rogues who had cheated him and carried off his daughter when they next met he would demand satisfaction with a rifle in his hands cliffe admitted that there was something rather absurd and barbarous in the pleasure the thought of the meeting afforded him but for all that the adventure he was embarking on had a strong attraction     chapter xxviii  the presidents despatches   the sun had set when walthew urged his wornout mule up a narrow track that twisted along the hillside through thick timber the evening was very dark and thin mist drifted among the giant trees creepers streamed down from their interlacing boughs damp brush projected from the sides of the trail and walthew growled savagely when he was buffeted by clusters of dewy leaves his head ached the perspiration dripped from his hot face and he was sore in every limb while he found the steamy atmosphere almost unbreathable  the cut on his head was healing but after a long forced march from the coast he had at sunrise left the camp where he and the revolutionaries had spent the night the country ahead was reported to be watched by the presidents soldiers and as the party was not strong enough to fight they had separated hoping to slip past the pickets singly and meet at a rendezvous agreed upon walthew reached the spot without being molested but although he waited for an hour nobody else arrived it seemed possible however that he had mistaken the place and he determined to push on to rio frio trusting that his companions would rejoin him there he had been told that as the president had dealings with foreigners he might be allowed to pass by any soldiers he fell in with when they saw he was an american  he was however still a long way from rio frio his mule was exhausted and he doubted if he were going the right way there was nothing to be seen but shadowy trunks that loomed through the mist a yard or two off and faint specks of phosphorescent light where the fireflies twinkled  rocking in his saddle with a painful jar walthew thought that if the jaded beast stumbled again as badly it would come down and he half decided to dismount he felt that he would be safer on his feet but the mule recovering turned abruptly without his guiding it and a few moments later the darkness grew thinner  the trees now rose on one side in a dense black mass the ground was more level and walthew saw that the animal had struck into a road that led through a clearing he followed it in the hope that there was a hacienda near and soon a light shone in the distance the mule now needed no urging and in a few minutes a building of some size loomed against the sky walthew rode up to it and as he reached the arched entrance to the patio a man appeared while another man moved softly behind him as if to cut off his retreat  can i get a fresh mule here and perhaps something to eat he asked as carelessly as he could  certainly señor said the man if you will get down we will put the beast in the stable  walthew hesitated there was no obvious reason why he should distrust the fellow but he imagined that he had been watching for somebody coming down the road the mule however was worn out and he did not think he had much chance of escaping if treachery was intended  very well he said dismounting and when another man came up he stumbled after the first into the passage  you have ridden far señor and will enjoy a rest his guide remarked one does not lose time by stopping for food on a long journey  walthew felt more suspicious they were now near a lamp that hung in the arch and although his companion was dressed like a peon his voice suggested some education the feeling that his arrival had been expected was stronger but it was too late to turn back and he went on surreptitiously making sure that his automatic pistol was loose he was taken across the patio up an outside staircase and along a balcony where his guide opened a door  the house is at your disposal he said with spanish politeness bowing to walthew to enter  the door was closed sharply and walthew wondered if he had been trapped as he cast a quick glance about the room was large badly lighted and scantily furnished two of its windows were open but he remembered that they must be some distance from the ground there seemed however to be no reason for alarm at the far end of the room a table was laid for supper and a girl and a priest sat near it they rose as he came forward  walthew gasped  blanca  the girl seemed equally astonished  señor walthew she exclaimed and her tone indicated both perplexity and concern walthews clothes were gray with dust his pose was slack with fatigue and a dirty bandage covered his forehead  you seem surprised he managed to say i guess i am the gleam in his eyes showed the pleasure he felt i didnt expect to find you here  but where do you come from  from the san lucar lagoon traveled as fast as i could but lost my companions in the bush they belong to your party  the priest came forward and walthew recognized father agustin  there has been a mistake the priest said to blanca and bowed to walthew you will excuse me i have an order to give  walthew thought it had something to do with his arrival he was no longer suspicious but puzzled he was among friends but they had received him in a curious manner  he turned to blanca with a smile  it looks as if im intruding but i hope you wont turn me out  oh no she said with a compassionate glance that thrilled him you seem ill and tired are you hurt  not much a scratch on my head but are you safe here they told us the woods were full of the presidents soldiers  we shall be gone at daybreak and we have a guard blanca paused and resumed with an air of relief it was fortunate you did not pass the house  thats a sure thing walthew agreed however i guess i know what you mean when i pulled up i fancied your friends were watching for me and id have found the road blocked if id gone on dont you think you had better tell me what its all about  blanca hesitated with some color in her face but just then father agustin returned  i have warned the men he informed the girl  señor walthew wishes to know what is going on she said  it might be better that he should know and he is to be trusted but you must decide whether you will tell him or not  blanca was silent for a moment and then began in a rather strained voice  we have a spy in the presidents household and word was sent us that a man would leave villa paz with some important despatches for gomez we believe they contain instructions about what he must do when the fighting begins but to avoid suspicion altiera is sending a foreign trader to whom he has given some privileges we expect him to stop and change mules here because the hacienda belongs to one of the presidents supporters  i see said walthew he would not have carried the despatches past this house but where is its owner  hiding at a hacienda some distance off he is a timid man and we had him warned that the rebels were coming to burn the place an hour after he left with his family we took possession  but why did don martin send you walthew asked sharply hasnt he men enough  blanca blushed and looked embarrassed but the next moment she lifted her head with an air of pride there was a sparkle in her deep blue eyes  i am a patriot señor and ready to make a sacrifice for my country we must seize the despatches but we do not wish to use force on a foreigner because this might lead to trouble our plan was to change the papers for others and send the messenger on without his knowing that he had lost them it would not be an easy matter  in short father agustin interposed with some dryness the señorita thought she might succeed where a man would fail  the blood rushed to walthews face for he understood blanca meant to use her personal charm to trick and rob the messenger it seemed to him an outrage but she fixed her eyes on him and they had a haughty challenging look she was daring him to deny that the course she meant to take was warranted he was furiously angry but he tried to be just and he knew that she would not go too far  it seems you do not approve she said  walthew felt a thrill in a sense she had admitted that his good opinion was worth something but he saw that he must be careful she was proud and had the fiery spanish temperament he might lose her by a hint of doubt  no he said i dont approve but i can conquer my prejudices as you must have done it is hateful to think of a womans doing such work but one must admire the courage that has helped you to undertake it i dare say the cause demands the sacrifice  the girls expression softened and she smiled as she turned to the priest  do you not think señor walthew has answered well  it is obvious that he has tact and i think he has feeling said father agustin but has he not some news for us perhaps  i have said walthew i want your help  he began with the arrival of evelyns message and blanca started as if about to speak but father agustin stopped her by a sign her face grew intent as walthew told how they had driven the enchantress before the gale and her eyes sparkled when he deprecatingly related the struggle on the beach  i think you have no reason to apologize she said they must have sent a strong guard and you tried to rescue your friend alone miguel was right there was nothing to be done by two or three men with knives then she paused with a thoughtful look it seems you do not know that miss cliffe is safe with us  it is a relief to learn that walthew said with feeling  since she was at rio frio when she sent the note it is plain that gomez added the few lines that led you into the trap but we must think how we can rescue mr grahame you suggest that the men who came with you from san lucar have no plans  no they expected to gather a force on the way but the peons had already gone off to join don martin we meant to steal into rio frio and then see what could be done all i know is that im not going back without my partner  we may find a way to set him free but it will need some thought father agustin remarked when a thing looks difficult force is not always the best means  it doesnt seem likely to be of much use now walthew gloomily agreed id six of your countrymen with me until i lost them and we were told that gomez was filling rio frio with soldiers but how did you come to take a part in this affair  father agustins eyes twinkled  i came as duenna you were surprised when you heard what the señorita had undertaken but it appeared that my presence might be something of a protection and perhaps a guarantee one concludes that this did not strike you  walthew looked embarrassed but father agustin smiled  you look as if you need refreshment he said we will have our supper now  when the meal was finished father agustin kept walthew talking while blanca leaned back silently in her chair her look was strained and once walthew surprised her cautious glance at the clock  i had forgotten the despatchcarrier he said with some sharpness he doesnt seem to be coming  there is another road longer and at present dangerous explained father agustin we have had it watched but this is the obvious way for a messenger to take  for all that said walthew steadily i hope the fellow will choose the other  neither of them answered blanca lay back in her chair the priest sat with one elbow on the table his cheek resting on his upturned palm he was very tired  walthew studied him for a moment and then put his thoughts into words  it is curious father agustin that whenever i have met you things began to happen  it is possible perhaps a priest is most needed where there is trouble and my mission is not always peace one looks forward to the time when lust and greed and cruelty shall no longer rule the hearts of men but it has not come yet  walthew lighted the cigarette his host passed over to him though father agustin had told him nothing new and his manner was by no means dramatic he felt impressed the quiet priest in his shabby cassock and clumsy rawhide shoes had somehow a dominating personality it was hard to tell what part he took in the revolution but even if it were not directly active walthew thought him a moral force that must be reckoned with  for a time nothing was said there was no sound in the room except the ticking of the clock and it seemed to walthew that the house had a deserted feeling he imagined that there was nobody in it except themselves he grew angry and pitiful by turns as he glanced at blanca it was a hateful task she had been given but he saw that she meant to carry it out he wanted to get on because grahame might be in danger but he could not leave until the despatchcarrier came one could trust father agustin but walthew felt that he must be on hand  it got cooler and a faint earthy smell crept in through the windows now and then the lamp flickered in a passing draught and once or twice they forced themselves to talk but the effort was obvious and the voices presently died away after this the quietness became oppressive and by degrees walthew grew drowsy rousing himself he felt ashamed as he glanced at the girl she did not move but her pose was tense and he knew that she was watchful he resented the craving for sleep when she was bearing a heavy strain but he had traveled fast since he left the lagoon and his exhausted body demanded rest  he would not give in and at last he started as a faint throbbing sound reached him from outside it came from a long way off but grew plainer and he saw father agustin lean forward then blanca stood up with a tinge of color in her face and a tightening of her lips somebody was riding hard down the road there was a shout and a sharp answer  for a few moments the three stood waiting with forced calm and then a man hurriedly entered  pepe is here señor he announced  ah said father agustin quietly bring him in he turned to walthew it is one of our men who watched the other road something has gone wrong  walthew saw blancas expression change although she had meant to get the despatches he knew she felt relieved  pepe entered his face was wet with perspiration and he spoke with a breathless quickness that prevented walthews following what he said still it was plain that his news was bad for his manner was apologetic and father agustin looked thoughtful  wait outside we may want you he said and turned to walthew after dismissing the fellow the messenger must have been suspicious and our men have blundered it was very dark and he came upon them suddenly one was shot as he seized the mule and the messenger escaped before they could mount but he was forced to turn back  could he pass them by making a round  it is not likely there is this road and the other with thick forest between and both are guarded the man must wait for daylight and i do not think he will reach rio frio we may turn this to your advantage but it needs thought  he sat down and lighted a cigarette and walthew waited in silence until he looked up  it is possible that gomez will offer your comrade his liberty in exchange for information he can use against don martin  grahame will give him none walthew answered emphatically  then i imagine he is in some danger you would take a risk to rescue him  of course  very well gomez is waiting for instructions and probably knows that the messenger is a foreigner i suggest that you impersonate him the guards will let you pass and gomez will no doubt receive you alone then you must try to extort an order for your friends release  im a pretty good shot said walthew meaningly i might get him covered before i begin  father agustin made a sign of impatience  your best argument will be thisif you are detained for more than a few minutes there will be a tumult in the town gomez will hesitate about forcing a rising before he gets his orders then as soon as you enter the house some of our people will find an excuse for loitering about the door the soldiers are not well drilled it might not be difficult to surprise and disarm the sentry and then the house could be seized for all that there is a risk success will depend upon your nerve and coolness  i cant think of any better plan said walthew  blanca gave him a quick glance and he thrilled as he saw a hint of trouble in her face he thought she was unwilling that he should run into danger but the next moment her eyes sparkled  it will work she said i am coming to help  walthew made a sign of protest but she would not let him speak  i promised to get the despatches and the messenger may arrive while you are with gomez then somebody must make arrangements for the door to be watched and i am known in rio frio i can find trustworthy men she raised her hand imperiously you need not object señor i am going  walthew was forced to acquiesce and an hour afterward they left the hacienda and rode through the dark bush with two wellarmed men behind them     chapter xxix  the presidio   the sun hung low in the western sky with a peak of the black cordillera cutting its lower edge and rio frio shone in the glaring light seen from the road across the valley the town had an ethereal look for the tiers of square white houses rose from a gulf of shadow and clustered upon the hillside glimmering with a pearly luster picked out by clumps of green behind were barren slopes deepening in color to dusky purple as they ran back to the foot of the mountain wall  walthew pulled up his mule and sat gazing at the town he had been riding beside blanca while father agustin and two others followed at some distance  five minutes ago you could hardly see the place against the background and now it glows as if it were lighted up inside he remarked looks more like an enchanted palace than a collection of adobe houses one could imagine that some magician had suddenly conjured it up  im afraid theres not much enchantment in rio frio blanca answered its very prosaic and rather dirty  well i dont know said walthew looking boldly at her im not given to romantic sentiment but something very strange happened to me one night in your town must have been glamour in the air for ive been a changed man ever since you wouldnt expect a matteroffact american who was on the hunt for money to trail round the country trying to act like garibaldi unless he was bewitched  blanca smiled prettily  you have at least chosen to follow a great example señor  i dont think i chose him walthew returned dryly id have looked for somebody easier  but you were free to give up the part if you found it too hard for you  no thats the trouble i wasnt free  the girl knew that he was not talking at random to hide nervousness there was an underlying gravity in his manner and she secretly thrilled to it although he still wore the dirty bandage and was dusty and unkempt she thought he had a very gallant air his eyes were bright and intent and his thin face was very resolute the faint smile with which he regarded her somehow emphasized his determined highstrung look  señor she said it is better to aim high achievement is not everything the effort counts and it is a generous errand you go upon tonight but we will talk of something else look there is the house where i spent the only happy years i can remember until my father heard the call of duty once more and obeyed higher up you can see the green gap of the alameda beyond it the church of san sebastian she paused for a moment with a shiver the white line beneath it is the top of the presidio where gomez lives but the light fades quickly and now seeeverything has gone  the sun had sunk behind the cordillera and the white town changing suddenly to gray melted out of sight as the shadows rolled up the hillside  you must see that its enchanted walthew remarked the magician has waved his wand and blotted it out  it will shine again tomorrow blanca answered in a quiet voice the shadows have long rested on this country of ours but one looks for the dawn  the others were close behind them but the party was smaller than it had been ragged men with dark determined faces had been picked up on the way but it would excite suspicion if they entered rio frio in a body and they had separated during the last hour walthew did not know what their orders were but he thought they would act upon some plan already made if he failed to secure grahames release and blanca presently bore this conclusion out  you will not be left unsupported but it will be better if you can make gomez set your comrade free without our help she said we do not wish to strike the first blow tonight but if it is needful the presidio will be attacked gomezs position is like ours he is not quite ready to force a conflict you see how that strengthens your hand he cannot altogether trust his soldiers and a shot would rouse the town her voice sounded rather strained as she concluded but if you are careful the shot will not be fired gomez is cruel but he is a coward and will give way if you use moral force  its a big thing walthew answered thoughtfully still i must put it over somehow i have to get my partner out  darkness fell before they reached rio frio and blanca stopped her mule on the outskirts of the town  we must separate here she said i do not think the entrance is carefully guarded because it is not gomezs policy to admit that an attack is possible but there may be spies and a rural or two on watch she paused and held out her hand i wish you good fortune señor and i do not think your nerve will fail but if the worst comes we will not leave you in gomezs power  walthew bending down kissed her hand and then lifted his hat  until i see you again señorita he said and quietly rode on  there was no moon and the air was still the town rose before him vague and shadowy with a faint musky smell drifting out from it as he reached the first of the houses a wave of heat rising from the rough pavement surrounded him the walls looked blank for there were no lights behind the lattices but a ray of brightness fell across the street a short distance in front as he crossed the illuminated strip a man in white uniform stepped forward and seized his bridle  who comes he asked looking hard at walthews face  a messenger for the secretario  pass friend said the other letting go the bridle  walthew rode on but checked the mule as soon as he was out of sight it looked as if he had been expected but he had been warned that he must give the revolutionaries time to communicate with their friends in the city they might have some trouble in entering it although he believed they meant to do so through the house of some sympathizer on the outskirts when he turned a corner he stopped to listen but heard nothing behind him and the street in front was quiet it seemed that nobody had been sent to announce his arrival and he could proceed slowly without rousing suspicion  leaving the direct line he wound in and out through narrow streets the mules shoes clanging on the hot stones he passed one or two dimly lighted cafés where men roused by the clatter looked up their figures showing indistinct about the small tables between the pillars farther on shadowy groups were sitting close together on the pavement and though their voices were quiet they had somehow an air of excitement men appeared and vanished in the gloom moving softly and quickly as if afraid of loitering there was a mysterious hint of tension about all that walthew saw and he felt his heart beat as he rode on  crossing the plaza he dismounted at the hotel he had previously visited and sent for the majordomo when the hostler grumbled something about the stables being full  you will remember me he said i want to leave my mule here and perhaps spend the night  i am sorry but we have no room there are a number of strangers in the town they are not so full at the golden fleece  id rather stay here if i have to wait until tomorrow walthew answered you take care of the mules well and i may have a long ride then one puts up at a place one knows with moreconfidence  the majordomo looked hard at him  we must try to make room señor since you haveconfidence  exactly said walthew smiling now i want the mule fed but not unsaddled i may perhaps need it in an hour and it would be an advantage if you could find me another  it might be possible the majordomo replied in a thoughtful tone still there are spies about and they may watch this house with permission i will send the mule to ramon silva in the calle pinastro he is a carrier and it is known that he buys packanimals he will have both mules ready if you ask for them with confidence  walthew thanked the man and set off for the presidio it was a long squarefronted building with a sentrybox at the entrance and an untidy soldier sat smoking outside another stood a little farther on in a slouching attitude a rifle raking across his shoulder and his kepis tilted to one side discipline is seldom marked among spanishamerican soldiers but walthew was somewhat surprised to note that the fellow was bantering a group of loiterers they were dressed like peons and one carried a tray of sweetmeats and another a quantity of cigarettes apparently for sale as walthew passed the former hurriedly moved his tray as if to prevent its being upset  be careful señor he exclaimed giving walthew a warning glance  walthew understood it the men were not there by accident and he saw that one was within leaping distance of the sentry he knew that the spanish knife is almost as dangerous as the rifle at close quarters and can moreover be thrown a short distance with effect  i have a message for the secretario he told the sentry with a careless air  the man let him pass and he saw that he was expected when a dusky steward met him at the door since the despatchcarrier was known to be a foreigner it was easy to enter the presidio but he wondered what would happen before he left now that the dangerous game was about to begin he clearly recognized the risk he ran for all that it looked as if he held the trump cards and he hoped that he had nerve enough to play them well pulling himself together he followed his guide across the patio and up an outer stair until the man stopped and knocked at a door  the messenger señor he announced  walthew held his breath until he heard the door shut behind him then he turned to gomez who had risen from his seat at a table it was a small room and the table stood between the men walthew felt his nerves tingle and his skin grow damp with perspiration as gomez looked at him there was surprise in the secretarys face and he seemed puzzled as if he were trying to revive a memory  you are not the man we were told would come but i think i have seen you somewhere he said  walthew stood still his hand in his jacket pocket as if about to take the despatches from it  the other messenger was detained but we have met i once dined at your table at the international in havana  gomez gave him a quick suspicious glance  then there is something i do not understand but it is not important now you bring the presidents orders  no i bring this  he took his hand from his pocket and the barrel of an automatic pistol glinted in the light  gomez flinched but recovered his calm with a quickness that showed walthew he had a dangerous antagonist  push your chair back from that open drawer and then keep still he ordered  gomez obeyed and walthew sat down on the edge of the table where if necessary he could spring up more quickly than from a chair besides the position helped him to keep both gomez and the door in sight  you are uselessly dramatic señor gomez remarked with a forced sneer you dare not use the pistol and i am not to be frightened by so cheap a trick  walthew did not put down the weapon  rather stale but it has served its purpose by stopping you from calling out and thats all i wanted to begin with now im going to show you how we stand  your position strikes me as very weak  well said walthew coolly i dont know there are some chances in my favor  not many i think a shot or a call from me would lead to your immediate arrest  walthew lowered the pistol  im not going to shoot and you wont call one of your sentries is smoking cigarettes with a wiry liberator ready to put his knife into him and something would happen to the other before he could throw up his rifle then a number of my friends are waiting to seize the gate  what would they gain they could not hold the building in a few minutes the soldiers would arrive  just so still theyd have a few minutes and theres reason for believing theyre not fond of you then i dont mean to be made a prisoner and if im forced to ill shoot straight  this was not an idle threat walthews nerves were steady and he felt a rancorous hatred of the man he had been guilty of unspeakable cruelties he had carried off an american girl and he now had grahame in his power walthews face was pale but his lips were firmly set and there was an ominous gleam in his eyes gomez began to grow uneasy  however walthew went on the important point is that the first shot starts the revolution my friends wont have much trouble with the sentries at the door but if your soldiers try to break in afterward it will rouse the town you may take this for granted because you must see that id make sure of being supported outside before i ventured here  gomez pondered the americans position was certainly strong the lad was not a rash fool and his having made the venture proved his statement about the likelihood of a revolution to be correct moreover gomez had other reasons for not questioning it as he looked up walthew made a warning gesture and gomez heard footsteps outside  dont move said walthew in a low tense voice if that fellow comes in it will make trouble for both of us youd better think how youre going to keep him out  the secretarys lips twitched but he sat motionless the steps drew nearer echoing down the passage in another moment the man outside would reach the door walthew held his breath but the steps continued and passed then they grew fainter and walthew saw his antagonists pose relax the strain had told on him gomez was weakening and the game was nearly won  what do you want the secretary asked  an order for grahames release  impossible my signature would make me responsible to the president  youll take a bigger responsibility if you refuse the men i left waiting will begin the trouble if im not outside very soon you havent got your masters orders yet and the liberators have headed his messenger off i guess youll have to answer for it if you spoil his plans remember youll have to face a revolution unless you let grahame out  gomez was silent for a few moments and then made a sign of acquiescence  very well he said and pulling his chair to the table began to write then he gave walthew the paper are you satisfied  not quite said walthew glancing over the message ring for one of your men and send it off with this note he handed both papers to gomez order him to deliver them at once  when the man came in walthew was sitting carelessly in a chair as if nothing unusual had been going on his right hand however was gripping the pistol in his jacket pocket  ill wait here for five minutes to give him a start seems to me that would be safer he said when the orderly had left them  he was relieved when he thought he could get up for the strain had been heavy and he was feeling rather limp but he walked steadily to the door and did not quicken his steps until he reached the stairs it was with tingling nerves that he came to the outer gate but the sentries let him pass and when he had gone a short distance three or four peons who were hanging about turned and followed him he was outside in the friendly darkness but he had still to leave the town     chapter xxx  the escape   walthew waited for the peons and then turned toward calle pinastro where he had arranged to meet grahame he had now three companions whom he thought he could trust but they were unarmed except for their knives gomez had sent the order for grahames release but if he could rearrest him and seize walthew without causing a tumult he would do so they had only five or six minutes start it did not look as if they could get out of the town in time and walthew felt fiercely impatient for all that he stopped at the corner of a street when one of the others touched him  there was a lighted café near by and a girl stood on the pavement near its open front she was dressed very plainly in white with a dark shawl fastened round her head like a peasant girl but he felt a sudden thrill as she turned toward him although he could not see her very well he knew it was blanca when he cautiously crossed the street she drew him back into the shadow but he saw her look of relief  you have succeeded she said softly where is mr grahame  i am to meet him at ramon silvas  you cannot go this way there are two rurales farther on but it would be dangerous to turn back now  she put her hand on his arm as if to detain him while she considered what to do and walthew looked about knowing that he could trust her knowledge of the town the street was narrow and dark except where the light from the café shone across it a few citizens sat round the small tables and several shadowy figures loitered in the gloom outside walthew thought they had come with the girl but there was nothing in their attitude to suggest that they had any particular business in the neighborhood and his own followers had stopped at the corner  suddenly a clatter of hoofs broke out some one was riding fast toward them walthew felt blancas hand tighten warningly on his arm as she drew back a pace or two the sound grew louder there was a hoarse shout like a sentrys challenge and an answer which walthew imagined satisfied the rurales on guard and then a mounted man rode into the stream of light  the mule was foul with sweat and dust and a trickle of blood ran down its shoulder the riders face was pale and set walthews eyes rested on him for only a second but he knew the fellow was english or american there was an angry cry in the background and a stealthy figure outlined against a blank white wall crossed the street the mounted man was obviously the presidents messenger but walthew having seen his grim tired look and the way he drove the wornout mule furiously down the street felt a touch of halfadmiring sympathy after all the fellow was white and was gallantly doing what he had undertaken  a moment more and walthew saw something glisten in the hand of the stealthy figure that seemed ready to spring he was only a yard away and acting on impulse he stumbled as if by accident and fell against the man the knife dropped with a jingle and the messenger dashed past throwing walthew a quick glance as he went  an angry murmur broke out and several of the loiterers closed in on walthew while men left the café to see what was going on and there were quick footsteps farther off in the gloom remembering the need for haste and that grahame might be in danger walthew half regretted his rashness but as he wondered what to do blanca ran to his side  the rurales are coming she shouted and the men about them vanished as she led him away  they turned a corner into a lane between dark houses  why did you interfere she asked breathlessly  i dont know felt i had to walthew answered with some embarrassment  but you know who he is  yes hes carrying the despatches still he looked played out and he had got through  through your friends  i suppose so it didnt seem to make much difference guess ive been foolish  you were generous but generosity of that kind must be paid for blanca answered in a hard tone it will cost our people something and now that gomez has got his orders i dont know that we can leave the town  grahame and i must find a way but youd be safer without us i cant let you run into needless danger  blanca laughed  do you think i would leave you to get into fresh difficulties with a temperament like yours youre not to be trusted alone  i handled gomez pretty well walthew boasted  and you still wear the bandage he saw you with is it safe to take it off  id forgotten it he admitted  he threw the bandage into the lane with some annoyance for the girl seemed amused but she made no remark until they reached a quiet street  well she said perhaps i can excuse you to the others who havent deserted us but we turn down here and you had better go a few yards in front  following the directions she gave him he presently crossed a square and entered a street where a dim light burned a man stood near it in a careless pose smoking a cigarette and walthews heart beat fast as he saw him  grahame he said and the next moment he was shaking his comrades hand  got your note said grahame thought id better wait here silva cant let us have the mules  walthew understood his brevity there was no time for questions and explanations  grahame took off his hat as blanca joined them  i must see silva wait in the shadow she said and moved quickly away  the men stood silent they had much to say but it would keep and the means of escaping from the town occupied their minds the street was deserted and seemed strangely quiet after the girls footsteps died away but indistinct cries came across the flat roofs as if something were happening walthew looked about sharply in tense impatience but could see nothing and blanca did not return at last however she came silently toward them through the gloom  it is impossible for silva to give us the mules she said the government has seized all he has and two rurales guard the stable  then we must try to get away on foot grahame replied would you be safer señorita if you got some of your friends to hide you  no she said i must take my father some news i have picked up and gomez will leave no place unsearched when he learns that i have been here i think we shall be out of danger if we can reach a house i know  they went down the street quickly but silently and as they turned the corner a man sprang out from the gloom beside a wall and immediately afterward disappeared a few moments later they heard a whistle and blanca led the men into a narrow lane  it is off our way and we must run she said  she shook off walthew when he tried to take her arm and they had gone some distance before they heard footsteps behind them the pursuers did not seem to gain much ground but when they slipped round a corner somebody shouted and the girl sped across the square they had entered a little farther on they heard a heavier tread on the uneven stones  rurales grahame whispered  blanca turned off quickly and led them through an archway into a street where there was a café which to walthews surprise she made for the pursuers had not come out from the archway yet and the party falling into a slower pace before they reached the café went in and sat down calmly at one of the tables as usual the front of the café was open to the pavement separated from it by only a row of pillars a few men sat inside and glanced curiously at the newcomers but they made no remark  a bottle of vermouth as soon as you can grahame said to the landlord  the fellow gave him a quick glance and then his eyes rested for a moment on the girl but he did not delay and was coming back with some glasses when several barefooted men and two others in uniform ran down the street grahame had taken up a newspaper but he watched them over it without turning his head walthew pushed his chair back carelessly into the shadow and blanca played with a gaudy fan the men did not look into the café but the landlord after quietly filling the glasses put down the bottle with a meaning smile  they may come back he said and moved away  walthew was about to get up but blanca coquettishly tapped him with her fan and taking the hint he sat still they must drink some of the vermouth before they left he drained his glass and insisted on refilling the girls blanca protested laughingly but grahame saw that she held her fan so that it hid her face from the other customers she was playing her part well still he thought that walthew knowing less of spanish conventions did not understand how daring she was when grahames eyes rested on her she blushed and quickly turned her head  it seems you have a number of supporters in the town he remarked in a low voice  yes she said you are thinking of the landlords hint we hope at least half the people are on our side but we can venture out in a minute or two  she raised her glass smiling at walthew and then hummed a song until she got up and standing in front of a dirty mirror began to arrange the black mantilla that covered her head her pose and movements were marked by rakish coquetry and grahame saw they had deceived the loungers but he noticed with a touch of dry amusement that walthew looked puzzled and not quite pleased  now señores she said loudly in castilian you have had wine enough and must not keep me waiting  she went out in front of them flaunting her fan but when they reached the pavement her manner changed and her voice was strained as she whispered  follow me close but quickly there is no time to lose  they were not molested as they crossed the town but when they neared its outskirts blanca left the road that led to the open country and plunged into a network of narrow streets at last she stopped in front of a large but dilapidated looking house and knocking twice waited a few moments until her summons was answered there was no light inside and she exchanged a word with a halfseen person at the door before the party was admitted the door was shut and bolted and they were led into an inner room where a small lamp burned and a woman with a frightened face confronted them  the road is stopped and you must go at once before the house is searched she said excitedly  where are the others blanca asked  they lost you and have gone on you know where they will wait  blanca nodded and beckoned her companions and they followed her and the woman to a window at the back grahame tactfully sprang out first and was relieved to find himself outside the town with a grove of trees that promised safe concealment not far ahead he made his way toward them without looking round walthew got out next but as soon as he reached the ground he turned and held up his arms to blanca who was sitting on the ledge as she sprang down he caught her and holding her fast kissed her ardently his feeling of triumph banished all thought of their danger when he found that she did not resist her eyes shone a deep mystic blue and she smiled as she slipped her arm round his neck for a moment before he set her down  without speaking they hurried on after grahame  we have about a mile to go blanca said when they reached him  she struck into a path that led them past clumps of trees rows of neatly planted bushes and fields of cane it was a still dark night on which a sound would carry far but they heard no pursuit and the town seemed quiet  at last a small building loomed up ahead and blanca stopped beside it  we should find the others here she whispered but you wait it would be better for them to see me first  they let her go knowing that she would be easily recognized but she came back a few moments later  there is nobody about perhaps they have gone on because they had news from people in the town or something may have happened to make them change their plans  sitting down outside the building they began to consider what must be done  we must go on without our mules blanca said i have information that my father must get as soon as possible but we may not be able to join him until tomorrow night the road is the nearest way but now that gomez has his orders he may have sent out soldiers to stop all travelers besides there are rurales about  then well take to the mountains said walthew he did not mean her to run a risk i guess theyve disarmed grahame and with one pistol among us we couldnt put up much of a fight  theres another blanca returned quietly i might let mr grahame have it if he is a good shot but he must give it back to me and as time is important we will take the road  she silenced walthews objections and they set off striking into a broad track some distance farther on for a time it wound deep with dust that clung about their feet heavy with the dew across a belt of cultivated land where indistinct orderly rows of coffee bushes ran back from its edge then it plunged into thick forest where the soil was soft and the darkness impenetrable and they stumbled along blindly trying to feel their way for all that grahame was conscious of keen satisfaction as he breathed the warm night air heavy as it was it seemed strangely invigorating after the foul atmosphere of the carcel where he had been imprisoned and it was something to walk at large again walthew however felt anxious and limp he had been highly strung for several hours and he held himself responsible for the safety of the girl he loved listening for sounds of pursuit he tried to pierce the darkness in front and started when a leaf rustled or some animal moved stealthily through the forest he thought his footsteps rang down the brancharched track alarmingly loud  they came out into barren rolling country where clumps of cactus and euphorbia grew in fantastic shapes the track led upward and it was obvious that blanca was getting tired unless they are the wives of peons spanishamerican women do not lead an active life and as a rule limit their walks to an evening stroll in the plaza  for a while blanca leaned on walthews arm and he winced as he felt her limping movements but at last she stopped  i cannot go much farther but there is a house near here she said we can rest when we reach it  the house proved to be empty and in some disorder suggesting that its occupants had hurriedly fled but on searching it with a light they found some food a little charcoal and an iron cooking pot blanca and walthew had made a long journey after their last meal and grahame had eaten nothing since his very plain breakfast at ten oclock  following the girls instructions he lighted the charcoal and set the pot near the door while she prepared the food but walthew lay down in the dust outside he was physically tired and now when he imagined they were comparatively safe he felt very slack and his mind was dull for all that he lay where he could see the road and only moved his eyes from it when he glanced into the small adobe building the charcoal made a faint red glow that forced up the face of the stooping girl out of the darkness and touched her skin with a coppery gleam grahame knelt beside her a dark vaguely outlined figure fanning the fire and walthew felt half jealous that he should help  then he found himself getting drowsy and lighting a cigarette he fixed his eyes resolutely on the road all was very quiet and there was not a movement anywhere  but blanca was not out of danger yet     chapter xxxi  the american trader   walthew was almost dozing when he was startled by a sound that came out of the darkness it was some distance off but it had a regular beat in it and when it grew louder he could not doubt that some one was riding fast up the road  move the fire backtheres somebody coming he called quickly blanca will you give grahame your pistol  he used her name for the first time and it thrilled him but he had other things to think about the faint glow of the charcoal vanished and grahame came out and stood listening  stay where you are and guard the door he said ill drop behind that bush and then if the fellow gets down well have him between us  throwing away a cigarette he was smoking he vanished into the gloom and walthew lay still with his heart beating fast the drumming of hoofs grew slower as the rider climbed the hill before the house but walthew could not see him until he dismounted and came up the path leading his mule it was some comfort to realize that they had only one man to deal with but if he was a spy of the presidents he must not get away walthew lying at full length quickly worked his elbow into the dust to steady his pistol hand  when the stranger was three or four yards away he stopped and looped the bridle round his arm then he put his hand into his pocket and walthew with his nerves atingle supposed that the man was searching for a match in another moment he might have to shoot and he held his breath as his finger tightened on the trigger he heard the match scrape a tiny flame flickered between the strangers hands and walthew started as he saw his face it was the man who had carried the presidents orders into rio frio  the light spread falling on walthews recumbent figure and sparkling on his pistol but the messenger did not throw it down as the american had half expected instead he coolly held it up  i see you have me covered he said though its a surprise to find you here im not going to run away  walthew lowered his pistol  very well leave your mule and go into the house will you tie up the animal grahame  so there are two of you  the man did as he was told and walthew following him asked blanca to get a light  the girl had found a lamp which she placed on the ground and the stranger looked at her sharply as she bent over it nobody spoke until grahame came in  are you alone he asked the messenger  quite  whats your name and business  carson agent for the trading firm henniker and gillatly  where were you going and why did you come here  carson turned to walthew who had been wondering whether he recognized him  i imagine this gentleman knows my business he said he did me a service in rio frio which im glad to acknowledge as a matter of fact i stopped here to look for something to eat the owner of this house is on the presidents side its pretty plain though that he has cleared out taking it all round i havent had much luck this trip  who warned you not to call at the hacienda perez blanca asked  i dont know his namehe stopped me for a moment in the dark im sorry i had to put one of your friends out of action señorita but i hadnt much choice because he struck at me with his knife for all that i hope the mans not badly hurt  we expect him to recover  you seem to know this lady walthew broke in  carson smiled  i havent had the pleasure of being presented but ive seen miss sarmiento once or twice and it would be strange if i forgot her  his easy goodhumor disarmed walthew  did you deliver the presidents despatches he asked  yes to tell the truth i was glad to get rid of themand i imagine miss sarmiento acted wisely in leaving the town now however im naturally curious to know what you mean to do with me  will you give us your word not to tell any of the presidents supporters that you have met us  ill promise with pleasure i feel that ive done enough in carrying his despatches  very well said grahame that clears the ground but we must talk it over together  thanks carson said coolly im not pressed for timeand i notice that you have been cooking i wonder if i might ask for some supper  all we have is at your service señor blanca answered with spanish politeness but wed better put out the light  she extinguished the lamp and they gathered round the cooking pot the men sitting on the earth floor with the red glow of the burning charcoal on their faces it could not be seen many yards away and grahames view commanded the path to the door blanca divided the omelette she had made and afterward gave them some black coffee and a bundle of cigarettes  these are habaneros and should be good she said as they belong to a friend of the presidents we need not hesitate about using them  she sat down beside walthew and they smoked in silence for a while blanca was studying carsons face as it was lighted by the glow from the charcoal  why did you help altiera she asked him suddenly  commercial interest he has given us one or two trading privileges and he seemed to think i had a pretty good chance of getting through  do you know what his orders to gomez were  grahame had wondered when she meant to ask this and had left it to her feeling that she was more likely to catch the messenger off his guard  carson laughed  honestly i dont know altiera isnt the man to take an outsider into his confidence  still you know something  well carson said quietly im sorry i must refuse to tell you my surmises no doubt youll understand my obstinacy  arent you rash señor blanca asked in a meaning tone  on the whole i think not of course im in your hands but as ive promised not to give you away i expect these gentlemen wont take an unfair advantage of me then from what i know about don martin i feel that i can trust his daughter  blanca smiled  well she said i suppose we must let you go you are at liberty to leave us when you wish  grahame and walthew agreed and carson shook hands with them  its evident that your only reason for stopping near rio frio is that miss sarmiento finds it impossible to walk any farther he remarked shes welcome to my mule gomez requisitioned it from a man called silva whos suspected of sympathizing with your party i believe i know where to find another animal  they thanked him and let him go and soon after he vanished into the darkness blanca mounted the mule and they set off again  pushing on until dawn they found a small deserted hacienda standing back from the road and as tall forest grew close up to it offering a line of retreat they decided to rest there the mule looked jaded blanca admitted that she could not go much farther and walthew was obviously worn out they could find nothing to eat but there was some furniture in the house and blanca found a place to sleep in one of the rooms while the men lay down on a rug outside the sun was now rising above the high cordillera and wet with the dew as they were they enjoyed the warmth a few lizards crept about the wall in front of them and an archway near by commanded a view of the road the building was in good order and had apparently been abandoned on the approach of the presidents soldiers  these people know what to expect they must have been ready to light out walthew remarked i rather liked that fellow carson but its curious he didnt ask us anything about our business  hed take it for granted that we had an active part in the revolution  no doubt the señoritas being with us would suggest something of the kind but he seemed surprised at first walthew replied with a thoughtful air for all that i cant quite see  no said grahame i dont think you altogether understand the situation yet i suppose you mean to marry miss sarmiento  certainly if shell have me walthew answered with firmness though he looked at his comrade as if he expected something more  grahame smiled  then youre to be congratulated because you wont have much trouble in getting your wish  what do you mean walthews tone was sharp but he remembered an incident during his escape from the town ill admit i wasnt quite hopeless but we were both in danger  he broke off and grahame regarded him with a friendly laugh  youre modestand youre more ignorant of spanish customs than i thought however id better explain so youll know how don martin will look at it to begin with a wellbroughtup girl is never permitted to meet a man unless she is suitably escorted by an older member of the family and you have been wandering about with miss sarmiento for two or three days now you can understand why carson was surprised and i noticed he was uncertain how to address miss sarmiento at first she noticed his hesitation though you did not  for some moments walthew was silent his brows knitted  no i never thought of it he admitted but well say no more about it until ive seen don martin besides theres another matter a fellow who joined us at the lagoon gave me a letter for you sorry i forgot it until now but i had a good deal to think about  i dont suppose its important grahame replied and lighted a cigarette before opening the envelope with an english stamp  then his expression changed and a few moments afterward he let the letter drop and sat very still the cigarette went out the hot sun shone upon his uncovered head and a lizard ran across his leg but he did not move he seemed lost in thought walthew watching with puzzled sympathy waited for him to speak  this letter has been a long time on the way he explained at last it probably had to wait at our havana address and then don martins people had no opportunity to deliver it  but whats the news walthew asked  grahame answered with a strained laugh  in a sense its rather a grim joke while ive been risking my life for a few dollars profit on smuggled guns and practicing the sternest selfdenial it seems ive been the owner of an old border estate  ah said walthew then calder hall now belongs to you  what do you know about calder hall  ive known all about it for some time and im very glad but i understand that you didnt expect to inherit the estate  no it seemed impossible i wont trouble you with family particulars but two deaths have occurred in a very short time the last owner was no older than i am and married but his only child is a girl and he was killed while hunting although he was my cousin ive rarely seen him  he was silent again for some minutes his mind busy with alluring visions he had long struggled with poverty and had wandered about the world engaging in reckless adventures but he had inherited a love for the old home of his race and now it was his but this while counting for much was not the main thing he had been strongly attracted by evelyn cliffe but recognizing his disadvantages he had tried hard to hold in check the love for her which grew in spite of him the obstacles that had bulked so large were now removed he was free to win her if he could and it was comforting to remember that in her urgent need she had sent for him but he had work to finish first  i suppose you mean to start home as soon as you can walthew suggested  no grahame answered quietly im not going yet for one thing we have taken don martins money and now that he has to meet a crisis we cant leave him in the lurch besides one day at san lucar we promised some of the leaders of the movement that wed see them through  it was a good reason grahame was not the man to do a shabby thing but walthew remembering that evelyn was with the rebels thought his comrade had a stronger motive for staying  well he agreed i guess thats so anyway the game cant last much longer theyll have to use our guns in the next few days  yes and as we dont know what part well have in it youd better get some rest ill keep watch a while  walthew was glad of the opportunity to sleep and grahame moving back into the shadow as the sun got hot sat still with his mind busy and his eyes fixed upon the road  at noon blanca came out of the house and stood looking down at walthew with a compassionate gentleness that she did not try to hide the halfhealed cut showed plainly on his forehead his brown face looked worn and he lay in an attitude of deep weariness  it is a pity to wake him but we must start she said and indicated the scar i suppose you can guess that he has borne something and he got that wound for you  im not likely to forget it grahame answered quietly  no blanca said with a curious smile you do not make many protestations you men of the north but one can trust you  she stooped and touched walthew gently  it is noon and we must go  her voice was quiet but walthew seemed to know it in his sleep for he sprang to his feet with a halfashamed air  i didnt mean to sleep so long he said and looked at blanca anxiously have you rested enough are you quite fit to travel  blanca smiled and when walthew brought up the mule and helped her to mount she noticed something new in his manner hitherto it had been marked by a certain diffidence but now this had gone he was assiduously careful of her but with a hint of proprietary right something had happened since she had last seen him to account for the change she gave grahame a searching glance but his face was impassive  they set off walthew walking beside the mule but it was to grahame that the girl spoke as they moved slowly forward in the scorching heat he thought he understood and his eyes twinkled with amusement when she was not looking blanca suspected him and she did not mean walthew to take too much for granted     chapter xxxii  loves vision   it was late when walthew led blancas mule through the rebel camp to the table under a tree where don martin sat writing there was a half moon in the sky and as they passed between the rows of motionless dark figures stretched on the ground here and there an upturned face caught the light and shone a livid white in places a sentrys form was silhouetted vague and black against the sky but except for this all was wrapped in puzzling shadow and silence brooded over the camp  one of don martins staff sat beside the table smoking a cigarette another lay asleep near by but a small lamp burned steadily near the leaders hand lighting up his grave face against the gloom he put down his pen and waited when walthew stopped the mule and helped the girl to dismount  i have had the honor of escorting the señorita from rio frio where with her help i got my partner out of the carcel he said  yes don martin returned in a quiet voice i have heard something of this i am told that you met my daughter at the hacienda perez was it by accident  walthew remembering grahames remarks on the subject felt embarrassed for the steadiness of don martins glance was significant  certainly he answered i had never heard of the hacienda before i reached it for all that i would not have kept away if i had known the señorita was there  one must acknowledge your frankness don martin remarked well what happened afterward  walthew looked at blanca but she seemed to be smiling as she unfolded her fan and he began a brief account of their adventures  and your comrade is with you asked don martin i was told of his escape but you have been some time on the way our friends who lost you in rio frio arrived this morning  blanca laughed  i cannot walk like a peon she explained  but you came on a mule  we had gone some distance when carson the trader lent it to us  walthew had not mentioned their meeting with the presidents messenger and don martin looked surprised  carson he exclaimed if i did not believe mr grahame was a man of honor i should not know what to think  mr walthew also is a man of honor blanca retorted in a meaning tone but i have news which you must hear at once  don martin turned to walthew  you will give me a few minutes then i will see you again  taking this as a dismissal walthew went back to where grahame was waiting and smoked a cigarette with him soon after he had finished it a drowsy soldier beckoned him and he returned to sarmiento when he reached the table blanca had gone  señor he said i have a favor to ask but the accident that i was thrown into miss sarmientos company at the hacienda and rio frio has nothing to do with it you must understand that i want your consent to my marriage to your daughter  ah said don martin you have learned that she is willing  walthew felt half guilty when he thought of the kiss beneath the windowsill but he looked at don martin steadily  i thought it better to follow your customs he explained blanca does not know i meant to ask you but i want to say that my mind has been made up for some time it was for her sake that i determined to stay on the coast and give you all the help i could  there was a gleam of amusement in don martins eyes  then my daughter gained us a useful ally but so far you have spoken for yourself what about your parents blanca sarmiento is not an american  walthew hesitated for a moment  they may feel some surprise but i believe it will vanish when they have seen her and i choose my wife to please myself i think i have means enough to make my way without any help though i havent a great deal  how much  sarmiento nodded when walthew told him  it is enough you would be thought a rich man in this country still i would prefer to have your fathers consent it is our custom that a marriage should be arranged with the approval of both families  but you are a progressive and dont count much on customs i understand that you mean to cut out all those that stop your people from going ahead  it is true to some extent don martin admitted with a smile for all that one may believe in progress in the abstract and yet hesitate about making risky experiments that touch ones own family however if blanca is willing i can trust her to you  ill try to deserve your confidence walthew answered and added with a naïvely thoughtful air my people will come round the only thing theyll insist on is that i enter the family business and thats going to be easier than i thought  why did you refuse in the beginning  its rather hard to explain i wanted to get into touch with realities to learn what i was good for and find my proper level  sarmiento made a sign of comprehension  and in searching for what you call realities you have found yourself  walthew recognized the truth of this it was not that in facing danger and hardship he had gained steadiness and selfcontrol because he had never lacked courage but he had acquired a clearer conception of essential things he would no longer be content to accept thoughtlessly the conventional view his comrade had taught him much by his coolness in time of strain and his stubborn tenacity when things went wrong it was not for nothing that grahame had hawklike eyes he had the gift of seeing what must be done but after all it was from hardship itself that walthew had learned most and in the light of that knowledge he determined to go home the work he was best fitted for was waiting in the smoky industrial town it was not the task he had longed for but it was his and he would be content now  don martin smiled  you may try to persuade blanca to go with you to your country if you wish i want a talk with your comrade now will you send him to me  walthew left him with a light heart and shortly afterward grahame joined don martin  señor said the leader you have kept your agreement with us faithfully and i do not know that we have any further claim but i understand that you do not mean to leave us yet  no grahame replied quietly i shall see you through  good another body of our friends is gathering at a village to which i will send you with a guide they are well armed and determined i offer you command  where is the señorita cliffe grahame wanted to know  at a hacienda two or three hours ride back she is in good hands and at daybreak my daughter leaves to join her  grahame was sensible of keen disappointment  when do you wish me to start he asked  as soon as possible but youd better take an hours rest  im ready now if you will give me my orders  when a few minutes later he rode away with the guide walthew and blanca left the camp and followed a path that led through a field of rustling sugarcane  we must not go far blanca protested this is quite against my peoples idea of what is correct  its a sign of the change youre going to make for me you might have been something like a princess here and youll be the wife of a plain american citizen instead  i never wanted to be a princess she said and certainly not a conspirator all i really hoped for was one faithful subject  you have one whose loyalty wont change but you mustnt expect too much because im giving up my adventurous career and turning business man men like bolivar and the other fellow you wanted me to copy arent born every dayand im not sure wed appreciate them if they were  blanca laughed  you are a pessimist but i will tell you a secret it needs courage to be the wife of a great soldier and i am not brave enough her voice fell to a low caressing note ones heart shrinks from sending the man one loves into danger  walthew stopped in the path and faced the girl she was smiling the halfmoon now high overhead shed its beams down in a weird light that lay over everything like a mantle of blue silver all about them the tall cane whispered in the wind  walthew opened his arms and blanca cuddled to him  it is so wonderful he breathed after the first long kiss so wonderful that you are really going back to the states with me  you are not going back the same she smiled up at him and he stooped and kissed the smile  you have seen the vision she finished romance has touched you  it was you who opened my eyes perhaps now they are dazzled but we will never let the vision quite fade romance shall spread her bright wings above the home im going to build you on the river bluff  again he found her mouth and drank deep  the silence was broken by a rattle of leather and a jingle of steel that startled them and as they turned quickly and walked up the path a dark figure rose out of the gloom ahead and stood before them sinister and threatening when walthew had answered the sentrys challenge blanca shivered  i had forgotten for a few minutes she said rio frio is not taken yet and you must fight for us  for two or three days if all goes well it cant be a long struggle rio frio is bound to fall  blanca clung closer to him  i cannot keep you she said but how i wish the days were over there is nothing of the princess in me i am only an anxious girl     chapter xxxiii  the hero of rio frio   day was breaking when cliffe saw rio frio loom out above lowlying mist there was no perceptible light in the sky but the scattered clumps of trees were growing blacker and more distinct and the town began to stand out against a dusky background it had an unsubstantial look as if it might suddenly fade away and cliffe felt that he was doing something fantastic and unreal as he watched the blurred forms of his companions move on to some extent want of sleep and weariness accounted for this because he had marched all night but the silence with which the rebels advanced helped the illusion a number of them were barefooted and the rawhide sandals of the others made no sound in the thick dust  cliffe marched near the head of the straggling battalion a cartridgebelt round his waist and a rifle on his shoulder his light clothes were damp and stained with soil his costly panama hat hung crumpled and shapeless about his head and he did not differ much in external appearance from the men around him they were a picturesque undisciplined band but cliffe knew that they meant business he recognized that there was something humorous about his marching with them he belonged to the orderly cities where he had been treated as a man of importance but now he was swayed by primitive impulses and had cast off the habits of civilization  the rebel leader had promised to make inquiries about evelyn but had learned nothing cliffe imagined that the man having other things to think about had not been very diligent he held gomez accountable for the distress he felt the rogue had cheated him and stolen his daughter cliffe sternly determined that he should pay for it gomez however was in rio frio and since he could not be reached by other means cliffe was ready to fight his way into the town the curious thing was that instead of finding the prospect disagreeable he was conscious of a certain fierce satisfaction the commander of the detachment had treated him well but his limited knowledge of castilian had made it necessary that he should take his place in the ranks  the leading files halted and from their disjointed remarks cliffe gathered that a picket of the enemys had been surprised by the scouts he had heard no shots but he could imagine the darkskinned men many of whom had indian blood in them crawling silently through the long grass with unsheathed knives it was not a pleasant picture but the road was clear  the light was growing when they went on moving faster the need for haste was obvious as they were not numerous they must enter the town while darkness covered their approach and they were late another detachment should have met them but it had not arrived on the whole cliffe did not think their chances good but that did not daunt him and he trudged on with the rest the dust rolling like a fog about his head  after a while the advance split up into two streams of hurrying men and going with one body cliffe saw the flattopped houses near ahead stumbling among small bushes and gazing between the shoulders of the men in front he made out a shadowy opening in the line of buildings a few minutes later the clatter of sandals rose from slippery stones there were blank walls about him and he was in the town it was hard to believe they had entered unopposed without a shot being fired but he supposed the guard had been surprised and overpowered by friends inside  the backs of the leading files obstructed his view but now that they were moving down a narrow lane the air throbbed with the sound of their advance rifle slings rattled feet fell with a rapid beat and now and then an order broke through the jingle of steel then a shot rang out and the men began to run two or three falling out here and there with the intention cliffe supposed of occupying friendly houses a little later the advance guard swung out into a wider street and a group of men began tearing up the pavement it had been loosened beforehand and the stones came up easily another group were throwing furniture out of the houses they worked frantically though they were fired at and cliffe could hear the bullets splash upon the stones  for the most part the men were wiry peons some toiling half naked but there were a number who looked like prosperous citizens the light however was dim and they were hard to distinguish as they flitted to and fro with their loads or plied the shovel a barricade was rising fast but the alarm had spread detached shouts and a confused uproar rolled across the town the call of bugles joined in and the sharp clang of the rifles grew more frequent cliffe could see no smoke but he imagined that the roofs farther on were occupied by the troops gomez was no doubt hurrying into action  the attack had obviously been well timed and arranged with the coöperation of revolutionaries in the town but while the rebels had gained an entrance they seemed unable to follow up their success and it remained to be seen if they could hold their ground until reënforcements arrived finding no opportunity for doing anything useful cliffe sat down on the pavement and lighted a cigarette he did not feel the nervousness he had expected but he was tired and hungry it was four oclock on the previous afternoon when he shared the officers frugal dinner and he had eaten nothing since there was no use in speculating about what was likely to happen in the next few hours but he meant to have a reckoning with gomez if he came through alive  then as he watched the blurred figures swarming like ants about the barricade he broke into a dry smile for the situation had an ironically humorous side he had thought himself a sober business man and now he was helping a horde of frenzied rebels to overthrow the government he had supported with large sums of money this was a novelty in the way of finance moreover it was strange that he should derive a quiet satisfaction from the touch of the rifle balanced across his knees he was better used to the scattergun and did not altogether understand the sights but he was determined to shoot as well as he could  an opportunity was soon offered him some one gave an order and after some pushing and jostling he squeezed himself between the legs of a table on the top of the barricade a ragged desperado who scowled furiously and used what seemed to be violently abusive language had contested the position with him and it struck cliffe as remarkable that he should have taken so much trouble to secure a post where he might get shot he was there however and thought he could make pretty good shooting up to a couple hundred yards  he had got comfortably settled with his left elbow braced against a ledge to support the rifle when a body of men in white uniform appeared at the other end of the street an officer with sword drawn marched at their head but they did not seem anxious to press forward or to be moving in very regular order the distances were uneven and some of the men straggled toward the side of the street where it was darker close to the walls cliffe sympathized with them although he felt steadier than he had thought possible  a rifle flashed on a roof and others answered from the barricade but only a thin streak of gray vapor that vanished almost immediately marked the firing it looked as if the rebels had obtained good powder after a few moments cliffe heard a shrill humming close above his head and there was a crash as a man behind him fell backward then he felt his rifle jump and jar his shoulder though he was not otherwise conscious that he had fired he must have pulled the trigger by instinct but he did not try to ascertain the result of his shot he had not come to that yet  there was a sharp patter on the front of the barricade and splinters sprang from the table legs some one near cliffe cried out and the patter went on raising his head cautiously he saw that a number of soldiers were firing from the roofs while the rest ran steadily up the street they must be stopped dropping his chin upon the stock he stiffened his arms and held his breath as he squeezed the trigger  after this he was too busy to retain a clear impression of what happened his rifle jumped and jarred until it got hot his shoulder felt sore and he found he must pull round his cartridgebelt because the nearer clips were empty he did not know how the fight was going the separate advancing figures he gazed at through the notch of the rear sight monopolized his attention but there was thin smoke and dust about and he could not see them well it seemed curious that they had not reached the barricade and he felt angry with them for keeping him in suspense then the firing gradually slackened and died away everything seemed strangely quiet except that men were running back down the street in disorder the rebels had held their ground the attack had failed  after a few moments he noticed that the sun shone down between the houses and it was getting hot he felt thirsty and the glare hurt his eyes which smarted with the dust and acrid vapor that hung about the spot all the soldiers however had not gone back several lay in strange slack attitudes near the front of the barricade and a rebel who sprang down perhaps with the object of securing fresh cartridges suddenly dropped the rest lay close and left the fallen alone then a tall priest in threadbare cassock and clumsy rawhide shoes came out of a house and with the help of two or three others carried the victims inside cliffe heard somebody say that it was father agustin  soon afterward a man near cliffe gave him a cigarette and he smoked it although his mouth was dry and the tobacco had a bitter taste the heat was getting worse and his head began to ache but he was busy wondering what would happen next gomez must have more troops than the handful he had sent the rebels could not hold the position against a strong force and their supports had not arrived he hoped gomez had no machineguns  suddenly the attack recommenced there were more soldiers and a rattle of firing that broke out farther up the street suggested that the revolutionaries were being attacked in flank some of the men seemed to hesitate and began to look behind them but they got steadier when an officer called out and cliffe understood that a detachment had been sent back to protect their rear in the meantime the soldiers in front were coming on they were slouching untidy fellows but their brown faces were savage and cliffe knew they meant to get in it was however his business to keep them out and he fired as fast as he could load when the barrel got so hot that he could hardly touch it he paused to cool the open breach and anxiously looked about  the street seemed filled with white figures but they had opened out and in the gaps he could see the dazzling stones over which the hot air danced there was a gleam of bright steel in the sun and he noticed that the walls were scarred raw spots marked where the chipped whitewash had fallen off and the adobe showed through but there was no time to observe these things the foremost men were dangerously near finding he could now hold his rifle cliffe snapped in a cartridge and closed the breach then he spent a few tense minutes the enemy reached the foot of the barrier and climbed up rifles flashed from roofs and windows streaks of flame rippled along the top of the barricade and one or two of the defenders perhaps stung by smarting wounds or maddened by excitement leaped down with clubbed weapons and disappeared cliffe kept his place between the table legs and pulled round his cartridgebelt  the tension could not last flesh and blood could not stand it he understood why the men had leaped down courting death he hoped his own nerve was normally good but if the struggle was not decided soon he could not answer for himself he must escape from the strain somehow if he had to charge the attackers with an empty rifle  there was a sudden change the climbing white figures seemed to melt away and though the rifles still clanged from roofs and windows the firing slackened along the barricade the troops were going back running not retiring and trying to break into houses from which men with rude weapons thrust them out it looked as if the inhabitants were all insurgents now  soon the priest reappeared and cliffe left his post and sat down where there was a strip of shade he had helped to beat off two attacks but he was doubtful about the third while he rested a fat swarthy woman brought him a cup of caña and he was surprised when he saw how much of the fiery spirit he had drunk the woman smiled and went on to the next man with the cup  cliffe wondered how long he had been fighting for he found his watch had stopped but the sun was not high yet after all the reënforcements he had begun to despair of might arrive in time while he comforted himself with this reflection some of the other men dug a trench behind the barricade and citizens loading the earth into baskets carried it off cliffe did not know what this was for but he supposed the baskets would be used to strengthen defenses somewhere else it was a long time since he had handled a spade but if they needed his help he could dig pulling himself up with an effort he took a tool from a breathless man and set to work  after a time a citizen appeared with a bundle of papers and a white flag an officer signed him to come forward and taking the papers from him threw them among the men cliffe got one and finding a man who spoke a little english asked him what the notice meant the man said it was a proclamation by gomez stating that as the people had serious ground for dissatisfaction with the presidents administration and were determined to end it he must accede to the wish of the leading citizens who had urged him to form a provisional government he promised a general amnesty for past offenses and the prompt redress of all grievances  so the dog turns on his master the translator remarked with bitter scorn altiera was a tyrant but this rogue would be worse  the insurgent leader standing on top of the barricade read the proclamation in a loud ironical voice and when he tore it up with a dramatic gesture the roar of mocking laughter that rang down the street showed what all who heard it thought of gomezs claim then people ran out of the houses and pelted the messenger with stones as he hurriedly retired until a few shots from a roof cleared the street  the dog has bought the soldiers altiera should have been his own paymaster the man whom cliffe had questioned remarked  for the next half hour everything was quiet but cliffe felt uneasy one could not tell what gomez was doing but it was plain that he must make a resolute attempt to crush the rebels before he turned his forces against the president he must have felt reasonably sure of his ground when he made his last daring move as his terms had been scornfully rejected the country would soon be devastated by three hostile factions which would make evelyns danger very grave cliffe forgot that he was thirsty and there was a pain in his left side brought on by want of food if help did not come by sunset his friends would be overwhelmed by numbers when it was too dark to shoot straight  then he saw that they were threatened by a more urgent danger the end of the street opened into the plaza which had been deserted the houses on its opposite side were shuttered and the sun burned down into the dazzling square except for a strip of shadow beneath one white wall now however a body of men appeared carrying something across the uneven pavement when they stopped and began to put the separate parts together cliffe saw that it was a machinegun he wondered why gomez had not made use of it earlier unless perhaps it had formed the main defense of the presidio  the barrel thickened by its water jacket gleamed ominously in front of the steel shield as the men got the gun into position but it was unthinkable that they should be left to do so undisturbed and cliffe scrambled back to his post when an order rang out he felt that he hated the venomous machine which had perhaps been bought with his money steadying his rifle he fired as fast as he could  though the smoke was thin it hung about the rebels position making it hard to see and cliffe feared their shots were going wide but after a few moments the barricade trembled and there was a curious whirring sound above his head dust and splinters of stone were flung up and large flakes fell from the neighboring walls all this seemed to happen at once before he was conscious of a measured thudding like a big hammer falling very fast which drowned the reports of the rifles and dominated everything the flimsy defenses were pierced gaps began to open here and there and men dropped back into the trench then a fierce yell rang across the city and although cliffe heard no order the rebel fire slackened peering through the vapor he saw the soldiers were frantically dragging the gun into a new position the shield no longer hid the men at the breach but cliffe did not shoot he felt paralyzed as he watched to see what was happening  the hammering began again and flashes that looked pale in the sunshine leapt about the muzzle of the gun soldiers lying down behind it were using their rifles and another detachment hurriedly came up cliffes view of the plaza was limited he could not see one side of it where an attack was evidently being made but presently a mob of running men swept into sight a few dropped upon the pavement and began to fire but the main body ran straight for the gun and he noticed with a thrill that they were led by a lightskinned man some of them fell but the rest went on and the rebels behind the barricade began to shout the eagerly expected reënforcements had arrived  the man with the fair skin was the first to reach the gun cliffe saw his pistol flash but the struggle did not last gomezs men fell back and the others swung round the gun then as flame blazed from its muzzle a triumphant yell rose from the barricade and cliffe springing up on the table waved his hat and shouted with the rest grahame with his handful of peons had saved the day  in a few seconds cliffe felt dizzy his head was unsteady his knees seemed weak and as he tried to get down he lost his balance falling from the top of the barricade he plunged heavily into the trench where his senses left him  it was some time afterward when he came to himself and looking round in a halfdazed manner wondered where he was the big room in which he lay was shadowy and cool and he did not feel much the worse except that his head ached and his eyes were dazzled a tumult seemed to be going on outside but the room was quiet and a girl in a white dress sat near by he thought he ought to know her although he could not see her face until she heard him move and came toward him  evelyn he gasped  yes she answered smiling how do you feel  dizzy said cliffe but this is rio frio isnt it how did you get here  you mustnt talk she said firmly and he saw that she had a glass in her hand drink this and go to sleep again  cliffe did not mean to go to sleep although he drained the glass because he was thirsty there was much he wanted to know but he found it difficult to talk and evelyn would not answer after a futile effort to shake it off he succumbed to the drowsiness that was overpowering him     chapter xxxiv  the coming dawn   it was getting dark when cliffe wakened the windows were open and a flickering red glow shone into the room footsteps and voices rose from the street below as if the city were astir but this did not interest him much evelyn was standing near and a man whom he could not see well sat in the shadow  you must have something to tell me cliffe said to the girl we seem to be in safe quarters but how did we get here  evelyn knelt down beside his couch and put her hand on his hot forehead it felt pleasantly cool and cliffe lay still with a sigh of satisfaction  father agustin brought you in here several hours ago she explained but that was before i arrived i was worried but the doctor says we neednt be alarmed  thats a sure thing cliffe replied im feeling pretty well but thirsty whats the matter with me anyhow  exhaustion and perhaps slight sunstroke and shock you must have had a bad fall because you are bruised  i certainly fell right down to the bottom of the trench but thats not what i want to talk about it is a big relief to see you safe but where have you been  it will take some time to tell evelyn bent closer over him as she began an account of her adventures in a low voice and cliffe dully imagined that she did not want the other occupant of the room to hear the fellow was no doubt a doctor  i had no difficulty after i reached don martins camp she finished his daughter the pretty girl we saw at the international was with him most of the time and afterward her duenna treated me very well when the rebels advanced on rio frio don martin thought it safer for blanca and me to go with them but they left us outside with a guard until the town was taken then i was told that a priest had picked you up badly hurt and they brought me here the house belongs to a merchant who took some part in the revolution you can imagine how anxious i was until father agustin sent a doctor  i hate to think of the danger you were in he said though you seem to have shown surprising grit  evelyn laughed and patted his shoulder  then i must have inherited it im told that you and the others held the barricade stubbornly for two hours don martin admits that he might not have taken rio frio if it hadnt been for the stand you made  he wouldnt have taken it and thered have been very few of us left if grahame hadnt rushed the gun but ive something else to thank him for it seems from your story that he got himself into trouble by going to your help  yes said evelyn quietly you can thank him now if you like she beckoned the man across the room come and join us dear  the red glow from outside fell on her face as cliffe gave her a surprised look and he noticed that she blushed then he held out his hand to grahame because he thought he understood  it seems i owe you a good deal he said  well grahame returned smiling i suppose my intentions were good but i didnt accomplish much and my partner had to run a serious risk to get me out of trouble  the way you rushed that gun was great  it might have been better if we had taken the fellows in the rear but we were told that they were making things hot for you and there was no time to get round  when we met in havana id no idea that you were up against me cliffe said with a laugh curious isnt it that we should make friends while i was backing the president and you the rebels he turned to the window whats the fire outside  the presidio burning gomez used it as headquarters and made his last stand there  ah then your friends have finished him  grahame nodded  a rather grim business he had much to answer for but although half his troops deserted he made a gallant end  wheres your partner and what are the rebel bosses doing now  walthew was patrolling the streets with a company of brigands when i last saw him he promised to meet me here as soon as he was relieved the others are busy forming a provisional government don martin said hed call on you soon  i owe him some thanks but i mean to cut my connection with this countrys affairs no more political speculations ive had enough  grahame laughed  i can imagine that these people are an unstable lot and its not certain that don martin whos much the best man they have will be the next president but we were told to keep you quiet and evelyn is tired she had to follow the rebels march all night but wouldnt rest until she was satisfied about you  how long have you called her evelyn cliffe demanded looking hard at him  he will tell you about that tomorrow evelyn answered with a blush you must lie still and go to sleep again if you can but if you give trouble well leave the señora rocas who is deaf and very clumsy to look after you  when cliffe fell asleep evelyn and grahame went out on to the balcony and watched the moonlight creep across the town there were lights in the cafés and excited citizens gathered in the streets now and then a few angry cries broke out but for the most part the scraps of news that spread among the crowd were received with exultant cheers  the next day cliffe was much better and after breakfast grahame found him sitting in the shady patio he listened to the younger man quietly and then held out his hand  im glad i can agree he said ill miss her but i feel that shell be safe with you  ten minutes later grahame met walthew who looked disturbed and indignant  what are they doing at the council grahame asked  fooling said walthew fiercely seems to me theyre mad last night they were solid for don martin but now a faction that means to make castillo president is gaining ground  a number of them must know he gave their plans away to save his skin  they know all right one fellow urged that castillo did so as a matter of policy because he meant to force altieras hand guess the crowd who want him would believe anything that suited them  well grahame said thoughtfully ive had my doubts whether theyd get on with don martin his code of political moralitys rather high they want a man who wont expect too much i dare say they feel that after turning out altiera theyre entitled to a few opportunities for graft themselves and for finding their friends official jobs im sorry for sarmiento though what does he say  havent seen him this morning father agustin believes hell respect the wish of the majority although the fellows who did the fighting are all on his side  grahame went to look for evelyn and it was noon when walthew met him again  after a glorious row theyve chosen castilloand i wish them joy of him he said don martin withdraws his claim and wants to leave tomorrow hes going to live in cuba and if cliffes fit to travel we may as well all clear out im sick of this place anyway id like to take blanca and her father across in the enchantress  there will be no difficulty about that i think we can sell the boat at new orleans have you made any plans  sure im going to marry blanca at havana and then take her home she seemed to think she ought to stay with her father but don martin convinced her this wasnt necessary guess it hurt him but he told me the girl had had a pretty rough time wandering about in exile and he means to give her a chance of a brighter life  why did you fix on havana for the wedding  walthew laughed  my people will see there is no use in kicking when i take my wife home and theyve only to give blanca a fair show to get fond of her then there are a number of americans in havana and i can get the thing properly registered and fixed up by our consul don martin agreed he paused a minute and added don martins going to address the citizens in the plaza at six oclock and i think hed like you and cliffe to be there  grahame promised to ask cliffe and soon after dinner he found that a place had been kept for his party on the broad steps of the church of san sebastian the air was cooling and dusk was near but the light had not gone and the square was packed with an expectant crowd except where a space was kept the lower steps were occupied by officials and leading citizens but the two highest were empty  for a few minutes there was deep silence and nobody moved in the crowded plaza then a murmur rose as the leather curtain across the door was drawn back and don martin came out with three priests in their robes behind him he stood bareheaded on the second step very straight and soldierlike but plainly dressed in white with no sash or badge of office the priests standing above with father agustins tall figure in the middle as he turned his face toward the crowd a great shout went up  viva sarmiento viva el libertador  don martin bowed but did not speak and a bugle call rang across the square and was followed by a measured tramp of feet men marching in loose fours swung out of a shadowy opening and advanced upon the church a red sash round the waist with the ends left hanging loose was the only uniform they wore and grahame felt a curious emotional quiver as he recognized the detachment he had led he understood that the best of them had been enrolled for a time as a national guard their brown faces were impassive as they filled the open space but after they swung into double line instead of the conventional salute they waved their ragged hats and a roar broke out  viva sarmiento viva el maestro  then some of the group looked anxious and there was a stir in the crowd as an officer approached the steps he had his pistol drawn but he lowered it and stood opposite don martin with his hat off  your comrades salute you señor he said you have led us to victory and if you have fresh orders for us we obey you still  he spoke clearly in a meaning tone and there was an applauding murmur from the crowd that gathered strength and filled the square everybody seemed to feel a sudden tension and grahame imagined that the superseded leader had only to give the signal for a counter revolution to begin but he saw that father agustin wore a quiet smile  don martin raised his hand  i thank you and i know your loyalty but it belongs to your country of which i am a private citizen i can give no orders but i ask you to serve the new government as well as you have served me  the officer went back to his men with a moody air and don martin turned to the crowd  in a national crisis it is a citizens duty to devote himself to his countrys service and this i have done but it is a duty that carries no claim for reward many of you have helped me with effort and money and some have given their lives but the rough work is done and the crisis is past now that i am no longer needed i lay down my authority and it is better in several ways that i should go but you who remain have still much to do it is harder to build than to pull down and your task is to establish justice freedom and prosperity the best foundation is obedience to the new leader the nation has chosen  he moved back into the gloom for darkness was gathering fast and after a few words of grave advice father agustin blessed the people then the national guard marched away and the crowd broke up but grahame and his party waited with don martin standing behind them by the door of the church a smell of incense floated out and dim lights twinkled in the building no one spoke until the measured tramp of feet had died away  then grahame put his hand on don martins arm  the sacrifice you have made tonight must have cost you something he said in a sympathetic voice  it is seldom easy to do what is best don martin answered smiling sadly and now with your permission i should like to be alone we will start for valverde early tomorrow  they left him in the deserted plaza  what a man that is cliffe remarked if they were all like him in congress thered be a big improvement in our politicsand i guess youd have some use for a few of his kind at westminster  thats true grahame agreed i cant say that such men are scarce but as a rule they dont come to the top they do whats demanded of them and then quietly fall out of sight                                       the next morning they set out for the coast the enchantress was in the roadstead when they reached the port and they went straight on board macallister met them at the gangway and there was deep feeling in his face as he shook hands with his comrades but a few moments later he surveyed the group with a grin walthew had helped evelyn on board and blanca stood near grahame  im thinking yere no sorted right he said and when evelyn blushed he resumed with a chuckle ye need no tell me i kenned what would happen and i wish ye all happiness  he turned with a flourish to don martin  wed ha dressed the ship for ye señor only our flags are a bit ragged and i couldna find the one ye have served so weel  thank you said don martin we hope our flag will be better known before long  macallister hurried below to raise steam but it was some time before they got a working pressure and dusk was falling when the windlass hauled in the rattling cable and grahame rang the telegraph the propeller churned the phosphorescent sea the enchantress forged ahead and the white town began to fade into the haze astern  don martin leaned upon the taffrail watching the dim littoral until it melted from his sight and only the black cordillera in the background cut against the sky then he joined the group about the deckhouse and lighted a cigarette  another act finished and the curtain dropped but one looks forward to the next with confidence he said  it might have opened better if you had kept the leading part grahame replied and added meaningly you could have kept it  that is possible don martin agreed but it might not have been wise i fought for peace and i was satisfied when it was secured  still i dont see why you left cliffe interposed is castillo strong enough to rule your people  we must give him an opportunity if he has some failings his intentions are good no rule is free from faults and when it is autocratic a possible claimant for the chief post is a danger to the state all who love change and turmoil fix their hopes on him  do you mean to live in cuba  yes i have some skill in organization and a little money left and friends wish me to help in the development of a new sugar estate it is not very far from valverde and one hears what is going on don martin paused and spread out his hands if all goes well i shall grow sugar but if it happens that my country needs me i will go back again  walthew changed the subject and presently evelyn and grahame strolled forward to the bow there was moonlight on the water and the enchantress steamed smoothly up the glittering track while the foam that curled about her stern shone with phosphorescent flame  i wonder where that path is leading us evelyn said  toward the dawn grahame answered theres glamour in moonlight and mystery in the dark but were moving on to meet the sunshine   the end
