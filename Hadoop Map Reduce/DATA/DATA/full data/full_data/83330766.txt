take me with you  r stevenson    letter  2 sulyarde terrace torquay thursday april 1866    respected paternal relative  i write to make a request of the  most moderate nature  every year i have cost you an enormous   nay elephantine  sum of money for drugs and physicians fees and  the most expensive time of the twelve months was march  but this year the biting oriental blasts the howling tempests and  the general ailments of the human race have been successfully  braved by yours truly  does not this deserve remuneration  i appeal to your charity i appeal to your generosity i appeal to  your justice i appeal to your accounts i appeal in fine to your  purse  my sense of generosity forbids the receipt of more  my sense of  justice forbids the receipt of less  than halfacrown  greeting  from sir your most affectionate and needy son  r stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    wick friday september 11 1868  my dear mother     wick lies at the end or elbow of an open  triangular bay hemmed on either side by shores either cliff or  steep earthbank of no great height  the grey houses of pulteney  extend along the southerly shore almost to the cape and it is  about halfway down this shore  no sixsevenths way down  that  the new breakwater extends athwart the bay  certainly wick in itself possesses no beauty  bare grey shores  grim grey houses grim grey sea not even the gleam of red tiles  not even the greenness of a tree  the southerly heights when i  came here were black with people fishers waiting on wind and  night  now all the sys stornoway boats have beaten out of the  bay and the wick men stay indoors or wrangle on the quays with  dissatisfied fishcurers kneehigh in brine mud and herring  refuse  the day when the boats put out to go home to the hebrides  the girl here told me there was a black wind and on going out i  found the epithet as justifiable as it was picturesque  a cold  black southerly wind with occasional rising showers of rain it  was a fine sight to see the boats beat out ateeth of it  in wick i have never heard any one greet his neighbour with the  usual fine day or good morning  both come shaking their heads  and both say breezy breezy  and such is the atrocious quality  of the climate that the remark is almost invariably justified by  the fact  the streets are full of the highland fishers lubberly stupid  inconceivably lazy and heavy to move  you bruise against them  tumble over them elbow them against the wall  all to no purpose  they will not budge and you are forced to leave the pavement every  step  to the south however is as fine a piece of coast scenery as i  ever saw  great black chasms huge black cliffs rugged and over hung gullies natural arches and deep green pools below them  almost too deep to let you see the gleam of sand among the darker  weed  there are deep caves too  in one of these lives a tribe of  gipsies  the men are always drunk simply and truthfully always   from morning to evening the great villainouslooking fellows are  either sleeping off the last debauch or hulking about the cove in  the horrors  the cave is deep high and airy and might be made  comfortable enough  but they just live among heaped boulders damp  with continual droppings from above with no more furniture than  two or three tin pans a truss of rotten straw and a few ragged  cloaks  in winter the surf bursts into the mouth and often forces  them to abandon it  an emeute of disappointed fishers was feared and two ships of war  are in the bay to render assistance to the municipal authorities   this is the ides and to all intents and purposes said ides are  passed  still there is a good deal of disturbance many drunk men  and a double supply of police  i saw them sent for by some people  and enter an inn in a pretty good hurry  what it was for i do not  know  you would see by papas letter about the carpenter who fell off the  staging  i dont think i was ever so much excited in my life  the  man was back at his work and i asked him how he was but he was a  highlander and  need i add it  dickens a word could i  understand of his answer  what is still worse i find the people  hereabout  that is to say the highlanders not the northmen   dont understand me  i have lost a shillings worth of postage stamps which has damped  my ardour for buying big lots of em  ill buy them one at a time  as i want em for the future  the free church minister and i got quite thick  he left last night  about two in the morning when i went to turn in  he gave me the  enclosed  i remain your affectionate son  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    wick september 5 1868  monday    my dear mamma  this morning i got a delightful haul  your letter  of the fourth surely misdated papas of same day virgils  bucolics very thankfully received and aikmans annals a precious  and most acceptable donation for which i tender my most ebullient  thanksgivings  i almost forgot to drink my tea and eat mine egg  it contains more detailed accounts than anything i ever saw except  wodrow without being so portentously tiresome and so desperately  overborne with footnotes proclamations acts of parliament and  citations as that last history  i have been reading a good deal of herbert  hes a clever and a  devout cove but in places awfully twaddley if i may use the  word  oughtnt this to rejoice papas heart    carve or discourse do not a famine fear who carves is kind to two who talks to all   you understand  the fearing a famine is applied to people  gulping down solid vivers without a word as if the ten lean kine  began tomorrow  do you remember condemning something of mine for being too  obtrusively didactic  listen to herbert    is it not verse except enchanted groves and sudden arbours shadow coarsespun lines must purling streams refresh a lovers loves must all be veiled while he that reads divines catching the sense at two removes   you see except was used for unless before 1630   tuesday  the riots were a hum  no more has been heard and one  of the warsteamers has deserted in disgust  the moonstone is frightfully interesting  isnt the detective  prime  dont say anything about the plot for i have only read on  to the end of betteredges narrative so dont know anything about  it yet  i thought to have gone on to thurso tonight but the coach was  full so i go tomorrow instead  today i had a grouse  great glorification  there is a drunken brute in the house who disturbed my rest last  night  hes a very respectable man in general but when on the  spree a most consummate fool  when he came in he stood on the  top of the stairs and preached in the dark with great solemnity and  no audience from 12 pm to halfpast one  at last i opened my  door  are we to have no sleep at all for that drunken brute  i  said  as i hoped it had the desired effect  drunken brute he  howled in much indignation then after a pause in a voice of some  contrition well if i am a drunken brute its only once in the  twelvemonth  and that was the end of him the insult rankled in  his mind and he retired to rest  he is a fishcurer a man over  fifty and pretty rich too  hes as bad again today but ill be  shot if he keeps me awake ill douse him with water if he makes a  row  ever your affectionate son  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    wick september 1868  saturday 10 am  my dear mother  the last two days have been dreadfully hard and  i was so tired in the evenings that i could not write  in fact  last night i went to sleep immediately after dinner or very nearly  so  my hours have been 102 and 37 out in the lighter or the  small boat in a long heavy roll from the noreast  when the dog  was taken out he got awfully ill one of the men geordie grant by  name and surname followed shoot with considerable eclat but  wonderful to relate i kept well  my hands are all skinned  blistered discoloured and engrained with tar some of which  latter has established itself under my nails in a position of such  natural strength that it defies all my efforts to dislodge it  the  worst work i had was when david macdonalds eldest and i took the  charge ourselves  he remained in the lighter to tighten or slacken  the guys as we raised the pole towards the perpendicular with two  men  i was with four men in the boat  we dropped an anchor out a  good bit then tied a cord to the pole took a turn round the  sternmost thwart with it and pulled on the anchor line  as the  great big wet hawser came in it soaked you to the skin  i was  the sternest used by way of variety for sternmost of the lot  and had to coil it  a work which involved from its being so stiff  and your being busy pulling with all your might no little trouble  and an extra ducking  we got it up and just as we were going to  sing victory one of the guys slipped in the pole tottered   went over on its side again like a shot and behold the end of our  labour  you see i have been roughing it and though some parts of the  letter may be neither very comprehensible nor very interesting to  you i think that perhaps it might amuse willie traquair who  delights in all such dirty jobs  the first day i forgot to mention was like midwinter for cold  and rained incessantly so hard that the livid white of our cold pinched faces wore a sort of inflamed rash on the windward side  i am not a bit the worse of it except forementioned state of  hands a slight crick in my neck from the rain running down and  general stiffness from pulling hauling and tugging for dear life  we have got double weights at the guys and hope to get it up like  a shot  what fun you three must be having  i hope the cold dont disagree  with you  i remain my dear mother your affectionate son  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    pulteney wick sunday september 1868  my dear mother  another storm  wind higher rain thicker  the  wind still rising as the night closes in and the sea slowly rising  along with it it looks like a three days gale  last week has been a blank one  always too much sea  i enjoyed myself very much last night at the rs  there was a  little dancing much singing and supper  are you not well that you do not write  i havent heard from you  for more than a fortnight  the wind fell yesterday and rose again today it is a dreadful  evening but the wind is keeping the sea down as yet  of course  nothing more has been done to the poles and i cant tell when i  shall be able to leave not for a fortnight yet i fear at the  earliest for the winds are persistent  wheres murra  is cummie  struck dumb about the boots  i wish you would get somebody to  write an interesting letter and say how you are for youre on the  broad of your back i see  there hath arrived an inroad of farmers  tonight and i go to avoid them to m if hes disengaged to the  rs if not  sunday later  storm without  wind and rain  a confused mass  of winddriven rainsqualls windragged mist foam spray and  great grey waves  of this hereafter in the meantime let us  follow the due course of historic narrative  seven pm found me at breadalbane terrace clad in spotless  blacks white tie shirt et caetera and finished off below with a  pair of navvies boots  how true that the devil is betrayed by his  feet  a message to cummy at last  why o treacherous woman were  my dress boots withheld  dramatis personae  pere r amusing longwinded in many points  like papa mere r nice delicate likes hymns knew aunt margaret  tould man knew uncle alan fille r nommee sara no h rather  nice lights up well good voice interested face miss l nice  also washed out a little and i think a trifle sentimental fils  r in a leith office smart full of happy epithet amusing  they  are very nice and very kind asked me to come back  any night you  feel dull and any night doesnt mean no night  well be so glad  to see you  cest la mere qui parle  i was back there again tonight  there was hymnsinging and  general religious controversy till eight after which talk was  secular  mrs s was deeply distressed about the boot business   she consoled me by saying that many would be glad to have such feet  whatever shoes they had on  unfortunately fishers and seafaring  men are too facile to be compared with  this looks like enjoyment   better speck than anster  i have done with frivolity  this morning i was awakened by mrs s  at the door  theres a ship ashore at shaltigoe  as my senses  slowly flooded i heard the whistling and the roaring of wind and  the lashing of gustblown and uncertain flaws of rain  i got up  dressed and went out  the mizzled sky and rain blinded you   c                  d              \          a\            \            b\   c d is the new pier  a the schooner ashore  b the salmon house  she was a norwegian  coming in she saw our first gaugepole  standing at point e norse skipper thought it was a sunk smack and  dropped his anchor in full drift of sea  chain broke  schooner  came ashore  insured laden with wood  skipper owner of vessel and  cargo bottom out  i was in a great fright at first lest we should be liable but it  seems thats all right  some of the waves were twenty feet high  the spray rose eighty  feet at the new pier  some wood has come ashore and the roadway  seems carried away  there is something fishy at the far end where  the cross wall is building but till we are able to get along all  speculation is vain  i am so sleepy i am writing nonsense  i stood a long while on the cope watching the sea below me i hear  its dull monotonous roar at this moment below the shrieking of the  wind and there came ever recurring to my mind the verse i am so  fond of   but yet the lord that is on high is more of might by far than noise of many waters is or great seabillows are   the thunder at the wall when it first struck  the rush along ever  growing higher  the great jet of snowwhite spray some forty feet  above you  and the noise of many waters the roar the hiss the  shrieking among the shingle as it fell head over heels at your  feet  i watched if it threw the big stones at the wall but it  never moved them  monday  the end of the work displays gaps cairns of ten ton  blocks stones torn from their places and turned right round  the  damage above water is comparatively little  what there may be  below on ne sait pas encore  the roadway is torn away cross  heads broken planks tossed here and there planks gnawn and  mumbled as if a starved bear had been trying to eat them planks  with spales lifted from them as if they had been dressed with a  rugged plane one pile swaying to and fro clear of the bottom the  rails in one place sunk a foot at least  this was not a great  storm the waves were light and short  yet when we are standing at  the office i felt the ground beneath me quail as a huge roller  thundered on the work at the last years cross wall  how could noster amicus q maximus appreciate a storm at wick  it  requires a little of the artistic temperament of which mr t s  ce possesses some whatever he may say  i cant look at it  practically however  that will come i suppose like grey hair or  coffin nails  our pole is snapped  a fortnights work and the loss of the norse  schooner all for nothing  except experience and dirty clothes   your affectionate son  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs churchill babington    swanston cottage lothianburn summer 1871  my dear maud  if you have forgotten the handwriting  as is like  enough  you will find the name of a former correspondent dont  know how to spell that word at the end  i have begun to write to  you before now but always stuck somehow and left it to drown in a  drawerful of like fiascos  this time i am determined to carry  through though i have nothing specially to say  we look fairly like summer this morning the trees are blackening  out of their spring greens the warmer suns have melted the  hoarfrost of daisies of the paddock and the blackbird i fear  already beginning to stint his pipe of mellower days  which is  very apposite i cant spell anything today  one p or two and  pretty  all the same we have been having shocking weather  cold  winds and grey skies  i have been reading heaps of nice books but i cant go back so  far  i am reading clarendons hist rebell at present with which  i am more pleased than i expected which is saying a good deal  it  is a pet idea of mine that one gets more real truth out of one  avowed partisan than out of a dozen of your sham impartialists   wolves in sheeps clothing  simpering honesty as they suppress  documents  after all what one wants to know is not what people  did but why they did it  or rather why they thought they did it  and to learn that you should go to the men themselves  their very  falsehood is often more than another mans truth  i have possessed myself of mrs hutchinson which of course i  admire etc  but is there not an irritating deliberation and  correctness about her and everybody connected with her  if she  would only write bad grammar or forget to finish a sentence or do  something or other that looks fallible it would be a relief  i  sometimes wish the old colonel had got drunk and beaten her in the  bitterness of my spirit  i know i felt a weight taken off my heart  when i heard he was extravagant  it is quite possible to be too  good for this evil world and unquestionably mrs hutchinson was   the way in which she talks of herself makes ones blood run cold   there  i am glad to have got that out  but dont say it to  anybody  seal of secrecy  please tell mr babington that i have never forgotten one of his  drawings  a rubens i think  a woman holding up a model ship   that woman had more life in her than ninety per cent of the lame  humans that you see crippling about this earth  by the way that is a feature in art which seems to have come in  with the italians  your old greek statues have scarce enough  vitality in them to keep their monstrous bodies fresh withal  a  shrewd country attorney in a turned white neckcloth and rusty  blacks would just take one of these agamemnons and ajaxes quietly  by his beautiful strong arm trot the unresisting statue down a  little gallery of legal shams and turn the poor fellow out at the  other end naked as from the earth he came  there is more  latent life more of the coiled spring in the sleeping dog about a  recumbent figure of michael angelos than about the most excited of  greek statues  the very marble seems to wrinkle with a wild energy  that we never feel except in dreams  i think this letter has turned into a sermon but i had nothing  interesting to talk about  i do wish you and mr babington would think better of it and come  north this summer  we should be so glad to see you both  do  reconsider it  believe me my dear maud ever your most  affectionate cousin  louis stevenson    letter  to alison cunningham    1871  my dear cummy  i was greatly pleased by your letter in many ways   of course i was glad to hear from you you know you and i have so  many old stories between us that even if there was nothing else  even if there was not a very sincere respect and affection we  should always be glad to pass a nod  i say even if there was  not  but you know right well there is  do not suppose that i  shall ever forget those long bitter nights when i coughed and  coughed and was so unhappy and you were so patient and loving with  a poor sick child  indeed cummy i wish i might become a man  worth talking of if it were only that you should not have thrown  away your pains  happily it is not the result of our acts that makes them brave and  noble but the acts themselves and the unselfish love that moved us  to do them  inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of  these  my dear old nurse and you know there is nothing a man can  say nearer his heart except his mother or his wife  my dear old  nurse god will make good to you all the good that you have done  and mercifully forgive you all the evil  and next time when the  spring comes round and everything is beginning once again if you  should happen to think that you might have had a child of your own  and that it was hard you should have spent so many years taking  care of some one elses prodigal just you think this  you have  been for a great deal in my life you have made much that there is  in me just as surely as if you had conceived me and there are  sons who are more ungrateful to their own mothers than i am to you   for i am not ungrateful my dear cummy and it is with a very  sincere emotion that i write myself your little boy  louis    letter  to charles baxter    dunblane friday 5th march 1872  my dear baxter  by the date you may perhaps understand the  purport of my letter without any words wasted about the matter  i  cannot walk with you tomorrow and you must not expect me  i came  yesterday afternoon to bridge of allan and have been very happy  ever since as every place is sanctified by the eighth sense  memory  i walked up here this morning three miles tudieu a  good stretch for me and passed one of my favourite places in the  world and one that i very much affect in spirit when the body is  tied down and brought immovably to anchor on a sickbed  it is a  meadow and bank on a corner on the river and is connected in my  mind inseparably with virgils eclogues  hic corulis mistos inter  consedimus ulmos or something very like that the passage begins  only i know my shortwinded latinity must have come to grief over  even this much of quotation and here to a wish is just such a  cavern as menalcas might shelter himself withal from the bright  noon and with his lips curled backward pipe himself blue in the  face while messieurs les arcadiens would roll out those cloying  hexameters that sing themselves in ones mouth to such a curious  lifting chant  in such weather one has the birds need to whistle and i who am  specially incompetent in this art must content myself by  chattering away to you on this bit of paper  all the way along i  was thanking god that he had made me and the birds and everything  just as they are and not otherwise for although there was no sun  the air was so thrilled with robins and blackbirds that it made the  heart tremble with joy and the leaves are far enough forward on  the underwood to give a fine promise for the future  even myself  as i say i would not have had changed in one iota this forenoon  in spite of all my idleness and guthries lost paper which is ever  present with me  a horrible phantom  no one can be alone at home or in a quite new place  memory and  you must go hand in hand with at least decent weather if you wish  to cook up a proper dish of solitude  it is in these little  flights of mine that i get more pleasure than in anything else   now at present i am supremely uneasy and restless  almost to the  extent of pain but o how i enjoy it and how i shall enjoy it  afterwards please god if i get years enough allotted to me for  the thing to ripen in  when i am a very old and very respectable  citizen with white hair and bland manners and a gold watch i shall  hear three crows cawing in my heart as i heard them this morning   i vote for old age and eighty years of retrospect  yet after all  i dare say a short shrift and a nice green grave are about as  desirable  poor devil how i am wearying you  cheer up  two pages more and  my letter reaches its term for i have no more paper  what  delightful things inns and waiters and bagmen are  if we didnt  travel now and then we should forget what the feeling of life is   the very cushion of a railway carriage  the things restorative to  the touch  i cant write confound it  thats because i am so  tired with my walk  believe me ever your affectionate friend  r l stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    dunblane tuesday 9th april 1872  my dear baxter  i dont know what you mean  i know nothing about  the standing committee of the spec did not know that such a body  existed and even if it doth exist must sadly repudiate all  association with such goodly fellowship  i am a rural  voluptuary at present  that is what is the matter with me  the  spec may go whistle  as for c baxter esq who is he  one  baxter or bagster a secretary i say to mine acquaintance is  at present disquieting my leisure with certain illegal  uncharitable unchristian and unconstitutional documents called  business letters  the affair is in the hands of the police  do  you hear that you evildoer  sending business letters is surely a  far more hateful and slimy degree of wickedness than sending  threatening letters the man who throws grenades and torpedoes is  less malicious the devil in redhot hell rubs his hands with glee  as he reckons up the number that go forth spreading pain and  anxiety with each delivery of the post  i have been walking today by a colonnade of beeches along the  brawling allan  my character for sanity is quite gone seeing that  i cheered my lonely way with the following in a triumphant chaunt   thank god for the grass and the firtrees and the crows and the  sheep and the sunshine and the shadows of the firtrees  i hold  that he is a poor mean devil who can walk alone in such a place  and in such weather and doesnt set up his lungs and cry back to  the birds and the river  follow follow follow me  come hither  come hither come hither  here shall you see  no enemy  except a  very slight remnant of winter and its rough weather  my bedroom  when i awoke this morning was full of birdsongs which is the  greatest pleasure in life  come hither come hither come hither  and when you come bring the third part of the earthly paradise you  can get it for me in elliots for two and tenpence 2s 10d  business habits  also bring an ounce of honeydew from wilsons  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    brussels thursday 25th july 1872  my dear mother  i am here at last sitting in my room without  coat or waistcoat and with both window and door open and yet  perspiring like a terracotta jug or a gruyere cheese  we had a very good passage which we certainly deserved in  compensation for having to sleep on cabin floor and finding  absolutely nothing fit for human food in the whole filthy  embarkation  we made up for lost time by sleeping on deck a good  part of the forenoon  when i woke simpson was still sleeping the  sleep of the just on a coil of ropes and as appeared afterwards  his own hat so i got a bottle of bass and a pipe and laid hold of  an old frenchman of somewhat filthy aspect fiat experimentum in  corpore vili to try my french upon  i made very heavy weather of  it  the frenchman had a very pretty young wife but my french  always deserted me entirely when i had to answer her and so she  soon drew away and left me to her lord who talked of french  politics africa and domestic economy with great vivacity  from  ostend a smokinghot journey to brussels  at brussels we went off  after dinner to the parc  if any person wants to be happy i  should advise the parc  you sit drinking iced drinks and smoking  penny cigars under great old trees  the band place covered walks  etc are all lit up  and you cant fancy how beautiful was the  contrast of the great masses of lamplit foliage and the dark  sapphire night sky with just one blue star set overhead in the  middle of the largest patch  in the dark walks too there are  crowds of people whose faces you cannot see and here and there a  colossal white statue at the corner of an alley that gives the  place a nice artificial eighteenth century sentiment  there was  a good deal of summer lightning blinking overhead and the black  avenues and white statues leapt out every minute into shortlived  distinctness  i get up to add one thing more  there is in the hotel a boy in  whom i take the deepest interest  i cannot tell you his age but  the very first time i saw him when i was at dinner yesterday i  was very much struck with his appearance  there is something very  leonine in his face with a dash of the negro especially if i  remember aright in the mouth  he has a great quantity of dark  hair curling in great rolls not in little corkscrews and a pair  of large dark and very steady bold bright eyes  his manners  are those of a prince  i felt like an overgrown ploughboy beside  him  he speaks english perfectly but with i think sufficient  foreign accent to stamp him as a russian especially when his  manners are taken into account  i dont think i ever saw any one  who looked like a hero before  after breakfast this morning i was  talking to him in the court when he mentioned casually that he had  caught a snake in the riesengebirge  i have it here he said  would you like to see it  i said yes and putting his hand into  his breastpocket he drew forth not a dried serpent skin but the  head and neck of the reptile writhing and shooting out its horrible  tongue in my face  you may conceive what a fright i got  i send  off this single sheet just now in order to let you know i am safe  across but you must not expect letters often  r l stevenson  ps  the snake was about a yard long but harmless and now he  says quite tame    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    hotel landsberg frankfurt monday 29th july 1872   last night i met with rather an amusing adventurette  seeing a  church door open i went in and was led by most importunate  fingerbills up a long stair to the top of the tower  the father  smoking at the door the mother and the three daughters received me  as if i was a friend of the family and had come in for an evening  visit  the youngest daughter about thirteen i suppose and a  pretty little girl had been learning english at the school and  was anxious to play it off upon a real veritable englander so we  had a long talk and i was shown photographs etc marie and i  talking and the others looking on with evident delight at having  such a linguist in the family  as all my remarks were duly  translated and communicated to the rest it was quite a good german  lesson  there was only one contretemps during the whole interview   the arrival of another visitor in the shape surely the last of  gods creatures a woodworm of the most unnatural and hideous  appearance with one great striped horn sticking out of his nose  like a boltsprit  if there are many woodworms in germany i shall  come home  the most courageous men in the world must be  entomologists  i had rather be a liontamer  today i got rather a curiosity  lieder und balladen von robert  burns translated by one silbergleit and not so ill done either   armed with which i had a swim in the main and then bread and  cheese and bavarian beer in a sort of cafe or at least the german  substitute for a cafe but what a falling off after the heavenly  forenoons in brussels  i have bought a meerschaum out of local sentiment and am now very  low and nervous about the bargain having paid dearer than i should  in england and got a worse article if i can form a judgment  do write some more somebody  tomorrow i expect i shall go into  lodgings as this hotel work makes the money disappear like butter  in a furnace  meanwhile believe me ever your affectionate son  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    hotel landsberg thursday 1st august 1872   yesterday i walked to eckenheim a village a little way out of  frankfurt and turned into the alehouse  in the room which was  just such as it would have been in scotland were the landlady two  neighbours and an old peasant eating raw sausage at the far end   i soon got into conversation and was astonished when the landlady  having asked whether i were an englishman and received an answer  in the affirmative proceeded to inquire further whether i were not  also a scotchman  it turned out that a scotch doctor  a professor   a poet  who wrote books  gross wie das  had come nearly every  day out of frankfurt to the eckenheimer wirthschaft and had left  behind him a most savoury memory in the hearts of all its  customers  one man ran out to find his name for me and returned  with the news that it was cobie scobie i suspect and during his  absence the rest were pouring into my ears the fame and  acquirements of my countryman  he was in some undecipherable  manner connected with the queen of england and one of the  princesses  he had been in turkey and had there married a wife of  immense wealth  they could find apparently no measure adequate to  express the size of his books  in one way or another he had  amassed a princely fortune and had apparently only one sorrow his  daughter to wit who had absconded into a kloster with a  considerable slice of the mothers geld  i told them we had no  klosters in scotland with a certain feeling of superiority  no  more had they i was told  hier ist unser kloster and the  speaker motioned with both arms round the taproom  although the  first torrent was exhausted yet the doctor came up again in all  sorts of ways and with or without occasion throughout the whole  interview as for example when one man taking his pipe out of  his mouth and shaking his head remarked apropos of nothing and  with almost defiant conviction er war ein feiner mann der herr  doctor and was answered by another with yaw yaw und trank  immer rothen wein  setting aside the doctor who had evidently turned the brains of  the entire village they were intelligent people  one thing in  particular struck me their honesty in admitting that here they  spoke bad german and advising me to go to coburg or leipsic for  german  sie sprechen da rein clean said one and they all  nodded their heads together like as many mandarins and repeated  rein so rein in chorus  of course we got upon scotland  the hostess said die  schottlander trinken gern schnapps which may be freely  translated scotchmen are horrid fond of whisky  it was  impossible of course to combat such a truism and so i proceeded  to explain the construction of toddy interrupted by a cry of  horror when i mentioned the hot water and thence as i find is  always the case to the most ghastly romancing about scottish  scenery and manners the highland dress and everything national or  local that i could lay my hands upon  now that i have got my  german burns i lean a good deal upon him for opening a  conversation and read a few translations to every yawning audience  that i can gather  i am grown most insufferably national you see   i fancy it is a punishment for my want of it at ordinary times   now what do you think there was a waiter in this very hotel but  alas he is now gone who sang from morning to night as my  informant said with a shrug at the recollection what but s ist  lange her the german version of auld lang syne so you see  madame the finest lyric ever written will make its way out of  whatsoever corner of patois it found its birth in   meitz herz ist im hochland mean herz ist nicht hier mein herz ist im hochland im grunen revier im grunen reviere zu jagen das reh mein herz ist im hochland wo immer ich geh   i dont think i need translate that for you  there is one thing that burthens me a good deal in my patriotic  garrulage and that is the black ignorance in which i grope about  everything as for example when i gave yesterday a full and i  fancy a startlingly incorrect account of scotch education to a  very stolid german on a garden bench  he sat and perspired under  it however with much composure  i am generally glad enough to  fall back again after these political interludes upon burns  toddy and the highlands  i go every night to the theatre except when there is no opera  i  cannot stand a play yet but i am already very much improved and  can understand a good deal of what goes on  friday august 2 1872  in the evening at the theatre i had a  great laugh  lord allcash in fra diavolo with his white hat red  guidebooks and bad german was the piecederesistance from a  humorous point of view and i had the satisfaction of knowing that  in my own small way i could minister the same amusement whenever i  chose to open my mouth  i am just going off to do some german with simpson  your  affectionate son  r l stevenson    letter  to thomas stevenson    frankfurt rosengasse 13 august 4 1872  my dear father  you will perceive by the head of this page that  we have at last got into lodgings and powerfully mean ones too   if i were to call the street anything but shady i should be  boasting  the people sit at their doors in shirtsleeves smoking  as they do in seven dials of a sunday  last night we went to bed about ten for the first time  householders in germany  real teutons with no deception spring  or false bottom  about halfpast one there began such a  trumpeting shouting pealing of bells and scurrying hither and  thither of feet as woke every person in frankfurt out of their  first sleep with a vague sort of apprehension that the last day was  at hand  the whole street was alive and we could hear people  talking in their rooms or crying to passersby from their windows  all around us  at last i made out what a man was saying in the  next room  it was a fire in sachsenhausen he said sachsenhausen  is the suburb on the other side of the main and he wound up with  one of the most tremendous falsehoods on record hier alles ruht   here all is still  if it can be said to be still in an engine  factory or in the stomach of a volcano when it is meditating an  eruption he might have been justified in what he said but not  otherwise  the tumult continued unabated for near an hour but as  one grew used to it it gradually resolved itself into three bells  answering each other at short intervals across the town a man  shouting at ever shorter intervals and with superhuman energy  feuer  im sachsenhausen and the almost continuous winding of  all manner of bugles and trumpets sometimes in stirring  flourishes and sometimes in mere tuneless wails  occasionally  there was another rush of feet past the window and once there was  a mighty drumming down between us and the river as though the  soldiery were turning out to keep the peace  this was all we had  of the fire except a great cloud all flushed red with the glare  above the roofs on the other side of the gasse but it was quite  enough to put me entirely off my sleep and make me keenly alive to  three or four gentlemen who were strolling leisurely about my  person and every here and there leaving me somewhat as a keepsake     however everything has its compensation and when day came  at last and the sparrows awoke with trills and carolets the dawn  seemed to fall on me like a sleeping draught  i went to the window  and saw the sparrows about the eaves and a great troop of doves go  strolling up the paven gasse seeking what they may devour  and so  to sleep despite fleas and firealarms and clocks chiming the  hours out of neighbouring houses at all sorts of odd times and with  the most charming want of unanimity  we have got settled down in frankfurt and like the place very  much  simpson and i seem to get on very well together  we suit  each other capitally and it is an awful joke to be living two  wouldbe advocates and one a baronet in this supremely mean  abode  the abode is however a great improvement on the hotel and i  think we shall grow quite fond of it  ever your affectionate son  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    13 rosengasse frankfurt tuesday morning august 1872     last night i was at the theatre and heard die judin la  juive and was thereby terribly excited  at last in the middle  of the fifth act which was perfectly beastly i had to slope  i  could stand even seeing the cauldron with the sham fire beneath  and the two hateful executioners in red but when at last the  girls courage breaks down and grasping her fathers arm she  cries out  o so shudderfully  i thought it high time to be out  of that galere and so i do not know yet whether it ends well or  ill but if i ever afterwards find that they do carry things to the  extremity i shall think more meanly of my species  it was raining  and cold outside so i went into a bierhalle and sat and brooded  over a schnitt halfglass for nearly an hour  an opera is far  more real than real life to me  it seems as if stage illusion and  particularly this hardest to swallow and most conventional illusion  of them all  an opera  would never stale upon me  i wish that  life was an opera  i should like to live in one but i dont know  in what quarter of the globe i shall find a society so constituted   besides it would soon pall  imagine asking for threekreuzer  cigars in recitative or giving the washerwoman the inventory of  your dirty clothes in a sustained and flourishous aria  i am in a right good mood this morning to sit here and write to  you but not to give you news  there is a great stir of life in a  quiet almost country fashion all about us here  some one is  hammering a beefsteak in the rezdechaussee  there is a great  clink of pitchers and noise of the pumphandle at the public well  in the little squarekin round the corner  the children all  seemingly within a month and certainly none above five that  always go halting and stumbling up and down the roadway are  ordinarily very quiet and sit sedately puddling in the gutter  trying i suppose poor little devils to understand their  muttersprache but they too make themselves heard from time to  time in little incomprehensible antiphonies about the drift that  comes down to them by their rivers from the strange lands higher up  the gasse  above all there is here such a twittering of canaries  i can see twelve out of our window and such continual visitation  of grey doves and bignosed sparrows as make our little byestreet  into a perfect aviary  i look across the gasse at our opposite neighbour as he dandles  his baby about and occasionally takes a spoonful or two of some  pale slimy nastiness that looks like dead porridge if you can take  the conception  these two are his only occupations  all day long  you can hear him singing over the brat when he is not eating or  see him eating when he is not keeping baby  besides which there  comes into his house a continual round of visitors that puts me in  mind of the luncheon hour at home  as he has thus no ostensible  avocation we have named him the ws to give a flavour of  respectability to the street  enough of the gasse  the weather is here much colder  it rained a  good deal yesterday and though it is fair and sunshiny again to day and we can still sit of course with our windows open yet  there is no more excuse for the siesta and the bathe in the river  except for cleanliness is no longer a necessity of life  the main  is very swift  in one part of the baths it is next door to  impossible to swim against it and i suspect that out in the open  it would be quite impossible  adieu my dear mother and believe  me ever your affectionate son  robert louis stevenson  rentier    letter  to charles baxter    17 heriot row edinburgh sunday february 2 1873  my dear baxter  the thunderbolt has fallen with a vengeance now   on friday night after leaving you in the course of conversation  my father put me one or two questions as to beliefs which i  candidly answered  i really hate all lying so much now  a new  found honesty that has somehow come out of my late illness  that i  could not so much as hesitate at the time but if i had foreseen  the real hell of everything since i think i should have lied as i  have done so often before  i so far thought of my father but i  had forgotten my mother  and now they are both ill both silent  both as down in the mouth as if  i can find no simile  you may  fancy how happy it is for me  if it were not too late i think i  could almost find it in my heart to retract but it is too late  and again am i to live my whole life as one falsehood  of course  it is rougher than hell upon my father but can i help it  they  dont see either that my game is not the lighthearted scoffer  that i am not as they call me a careless infidel  i believe as  much as they do only generally in the inverse ratio  i am i  think as honest as they can be in what i hold  i have not come  hastily to my views  i reserve as i told them many points until  i acquire fuller information and do not think i am thus justly to  be called horrible atheist  now what is to take place  what a curse i am to my parents  o  lord what a pleasant thing it is to have just damned the happiness  of probably the only two people who care a damn about you in the  world  what is my life to be at this rate  what you rascal  answer  i  have a pistol at your throat  if all that i hold true and most  desire to spread is to be such death and a worse than death in  the eyes of my father and mother what the devil am i to do  here is a good heavy cross with a vengeance and all rough with  rusty nails that tear your fingers only it is not i that have to  carry it alone i hold the light end but the heavy burden falls on  these two  dont  i dont know what i was going to say  i am an abject  idiot which all things considered is not remarkable  ever your

july 28 1873  my dear mother  i am too happy to be much of a correspondent   yesterday we were away to melford and lavenham both exceptionally  placid beautiful old english towns  melford scattered all round a  big green with an elizabethan hall and park great screens of  trees that seem twice as high as trees should seem and everything  else like what ought to be in a novel and what one never expects  to see in reality made me cry out how good we were to live in  scotland for the many hundredth time  i cannot get over my  astonishment  indeed it increases every day  at the hopeless  gulf that there is between england and scotland and english and  scotch  nothing is the same and i feel as strange and outlandish  here as i do in france or germany  everything by the wayside in  the houses or about the people strikes me with an unexpected  unfamiliarity  i walk among surprises for just where you think  you have them something wrong turns up  i got a little law read yesterday and some german this morning  but on the whole there are too many amusements going for much work  as for correspondence i have neither heart nor time for it today  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    17 heriot row edinburgh saturday september 6 1873  i have been today a very long walk with my father through some of  the most beautiful ways hereabouts the day was cold with an iron  windy sky and only glorified now and then with autumn sunlight   for it is fully autumn with us with a blight already over the  greens and a keen wind in the morning that makes one rather timid  of ones tub when it finds its way indoors  i was out this evening to call on a friend and coming back  through the wet crowded lamplit streets was singing after my  own fashion du hast diamanten und perlen when i heard a poor  cripple man in the gutter wailing over a pitiful scotch air his  clubfoot supported on the other knee and his whole woebegone body  propped sideways against a crutch  the nearest lamp threw a strong  light on his worn sordid face and the three boxes of lucifer  matches that he held for sale  my own false notes stuck in my  chest  how well off i am is the burthen of my songs all day long   drum ist so wohl mir in der welt and the ugly reality of the  cripple man was an intrusion on the beautiful world in which i was  walking  he could no more sing than i could and his voice was  cracked and rusty and altogether perished  to think that that  wreck may have walked the streets some night years ago as glad at  heart as i was and promising himself a future as golden and  honourable  sunday 1120 am  i wonder what you are doing now  in church  likely at the te deum  everything here is utterly silent  i can  hear mens footfalls streets away the whole life of edinburgh has  been sucked into sundry pious edifices the gardens below my  windows are steeped in a diffused sunlight and every tree seems  standing on tiptoes strained and silent as though to get its head  above its neighbours and listen  you know what i mean dont you   how trees do seem silently to assert themselves on an occasion  i  have been trying to write roads until i feel as if i were standing  on my head but i mean roads and shall do something to them  i wish i could make you feel the hush that is over everything only  made the more perfect by rare interruptions and the rich placid  light and the still autumnal foliage  houses you know stand  all about our gardens  solid steady blocks of houses all look  empty and asleep  monday night  the drums and fifes up in the castle are sounding  the guardcall through the dark and there is a great rattle of  carriages without  i have had i must tell you my bed taken out  of this room so that i am alone in it with my books and two  tables and two chairs and a coalskuttle or scuttle  and a  debris of broken pipes in a corner and my old school playbox so  full of papers and books that the lid will not shut down standing  reproachfully in the midst  there is something in it that is still  a little gaunt and vacant it needs a little populous disorder over  it to give it the feel of homeliness and perhaps a bit more  furniture just to take the edge off the sense of illimitable  space eternity and a future state and the like that is brought  home to one even in this small attic by the wide empty floor  you would require to know what only i can ever know many grim and  many maudlin passages out of my past life to feel how great a  change has been made for me by this past summer  let me be ever so  poor and threadpaper a soul i am going to try for the best  these good booksellers of mine have at last got a werther without  illustrations  i want you to like charlotte  werther himself has  every feebleness and vice that could tend to make his suicide a  most virtuous and commendable action and yet i like werther too   i dont know why except that he has written the most delightful  letters in the world  note by the way the passage under date  june 21st not far from the beginning it finds a voice for a great  deal of dumb uneasy pleasurable longing that we have all had  times without number  i looked that up the other day for roads so  i know the reference but you will find it a garden of flowers from  beginning to end  all through the passion keeps steadily rising  from the thunderstorm at the countryhouse  there was thunder in  that story too  up to the last wild delirious interview either  lotte was no good at all or else werther should have remained  alive after that either he knew his woman too well or else he was  precipitate  but an idiot like that is hopeless and yet he  wasnt an idiot  i make reparation and will offer eighteen pounds  of best wax at his tomb  poor devil he was only the weakest  or  at least a very weak strong man  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    17 heriot row edinburgh friday september 12 1873     i was over last night contrary to my own wish in leven  fife and this morning i had a conversation of which i think some  account might interest you  i was up with a cousin who was fishing  in a milllade and a shower of rain drove me for shelter into a  tumbledown steading attached to the mill  there i found a labourer  cleaning a byre with whom i fell into talk  the man was to all  appearance as heavy as hebete as any english clodhopper but i  knew i was in scotland and launched out forthright into education  and politics and the aims of ones life  i told him how i had  found the peasantry in suffolk and added that their state had made  me feel quite pained and downhearted  it but to do that he  said to onybody that thinks at a  then again he said that he  could not conceive how anything could daunt or cast down a man who  had an aim in life  they that have had a guid schoolin and do  nae mair whatever they do they have done but him that has aye  something ayont need never be weary  i have had to mutilate the  dialect much so that it might be comprehensible to you but i  think the sentiment will keep even through a change of words  something of the heartsome ring of encouragement that it had for  me  and that from a man cleaning a byre  you see what john knox  and his schools have done  saturday  this has been a charming day for me from morning to now  5 pm  first i found your letter and went down and read it on  a seat in those public gardens of which you have heard already   after lunch my father and i went down to the coast and walked a  little way along the shore between granton and cramond  this has  always been with me a very favourite walk  the firth closes  gradually together before you the coast runs in a series of the  most beautifully moulded bays hill after hill wooded and softly  outlined trends away in front till the two shores join together   when the tide is out there are great gleaming flats of wet sand  over which the gulls go flying and crying and every cape runs down  into them with its little spit of wall and trees  we lay together  a long time on the beach the sea just babbled among the stones  and at one time we heard the hollow sturdy beat of the paddles of  an unseen steamer somewhere round the cape  i am glad to say that  the peace of the day and scenery was not marred by any  unpleasantness between us two  i am unhappily off my style and can do nothing well indeed i  fear i have marred roads finally by patching at it when i was out  of the humour  only i am beginning to see something great about  john knox and queen mary  i like them both so much that i feel as  if i could write the history fairly  i have finished roads today and send it off to you to see  the  lord knows whether it is worth anything  some of it pleases me a  good deal but i fear it is quite unfit for any possible magazine   however i wish you to see it as you know the humour in which it  was conceived walking alone and very happily about the suffolk  highways and byeways on several splendid sunny afternoons   believe me ever your faithful friend  robert louis stevenson  monday  i have looked over roads again and i am aghast at its  feebleness  it is the trial of a very prentice hand indeed   shall i ever learn to do anything well  however it shall go to  you for the reasons given above    letter  to mrs sitwell    edinburgh tuesday september 16 1873     i must be very strong to have all this vexation and still to  be well  i was weighed the other day and the gross weight of my  large person was eight stone six  does it not seem surprising that  i can keep the lamp alight through all this gusty weather in so  frail a lantern  and yet it burns cheerily  my mother is leaving for the country this morning and my father  and i will be alone for the best part of the week in this house   then on friday i go south to dumfries till monday  i must write  small or i shall have a tremendous budget by then  720 pm  i must tell you a thing i saw today  i was going down  to portobello in the train when there came into the next  compartment third class an artisan strongly marked with  smallpox and with sunken heavy eyes  a face hard and unkind and  without anything lovely  there was a woman on the platform seeing  him off  at first sight with her one eye blind and the whole cast  of her features strongly plebeian and even vicious she seemed as  unpleasant as the man but there was something beautifully soft a  sort of light of tenderness as on some dutch madonna that came  over her face when she looked at the man  they talked for a while  together through the window the man seemed to have been asking  money  ye ken the last time she said i gave ye two shillins  for your ludgin and ye said   it died off into whisper   plainly falstaff and dame quickly over again  the man laughed  unpleasantly even cruelly and said something and the woman  turned her back on the carriage and stood a long while so and do  what i might i could catch no glimpse of her expression although  i thought i saw the heave of a sob in her shoulders  at last  after the train was already in motion she turned round and put two  shillings into his hand  i saw her stand and look after us with a  perfect heaven of love on her face  this poor oneeyed madonna   until the train was out of sight but the man sordidly happy with  his gains did not put himself to the inconvenience of one glance  to thank her for her illdeserved kindness  i have been up at the spec and looked out a reference i wanted   the whole town is drowned in white wet vapour off the sea   everything drips and soaks  the very statues seem wet to the skin   i cannot pretend to be very cheerful i did not see one contented  face in the streets and the poor did look so helplessly chill and  dripping without a stitch to change or so much as a fire to dry  themselves at or perhaps money to buy a meal or perhaps even a  bed  my heart shivers for them  dumfries friday  all my thirst for a little warmth a little  sun a little corner of blue sky avails nothing  without the rain  falls with a long drawn swish and the night is as dark as a vault   there is no wind indeed and that is a blessed change after the  unruly bedlamite gusts that have been charging against one round  street corners and utterly abolishing and destroying all that is  peaceful in life  nothing sours my temper like these coarse  termagant winds  i hate practical joking and your vulgarest  practical joker is your flaw of wind  i have tried to write some verses but i find i have nothing to say  that has not been already perfectly said and perfectly sung in  adelaide  i have so perfect an idea out of that song  the great  alps a wonder in the starlight  the river strong from the hills  and turbulent and loudly audible at night  the country a scented  fruhlingsgarten of orchards and deep wood where the nightingales  harbour  a sort of german flavour over all  and this lovedrunken  man wandering on by sleeping village and silent town pours out of  his full heart einst o wunder einst etc  i wonder if i am  wrong about this being the most beautiful and perfect thing in the  world  the only marriage of really accordant words and music   both drunk with the same poignant unutterable sentiment  today in glasgow my father went off on some business and my  mother and i wandered about for two hours  we had lunch together  and were very merry over what the people at the restaurant would  think of us  mother and son they could not suppose us to be  saturday  and today it came  warmth sunlight and a strong  hearty living wind among the trees  i found myself a new being   my father and i went off a long walk through a country most  beautifully wooded and various under a range of hills  you should  have seen one place where the wood suddenly fell away in front of  us down a long steep hill between a double row of trees with one  small fairhaired child framed in shadow in the foreground and  when we got to the foot there was the little kirk and kirkyard of  irongray among broken fields and woods by the side of the bright  rapid river  in the kirkyard there was a wonderful congregation of  tombstones upright and recumbent on four legs after our scotch  fashion and of flatarmed firtrees  one gravestone was erected  by scott at a cost i learn of 70 pounds to the poor woman who  served him as heroine in the heart of midlothian and the  inscription in its stiff jedediah cleishbotham fashion is not  without something touching  we went up the stream a little further  to where two covenanters lie buried in an oakwood the tombstone  as the custom is containing the details of their grim little  tragedy in funnily bad rhyme one verse of which sticks in my  memory   we died their furious rage to stay near to the kirk of irongray   we then fetched a long compass round about through holywood kirk  and lincluden ruins to dumfries  but the walk came sadly to grief  as a pleasure excursion before our return     sunday  another beautiful day  my father and i walked into  dumfries to church  when the service was done i noted the two  halberts laid against the pillar of the churchyard gate and as i  had not seen the little weekly pomp of civic dignitaries in our  scotch country towns for some years i made my father wait  you  should have seen the provost and three bailies going stately away  down the sunlit street and the two town servants strutting in  front of them in red coats and cocked hats and with the halberts  most conspicuously shouldered  we saw burnss house  a place that  made me deeply sad  and spent the afternoon down the banks of the  nith  i had not spent a day by a river since we lunched in the  meadows near sudbury  the air was as pure and clear and sparkling  as spring water beautiful graceful outlines of hill and wood shut  us in on every side and the swift brown river fled smoothly away  from before our eyes rippled over with oily eddies and dimples   white gulls had come up from the sea to fish and hovered and flew  hither and thither among the loops of the stream  by good fortune  too it was a dead calm between my father and me  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    edinburgh saturday october 4 1873  it is a little sharp today but bright and sunny with a sparkle in  the air which is delightful after four days of unintermitting  rain  in the streets i saw two men meet after a long separation  it was plain  they came forward with a little run and leaped at  each others hands  you never saw such bright eyes as they both  had  it put one in a good humour to see it   8 pm  i made a little more out of my work than i have made for a  long while back though even now i cannot make things fall into  sentences  they only sprawl over the paper in bald orphan clauses   then i was about in the afternoon with baxter and we had a good  deal of fun first rhyming on the names of all the shops we passed  and afterwards buying needles and quack drugs from openair  vendors and taking much pleasure in their inexhaustible eloquence   every now and then as we went arthurs seat showed its head at the  end of a street  now today the blue sky and the sunshine were  both entirely wintry and there was about the hill in these  glimpses a sort of thin unreal crystalline distinctness that i  have not often seen excelled  as the sun began to go down over the  valley between the new town and the old the evening grew  resplendent all the gardens and lowlying buildings sank back and  became almost invisible in a mist of wonderful sun and the castle  stood up against the sky as thin and sharp in outline as a castle  cut out of paper  baxter made a good remark about princes street  that it was the most elastic street for length that he knew  sometimes it looks as it looked tonight interminable a way  leading right into the heart of the red sundown sometimes again  it shrinks together as if for warmth on one of the withering  clear eastwindy days until it seems to lie underneath your feet  i want to let you see these verses from an ode to the cuckoo  written by one of the ministers of leith in the middle of last  century  the palmy days of edinburgh  who was a friend of hume  and adam smith and the whole constellation  the authorship of  these beautiful verses has been most truculently fought about but  whoever wrote them and it seems as if this logan had they are  lovely    what time the pea puts on the bloom thou fliest the vocal vale an annual guest in other lands another spring to hail  sweet bird thy bower is ever green thy sky is ever clear thou hast no sorrow in thy song no winter in thy year  o could i fly id fly with thee wed make on joyful wing our annual visit oer the globe companions of the spring   sunday  i have been at church with my mother where we heard  arise shine sung excellently well and my mother was so much  upset with it that she nearly had to leave church  this was the  antidote however to fifty minutes of solid sermon varra heavy   i have been sticking in to walt whitman nor do i think i have ever  laboured so hard to attain so small a success  still the thing is  taking shape i think i know a little better what i want to say  all through and in process of time possibly i shall manage to say  it  i must say i am a very bad workman mais jai du courage i am  indefatigable at rewriting and bettering and surely that humble  quality should get me on a little  monday october 6  it is a magnificent glimmering moonlight  night with a wild great west wind abroad flapping above one like  an immense banner and every now and again swooping furiously  against my windows  the wind is too strong perhaps and the trees  are certainly too leafless for much of that wide rustle that we  both remember there is only a sharp angry sibilant hiss like  breath drawn with the strength of the elements through shut teeth  that one hears between the gusts only  i am in excellent humour  with myself for i have worked hard and not altogether fruitlessly  and i wished before i turned in just to tell you that things were  so  my dear friend i feel so happy when i think that you remember  me kindly  i have been up tonight lecturing to a friend on life  and duties and what a man could do a coal off the altar had been  laid on my lips and i talked quite above my average and hope i  spread what you would wish to see spread into one persons heart  and with a new light upon it  i shall tell you a story  last friday i went down to portobello  in the heavy rain with an uneasy wind blowing par rafales off the  sea or en rafales should it be or what  as i got down near  the beach a poor woman oldish and seemingly lately at least  respectable followed me and made signs  she was drenched to the  skin and looked wretched below wretchedness  you know i did not  like to look back at her it seemed as if she might misunderstand  and be terribly hurt and slighted so i stood at the end of the  street  there was no one else within sight in the wet  and lifted  up my hand very high with some money in it  i heard her steps draw  heavily near behind me and when she was near enough to see i let  the money fall in the mud and went off at my best walk without ever  turning round  there is nothing in the story and yet you will  understand how much there is if one chose to set it forth  you  see she was so ugly and you know there is something terribly  miserably pathetic in a certain smile a certain sodden aspect of  invitation on such faces  it is so terrible that it is in a way  sacred it means the outside of degradation and what is worst of  all in life false position  i hope you understand me rightly   ever your faithful friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    edinburgh tuesday october 14 1873  my father has returned in better health and i am more delighted  than i can well tell you  the one trouble that i can see no way  through is that his health or my mothers should give way  to night as i was walking along princes street i heard the bugles  sound the recall  i do not think i had ever remarked it before  there is something of unspeakable appeal in the cadence  i felt as  if something yearningly cried to me out of the darkness overhead to  come thither and find rest one felt as if there must be warm  hearts and bright fires waiting for one up there where the buglers  stood on the damp pavement and sounded their friendly invitation  forth into the night  wednesday  i may as well tell you exactly about my health  i am  not at all ill have quite recovered only i am what mm les  medecins call below par which in plain english is that i am  weak  with tonics decent weather and a little cheerfulness that  will go away in its turn and i shall be all right again  i am glad to hear what you say about the exam until quite lately  i have treated that pretty cavalierly for i say honestly that i do  not mind being plucked i shall just have to go up again  we  travelled with the lord advocate the other day and he strongly  advised me in my fathers hearing to go to the english bar and the  lord advocates advice goes a long way in scotland  it is a sort  of special legal revelation  dont misunderstand me  i dont of  course want to be plucked but so far as my style of knowledge  suits them i cannot make much betterment on it in a month  if  they wish scholarship more exact i must take a new lease  altogether  thursday  my head and eyes both gave in this morning and i had  to take a day of complete idleness  i was in the open air all day  and did no thought that i could avoid and i think i have got my  head between my shoulders again however i am not going to do  much  i dont want you to run away with any fancy about my being  ill  given a person weak and in some trouble and working longer  hours than he is used to and you have the matter in a nutshell   you should have seen the sunshine on the hill today it has lost  now that crystalline clearness as if the medium were springwater  you see i am stupid but it retains that wonderful thinness of  outline that makes the delicate shape and hue savour better in  ones mouth like fine wine out of a finelyblown glass  the birds  are all silent now but the crows  i sat a long time on the stairs  that lead down to duddingston loch  a place as busy as a great  town during frost but now solitary and silent and when i shut my  eyes i heard nothing but the wind in the trees and you know all  that went through me i dare say without my saying it  ii  i am now all right  i do not expect any tic tonight and  shall be at work again tomorrow  i have had a day of open air  only a little modified by le capitaine fracasse before the dining room fire  i must write no more for i am sleepy after two nights  and to quote my book sinon blanches du moins grises and so i  must go to bed and faithfully hoggishly slumber  your faithful  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    mentone november 13 1873  my dear mother  the place is not where i thought it is about  where the old post office was  the hotel de londres is no more an  hotel  i have found a charming room in the hotel du pavillon just  across the road from the princes villa it has one window to the  south and one to the east with a superb view of mentone and the  hills to which i move this afternoon  in the old great place  there is a kiosque for the sale of newspapers a string of  omnibuses perhaps thirty go up and down under the planetrees of  the turin road on the occasion of each train the promenade has  crossed both streams and bids fair to reach the cap st martin   the old chapel near freemans house at the entrance to the gorbio  valley is now entirely submerged under a shining new villa with  pavilion annexed over which in all the pride of oak and chestnut  and divers coloured marbles i was shown this morning by the  obliging proprietor  the princes palace itself is rehabilitated  and shines afar with white windowcurtains from the midst of a  garden all trim borders and greenhouses and carefully kept walks   on the other side the villas are more thronged together and they  have arranged themselves shelf after shelf behind each other  i  see the glimmer of new buildings too as far eastward as grimaldi  and a viaduct carries i suppose the railway past the mouth of the  bone caves  f bacon lord chancellor made the remark that time  was the greatest innovator it is perhaps as meaningless a remark  as was ever made but as bacon made it i suppose it is better than  any that i could make  does it not seem as if things were fluid   they are displaced and altered in ten years so that one has  difficulty even with a memory so very vivid and retentive for that  sort of thing as mine in identifying places where one lived a long  while in the past and which one has kept piously in mind during  all the interval  nevertheless the hills i am glad to say are  unaltered though i dare say the torrents have given them many a  shrewd scar and the rains and thaws dislodged many a boulder from  their heights if one were only keen enough to perceive it  the  sea makes the same noise in the shingle and the lemon and orange  gardens still discharge in the still air their fresh perfume and  the people have still brown comely faces and the pharmacie gros  still dispenses english medicines and the invalids eheu still  sit on the promenade and trifle with their fingers in the fringes  of shawls and wrappers and the shop of pascal amarante still in  its present bright consummate flower of aggrandisement and new  paint offers everything that it has entered into peoples hearts  to wish for in the idleness of a sanatorium and the chateau des  morts is still at the top of the town and the fort and the jetty  are still at the foot only there are now two jetties and  i am  out of breath  to be continued in our next  for myself i have come famously through the journey and as i have  written this letter for the first time for ever so long with ease  and even pleasure i think my head must be better  i am still no  good at coming down hills or stairs and my feet are more  consistently cold than is quite comfortable  but these apart i  feel well and in good spirits all round  i have written to nice for letters and hope to get them tonight   continue to address poste restante  take care of yourselves  this is my birthday by the way  o i said that before  adieu   ever your affectionate son  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    mentone sunday november 1873  my dear friend  i sat a long while up among the olive yards to day at a favourite corner where one has a fair view down the  valley and on to the blue floor of the sea  i had a horace with  me and read a little but horace when you try to read him fairly  under the open heaven sounds urban and you find something of the  escaped townsman in his descriptions of the country just as  somebody said that morriss seapieces were all taken from the  coast  i tried for long to hit upon some language that might catch  ever so faintly the indefinable shifting colour of olive leaves  and above all the changes and little silverings that pass over  them like blushes over a face when the wind tosses great branches  to and fro but the muse was not favourable  a few birds scattered  here and there at wide intervals on either side of the valley sang  the little broken songs of late autumn and there was a great stir  of insect life in the grass at my feet  the path up to this coign  of vantage where i think i shall make it a habit to ensconce  myself a while of a morning is for a little while common to the  peasant and a little clear brooklet  it is pleasant in the  tempered grey daylight of the olive shadows to see the people  picking their way among the stones and the water and the brambles  the women especially with the weights poised on their heads and  walking all from the hips with a certain graceful deliberation  tuesday  i have been to nice today to see dr bennet he agrees  with clark that there is no disease but i finished up my day with  a lamentable exhibition of weakness  i could not remember french  or at least i was afraid to go into any place lest i should not be  able to remember it and so could not tell when the train went  at  last i crawled up to the station and sat down on the steps and  just steeped myself there in the sunshine until the evening began  to fall and the air to grow chilly  this long rest put me all  right and i came home here triumphantly and ate dinner well   there is the full true and particular account of the worst day i  have had since i left london  i shall not go to nice again for  some time to come  thursday  i am today quite recovered and got into mentone to day for a book which is quite a creditable walk  as an  intellectual being i have not yet begun to reexist my immortal  soul is still very nearly extinct but we must hope the best  now  do take warning by me  i am set up by a beneficent providence at  the corner of the road to warn you to flee from the hebetude that  is to follow  being sent to the south is not much good unless you  take your soul with you you see and my soul is rarely with me  here  i dont see much beauty  i have lost the key i can only be  placid and inert and see the bright days go past uselessly one  after another therefore dont talk foolishly with your mouth any  more about getting liberty by being ill and going south via the  sickbed  it is not the old freeborn bird that gets thus to  freedom but i know not what manacled and hidebound spirit  incapable of pleasure the clay of a man  go south  why i saw  more beauty with my eyes healthfully alert to see in two wet windy  february afternoons in scotland than i can see in my beautiful  olive gardens and grey hills in a whole week in my low and lost  estate as the shorter catechism puts it somewhere  it is a  pitiable blindness this blindness of the soul i hope it may not  be long with me  so remember to keep well and remember rather  anything than not to keep well and again i say anything rather  than not to keep well  not that i am unhappy mind you  i have found the words already   placid and inert that is what i am  i sit in the sun and enjoy  the tingle all over me and i am cheerfully ready to concur with  any one who says that this is a beautiful place and i have a  sneaking partiality for the newspapers which would be all very  well if one had not fallen from heaven and were not troubled with  some reminiscence of the ineffable aurore  to sit by the sea and to be conscious of nothing but the sound of  the waves and the sunshine over all your body is not unpleasant  but i was an archangel once  friday  if you knew how old i felt  i am sure this is what age  brings with it  this carelessness this disenchantment this  continual bodily weariness  i am a man of seventy  o medea kill  me or make me young again  today has been cloudy and mild and i have lain a great while on a  bench outside the garden wall my usual place now and looked at  the dovecoloured sea and the broken roof of cloud but there was  no seeing in my eye  let us hope tomorrow will be more  profitable  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    hotel mirabeau mentone sunday january 4 1874  my dear mother  we have here fallen on the very pink of hotels   i do not say that it is more pleasantly conducted than the  pavillon for that were impossible but the rooms are so cheery and  bright and new and then the food  i never i think so fully  appreciated the phrase the fat of the land as i have done since i  have been here installed  there was a dish of eggs at dejeuner the  other day over the memory of which i lick my lips in the silent  watches  now that the cold has gone again i continue to keep well in body  and already i begin to walk a little more  my head is still a very  feeble implement and easily set aspinning and i can do nothing  in the way of work beyond reading books that may i hope be of  some use to me afterwards  i was very glad to see that mlaren was sat upon and principally  for the reason why  deploring as i do much of the action of the  trades unions these conspiracy clauses and the whole partiality of  the master and servant act are a disgrace to our equal laws  equal  laws become a byeword when what is legal for one class becomes a  criminal offence for another  it did my heart good to hear that  man tell mlaren how as he had talked much of getting the  franchise for working men he must now be content to see them use  it now they had got it  this is a smooth stone well planted in the  foreheads of certain dilettanti radicals after mlarens fashion  who are willing to give the working men words and wind and votes  and the like and yet think to keep all the advantages just or  unjust of the wealthier classes without abatement  i do hope wise  men will not attempt to fight the working men on the head of this  notorious injustice  any such step will only precipitate the  action of the newly enfranchised classes and irritate them into  acting hastily when what we ought to desire should be that they  should act warily and little for many years to come until  education and habit may make them the more fit  all this intended for my father is much after the fashion of his  own correspondence  i confess it has left my own head exhausted i  hope it may not produce the same effect on yours  but i want him  to look really into this question both sides of it and not the  representations of rabid middleclass newspapers sworn to support  all the little tyrannies of wealth and i know he will be  convinced that this is a case of unjust law and that however  desirable the end may seem to him he will not be jesuit enough to  think that any end will justify an unjust law  here ends the political sermon of your affectionate and somewhat  dogmatical son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    mentone january 7 1874  my dear mother  i received yesterday two most charming letters   the nicest i have had since i left  december 26th and january 1st   this morning i got january 3rd  into the bargain with marie the american girl who is grace  itself and comes leaping and dancing simply like a wave  like  nothing else and who yesterday was queen out of the epiphany cake  and chose robinet the french painter as her favori with the most  pretty confusion possible  into the bargain with marie we have  two little russian girls with the youngest of whom a little  polyglot button of a threeyear old i had the most laughable  little scene at lunch today  i was watching her being fed with  great amusement her face being as broad as it is long and her  mouth capable of unlimited extension when suddenly her eye  catching mine the fashion of her countenance was changed and  regarding me with a really admirable appearance of offended  dignity she said something in italian which made everybody laugh  much  it was explained to me that she had said i was very polisson  to stare at her  after this she was somewhat taken up with me and  after some examination she announced emphatically to the whole  table in german that i was a madchen which word she repeated  with shrill emphasis as though fearing that her proposition would  be called in question  madchen madchen madchen madchen  this  hasty conclusion as to my sex she was led afterwards to revise i  am informed but her new opinion which seems to have been  something nearer the truth was announced in a third language quite  unknown to me and probably russian  to complete the scroll of her  accomplishments she was brought round the table after the meal was  over and said goodbye to me in very commendable english  the weather i shall say nothing about as i am incapable of  explaining my sentiments upon that subject before a lady  but my  health is really greatly improved  i begin to recognise myself  occasionally now and again not without satisfaction  please remember me very kindly to professor swan i wish i had a  story to send him but story lord bless you i have none to tell  sir unless it is the foregoing adventure with the little polyglot   the best of that depends on the significance of polisson which is  beautifully out of place  saturday 10th january  the little russian kid is only two and a  half  she speaks six languages  she and her sister aet 8 and  may johnstone aet 8 are the delight of my life  last night i  saw them all dancing  o it was jolly kids are what is the matter  with me  after the dancing we all  that is the two russian  ladies robinet the french painter mr and mrs johnstone two  governesses and fitful kids joining us at intervals  played a  game of the stool of repentance in the gallic idiom  o  i have not told you that colvin is gone however he is coming  back again he has left clothes in pawn to me  ever your  affectionate son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    mentone tuesday 13th january 1874     i lost a philipine to little mary johnstone last night so  today i sent her a rubbishing dolls toilet and a little note  with it with some verses telling how happy children made every one  near them happy also and advising her to keep the lines and some  day when she was grown a stately demoiselle it would make her  glad to know she gave pleasure long ago all in a very lame  fashion with just a note of prose at the end telling her to mind  her doll and the dog and not trouble her little head just now to  understand the bad verses for some time when she was ill as i am  now they would be plain to her and make her happy  she has just  been here to thank me and has left me very happy  children are  certainly too good to be true  yesterday i walked too far and spent all the afternoon on the  outside of my bed went finally to rest at nine and slept nearly  twelve hours on the stretch  bennet the doctor when told of it  this morning augured well for my recovery he said youth must be  putting in strong of course i ought not to have slept at all  as  it was i dreamed horridly but not my usual dreams of social  miseries and misunderstandings and all sorts of crucifixions of the  spirit but of good cheery physical things  of long successions  of vaulted dimly lit cellars full of black water in which i went  swimming among toads and unutterable cold blind fishes  now and  then these cellars opened up into sort of domed musichall places  where one could land for a little on the slope of the orchestra  but a sort of horror prevented one from staying long and made one  plunge back again into the dead waters  then my dream changed and  i was a sort of siamese pirate on a very high deck with several  others  the ship was almost captured and we were fighting  desperately  the hideous engines we used and the perfectly  incredible carnage that we effected by means of them kept me  cheery as you may imagine especially as i felt all the time my  sympathy with the boarders and knew that i was only a prisoner  with these horrid malays  then i saw a signal being given and  knew they were going to blow up the ship  i leaped right off and  heard my captors splash in the water after me as thick as pebbles  when a bit of river bank has given way beneath the foot  i never  heard the ship blow up but i spent the rest of the night swimming  about some piles with the whole sea full of malays searching for  me with knives in their mouths  they could swim any distance under  water and every now and again just as i was beginning to reckon  myself safe a cold hand would be laid on my ankle  ugh  however my long sleep troubled as it was put me all right again  and i was able to work acceptably this morning and be very jolly  all day  this evening i have had a great deal of talk with both  the russian ladies they talked very nicely and are bright  likable women both  they come from georgia  wednesday 1030  we have all been to tea tonight at the  russians villa  tea was made out of a samovar which is something  like a small steam engine and whose principal advantage is that it  burns the fingers of all who lay their profane touch upon it   after tea madame z played russian airs very plaintive and pretty  so the evening was muscovite from beginning to end  madame gs  daughter danced a tarantella which was very pretty  whenever nelitchka cries  and she never cries except from pain   all that one has to do is to start malbrook sen vaten guerre   she cannot resist the attraction she is drawn through her sobs  into the air and in a moment there is nelly singing with the glad  look that comes into her face always when she sings and all the  tears and pain forgotten  it is wonderful before i shut this up how that child remains ever  interesting to me  nothing can stale her infinite variety and yet  it is not very various  you see her thinking what she is to do or  to say next with a funny grave air of reserve and then the face  breaks up into a smile and it is probably berecchino said with  that sudden little jump of the voice that one knows in children as  the escape of a jackinthebox and somehow i am quite happy  after that  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    mentone january 1874     last night i had a quarrel with the american on politics  it  is odd how it irritates you to hear certain political statements  made  he was excited and he began suddenly to abuse our conduct  to america  i of course admitted right and left that we had  behaved disgracefully as we had until somehow i got tired of  turning alternate cheeks and getting duly buffeted and when he  said that the alabama money had not wiped out the injury i  suggested in language i remember of admirable directness and  force that it was a pity they had taken the money in that case   he lost his temper at once and cried out that his dearest wish was  a war with england whereupon i also lost my temper and  thundering at the pitch of my voice i left him and went away by  myself to another part of the garden  a very tender reconciliation  took place and i think there will come no more harm out of it  we  are both of us nervous people and he had had a very long walk and  a good deal of beer at dinner  that explains the scene a little   but i regret having employed so much of the voice with which i have  been endowed as i fear every person in the hotel was taken into  confidence as to my sentiments just at the very juncture when  neither the sentiments nor perhaps the language had been  sufficiently considered  friday  you have not yet heard of my book  four great scotsmen   john knox david hume robert burns walter scott  these their  lives their work the social media in which they lived and worked  with if i can so make it the strong current of the race making  itself felt underneath and throughout  this is my idea  you must  tell me what you think of it  the knox will really be new matter  as his life hitherto has been disgracefully written and the events  are romantic and rapid the character very strong salient and  worthy much interest as to the future of scotland and as to that  part of him which was truly modern under his hebrew disguise   hume of course the urbane cheerful gentlemanly letterwriting  eighteenth century full of attraction and much that i dont yet  know as to his work  burns the sentimental side that there is in  most scotsmen his poor troubled existence how far his poems were  his personally and how far national the question of the framework  of society in scotland and its fatal effect upon the finest  natures  scott again the ever delightful man sane courageous  admirable the birth of romance in a dawn that was a sunset  snobbery conservatism the wrong thread in history and notably in  that of his own land  voila madame le menu  comment le trouvez vous  il y a de la bonne viando si on parvient a la cuire  convenablement  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    mentone march 28 1874  my dear mother  beautiful weather perfect weather sun pleasant  cooling winds health very good only incapacity to write  the only new cloud on my horizon i mean this in no menacing sense  is the prince  i have philosophical and artistic discussions with  the prince  he is capable of talking for two hours upon end  developing his theory of everything under heaven from his first  position which is that there is no straight line  doesnt that  sound like a game of my fathers  i beg your pardon you havent  read it  i dont mean my father i mean tristram shandys  he is  very clever and it is an immense joke to hear him unrolling all  the problems of life  philosophy science what you will  in this  charmingly cutanddry hereweareagain kind of manner  he is  better to listen to than to argue withal  when you differ from  him he lifts up his voice and thunders and you know that the  thunder of an excited foreigner often miscarries  one stands  aghast marvelling how such a colossus of a man in such a great  commotion of spirit can open his mouth so much and emit such a  still small voice at the hinder end of it all  all this while he  walks about the room smokes cigarettes occupies divers chairs for  divers brief spaces and casts his huge arms to the four winds like  the sails of a mill  he is a most sportive prince  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    swanston may 1874 monday  we are now at swanston cottage lothianburn edinburgh  the garden  is but little clothed yet for you know here we are six hundred  feet above the sea  it is very cold and has sleeted this morning   everything wintry  i am very jolly however having finished  victor hugo and just looking round to see what i should next take  up  i have been reading roman law and calvin this morning  evening  i went up the hill a little this afternoon  the air was  invigorating but it was so cold that my scalp was sore  with this  high wintry wind and the grey sky and faint northern daylight it  was quite wonderful to hear such a clamour of blackbirds coming up  to me out of the woods and the bleating of sheep being shorn in a  field near the garden and to see golden patches of blossom already  on the furze and delicate green shoots upright and beginning to  frond out among last years russet bracken  flights of crows were  passing continually between the wintry leaden sky and the wintry  coldlooking hills  it was the oddest conflict of seasons  a wee  rabbit  this years making beyond question  ran out from under  my feet and was in a pretty perturbation until he hit upon a  lucky juniper and blotted himself there promptly  evidently this  gentleman had not had much experience of life  i have made an arrangement with my people  i am to have 84 pounds  a year  i only asked for 80 pounds on mature reflection  and as i  should soon make a good bit by my pen i shall be very comfortable   we are all as jolly as can be together so that is a great thing  gained  wednesday  yesterday i received a letter that gave me much  pleasure from a poor fellowstudent of mine who has been all  winter very ill and seems to be but little better even now  he  seems very much pleased with ordered south  a month ago he  says i could scarcely have ventured to read it today i felt on  reading it as i did on the first day that i was able to sun myself  a little in the open air  and much more to the like effect  it  is very gratifying  ever your faithful friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    swanston wednesday may 1874  struggling away at fables in song  i am much afraid i am going to  make a real failure the time is so short and i am so out of the  humour  otherwise very calm and jolly  cold still impossible  thursday  i feel happier about the fables and it is warmer a  bit but my body is most decrepit and i can just manage to be  cheery and tread down hypochondria under foot by work  i lead such  a funny life utterly without interest or pleasure outside of my  work  nothing indeed but work all day long except a short walk  alone on the cold hills and meals and a couple of pipes with my  father in the evening  it is surprising how it suits me and how  happy i keep  saturday  i have received such a nice long letter four sides  from leslie stephen today about my victor hugo  it is accepted   this ought to have made me gay but it hasnt  i am not likely to  be much of a tonic tonight  i have been very cynical over myself  today partly perhaps because i have just finished some of the  deedest rubbish about lord lyttons fables that an intelligent  editor ever shot into his wastepaper basket  if morley prints it i  shall be glad but my respect for him will be shaken  tuesday  another cold day yet i have been along the hillside  wondering much at idiotic sheep and raising partridges at every  second step  one little plover is the object of my firm adherence   i pass his nest every day and if you saw how he files by me and  almost into my face crying and flapping his wings to direct my  attention from his little treasure you would have as kind a heart  to him as i  today i saw him not although i took my usual way  and i am afraid that some person has abused his simple wiliness and  harried as we say in scotland the nest  i feel much righteous  indignation against such imaginary aggressor  however one must  not be too chary of the lower forms  today i sat down on a tree stump at the skirt of a little strip of planting and thoughtlessly  began to dig out the touchwood with an end of twig  i found i had  carried ruin death and universal consternation into a little  community of ants and this set me athinking of how close we are  environed with frail lives so that we can do nothing without  spreading havoc over all manner of perishable homes and interests  and affections and so on to my favourite mood of an holy terror  for all action and all inaction equally  a sort of shuddering  revulsion from the necessary responsibilities of life  we must not  be too scrupulous of others or we shall die  conscientiousness is  a sort of moral opium an excitant in small doses perhaps but at  bottom a strong narcotic  saturday  i have been two days in edinburgh and so had not the  occasion to write to you  morley has accepted the fables and i  have seen it in proof and think less of it than ever  however of  course i shall send you a copy of the magazine without fail and  you can be as disappointed as you like or the reverse if you can   i would willingly recall it if i could  try by way of change byrons mazeppa you will be astonished  it  is grand and no mistake and one sees through it a fire and a  passion and a rapid intuition of genius that makes one rather  sorry for ones own generation of better writers and  i dont  know what to say i was going to say smaller men but thats not  right read it and you will feel what i cannot express  dont be  put out by the beginning persevere and you will find yourself  thrilled before you are at an end with it  ever your faithful  friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    train between edinburgh and chester august 8 1874  my father and mother reading  i think i shall talk to you for a  moment or two  this morning at swanston the birds poor  creatures had the most troubled hour or two evidently there was a  hawk in the neighbourhood not one sang and the whole garden  thrilled with little notes of warning and terror  i did not know  before that the voice of birds could be so tragically expressive   i had always heard them before express their trivial satisfaction  with the blue sky and the return of daylight  really they almost  frightened me i could hear mothers and wives in terror for those  who were dear to them it was easy to translate i wish it were as  easy to write but it is very hard in this flying train or i would  write you more  chester  i like this place much but somehow i feel glad when i  get among the quiet eighteenth century buildings in cosy places  with some elbow room about them after the older architecture   this other is bedevilled and furtive it seems to stoop i am  afraid of trapdoors and could not go pleasantly into such houses   i dont know how much of this is legitimately the effect of the  architecture little enough possibly possibly far the most part of  it comes from bad historical novels and the disquieting statuary  that garnishes some facades  on the way today i passed through my dear cumberland country   nowhere to as great a degree can one find the combination of  lowland and highland beauties the outline of the blue hills is  broken by the outline of many tumultuous treeclumps and the broad  spaces of moorland are balanced by a network of deep hedgerows that  might rival suffolk in the foreground  how a railway journey  shakes and discomposes one mind and body  i grow blacker and  blacker in humour as the day goes on and when at last i am let  out and have the fresh air about me it is as though i were born  again and the sick fancies flee away from my mind like swans in  spring  i want to come back on what i have said about eighteenth century  and middleage houses  i do not know if i have yet explained to  you the sort of loyalty of urbanity that there is about the one  to my mind the spirit of a country orderly and prosperous a  flavour of the presence of magistrates and welltodo merchants in  bagwigs the clink of glasses at night in firelit parlours  something certain and civic and domestic is all about these quiet  staid shapely houses with no character but their exceeding  shapeliness and the comely external utterance that they make of  their internal comfort  now the others are as i have said both  furtive and bedevilled they are sly and grotesque they combine  their sort of feverish grandeur with their sort of secretive  baseness after the manner of a charles the ninth  they are  peopled for me with persons of the same fashion  dwarfs and  sinister people in cloaks are about them and i seem to divine  crypts and as i said trapdoors  o god be praised that we live  in this good daylight and this good peace  barmouth august 9th  today we saw the cathedral at chester  and far more delightful saw and heard a certain inimitable verger  who took us round  he was full of a certain recondite faraway  humour that did not quite make you laugh at the time but was  somehow laughable to recollect  moreover he had so far a just  imagination and could put one in the right humour for seeing an  old place very much as according to my favourite text scotts  novels and poems do for one  his account of the monks in the  scriptorium with their cowls over their heads in a certain  sheltered angle of the cloister where the big cathedral building  kept the sun off the parchments was all that could be wished and  so too was what he added of the others pacing solemnly behind them  and dropping ever and again on their knees before a little shrine  there is in the wall to keep em in the frame of mind  you will  begin to think me unduly biassed in this vergers favour if i go on  to tell you his opinion of me  we got into a little side chapel  whence we could hear the choir children at practice and i stopped  a moment listening to them with i dare say a very bright face  for the sound was delightful to me  ah says he youre very  fond of music  i said i was  yes i could tell that by your  head he answered  theres a deal in that head  and he shook  his own solemnly  i said it might be so but i found it hard at  least to get it out  then my father cut in brutally said anyway  i had no ear and left the verger so distressed and shaken in the  foundations of his creed that i hear he got my father aside  afterwards and said he was sure there was something in my face and  wanted to know what it was if not music  he was relieved when he  heard that i occupied myself with litterature which word note  here i do not spell correctly  goodnight and heres the  vergers health  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    swanston wednesday autumn 1874  i have been hard at work all yesterday and besides had to write a  long letter to bob so i found no time until quite late and then  was sleepy  last night it blew a fearful gale i was kept awake  about a couple of hours and could not get to sleep for the horror  of the winds noise the whole house shook and mind you our  house is a house a great castle of jointed stone that would weigh  up a street of english houses so that when it quakes as it did  last night it means something  but the quaking was not what put  me about it was the horrible howl of the wind round the corner  the audible haunting of an incarnate anger about the house the  evil spirit that was abroad and above all the shuddering silent  pauses when the storms heart stands dreadfully still for a moment   o how i hate a storm at night  they have been a great influence in  my life i am sure for i can remember them so far back  long  before i was six at least for we left the house in which i  remember listening to them times without number when i was six   and in those days the storm had for me a perfect impersonation as  durable and unvarying as any heathen deity  i always heard it as  a horseman riding past with his cloak about his head and somehow  always carried away and riding past again and being baffled yet  once more ad infinitum all night long  i think i wanted him to  get past but i am not sure i know only that i had some interest  either for or against in the matter and i used to lie and hold my  breath not quite frightened but in a state of miserable  exaltation  my first john knox is in proof and my second is on the anvil  it  is very good of me so to do for i want so much to get to my real  tour and my sham tour the real tour first  it is always working  in my head and if i can only turn on the right sort of style at  the right moment i am not much afraid of it  one thing bothers  me what with hammering at this j k and writing necessary  letters and taking necessary exercise that even not enough the  weather is so repulsive to me cold and windy i find i have no  time for reading except times of fatigue when i wish merely to  relax myself  o  and i read over again for this purpose  flauberts tentation de st antoine it struck me a good deal at  first but this second time it has fetched me immensely  i am but  just done with it so you will know the large proportion of salt to  take with my present statement that its the finest thing i ever  read  of course it isnt that its full of longueurs and is not  quite redd up as we say in scotland not quite articulated but  there are splendid things in it  i say do take your maccaroni with oil  do please  its beastly  with butter  ever your faithful friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    edinburgh december 23 1874  monday  i have come from a concert and the concert was rather a  disappointment  not so my afternoon skating  duddingston our big  loch is bearing and i wish you could have seen it this afternoon  covered with people in thin driving snow flurries the big hill  grim and white and alpine overhead in the thick air and the road  up the gorge as it were into the heart of it dotted black with  traffic  moreover i can skate a little bit and what one can do  is always pleasant to do  tuesday  i got your letter today and was so glad thereof  it  was of good omen to me also  i worked from ten to one my classes  are suspended now for xmas holidays and wrote four or five  portfolio pages of my buckinghamshire affair  then i went to  duddingston and skated all afternoon  if you had seen the moon  rising a perfect sphere of smoky gold in the dark air above the  trees and the white loch thick with skaters and the great hill  snowsprinkled overhead  it was a sight for a king  wednesday  i stayed on duddingston today till after nightfall   the little booths that hucksters set up round the edge were marked  each one by its little lamp  there were some fires too and the  light and the shadows of the people who stood round them to warm  themselves made a strange pattern all round on the snowcovered  ice  a few people with torches began to travel up and down the  ice a lit circle travelling along with them over the snow  a  gigantic moon rose meanwhile over the trees and the kirk on the  promontory among perturbed and vacillating clouds  the walk home was very solemn and strange  once through a broken  gorge we had a glimpse of a little space of mackerel sky moon litten on the other side of the hill the broken ridges standing  grey and spectral between and the hilltop over all snowwhite  and strangely magnified in size  this must go to you tomorrow so that you may read it on christmas  day for company  i hope it may be good company to you  thursday  outside it snows thick and steadily  the gardens  before our house are now a wonderful fairy forest  and o this  whiteness of things how i love it how it sends the blood about my  body  maurice de guerin hated snow what a fool he must have been   somebody tried to put me out of conceit with it by saying that  people were lost in it  as if people dont get lost in love too  and die of devotion to art as if everything worth were not an  occasion to some peoples end  what a wintry letter this is  only i think it is winter seen from  the inside of a warm greatcoat  and there is at least a warm  heart about it somewhere  do you know what they say in xmas  stories is true  i think one loves their friends more dearly at  this season  ever your faithful friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    17 heriot road edinburgh january 1875  my dear colvin  i have worked too hard i have given myself one  day of rest and that was not enough i am giving myself another   i shall go to bed again likewise so soon as this is done and  slumber most potently  9 pm slept all afternoon like a lamb  about my coming south i think the still small unanswerable voice  of coins will make it impossible until the session is over end of  march but for all that i think i shall hold out jolly  i do not  want you to come and bother yourself indeed it is still not quite  certain whether my father will be quite fit for you although i  have now no fear of that really  now dont take up this wrongly i  wish you could come and i do not know anything that would make me  happier but i see that it is wrong to expect it and so i resign  myself  some time after  i offered appleton a series of papers on  the modern french school  the parnassiens i think they call them   de banville coppee soulary and sully prudhomme  but he has  not deigned to answer my letter  i shall have another portfolio paper so soon as i am done with this  story that has played me out the story is to be called when the  devil was well  scene italy renaissance colour purely  imaginary of course my own unregenerate idea of what italy then  was  o when shall i find the story of my dreams that shall never  halt nor wander nor step aside but go ever before its face and  ever swifter and louder until the pit receives it roaring  the  portfolio paper will be about scotland and england  ever yours  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    edinburgh tuesday february 1875  i got your nice long gossiping letter today  i mean by that that  there was more news in it than usual  and so of course i am  pretty jolly  i am in the house however with such a beastly cold  in the head  our east winds begin already to be very cold  o i have such a longing for children of my own and yet i do not  think i could bear it if i had one  i fancy i must feel more like  a woman than like a man about that  i sometimes hate the children  i see on the street  you know what i mean by hate  wish they were  somewhere else and not there to mock me and sometimes again i  dont know how to go by them for the love of them especially the  very wee ones  thursday  i have been still in the house since i wrote and i  have worked  i finished the italian story not well but as well  as i can just now i must go all over it again some time soon  when i feel in the humour to better and perfect it  and now i have  taken up an old story begun years ago and i have now rewritten  all i had written of it then and mean to finish it  what i have  lost and gained is odd  as far as regards simple writing of  course i am in another world now but in some things though more  clumsy i seem to have been freer and more plucky  this is a  lesson i have taken to heart  i have got a jolly new name for my  old story  i am going to call it a country dance the two heroes  keep changing places you know and the chapter where the most of  this changing goes on is to be called up the middle down the  middle  it will be in six or perhaps seven chapters  i have  never worked harder in my life than these last four days  if i can  only keep it up  saturday  yesterday leslie stephen who was down here to  lecture called on me and took me up to see a poor fellow a poet  who writes for him and who has been eighteen months in our  infirmary and may be for all i know eighteen months more  it  was very sad to see him there in a little room with two beds and  a couple of sick children in the other bed a girl came in to visit  the children and played dominoes on the counterpane with them the  gas flared and crackled the fire burned in a dull economical way  stephen and i sat on a couple of chairs and the poor fellow sat up  in his bed with his hair and beard all tangled and talked as  cheerfully as if he had been in a kings palace or the great  kings palace of the blue air  he has taught himself two languages  since he has been lying there  i shall try to be of use to him  we have had two beautiful spring days mild as milk windy withal  and the sun hot  i dreamed last night i was walking by moonlight  round the place where the scene of my story is laid it was all so  quiet and sweet and the blackbirds were singing as if it was day  it made my heart very cool and happy  ever yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    february 8 1875  my dear colvin  forgive my bothering

the open air  it is very be   no not beautiful exactly just now but very bright and living   there are one or two song birds and a cuckoo all the fruittrees  are in flower and the beeches make sunshine in a shady place i  begin to go all right you need not be vexed about my health i  really was ill at first as bad as i have been for nearly a year  but the forest begins to work and the air and the sun and the  smell of the pines  if i could stay a month here i should be as  right as possible  thanks for your letter  your faithful  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    17 heriot row edinburgh sunday april 1875  here is my long story  yesterday night after having supped i  grew so restless that i was obliged to go out in search of some  excitement  there was a halfmoon lying over on its back and  incredibly bright in the midst of a faint grey sky set with faint  stars  a very inartistic moon that would have damned a picture  at the most populous place of the city i found a little boy three  years old perhaps half frantic with terror and crying to every  one for his mammy  this was about eleven mark you  people  stopped and spoke to him and then went on leaving him more  frightened than before  but i and a goodhumoured mechanic came up  together and i instantly developed a latent faculty for setting  the hearts of children at rest  master tommy murphy such was his  name soon stopped crying and allowed me to take him up and carry  him and the mechanic and i trudged away along princes street to  find his parents  i was soon so tired that i had to ask the  mechanic to carry the bairn and you should have seen the puzzled  contempt with which he looked at me for knocking in so soon  he  was a good fellow however although very impracticable and  sentimental and he soon bethought him that master murphy might  catch cold after his excitement so we wrapped him up in my  greatcoat  tobauga tobago street was the address he gave us  and we deposited him in a little grocers shop and went through all  the houses in the street without being able to find any one of the  name of murphy  then i set off to the head police office leaving  my greatcoat in pawn about master murphys person  as i went down  one of the lowest streets in the town i saw a little bit of life  that struck me  it was now halfpast twelve a little shop stood  still halfopen and a boy of four or five years old was walking up  and down before it imitating cockcrow  he was the only living  creature within sight  at the police offices no word of master murphys parents so i went  back emptyhanded  the good groceress who had kept her shop open  all this time could keep the child no longer her father bad with  bronchitis said he must forth  so i got a large scone with  currants in it wrapped my coat about tommy got him up on my arm  and away to the police office with him  not very easy in my mind  for the poor child young as he was  he could scarce speak  was  full of terror for the office as he called it  he was now very  grave and quiet and communicative with me told me how his father  thrashed him and divers household matters  whenever he saw a  woman on our way he looked after her over my shoulder and then gave  his judgment  thats no her adding sometimes she has a wean  wi her  meantime i was telling him how i was going to take him  to a gentleman who would find out his mother for him quicker than  ever i could and how he must not be afraid of him but be brave  as he had been with me  we had just arrived at our destination   we were just under the lamp  when he looked me in the face and  said appealingly hell no put  me in the office  and i had to  assure him that he would not even as i pushed open the door and  took him in  the serjeant was very nice and i got tommy comfortably seated on a  bench and spirited him up with good words and the scone with the  currants in it and then telling him i was just going out to look  for mammy i got my greatcoat and slipped away  poor little boy he was not called for i learn until ten this  morning  this is very ill written and ive missed half that was  picturesque in it but to say truth i am very tired and sleepy   it was two before i got to bed  however you see i had my  excitement  monday  i have written nothing all morning i cannot settle to  it  yes  i will though  1045  and i did  i want to say something more to you about the  three women  i wonder so much why they should have been women and  halt between two opinions in the matter  sometimes i think it is  because they were made by a man for men sometimes again i think  there is an abstract reason for it and there is something more  substantive about a woman than ever there can be about a man  i  can conceive a great mythical woman living alone among  inaccessible mountaintops or in some lost island in the pagan  seas and ask no more  whereas if i hear of a hercules i ask  after iole or dejanira  i cannot think him a man without women   but i can think of these three deepbreasted women living out all  their days on remote hilltops seeing the white dawn and the purple  even and the world outspread before them for ever and no more to  them for ever than a sight of the eyes a hearing of the ears a  faraway interest of the inflexible heart not pausing not  pitying but austere with a holy austerity rigid with a calm and  passionless rigidity and i find them none the less women to the  end  and think if one could love a woman like that once see her once  grow pale with passion and once wring your lips out upon hers  would it not be a small thing to die  not that there is not a  passion of a quite other sort much less epic far more dramatic  and intimate that comes out of the very frailty of perishable  women out of the lines of suffering that we see written about  their eyes and that we may wipe out if it were but for a moment  out of the thin hands wrought and tempered in agony to a fineness  of perception that the indifferent or the merely happy cannot  know out of the tragedy that lies about such a love and the  pathetic incompleteness  this is another thing and perhaps it is  a higher  i look over my shoulder at the three great headless  madonnas and they look back at me and do not move see me and  through and over me the foul life of the city dying to its embers  already as the night draws on and over miles and miles of silent  country set here and there with lit towns thundered through here  and there with night expresses scattering fire and smoke and away  to the ends of the earth and the furthest star and the blank  regions of nothing and they are not moved  my quiet greatkneed  deepbreasted welldraped ladies of necessity i give my heart to  you  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    swanston tuesday april 1875  my dear friend  i have been so busy away to bridge of allan with  my father first and then with simpson and baxter out here from  saturday till monday  i had no time to write and as it is am  strangely incapable  thanks for your letter  i have been reading  such lots of law and it seems to take away the power of writing  from me  from morning to night so often as i have a spare moment  i am in the embrace of a law book  barren embraces  i am in good  spirits and my heart smites me as usual when i am in good  spirits about my parents  if i get a bit dull i am away to  london without a scruple but so long as my heart keeps up i am  all for my parents  what do you think of henleys hospital verses  they were to have  been dedicated to me but stephen wouldnt allow it  said it would  be pretentious  wednesday  i meant to have made this quite a decent letter this  morning but listen  i had pain all last night and did not sleep  well and now am cold and sickish and strung up ever and again  with another flash of pain  will you remember me to everybody  my  principal characteristics are cold poverty and scots law  three  very bad things  oo how the rain falls  the mist is quite low on  the hill  the birds are twittering to each other about the  indifferent season  o heres a gem for you  an old godly woman  predicted the end of the world because the seasons were becoming  indistinguishable my cousin dora objected that last winter had  been pretty well marked  yes my dear replied the  soothsayeress but i think youll find the summer will be rather  coamplicated  ever your faithful  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    edinburgh saturday april 1875  i am getting on with my rehearsals but i find the part very hard   i rehearsed yesterday from a quarter to seven and today from four  with interval for dinner to eleven  you see the sad strait i am  in for ink  a demain  sunday  this is the third inkbottle i have tried and still its  nothing to boast of  my journey went off all right and i have  kept ever in good spirits  last night indeed i did think my  little bit of gaiety was going away down the wind like a whiff of  tobacco smoke but today it has come back to me a little  the  influence of this place is assuredly all that can be worst against  one mail il faut lutter  i was haunted last night when i was in  bed by the most cold desolate recollections of my past life here  i was glad to try and think of the forest and warm my hands at the  thought of it  o the quiet grey thickets and the yellow  butterflies and the woodpeckers and the outlook over the plain as  it were over a sea  o for the good fleshly stupidity of the  woods the body conscious of itself all over and the mind  forgotten the clean air nestling next your skin as though your  clothes were gossamer the eye filled and content the whole man  happy  whereas here it takes a pull to hold yourself together it  needs both hands and a book of stoical maxims and a sort of  bitterness at the heart by way of armour  ever your faithful  r l s  wednesday  i am so played out with a cold in my eye that i cannot  see to write or read without difficulty  it is swollen horrible  so how i shall look as orsino god knows  i have my fine clothes  tho  henleys sonnets have been taken for the cornhill  he is  out of hospital now and dressed but still not too much to brag of  in health poor fellow i am afraid  sunday  so  i have still rather bad eyes and a nasty sore  throat  i play orsino every day in all the pomp of solomon  splendid francis the first clothes heavy with gold and stage  jewellery  i play it ill enough i believe but me and the  clothes and the wedding wherewith the clothes and me are  reconciled produce every night a thrill of admiration  our cook  told my mother there is a servants night you know that she and  the housemaid were just prood to be able to say it was oor young  gentleman  to sup afterwards with these clothes on and a  wonderful lot of gaiety and shakespearean jokes about the table is  something to live for  it is so nice to feel you have been dead  three hundred years and the sound of your laughter is faint and  far off in the centuries  ever your faithful  robert louis stevenson   wednesday  a moment at last  these last few days have been as  jolly as days could be and by good fortune i leave tomorrow for  swanston so that i shall not feel the whole fall back to habitual  self  the pride of life could scarce go further  to live in  splendid clothes velvet and gold and fur upon principally  champagne and lobster salad with a company of people nearly all of  whom are exceptionally good talkers when your days began about  eleven and ended about four  i have lost that sentence i give it  up it is very admirable sport any way  then both my afternoons  have been so pleasantly occupied  taking henley drives  i had a  business to carry him down the long stair and more of a business  to get him up again but while he was in the carriage it was  splendid  it is now just the top of spring with us  the whole  country is mad with green  to see the cherryblossom bitten out  upon the black firs and the black firs bitten out of the blue sky  was a sight to set before a king  you may imagine what it was to a  man who has been eighteen months in an hospital ward  the look of  his face was a wine to me  i shall send this off today to let you know of my new address   swanston cottage lothianburn edinburgh  salute the faithful in  my name  salute priscilla salute barnabas salute ebenezer  o

to church and am not depressed  a great step   i was at that beautiful church my petit poeme en prose was about   it is a little cruciform place with heavy cornices and string  course to match and a steep slate roof  the small kirkyard is  full of old gravestones  one of a frenchman from dunkerque  i  suppose he died prisoner in the military prison hard by  and one  the most pathetic memorial i ever saw a poor schoolslate in a  wooden frame with the inscription cut into it evidently by the  fathers own hand  in church old mr torrence preached  over  eighty and a relic of times forgotten with his black thread  gloves and mild old foolish face  one of the nicest parts of it  was to see john inglis the greatest man in scotland our justice general and the only born lawyer i ever heard

1875july 1879     letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    chez siron barbizon seine et marne august 1875  my dear mother  i have been three days at a place called grez a  pretty and very melancholy village on the plain  a low bridge of  many arches choked with sedge great fields of white and yellow  waterlilies poplars and willows innumerable and about it all  such an atmosphere of sadness and slackness one could do nothing  but get into the boat and out of it again and yawn for bedtime  yesterday bob and i walked home it came on a very creditable  thunderstorm we were soon wet through sometimes the rain was so  heavy that one could only see by holding the hand over the eyes  and to crown all we lost our way and wandered all over the place  and into the artillery range among broken trees with big shot  lying about among the rocks  it was near dinnertime when we got  to barbizon and it is supposed that we walked from twentythree to  twentyfive miles which is not bad for the advocate who is not  tired this morning  i was very glad to be back again in this dear  place and smell the wet forest in the morning  simpson and the rest drove back in a carriage and got about as wet  as we did  why dont you write  i have no more to say  ever your  affectionate son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    chateau renard loiret august 1875     i have been walking these last days from place to place and  it does make it hot for walking with a sack in this weather  i am  burned in horrid patches of red my nose i fear is going to take  the lead in colour simpson is all flushed as if he were seen by a  sunset  i send you here two rondeaux i dont suppose they will  amuse anybody but me but this measure short and yet intricate is  just what i desire and i have had some good times walking along  the glaring roads or down the poplar alley of the great canal  pitting my own humour to this old verse   far have you come my lady from the town and far from all your sorrows if you please to smell the good seawinds and hear the seas and in green meadows lay your body down  to find your pale face grow from pale to brown your sad eyes growing brighter by degrees far have you come my lady from the town and far from all your sorrows if you please  here in this seaboard land of old renown in meadow grass go wading to the knees bathe your whole soul a while in simple ease there is no sorrow but the sea can drown far have you come my lady from the town   nous nirons plus au bois   well walk the woods no more but stay beside the fire to weep for old desire and things that are no more  the woods are spoiled and hoar the ways are full of mire well walk the woods no more but stay beside the fire we loved in days of yore love laughter and the lyre ah god but death is dire and death is at the door  well walk the woods no more  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    edinburgh autumn 1875  my dear colvin  thanks for your letter and news  no  my burns  is not done yet it has led me so far afield that i cannot finish  it every time i think i see my way to an end some new game or  perhaps wild goose starts up and away i go  and then again to  be plain i shirk the work of the critical part shirk it as a man  shirks a long jump  it is awful to have to express and  differentiate burns in a column or two  o golly i say you know  it cant be done at the money  all the more as im going write a  book about it  ramsay fergusson and burns  an essay or a  critical essay but then im going to give lives of the three  gentlemen only the gist of the book is the criticism by robert  louis stevenson advocate  hows that for cut and dry  and i  could write this book  unless i deceive myself i could even write  it pretty adequately  i feel as if i was really in it and knew  the game thoroughly  you see what comes of trying to write an  essay on burns in ten columns  meantime when i have done burns i shall finish charles of orleans  who is in a good way about the fifth month i should think and  promises to be a fine healthy child better than any of his elder  brothers for a while and then perhaps a villon for villon is a  very essential part of my ramsayfergussonburns i mean is a note  in it and will recur again and again for comparison and  illustration then perhaps i may try fontainebleau by the way   but so soon as charles of orleans is polished off and immortalised  for ever he and his pipings in a solid imperishable shrine of r  l s my true aim and end will be this little book  suppose i  could jerk you out 100 cornhill pages that would easy make 200  pages of decent form and then thickish paper  eh would that do   i dare say it could be made bigger but i know what 100 pages of  copy bright consummate copy imply behind the scenes of weary  manuscribing i think if i put another nothing to it i should not  be outside the mark and 100 cornhill pages of 500 words means i  fancy but i never was good at figures means 50000 words   theres a prospect for an idle young gentleman who lives at home at  ease  the future is thick with inky fingers  and then perhaps  nobody would publish  ah nom de dieu  what do you think of all  this will it paddle think you  i hope this pen will write it is the third i have tried  about coming up no thats impossible for i am worse than a  bankrupt  i have at the present six shillings and a penny i have  a sounding lot of bills for christmas new dress suit for  instance the old one having gone for parliament house and new  white shirts to live up to my new profession im as gay and swell  and gummy as can be only all my boots leak one pair water and  the other two simple black mud so that my rig is more for the eye  than a very solid comfort to myself  that is my budget  dismal  enough and no prospect of any coin coming in at least for months   so that here i am i almost fear for the winter certainly till  after christmas and then it depends on how my bills turn out  whether it shall not be till spring  so meantime i must whistle  in my cage  my cage is better by one thing i am an advocate now   if you ask me why that makes it better i would remind you that in  the most distressing circumstances a little consequence goes a long  way and even bereaved relatives stand on precedence round the  coffin  i idle finely  i read boswells life of johnson martins  history of france allan ramsay olivier bosselin all sorts of  rubbish apropos of burns commines juvenal des ursins etc  i  walk about the parliament house five forenoons a week in wig and  gown i have either a five or six mile walk or an hour or two hard  skating on the rink every afternoon without fail  i have not written much but like the seamans parrot in the tale  i have thought a deal  you have never by the way returned me  either spring or beranger which is certainly a dd shame  i  always comforted myself with that when my conscience pricked me  about a letter to you  thus conscience  o no thats not  appropriate in this connection  ever yours  robert louis stevenson  i say is there any chance of your coming north this year  mind  you that promise is now more respectable for age than is

so be it  there is one masterpiece fewer  in the world  the world can ill spare it but i sir i and here  i strike my hollow boson so that it resounds i am full of this  sort of bauble i am made of it it comes to me sir as the desire  to sneeze comes upon poor ordinary devils on cold days when they  should be getting out of bed and into their horrid cold tubs by the  light of a seven oclock candle with the dismal seven oclock  frostflowers all over the window  show stephen what you please if you could show him how to give me  money you would oblige sincerely yours  r l s  i have a scroll of springtime somewhere but i know that it is not  in very good order and do not feel myself up to very much grind  over it  i am damped about springtime thats the truth of it  it  might have been four or five quid  sir i shall shave my head if this goes on  all men take a  pleasure to gird at me  the laws of nature are in open war with  me  the wheel of a dogcart took the toes off my new boots  gout  has set in with extreme rigour and cut me out of the cheap  refreshment of beer  i leant my back against an oak i thought it  was a trusty tree but first it bent and syne  it lost the spirit  of springtime and so did professor sidney colvin trinity college  to me  ever yours  robert louis stevenson  along with this i send you some ppps if you lose them you  need not seek to look upon my face again  do for gods sake  answer me about them also it is a horrid thing for a fond  architect to find his monuments received in silence  yours  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    edinburgh november 12 1875  my dear friend  since i got your letter i have been able to do a  little more work and i have been much better contented with  myself but i cant get away that is absolutely prevented by the  state of my purse and my debts which i may say are red like  crimson  i dont know how i am to clear my hands of them nor  when not before christmas anyway  yesterday i was twentyfive so  please wish me many happy returns  directly  this one was not  unhappy anyway  i have got back a good deal into my old random  littlethought way of life and do not care whether i read write  speak or walk so long as i do something  i have a great delight  in this wheelskating i have made great advance in it of late can  do a good many amusing things i mean amusing in my sense  amusing  to do  you know i lose all my forenoons at court  so it is but  the time passes it is a great pleasure to sit and hear cases  argued or advised  this is quite autobiographical but i feel as  if it was some time since we met and i can tell you i am glad to  meet you again  in every way you see but that of work the world  goes well with me  my health is better than ever it was before i  get on without any jar nay as if there never had been a jar with  my parents  if it werent about that work id be happy  but the  fact is i dont think  the fact is im going to trust in  providence about work  if i could get one or two pieces i hate out  of my way all would be well i think but these obstacles disgust  me and as i know i ought to do them first i dont do anything  i  must finish this off or ill just lose another day  ill try to  write again soon  ever your faithful friend  r l s    letter  to mrs de mattos    edinburgh january 1876  my dear katharine  the prisoner reserved his defence  he has  been seedy however principally sick of the family evil  despondency the sun is gone out utterly and the breath of the  people of this city lies about as a sort of damp unwholesome fog  in which we go walking with bowed hearts  if i understand what is  a contrite spirit i have one it is to feel that you are a small  jar or rather as i feel myself a very large jar of pottery work  rather mal reussi and to make every allowance for the potter i  beg pardon potter with a capital p on his illsuccess and  rather wish he would reduce you as soon as possible to potsherds   however there are many things to do yet before we go   grossir la pate universelle faite des formes que dieu fond   for instance i have never been in a revolution yet  i pray god i  may be in one at the end if i am to make a mucker  the best way  to make a mucker is to have your back set against a wall and a few  lead pellets whiffed into you in a moment while yet you are all in  a heat and a fury of combat with drums sounding on all sides and  people crying and a general smash like the infernal orchestration  at the end of the huguenots     please pardon me for having been so long of writing and show your  pardon by writing soon to me it will be a kindness for i am  sometimes very dull  edinburgh is much changed for the worse by  the absence of bob and this damned weather weighs on me like a  curse  yesterday or the day before there came so black a rain  squall that i was frightened  what a child would call frightened  you know for want of a better word  although in reality it has  nothing to do with fright  i lit the gas and sat cowering in my  chair until it went away again  ever yours  r l s  o i am trying my hand at a novel just now it may interest you to  know i am bound to say i do not think it will be a success   however its an amusement for the moment and work work is your  only ally against the bearded people that squat upon their hams  in the dark places of life and embrace people horribly as they go  by  god save us from the bearded people to think that the sun is  still shining in some happy places  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    edinburgh january 1876     our weather continues as it was bitterly cold and raining  often  there is not much pleasure in life certainly as it stands  at present  nous nirons plus au boss helas  i meant to write some more last night but my father was ill and it  put it out of my way  he is better this morning  if i had written last night i should have written a lot  but this  morning i am so dreadfully tired and stupid that i can say nothing   i was down at leith in the afternoon  god bless me what horrid  women i saw i never knew what a plainlooking race it was before   i was sick at heart with the looks of them  and the children  filthy and ragged  and the smells  and the fat black mud  my soul was full of disgust ere i got back  and yet the ships were  beautiful to see as they are always and on the pier there was a  clean cold wind that smelt a little of the sea though it came down  the firth and the sunset had a certain eclat and warmth  perhaps  if i could get more work done i should be in a better trim to  enjoy filthy streets and people and cold grim weather but i dont  much feel as if it was what i would have chosen  i am tempted  every day of my life to go off on another walking tour  i like  that better than anything else that i know  ever your faithful  friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    edinburgh february 1876  my dear colvin  1st  i have sent fontainebleau long ago long  ago  and leslie stephen is worse than tepid about it  liked some  parts of it very well the son of belial  moreover he proposes  to shorten it and i who want money and money soon and not glory  and the illustration of the english language i feel as if my  poverty were going to consent  2nd  im as fit as a fiddle after my walk  i am four inches  bigger about the waist than last july  there thats your prophecy  did that  i am on charles of orleans now but i dont know where  to send him  stephen obviously spews me out of his mouth and i  spew him out of mine so help me  a man who doesnt like my  fontainebleau  his head must be turned  3rd  if ever you do come across my spring i beg your pardon for  referring to it again but i dont want you to forget send it off  at once  4th  i went to ayr maybole girvan ballantrae stranraer  glenluce and wigton  i shall make an article of it some day soon  a winters walk in carrick and galloway  i had a good time   yours  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    swanston cottage lothianburn july 1876  here i am here and very well too  i am glad you liked walking  tours i like it too i think its prose and i own with  contrition that i have not always written prose  however i am  endeavouring after new obedience scot shorter catechism  you  dont say aught of forest notes which is kind  there is one if  you will that was too sweet to be wholesome  i am at charles dorleans  about fifteen cornhill pages have  already couled from under my facile plume  no i mean eleven  fifteen of ms  and we are not much more than halfway through  charles and i but hes a pleasant companion  my health is very  well i am in a fine exercisy state  baynes is gone to london if  you see him inquire about my burns  they have sent me 5 pounds  5s for it which has mollified me horrid  5 pounds 5s is a good  deal to pay for a read of it in ms i cant complain  yours  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    swanston cottage lothianburn july 1876     i have the strangest repugnance for writing indeed i have  nearly got myself persuaded into the notion that letters dont  arrive in order to salve my conscience for never sending them off   im reading a great deal of fifteenth century  trial of joan of  arc paston letters basin etc also boswell daily by way of a  bible i mean to read boswell now until the day i die  and now and  again a bit of pilgrims progress  is that all  yes i think  thats all  i have a thing in proof for the cornhill called  virginibus puerisque  charles of orleans is again laid aside  but in a good state of furtherance this time  a paper called a  defence of idlers which is really a defence of r l s is in a  good way  so you see i am busy in a tumultuous knotless sort of  fashion and as i say i take lots of exercise and im as brown a  berry  this is the first letter ive written for  o i dont know how  long  july 30th  this is i suppose three weeks after i began  do  please forgive me  to the highlands first to the jenkins then to antwerp thence  by canoe with simpson to paris and grez on the loing and an old  acquaintance of mine on the skirts of fontainebleau to complete  our cruise next spring if were all alive and jolly by loing and  loire saone and rhone to the mediterranean  it should make a  jolly book of gossip i imagine  god bless you  robert louis stevenson  ps  virginibus puerisque is in august cornhill  charles of  orleans is finished and sent to stephen idlers ditto and sent  to grove but ive no word of either  so ive not been idle  r l s    letter  to w e henley    chauny aisne september 1876  my dear henley  here i am you see and if you will take to a  map you will observe i am already more than two doors from  antwerp whence i started  i have fought it through under the  worst weather i ever saw in france i have been wet through nearly  every day of travel since the second inclusive besides this i  have had to fight against pretty mouldy health so that on the  whole the essayist and reviewer has shown i think some pluck   four days ago i was not a hundred miles from being miserably  drowned to the immense regret of a large circle of friends and the  permanent impoverishment of british essayism and reviewery  my  boat culbutted me under a fallen tree in a very rapid current and  i was a good while before i got on to the outside of that fallen  tree rather a better while than i cared about  when i got up i  lay some time on my belly panting and exuded fluid  all my  symptoms jusqu ici are trifling  but ive a damned sore throat   yours ever  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    17 heriot row edinburgh may 1877     a perfect chorus of repudiation is sounding in my ears and  although you say nothing i know you must be repudiating me all  the same  write i cannot  theres no good mincing matters a  letter frightens me worse than the devil and i am just as unfit  for correspondence as if i had never learned the three rs  let me give my news quickly before i relapse into my usual  idleness  i have a terror lest i should relapse before i get this  finished  courage r l s  on leslie stephens advice i gave  up the idea of a book of essays  he said he didnt imagine i was  rich enough for such an amusement and moreover whatever was worth  publication was worth republication  so the best of those i had  ready  an apology for idlers is in proof for the cornhill  i  have villon to do for the same magazine but god knows when ill  get it done for drums trumpets  im engaged upon  trumpets  drums  a novel  the hair trunk or the ideal commonwealth  it  is a most absurd story of a lot of young cambridge fellows who are  going to found a new society with no ideas on the subject and  nothing but bohemian tastes in the place of ideas and who are   well i cant explain about the trunk  it would take too long   but the trunk is the fun of it  everybody steals it burglary  marine fight life on desert island on west coast of scotland  sloops etc  the first scene where they make their grand schemes  and get drunk is supposed to be very funny by henley  i really  saw him laugh over it until he cried  please write to me although i deserve it so little and show a  christian spirit  ever your faithful friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    edinburgh august 1877  my dear colvin  im to be whipped away tomorrow to penzance  where at the postoffice a letter will find me glad and grateful   i am well but somewhat tired out with overwork  i have only been  home a fortnight this morning and i have already written to the  tune of fortyfive cornhill pages and upwards  the most of it was  only very laborious recasting and remodelling it is true but it  took it out of me famously all the same  temple bar appears to like my villon so i may count on another  market there in the future i hope  at least i am going to put it  to the proof at once and send another story the sire de  maletroits mousetrap  a true novel in the old sense all  unities preserved moreover if thats anything and i believe with  some little merits not so clever perhaps as the last but sounder  and more natural  my villon is out this month i should so much like to know what  you think of it  stephen has written to me apropos of idlers  that something more in that vein would be agreeable to his views   from stephen i count that a devil of a lot  i am honestly so tired this morning that i hope you will take this  for what its worth and give me an answer in peace  ever yours  louis stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    penzance august 1877     you will do well to stick to your burn that is a delightful  life you sketch and a very fountain of health  i wish i could  live like that but alas it is just as well i got my idlers  written and done with for i have quite lost all power of resting   i have a goad in my flesh continually pushing me to work work  work  i have an essay pretty well through for stephen a story  the sire de maletroits mousetrap with which i shall try temple  bar another story in the clouds the stepfathers story most  pathetic work of a high morality or immorality according to point  of view and lastly also in the clouds or perhaps a little  farther away an essay on the two st michaels mounts  historical and picturesque perhaps if it didnt come too long i  might throw in the bass rock and call it three sea fortalices  or something of that kind  you see how work keeps bubbling in my  mind  then i shall do another fifteenth century paper this autumn   la sale and petit jehan de saintre which is a kind of fifteenth  century sandford and merton ending in horrid immoral cynicism as  if the author had got tired of being didactic and just had a good  wallow in the mire to wind up with and indemnify himself for so  much restraint  cornwall is not much to my taste being as bleak as the bleakest  parts of scotland and nothing like so pointed and characteristic   it has a flavour of its own though which i may try and catch if  i find the space in the proposed article  will o the mill i  sent red hot to stephen in a fit of haste and have not yet had  an answer  i am quite prepared for a refusal  but i begin to have  more hope in the story line and that should improve my income  anyway  i am glad you liked villon some of it was not as good  as it ought to be but on the whole it seems pretty vivid and the  features strongly marked  vividness and not style is now my line  style is all very well but vividness is the real line of country  if a thing is meant to be read it seems just as well to try and  make it readable  i am such a dull person i cannot keep off my own  immortal works  indeed they are scarcely ever out of my head   and yet i value them less and less every day  but occupation is  the great thing so that a man should have his life in his own  pocket and never be thrown out of work by anything  i am glad to  hear you are better  i must stop  going to lands end  always  your faithful friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to a patchett martin    1877  dear sir  it would not be very easy for me to give you any idea  of the pleasure i found in your present  people who write for the  magazines probably from a guilty conscience are apt to suppose  their works practically unpublished  it seems unlikely that any  one would take the trouble to read a little paper buried among so  many others and reading it read it with any attention or  pleasure  and so i can assure you your little book coming from  so far gave me all the pleasure and encouragement in the world  i suppose you know and remember charles lambs essay on distant  correspondents  well i was somewhat of his way of thinking about  my mild productions  i did not indeed imagine they were read and  i suppose i may say enjoyed right round upon the other side of  the big football we have the honour to inhabit  and as your  present was the first sign to the contrary i feel i have been very  ungrateful in not writing earlier to acknowledge the receipt  i  dare say however you hate writing letters as much as i can do  myself for if you like my article i may presume other points of  sympathy between us and on this hypothesis you will be ready to  forgive me the delay  i may mention with regard to the piece of verses called such is  life that i am not the only one on this side of the football  aforesaid to think it a good and bright piece of work and  recognised a link of sympathy with the poets who play in  hostelries at euchre  believe me dear sir yours truly  r l s    letter  to a patchett martin    17 heriot row edinburgh december 1877  my dear sir  i am afraid you must already have condemned me for a  very idle fellow truly  here it is more than two months since i  received your letter i had no fewer than three journals to  acknowledge and never a sign upon my part  if you have seen a  cornhill paper of mine upon idling you will be inclined to set it  all down to that  but you will not be doing me justice  indeed i  have had a summer so troubled that i have had little leisure and  still less inclination to write letters  i was keeping the devil  at bay with all my disposable activities and more than once i  thought he had me by the throat  the odd conditions of our  acquaintance enable me to say more to you than i would to a person  who lived at my elbow  and besides i am too much pleased and  flattered at our correspondence not to go as far as i can to set  myself right in your eyes  in this damnable confusion i beg pardon i have lost all my  possessions or near about and quite lost all my wits  i wish i  could lay my hands on the numbers of the review for i know i  wished to say something on that head more particularly than i can  from memory but where they have escaped to only time or chance  can show  however i can tell you so far that i was very much  pleased with the article on bret harte it seemed to me just  clear and to the point  i agreed pretty well with all you said  about george eliot  a high but may we not add  a rather dry  lady  did you  i forget  did you have a kick at the stern works  of that melancholy puppy and humbug daniel deronda himself  the  prince of prigs the literary abomination of desolation in the way  of manhood a type which is enough to make a man forswear the love  of women if that is how it must be gained    hats off all the  same you understand  a woman of genius  of your poems i have myself a kindness for noll and nell  although i dont think you have made it as good as you ought   verse five is surely not quite melodious  i confess i like the  sonnet in the last number of the review  the sonnet to england  please if you have not and i dont suppose you have already read  it institute a search in all melbourne for one of the rarest and  certainly one of the best of books  clarissa harlowe  for any man  who takes an interest in the problems of the two sexes that book  is a perfect mine of documents  and it is written sir with the  pen of an angel  miss howe and lovelace words cannot tell how  good they are  and the scene where clarissa beards her family  with her fan going all the while and some of the quarrel scenes  between her and lovelace and the scene where colonel marden goes  to mr hall with lord m trying to compose matters and the  colonel with his eternal finest woman in the world and the  inimitable affirmation of mowbray  nothing nothing could be  better  you will bless me when you read it for this  recommendation but indeed i can do nothing but recommend  clarissa  i am like that frenchman of the eighteenth century who  discovered habakkuk and would give no one peace about that  respectable hebrew  for my part i never was able to get over his  eminently respectable name isaiah is the boy if you must have a  prophet no less  about clarissa i meditate a choice work  a  dialogue on man woman and clarissa harlowe  it is to be so  clever that no array of terms can give you any idea and very  likely that particular array in which i shall finally embody it  less than any other  do you know my dear sir what i like best in your letter  the  egotism for which you thought necessary to apologise  i am a rogue  at egotism myself and to be plain i have rarely or never liked  any man who was not  the first step to discovering the beauties of  gods universe is usually a perhaps partial apprehension of such  of them as adorn our own characters  when i see a man who does not  think pretty well of himself i always suspect him of being in the  right  and besides if he does not like himself whom he has seen  how is he ever to like one whom he never can see but in dim and  artificial presentments  i cordially reciprocate your offer of a welcome it shall be at  least a warm one  are you not my first my only admirer  a dear  tie  besides you are a man of sense and you treat me as one by  writing to me as you do and that gives me pleasure also  please  continue to let me see your work  i have one or two things coming  out in the cornhill  a story called the sire de maletroits door  in temple bar and a series of articles on edinburgh in the  portfolio but i dont know if these last fly all the way to  melbourne  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    hotel des etrangers dieppe january 1 1878  my dear colvin  i am at the inland voyage again  have finished  another section and have only two more to execute  but one at  least of these will be very long  the longest in the book  being  a great digression on french artistic tramps  i only hope paul may  take the thing i want coin so badly and besides it would be  something done  something put outside of me and off my conscience  and i should not feel such a muff as i do if once i saw the thing  in boards with a ticket on its back  i think i shall frequent  circulating libraries a good deal  the preface shall stand over  as you suggest until the last and then sir we shall see  this  to be read with a big voice  this is new years day  let me my dear colvin wish you a very  good year free of all misunderstanding and bereavement and full  of good weather and good work  you know best what you have done  for me and so you will know best how heartily i mean this  ever  yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    paris january or february 1878  my dear colvin  many thanks for your letter  i was much  interested by all the edinburgh gossip  most likely i shall arrive  in london next week  i think you know all about the crane sketch  but it should be a river not a canal you know and the look  should be cruel lewd and kindly all at once  there is more  sense in that greek myth of pan than in any other that i recollect  except the luminous hebrew one of the fall  one of the biggest  things done  if people would remember that all religions are no  more than representations of life they would find them as they  are the best representations licking shakespeare  what an inconceivable cheese is alfred de musset  his comedies  are to my view the best work of france this century  a large  order  did you ever read them  they are real clear living work   ever yours  r l s    letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    paris 44 bd haussmann friday february 21 1878  my dear people  do you know who is my favourite author just now   how are the mighty fallen  anthony trollope  i batten on him he  is so nearly wearying you and yet he never does or rather he  never does until he gets near the end when he begins to wean you  from him so that youre as pleased to be done with him as you  thought you would be sorry  i wonder if its old age  it is a  little i am sure  a young person would get sickened by the dead  level of meanness and cowardliness you require to be a little  spoiled and cynical before you can enjoy it  i have just finished  the way of the world there is only one person in it  no there  are three  who are nice  the wild american woman and two of the  dissipated young men dolly and lord nidderdale  all the heroes  and heroines are just ghastly  but what a triumph is lady carbury   that is real sound strong genuine work  the man who could do  that if he had had courage might have written a fine book he has  preferred to write many readable ones  i meant to write such a  long nice letter but i cannot hold the pen  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    hotel du val de grace rue st jacques paris sunday june 1878  my dear mother  about criticisms i was more surprised at the  tone of the critics than i suppose any one else  and the effect it  has produced in me is one of shame  if they liked that so much i  ought to have given them something better thats all  and i shall  try to do so  still it strikes me as odd and i dont understand  the vogue  it should sell the thing  ever your affectionate son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    monastier september 1878  my dear mother  you must not expect to hear much from me for the  next two weeks for i am near starting  donkey purchased  a love   price 65 francs and a glass of brandy  my route is all pretty  well laid out i shall go near no town till i get to alais   remember poste restante alais gard  greyfriars will be in  october  you did not say whether you liked september you might  tell me that at alais  the other nos of edinburgh are   parliament close villa quarters which perhaps may not appear  calton hill winter and new year and to the pentland hills  tis  a kind of book nobody would ever care to read but none of the  young men could have done it better than i have which is always a  consolation  i read inland voyage the other day  what rubbish  these reviewers did talk  it is not badly written thin mildly  cheery and strained  selon moi  i mean to visit hamerton on my  return journey otherwise i should come by sea from marseilles  i  am very well known here now indeed quite a

october 1878  my dear mother  i have seen hamerton he was very kind all his  family seemed pleased to see an inland voyage and the book seemed  to be quite a household word with them  p g himself promised to  help me in my bargains with publishers which said he and i doubt  not very truthfully he could manage to much greater advantage than  i  he is also to read an inland voyage over again and send me his  cuts and cuffs in private after having liberally administered his  kisses coram publico  i liked him very much  of all the pleasant  parts of my profession i think the spirit of other men of letters  makes the pleasantest  do you know your sunset was very good  the attack to speak  learnedly was so plucky and odd  i have thought of it repeatedly  since  i have just made a delightful dinner by myself in the cafe  felix where i am an old established beggar and am just smoking a  cigar over my coffee  i came last night from autun and i am  muddled about my plans  the world is such a dance  ever your  affectionate son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w e henley    trinity college cambridge autumn 1878  my dear henley  here i am living like a fightingcock and have  not spoken to a real person for about sixty hours  those who wait  on me are not real  the man i know to be a myth because i have  seen him acting so often in the palais royal  he plays the duke in  tricoche et cacolet i knew his nose at once  the part he plays  here is very dull for him but conscientious  as for the bedmaker  shes a dream a kind of cheerful innocent nightmare i never saw  so poor an imitation of humanity  i cannot work  cannot  even  the guitar is still undone i can only write ditchwater  tis  ghastly but i am quite cheerful and that is more important  do  you think you could prepare the printers for a possible breakdown  this week  i shall try all i know on monday but if i can get  nothing better than i got this morning i prefer to drop a week   telegraph to me if you think it necessary  i shall not leave till  wednesday at soonest  shall write again  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    17 heriot row edinburgh april 16 1879  pool of siloam by el  dorado delectable mountains arcadia  my dear gosse  herewith of the dibbs  a homely fiver  how and  why do you continue to exist  i do so ill but for a variety of  reasons  first i wait an angel to come down and trouble the  waters second more angels third  well more angels  the waters  are sluggish the angels  well the angels wont come thats  about all  but i sit waiting and waiting and people bring me  meals which help to pass time im sure its very kind of them  and sometimes i whistle to myself and as theres a very pretty  echo at my pool of siloam the things agreeable to hear  the sun  continues to rise every day to my growing wonder  the moon by  night thee shall not smite  and the stars are all doing as well  as can be expected  the air of arcady is very brisk and pure and  we command many enchanting prospects in space and time  i do not  yet know much about my situation for to tell the truth i only  came here by the run since i began to write this letter i had to  go back to date it and i am grateful to you for having been the  occasion of this little outing  what good travellers we are if we  had only faith no man need stay in edinburgh but by unbelief my  religious organ has been ailing for a while past and i have lain a  great deal in edinburgh a sheer hulk in consequence  but i got  out my wings and have taken a change of air  i read your book with great interest and ought long ago to have  told you so  an ordinary man would say that he had been waiting  till he could pay his debts    the book is good reading  your  personal notes of those you saw struck me as perhaps most sharp and  best held  see as many people as you can and make a book of  them before you die  that will be a living book upon my word   you have the touch required  i ask you to put hands to it in  private already  think of what carlyles caricature of old  coleridge is to us who never saw s t c  with that and kubla  khan we have the man in the fact  carlyles picture of course  is not of the author of kubla but of the author of that surprising  friend which has knocked the breath out of two generations of  hopeful youth  your portraits would be milder sweeter more true  perhaps and perhaps not so truthtelling  if you will take my  meaning  i have to thank you for an introduction to that beautiful  no  thats not the word  that jolly with an arcadian jollity  thing  of vogelweides  also for your preface  some day i want to read a  whole book in the same picked dialect as that preface  i think it  must be one e w gosse who must write it  he has got himself into  a fix with me by writing the preface i look for a great deal and  will not be easily pleased  i never thought of it but my new book which should soon be out  contains a visit to a murder scene but not done as we should like  to see them for of course i was running another hare  if you do not answer this in four pages i shall stop the enclosed  fiver at the bank a step which will lead to your incarceration for  life  as my visits to arcady are somewhat uncertain you had  better address 17 heriot row edinburgh as usual  i shall walk  over for the note if i am not yet home  believe me very really  yours  robert louis stevenson  i charge extra for a flourish when it is successful this isnt so  you have it gratis  is there any news in babylon the great  my  fellowcreatures are electing school boards here in the midst of  the ages  it is very composed of them  i cant think why they do  it  nor why i have written a real letter  if you write a real  letter back damme ill try to correspond with you  a thing  unknown in this age  it is a consequence of the decay of faith we  cannot believe that the fellow will be at the pains to read us    letter  to w e henley    17 heriot row edinburgh april 1879  my dear henley  heavens have i done the like  clarify and  strain indeed  make it like marvell no less  ill tell you  what  you may go to the devil thats what i think  be eloquent  is another of your pregnant suggestions  i cannot sufficiently  thank you for that one  portrait of a person about to be eloquent  at the request of a literary friend  you seem to forget sir that  rhyme is rhyme sir and  go to the devil  ill try to improve it but i shant be able to  o go to the  devil  seriously youre a cool hand  and then you have the brass to ask  me why my steps went one by one   why  powers of man to rhyme  with sun to be sure  why else could it be  and you yourself have  been a poet  grrrrr  ill never be a poet any more  men are  so dd ungrateful and captious i declare i could weep   o henley in my hours of ease you may say anything you please but when i join the muses revel begad i wish you at the devil in vain my verse i plane and bevel like banvilles rhyming devotees in vain by many an artful swivel lug in my meaning by degrees im sure to hear my henley cavil and grovelling prostrate on my knees devote his body to the seas his correspondence to the devil   impromptu poem  im going to shandon hydropathic cum parentibus  write here  i  heard from lang  ferrier prayeth to be remembered he means to  write likes his tourgenieff greatly  also likes my what was on  the slate which under a new title yet unfound and with a new  and on the whole kindly denouement is going to shoot up and  become a star     i see i must write some more to you about my monastery  i am a  weak brother in verse  you ask me to rewrite things that i have  already managed just to write with the skin of my teeth  if i  dont rewrite them its because i dont see how to write them  better not because i dont think they should be  but curiously  enough you condemn two of my favourite passages one of which is  j w ferriers favourite of the whole  here i shall think its  you who are wrong  you see i did not try to make good verse but  to say what i wanted as well as verse would let me  i dont like  the rhyme ear and hear  but the couplet my undissuaded heart  i hear whisper courage in my ear is exactly what i want for the  thought and to me seems very energetic as speech if not as verse   would daring be better than courage  je me le demande  no it  would be ambiguous as though i had used it licentiously for  daringly and that would cloak the sense  in short your suggestions have broken the heart of the scald  he  doesnt agree with them all and those he does agree with the  spirit indeed is willing but the dd flesh cannot cannot cannot  see its way to profit by  i think ill lay it by for nine years  like horace  i think the well of castalys run out  no more the  muses round my pillow haunt  i am fallen once more to the mere  proser  god bless you  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    swanston lothianburn edinburgh july 24 1879  my dear gosse  i have greatly enjoyed your articles which seems  to me handsome in tone and written like a fine old english  gentleman  but is there not a hitch in the sentence at foot of  page 153  i get lost in it  chapters viii and ix of merediths story are very good i think   but who wrote the review of my book whoever he was he cannot  write he is humane but a duffer i could weep when i think of  him for surely to be virtuous and incompetent is a hard lot  i  should prefer to be a bold pirate the gay sailorboy of  immorality and a publisher at once  my mind is extinct my  appetite is expiring i have fallen altogether into a holloweyed  yawning way of life like the parties in burne joness pictures     talking of burns  is this not sad weg  i use the term of  reproach not because i am angry with you this time but because i  am angry with myself and desire to give pain  talking i say of  robert burns the inspired poet is a very gay subject for study  i  made a kind of chronological table of his various loves and lusts  and have been comparatively speechless ever since  i am sorry to  say it but there was something in him of the vulgar bagmanlike  professional seducer  oblige me by taking down and reading for  the hundredth time i hope his twa dogs and his address to the  unco guid  i am only a scotchman after all you see and when i  have beaten burns i am driven at once by my parental feelings to  console him with a sugarplum  but hang me if i know anything i  like so well as the twa dogs  even a common englishman may have  a glimpse as it were from pisgah of its extraordinary merits  english the   a dull people incapable of comprehending the  scottish tongue  their history is so intimately connected with  that of scotland that we must refer our readers to that heading   their literature is principally the work of venal scots   stevensons handy cyclopaedia  glescow  blaikie  bannock  remember me in suitable fashion to mrs gosse the offspring and  the cat  and believe me ever yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    17 heriot row edinburgh july 28 1879  my dear colvin  i am just in the middle of your rembrandt  the  taste for bummkopf and his works is agreeably dissembled so far as  i have gone and the reins have never for an instant been thrown  upon the neck of that wooden pegasus he only perks up a learned  snout from a footnote in the cellarage of a paragraph just in  short where he ought to be to inspire confidence in a wicked and  adulterous generation  but mind you bummkopf is not human he is  dagon the fish god and down he will come sprawling on his belly  or his behind with his hands broken from his helpless carcase and  his head rolling off into a corner  up will rise on the other  side sane pleasurable human knowledge  a thing of beauty and a  joy etc  im three parts through burns long dry unsympathetic but sound  and i think in its dry way interesting  next i shall finish the  story and then perhaps thoreau  meredith has been staying with  morley who is about it is believed to write to me on a literary  scheme  is it keats hope you  my heart leaps at the thought   yours ever  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    17 heriot row edinburgh july 29 1879  my dear gosse  yours was delicious you are a young person of  wit one of the last of them wit being quite out of date and  humour confined to the scotch church and the spectator in  unconscious survival  you will probably be glad to hear that i am  up again in the world i have breathed again and had a frolic on  the strength of it  the frolic was yesterday sawbath the scene  the royal hotel bathgate i went there with a humorous friend to  lunch  the maid soon showed herself a lass of character  she was  looking out of window  on being asked what she was after im  lookin for my lad says she  is that him  weel ive been  lookin for him a my life and ive never seen him yet was the  response  i wrote her some verses in the vernacular she read  them  theyre no bad for a beginner said she  the landlords  daughter miss stewart was present in oil colour so i wrote her a  declaration in verse and sent it by the handmaid  she miss s  was present on the stair to witness our departure in a warm  suffused condition  damn it gosse you neednt suppose that  youre the only poet in the world  your statement about your initials it will be seen i pass over in  contempt and silence  when once i have made up my mind let me  tell you sir there lives no pockpudding who can change it  your  anger i defy  your unmanly reference to a wellknown statesman i  puff from me sir like so much vapour  weg is your name weg  w  e g  my enthusiasm has kind of dropped from me  i envy you your wife  your home your child  i was going to say your cat  there would  be cats in my home too if i could but get it  i may seem to you  the impersonation of life but my life is the impersonation of  waiting and thats a poor creature  god help us all and the deil  be kind to the hindmost  upon my word we are a brave cheery  crew we human beings and my admiration increases daily   primarily for myself but by a roundabout process for the whole  crowd for i dare say they have all their poor little secrets and  anxieties  and here am i for instance writing to you as if you  were in the seventh heaven and yet i know you are in a sad anxiety  yourself  i hope earnestly it will soon be over and a fine pink  gosse sprawling in a tub and a mother in the best of health and  spirits glad and tired and with another interest in life  man  you are out of the trouble when this is through  a first child is  a rival but a second is only a rival to the first and the husband  stands his ground and may keep married all his life  a  consummation heartily to be desired  goodbye gosse  write me a  witty letter with good news of the mistress  r l s     chapter iv  the amateur emigrant monterey and san francisco july  1879july 1880     letter  to sidney colvin    on board ss devonia an hour or two out of new york august  1879  my dear colvin  i have finished my story  the handwriting is not  good because of the ships misconduct  thirtyone pages in ten  days at sea is not bad  i shall write a general procuration about this story on another bit  of paper  i am not very well bad food bad air and hard work  have brought me down  but the spirits keep good  the voyage has  been most interesting and will make if not a series of pall mall  articles at least the first part of a new book  the last weight  on me has been trying to keep notes for this purpose  indeed i  have worked like a horse and am now as tired as a donkey  if i  should have to push on far by rail i shall bring nothing but my  fine bones to port  goodbye to you all  i suppose it is now late afternoon with you  and all across the seas  what shall i find over there  i dare not  wonder  ever yours  r l s  ps  i go on my way tonight if i can if not tomorrow   emigrant train ten to fourteen days journey warranted extreme  discomfort  the only american institution which has yet won my  respect is the rain  one sees it is a new country they are so  free with their water  i have been steadily drenched for twenty four hours waterproof wet through immortal spirit fitfully  blinking up in spite  bought a copy of my own work and the man  said by stevenson  indeed says i  yes sir says he   scene closes    letter  to sidney colvin    in the emigrant train from new york to san francisco august  1879  dear colvin  i am in the cars between pittsburgh and chicago  just now bowling through ohio  i am taking charge of a kid whose  mother is asleep with one eye while i write you this with the  other  i reached ny sunday night and by five oclock monday was  under way for the west  it is now about ten on wednesday morning  so i have already been about forty hours in the cars  it is  impossible to lie down in them which must end by being very  wearying  i had no idea how easy it was to commit suicide  there seems  nothing left of me i died a while ago i do not know who it is  that is travelling   of where or how i nothing know and why i do not care enough if even so my travelling eyes my travelling mind can go by flood and field and hill by wood and meadow fair beside the susquehannah and along the delaware i think i hope i dream no more the dreams of otherwhere the cherished thoughts of yore i have been changed from what i was before and drunk too deep perchance the lotus of the air beside the susquehannah and along the delaware unweary god me yet shall bring to lands of brighter air where i now half a king shall with enfranchised spirit loudlier sing and wear a bolder front than that which now i wear beside the susquehannah and along the delaware   exit muse hurried by childs games     have at you again being now well through indiana  in america you  eat better than anywhere else  fact  the food is heavenly  no man is any use until he has dared everything i feel just now as  if i had and so might become a man  if ye have faith like a  grain of mustard seed  that is so true just now i have faith as  big as a cigarcase i will not say die and do not fear man nor  fortune  r l s    letter  to w e henley    crossing nebraska saturday august 23 1879  my dear henley  i am sitting on the top of the cars with a mill  party from missouri going west for his health  desolate flat  prairie upon all hands  here and there a herd of cattle a yellow  butterfly or two a patch of wild sunflowers a wooden house or  two then a wooden church alone in miles of waste then a windmill  to pump water  when we stop which we do often for emigrants and  freight travel together the kine first the men after the whole  plain is heard singing with cicadae  this is a pause as you may  see from the writing  what happened to the old pedestrian  emigrants what was the tedium suffered by the indians and trappers  of our youth the imagination trembles to conceive  this is now  saturday 23rd and i have been steadily travelling since i parted  from you at st pancras  it is a strange vicissitude from the  savile club to this i sleep with a man from pennsylvania who has  been in the states navy and mess with him and the missouri bird  already alluded to  we have a tin washbowl among four  i wear  nothing but a shirt and a pair of trousers and never button my  shirt  when i land for a meal i pass my coat and feel dressed   this life is to last till friday saturday or sunday next  it is  a strange affair to be an emigrant as i hope you shall see in a  future work  i wonder if this will be legible my present station  on the waggon roof though airy compared to the cars is both dirty  and insecure  i can see the track straight before and straight  behind me to either horizon  peace of mind i enjoy with extreme  serenity i am doing right i know no one will think so and dont  care  my body however is all to whistles i dont eat but man  i can sleep  the car in front of mine is chock full of chinese  monday  what it is to be ill in an emigrant train let those  declare who know  i slept none till late in the morning overcome  with laudanum of which i had luckily a little bottle  all today  i have eaten nothing and only drunk two cups of tea for each of  which on the pretext that the one was breakfast and the other  dinner i was charged fifty cents  our journey is through ghostly  deserts sage brush and alkali and rocks without form or colour  a sad corner of the world  i confess i am not jolly but mighty  calm in my distresses  my illness is a subject of great mirth to  some of my fellowtravellers and i smile rather sickly at their  jests  we are going along bitter creek just now a place infamous in the  history of emigration a place i shall remember myself among the  blackest  i hope i may get this posted at ogden utah  r l s    letter   to sidney colvin    coast line mountains california september 1879  here is another curious start in my life  i am living at an angora  goatranche in the coast line mountains eighteen miles from  monterey  i was camping out but got so sick that the two  rancheros took me in and tended me  one is an old bearhunter  seventytwo years old and a captain from the mexican war the  other a pilgrim and one who was out with the bear flag and under  fremont when california was taken by the states  they are both  true frontiersmen and most kind and pleasant  captain smith the  bearhunter is my physician and i obey him like an oracle  the business of my life stands pretty nigh still  i work at my  notes of the voyage  it will not be very like a book of mine but  perhaps none the less successful for that  i will not deny that i  feel lonely today but i do not fear to go on for i am doing  right  i have not yet had a word from england partly i suppose  because i have not yet written for my letters to new york do not  blame me for this neglect if you knew all i have been through you  would wonder i had done so much as i have  i teach the ranche  children reading in the morning for the mother is from home sick   ever your affectionate friend  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    monterey ditto co california 21st october 1879  my dear colvin  although you have absolutely disregarded my  plaintive appeals for correspondence and written only once as  against god knows how many notes and notikins of mine  here goes  again  i am now all alone in monterey a real inhabitant with a  box of my own at the po  i have splendid rooms at the doctors  where i get coffee in the morning the doctor is french and i  mess with another jolly old frenchman the stranded fiftyeight yearold wreck of a goodhearted dissipated and once wealthy  nantais tradesman  my health goes on better as for work the  draft of my book was laid aside at p 68 or so and i have now by  way of change more than seventy pages of a novel a onevolume  novel alas to be called either a chapter in experience of arizona  breckonridge or a vendetta in the west or a combination of the  two  the scene from chapter iv to the end lies in monterey and  the adjacent country of course with my usual luck the plot of  the story is somewhat scandalous containing an illegitimate father  for piece of resistance     ever yours  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    monterey california september 1879  my dear colvin  i received your letter with delight it was the  first word that reached me from the old country  i am in good  health now i have been pretty seedy for i was exhausted by the  journey and anxiety below even my point of keeping up i am still a  little weak but that is all i begin to ingrease it seems  already  my book is about half drafted  the amateur emigrant  that is  can you find a better name  i believe it will be more  popular than any of my others the canvas is so much more popular  and larger too  fancy it is my fourth  that voluminous writer   i was vexed to hear about the last chapter of the lie and  pleased to hear about the rest it would have been odd if it had no  birthmark born where and how it was  it should by rights have  been called the devonia for that is the habit with all children  born in a steerage  i write to you hoping for more  give me news of all who concern  me near or far or big or little  here sir in california you  have a willing hearer  monterey is a place where there is no summer or winter and pines  and sand and distant hills and a bay all filled with real water  from the pacific  you will perceive that no expense has been  spared  i now live with a little french doctor i take one of my  meals in a little french restaurant for the other two i sponge   the population of monterey is about that of a dissenting chapel on  a wet sunday in a strong church neighbourhood  they are mostly  mexican and indianmixed  ever yours  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    monterey monterey co california 8th october 1879  my dear weg  i know i am a rogue and the son of a dog  yet let  me tell you when i came here i had a weeks misery and a  fortnights illness and since then i have been more or less busy  in being content  this is a kind of excuse for my laziness  i  hope you will not excuse yourself  my plans are still very  uncertain and it is not likely that anything will happen before  christmas  in the meanwhile i believe i shall live on here  between the sandhills and the sea as i think mr swinburne hath  it  i was pretty nearly slain my spirit lay down and kicked for  three days i was up at an angora goatranche in the santa lucia  mountains nursed by an old frontiersman a mighty hunter of  bears and i scarcely slept or ate or thought for four days  two  nights i lay out under a tree in a sort of stupor doing nothing  but fetch water for myself and horse light a fire and make coffee  and all night awake hearing the goatbells ringing and the tree frogs singing when each new noise was enough to set me mad  then  the bearhunter came round pronounced me real sick and ordered  me up to the ranche  it was an odd miserable piece of my life and according to all  rule it should have been my death but after a while my spirit got  up again in a divine frenzy and has since kicked and spurred my  vile body forward with great emphasis and success  my new book the amateur emigrant is about half drafted  i dont  know if it will be good but i think it ought to sell in spite of  the deil and the publishers for it tells an odd enough experience  and one i think never yet told before  look for my burns in  the cornhill and for my story of a lie in pauls withered babe  the new quarterly  you may have seen the latter ere this reaches  you  tell me if it has any interest like a good boy and remember  that it was written at sea in great anxiety of mind  what is your  news  send me your works like an angel au fur et a mesure of  their apparition for i am naturally short of literature and i do  not wish to rust  i fear this can hardly be called a letter  to say truth i feel  already a difficulty of approach i do not know if i am the same  man i was in europe perhaps i can hardly claim acquaintance with  you  my head went round and looks another way now for when i  found myself over here in a new land and all the past uprooted in  the one tug and i neither feeling glad nor sorry i got my last  lesson about mankind i mean my latest lesson for of course i do  not know what surprises there are yet in store for me  but that i  could have so felt astonished me beyond description  there is a  wonderful callousness in human nature which enables us to live  i  had no feeling one way or another from new york to california  until at dutch flat a mining camp in the sierra i heard a cock  crowing with a home voice and then i fell to hope and regret both  in the same moment  is there a boy or a girl and how is your wife  i thought of you  more than once to put it mildly  i live here comfortably enough but i shall soon be left all alone  perhaps till christmas  then you may hope for correspondence  and  may not i  your friend  r l s    letter  to w e henley    monterey california october 1879  my dear henley  herewith the pavilion on the links grand  carpentry story in nine chapters and i should hesitate to say how  many tableaux  where is it to go  god knows  it is the dibbs  that are wanted  it is not bad though i say it carpentry of  course but not bad at that and who else can carpenter in england  now that wilkie collins is played out  it might be broken for  magazine purposes at the end of chapter iv  i send it to you as i  dare say payn may help if all else fails  dibbs and speed are my  mottoes  do acknowledge the pavilion by return  i shall be so nervous till  i hear as of course i have no copy except of one or two places  where the vein would not run  god prosper it poor pavilion  may  it bring me money for myself and my sick one who may read it i do  not know how soon  love to your wife anthony and all  i shall write to colvin today  or tomorrow  yours ever  r l s    letter  to w e henley    monterey california october 1879  my dear henley  many thanks for your good letter which is the  best way to forgive you for your previous silence  i hope colvin  or somebody has sent me the cornhill and the new quarterly though  i am trying to get them in san francisco  i think you might have  sent me 1 some of your articles in the p m g 2 a paper with  the announcement of second edition and 3 the announcement of the  essays in athenaeum  this to prick you in the future  again  choose in your head the best volume of labiche there is and post  it to jules simoneau monterey monterey co california  do this  at once as he is my restaurant man a most pleasant old boy with  whom i discuss the universe and play chess daily  he has been out  of france for thirtyfive years and never heard of labiche  i  have eightythree pages written of a story called a vendetta in the  west and about sixty pages of the first draft of the amateur  emigrant  they should each cover from 130 to 150 pages when done   that is all my literary news  do keep me posted wont you  your  letter and bobs made the fifth and sixth i have had from europe in  three months  at times i get terribly frightened about my work which seems to  advance too slowly  i hope soon to have a greater burthen to  support and must make money a great deal quicker than i used  i  may get nothing for the vendetta i may only get some forty quid  for the emigrant i cannot hope to have them both done much before  the end of november  o and look here why did you not send me the spectator which  slanged me  rogues and rascals is that all you are worth  yesterday i set fire to the forest for which had i been caught i  should have been hung out of hand to the nearest tree judge lynch  being an active person hereaway  you should have seen my retreat  which was entirely for strategical purposes  i ran like hell   it was a fine sight  at night i went out again to see it it was a  good fire though i say it that should not  i had a near escape  for my life with a revolver  i fired six charges and the six  bullets all remained in the barrel which was choked from end to  end from muzzle to breach with solid lead it took a man three  hours to drill them out  another shot and id have gone to  kingdom come  this is a lovely place which i am growing to love  the pacific  licks all other oceans out of hand there is no place but the  pacific coast to hear eternal roaring surf  when i get to the top  of the woods behind monterey i can hear the seas breaking all  round over ten or twelve miles of coast from near carmel on my  left out to point pinas in front and away to the right along the  sands of monterey to castroville and the mouth of the salinas  i  was wishing yesterday that the world could get  no what i mean  was that you should be kept in suspense like mahomets coffin until  the world had made half a revolution then dropped here at the  station as though you had stepped from the cars you would then  comfortably enter walters waggon the sun has just gone down the  moon beginning to throw shadows you hear the surf rolling and  smell the sea and the pines  that shall deposit you at sanchezs  saloon where we take a drink you are introduced to bronson the  local editor i have no brain music he says im a mechanic  you see but hes a nice fellow to adolpho sanchez who is  delightful  meantime i go to the p o for my mail thence we walk  up alvarado street together you now floundering in the sand now  merrily stumping on the wooden sidewalks i call at hadsells for  my paper at length behold us installed in simoneaus little white washed backroom round a dirty tablecloth with francois the  baker perhaps an italian fisherman perhaps augustin dutra and  simoneau himself  simoneau francois and i are the three sure  cards the others mere waifs  then home to my great airy rooms  with five windows opening on a balcony i sleep on the floor in my  camp blankets you instal yourself abed in the morning coffee with  the little doctor and his little wife we hire a waggon and make a  day of it and by night i should let you up again into the air to  be returned to mrs henley in the forenoon following  by god you  would enjoy yourself  so should i  i have tales enough to keep  you going till five in the morning and then they would not be at  an end  i forget if you asked me any questions and i sent your  letter up to the city to one who will like to read it  i expect  other letters now steadily  if i have to wait another two months  i shall begin to be happy  will you remember me most  affectionately to your wife  shake hands with anthony from me and  god bless your mother  god bless stephen  does he not know that i am a man and cannot  live by bread alone but must have guineas into the bargain   burns i believe in my own mind is one of my highwater marks  meiklejohn flames me a letter about it which is so complimentary  that i must keep it or get it published in the monterey  californian  some of these days i shall send an exemplaire of that  paper it is huge  ever your affectionate friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to p g hamerton    monterey california november 1879  my dear mr hamerton  your letter to my father was forwarded to  me by mistake and by mistake i opened it  the letter to myself  has not yet reached me  this must explain my own and my fathers  silence  i shall write by this or next post to the only friends i  have who i think would have an influence as they are both  professors  i regret exceedingly that i am not in edinburgh as i  could perhaps have done more and i need not tell you that what i  might do for you in the matter of the election is neither from  friendship nor gratitude but because you are the only man i beg  your pardon worth a damn  i shall write to a third friend now i  think of it whose father will have great influence  i find here of all places in the world your essays on art which  i have read with signal interest  i believe i shall dig an essay  of my own out of one of them for it set me thinking if mine could  only produce yet another in reply we could have the marrow out  between us  i hope my dear sir you will not think badly of me for my long  silence  my head has scarce been on my shoulders  i had scarce  recovered from a long fit of useless illhealth than i was whirled  over here doublequick time and by cheapest conveyance  i have been since pretty ill but pick up though still somewhat of  a mossy ruin  if you would view my countenance aright come  view  it by the pale moonlight  but that is on the mend  i believe i  have now a distant claim to tan  a letter will be more than welcome in this distant clime where i  have a box at the postoffice  generally i regret to say empty   could your recommendation introduce me to an american publisher   my next book i should really try to get hold of here as its  interest is international and the more i am in this country the  more i understand the weight of your influence  it is pleasant to  be thus most at home abroad above all when the prophet is still  not without honour in his own land       letter  to edmund gosse    monterey california 15th november 1879  my dear gosse  your letter was to me such a bright spot that i  answer it right away to the prejudice of other correspondents or  dants dont know how to spell it who have prior claims    it  is the history of our kindnesses that alone makes this world  tolerable  if it were not for that for the effect of kind words  kind looks kind letters multiplying spreading making one happy  through another and bringing forth benefits some thirty some  fifty some a thousandfold i should be tempted to think our life a  practical jest in the worst possible spirit  so your four pages  have confirmed my philosophy as well as consoled my heart in these  ill hours  yes you are right monterey is a pleasant place but i see i can  write no more tonight  i am tired and sad and being already in  bed have no more to do but turn out the light  your affectionate  friend  r l s  i try it again by daylight  once more in bed however for today  it is mucho frio as we spaniards say and i had no other means of  keeping warm for my work  i have done a good spell 9 and a half  foolscap pages at least 8 of cornhill ah if i thought that i  could get eight guineas for it  my trouble is that i am all too  ambitious just now  a book whereof 70 out of 120 are scrolled  a  novel whereof 85 out of say 140 are pretty well nigh done  a  short story of 50 pp which shall be finished tomorrow or ill  know the reason why  this may bring in a lot of money  but i  dread to think that it is all on three chances  if the three were  to fail i am in a bog  the novel is called a vendetta in the  west  i see i am in a grasping dismal humour and should as we  americans put it quit writing  in truth i am so haunted by  anxieties that one or other is sure to come up in all that i write  i will send you herewith a monterey paper where the works of r l  s appear nor only that but all my life on studying the  advertisements will become clear  i lodge with dr heintz take my  meals with simoneau have been only two days ago shaved by the  tonsorial artist michaels drink daily at the bohemia saloon get  my daily paper from hadsels was stood a drink today by albano  rodriguez in short there is scarce a person advertised in that  paper but i know him and i may add scarce a person in monterey but  is there advertised  the paper is the marrow of the place  its  bones  pooh i am tired of writing so sillily  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    monterey december 1879  today my dear colvin i send you the first part of the amateur  emigrant 71 pp by far the longest and the best of the whole  it  is not a monument of eloquence indeed i have sought to be prosaic  in view of the nature of the subject but i almost think it is  interesting  whatever is done about any book publication two things remember   i must keep a royalty and second i must have all my books  advertised in the french manner on the leaf opposite the title   i know from my own experience how much good this does an author  with book buyers  the entire a e will be a little longer than the two others but  not very much  here and there i fancy you will laugh as you read  it but it seems to me rather a clever book than anything else   the book of a man that is who has paid a great deal of attention  to contemporary life and not through the newspapers  i have never seen my burns the darling of my heart  i await your  promised letter  papers magazines articles by friends reviews  of myself all would be very welcome i am reporter for the  monterey californian at a salary of two dollars a week  comment  trouvezvous ca  i am also in a conspiracy with the american  editor a french restaurantman and an italian fisherman against  the padre  the enclosed poster is my last literary appearance  it  was put up to the number of 200 exemplaires at the witching hour  and they were almost all destroyed by eight in the morning  but i  think the nickname will stick  dos reales deux reaux two bits  twentyfive cents about a shilling but in practice it is worth  from ninepence to threepence  thus two glasses of beer would cost  two bits  the italian fisherman an old garibaldian is a splendid  fellow  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    monterey monterey co california dec 8 1879  my dear weg  i received your book last night as i lay abed with a  pleurisy the result i fear of overwork gradual decline of  appetite etc  you know what a woodenhearted curmudgeon i am  about contemporary verse  i like none of it except some of my  own  i look back on that sentence with pleasure it comes from an  honest heart  hence you will be kind enough to take this from me  in a kindly spirit the piece to my daughter is delicious  and  yet even here i am going to pick holes  i am a beastly curmudgeon   it is the last verse  newly budded is off the venue and havent  you gone ahead to make a poetry daybreak instead of sticking to  your muttons and comparing with the mysterious light of stars the  plain friendly perspicuous human day  but this is to be a  beast  the little poem is eminently pleasant human and original  i have read nearly the whole volume and shall read it nearly all  over again you have no rivals  bancrofts history of the united states even in a centenary  edition is essentially heavy fare a little goes a long way i  respect bancroft but i do not love him he has moments when he  feels himself inspired to open up his improvisations upon universal  history and the designs of god but i flatter myself i am more  nearly acquainted with the latter than mr bancroft  a man in the  words of my plymouth brother who knows the lord must needs  from time to time write less emphatically  it is a fetter dance  to the music of minute guns  not at sea but in a region not a  thousand miles from the sahara  still i am halfway through  volume three and shall count myself unworthy of the name of an  englishman if i do not see the back of volume six  the countryman  of livingstone burton speke drake cook etc  i have been sweated not only out of my pleuritic fever but out of  all my eating cares and the better part of my brains strange  coincidence by aconite  i have that peculiar and delicious  sense of being born again in an expurgated edition which belongs to  convalescence  it will not be for long i hear the breakers roar  i shall be steering head first for another rapid before many days  nitor aquis said a certain eton boy translating for his sins a  part of the inland voyage into latin elegiacs and from the hour i  saw it or rather a friend of mine the admirable jenkin saw and  recognised its absurd appropriateness i took it for my device in  life  i am going for thirty now and unless i can snatch a little  rest before long i have i may tell you in confidence no hope of  seeing thirtyone  my health began to break last winter and has  given me but fitful times since then  this pleurisy though but a  slight affair in itself was a huge disappointment to me and marked  an epoch  to start a pleurisy about nothing while leading a dull  regular life in a mild climate was not my habit in past days and  it is six years all but a few months since i was obliged to spend  twentyfour hours in bed  i may be wrong but if the niting is to  continue i believe i must go  it is a pity in one sense for i  believe the class of work i might yet give out is better and more  real and solid than people fancy  but death is no bad friend a  few aches and gasps and we are done like the truant child i am  beginning to grow weary and timid in this big jostling city and  could run to my nurse even although she should have to whip me  before putting me to bed  will you kiss your little daughter from me and tell her that her  father has written a delightful poem about her  remember me  please to mrs gosse to middlemore to whom some of these days i  will write to  to  yes to  and to   i know you will gnash  your teeth at some of these wicked grim catlike old poet  if i  were god i would sort you  as we say in scotland  your sincere  friend  r l s  too young to be our child  blooming good    letter  to sidney colvin    608 bush street san francisco december 26 1879  my dear colvin  i am now writing to you in a cafe waiting for  some music to begin  for four days i have spoken to no one but to  my landlady or landlord or to restaurant waiters  this is not a  gay way to pass christmas is it and i must own the guts are a  little knocked out of me  if i could work i could worry through  better  but i have no style at command for the moment with the  second part of the emigrant the last of the novel the essay on  thoreau and god knows all waiting for me  but i trust something  can be done with the first part or by god ill starve here       o colvin you dont know how much good i have done myself  i  feared to think this out by myself  i have made a base use of you  and it comes out so much better than i had dreamed  but i have to  stick to work now and heres december gone pretty near useless   but lord love you october and november saw a great harvest  it  might have affected the price of paper on the pacific coast  as  for ink they havent any not what i call ink only stuff to write  cookerybooks with or the works of hayley or the pallid  perambulations of the  i can find nobody to beat hayley  i like  good knockmedown blackstrap to write with that makes a mark  and done with it  by the way i have tried to read the spectator  which they all say i imitate and  its very wrong of me i know   but i cant  its all very fine you know and all that but its  vapid  they have just played the overture to norma and i know  its a good one for i bitterly wanted the opera to go on i had  just got thoroughly interested  and then no curtain to rise  i have written myself into a kind of spirits bless your dear  heart by your leave  but this is wild work for me nearly nine  and me not back  what will mrs carson think of me  quite a  nighthawk i do declare  you are the worst correspondent in the  world  no not that henley is that  well i dont know i leave  the pair of you to him that made you  surely with small attention   but heres my service and ill away home to my den o much the  better for this crack professor colvin  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    608 bush street san francisco january 10 1880  my dear colvin  this is a circular letter to tell my estate  fully  you have no right to it being the worst of correspondents  but i wish to efface the impression of my last so to you it goes  any time between eight and halfpast nine in the morning a slender  gentleman in an ulster with a volume buttoned into the breast of  it may be observed leaving no 608 bush and descending powell with  an active step  the gentleman is r l s the volume relates to  benjamin franklin on whom he meditates one of his charming essays   he descends powell crosses market and descends in sixth on a  branch of the original pine street coffee house no less i believe  he would be capable of going to the original itself if he could  only find it  in the branch he seats himself at a table covered  with waxcloth and a pampered menial of highdutch extraction and  indeed as yet only partially extracted lays before him a cup of  coffee a roll and a pat of butter all to quote the deity very  good  a while ago and r l s used to find the supply of butter  insufficient but he has now learned the art to exactitude and  butter and roll expire at the same moment  for this refection he  pays ten cents or five pence sterling 0 pounds 0s 5d  half an hour later the inhabitants of bush street observe the same  slender gentleman armed like george washington with his little  hatchet splitting kindling and breaking coal for his fire  he  does this quasipublicly upon the windowsill but this is not to  be attributed to any love of notoriety though he is indeed vain of  his prowess with the hatchet which he persists in calling an axe  and daily surprised at the perpetuation of his fingers  the reason  is this  that the sill is a strong supporting beam and that  blows of the same emphasis in other parts of his room might knock  the entire shanty into hell  thenceforth for from three to four  hours he is engaged darkly with an inkbottle  yet he is not  blacking his boots for the only pair that he possesses are  innocent of lustre and wear the natural hue of the material turned  up with caked and venerable slush  the youngest child of his  landlady remarks several times a day as this strange occupant  enters or quits the house deres de author  can it be that this  brighthaired innocent has found the true clue to the mystery  the  being in question is at least poor enough to belong to that  honourable craft  his next appearance is at the restaurant of one donadieu in bush  street between dupont and kearney where a copious meal half a  bottle of wine coffee and brandy may be procured for the sum of  four bits alias fifty cents 0 pounds 2s 2d sterling  the  wine is put down in a whole bottleful and it is strange and  painful to observe the greed with which the gentleman in question  seeks to secure the last drop of his allotted half and the  scrupulousness with which he seeks to avoid taking the first drop  of the other  this is partly explained by the fact that if he were  to go over the mark  bang would go a tenpence  he is again armed  with a book but his best friends will learn with pain that he  seems at this hour to have deserted the more serious studies of the  morning  when last observed he was studying with apparent zest  the exploits of one rocambole by the late viscomte ponson du  terrail  this work originally of prodigious dimensions he had  cut into liths or thicknesses apparently for convenience of  carriage  then the being walks where is not certain  but by about halfpast  four a light beams from the windows of 608 bush and he may be  observed sometimes engaged in correspondence sometimes once again  plunged in the mysterious rites of the forenoon  about six he  returns to the branch original where he once more imbrues himself  to the worth of fivepence in coffee and roll  the evening is  devoted to writing and reading and by eleven or halfpast darkness  closes over this weird and truculent existence  as for coin you see i dont spend much only you and henley both  seem to think my work rather bosh nowadays and i do want to make  as much as i was making that is 200 pounds if i can do that i  can swim  last year with my ill health i touched only 109 pounds  that would not do i could not fight it through on that but on 200  pounds as i say i am good for the world and can even in this  quiet way save a little and that i must do  the worst is my  health it is suspected i had an ague chill yesterday i shall know  by tomorrow and you know if i am to be laid down with ague the  game is pretty well lost  but i dont know i managed to write a  good deal down in monterey when i was pretty sickly most of the  time and by god ill try ague and all  i have to ask you  frankly when you write to give me any good news you can and chat  a little but just in the meantime give me no bad  if i could get  thoreau emigrant and vendetta all finished and out of my hand i  should feel like a man who had made half a years income in a half  year but until the two last are finished you see they dont  fairly count  i am afraid i bore you sadly with this perpetual talk about my  affairs i will try and stow it but you see it touches me nearly   im the miser in earnest now  last night when i felt so ill the  supposed ague chill it seemed strange not to be able to afford a  drink  i would have walked half a mile tired as i felt for a  brandy and soda  ever yours  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    608 bush street san francisco jan 26 80  my dear charles  i have to drop from a 50 cent to a 25 cent  dinner today begins my fall  that brings down my outlay in food  and drink to 45 cents or 1s 10 and a half d per day  how are  the mighty fallen  luckily this is such a cheap place for food i  used to pay as much as that for my first breakfast in the savile in  the grand old palmy days of yore  i regret nothing and do not  even dislike these straits though the flesh will rebel on  occasion  it is today bitter cold after weeks of lovely warm  weather and i am all in a chitter  i am about to issue for my  little shilling and halfpenny meal taken in the middle of the day  the poor mans hour and i shall eat and drink to your prosperity   ever yours  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    608 bush street san francisco california january 1880  my dear colvin  i received this morning your long letter from  paris  well gods will be done if its dull its dull it was a  fair fight and its lost and theres an end  but fortunately  dulness is not a fault the public hates perhaps they may like this  vein of dulness  if they dont damn them well try them with  another  i sat down on the back of your letter and wrote twelve  cornhill pages this day as ever was of that same despised emigrant  so you see my moral courage has not gone down with my intellect   only frankly colvin do you think it a good plan to be so  eminently descriptive and even eloquent in dispraise  you rolled  such a lot of polysyllables over me that a better man than i might  have been disheartened  however i was not as you see and am  not  the emigrant shall be finished and leave in the course of  next week  and then ill stick to stories  i am not frightened   i know my mind is changing i have been telling you so for long  and i suppose i am fumbling for the new vein  well ill find it  the vendetta you will not much like i dare say  and that must be  finished next but ill knock you with the forest state  a  romance  im vexed about my letters i know it is painful to get these  unsatisfactory things but at least i have written often enough   and not one soul ever gives me any news about people or things  everybody writes me sermons its good for me but hardly the food  necessary for a man who lives all alone on fortyfive cents a day  and sometimes less with quantities of hard work and many heavy  thoughts  if one of you could write me a letter with a jest in it  a letter like what is written to real people in this world  i am  still flesh and blood  i should enjoy it  simpson did the other  day and it did me as much good as a bottle of wine  a lonely man  gets to feel like a pariah after awhile  or no not that but like  a saint and martyr or a kind of macerated clergyman with pebbles  in his boots a pillared simeon im damned if i know what but  man alive i want gossip  my health is better my spirits steadier i am not the least cast  down  if the emigrant was a failure the pavilion by your leave  was not  it was a story quite adequately and rightly done i  contend and when i find stephen for whom certainly i did not mean  it taking it in i am better pleased with it than before  i know  i shall do better work than ever i have done before but mind you  it will not be like it  my sympathies and interests are changed   there shall be no more books of travel for me  i care for nothing  but the moral and the dramatic not a jot for the picturesque or  the beautiful other than about people  it bored me hellishly to  write the emigrant well its going to bore others to read it  thats only fair  i should also write to others but indeed i am jacktired and must  go to bed to a french novel to compose myself for slumber  ever  your affectionate friend  r l s    letter  to w e henley    608 bush street san francisco cal february 1880  my dear henley  before my work or anything i sit down to answer  your long and kind letter  i am well cheerful busy hopeful i cannot be knocked down i do  not mind about the emigrant  i never thought it a masterpiece  it  was written to sell and i believe it will sell and if it does  not the next will  you need not be uneasy about my work i am  only beginning to see my true method  1 as to studies  there are two more already gone to stephen  yoshida torajiro which i think temperate and adequate and  thoreau which will want a really balzacian effort over the proofs   but i want benjamin franklin and the art of virtue to follow and  perhaps also william penn but this last may be perhaps delayed for  another volume  i think not though  the studies will be an  intelligent volume and in their latter numbers more like what i  mean to be my style or i mean what my style means to be for i am  passive  2 the essays  good news indeed  i think ordered south  must be thrown in  it always swells the volume and it will never  find a more appropriate place  it was may 1874 macmillan i  believe  3 plays  i did not understand you meant to try the  draft  i shall make you a full scenario as soon as the emigrant is  done  4 emigrant  he shall be sent off next week  5 stories   you need not be alarmed that i am going to imitate meredith  you  know i was a storyteller ingrain did not that reassure you  the  vendetta which falls next to be finished is not entirely  pleasant  but it has points  the forest state or the greenwood  state  a romance is another pair of shoes  it is my old  semiramis our halfseen duke and duchess which suddenly sprang  into sunshine clearness as a story the other day  the kind happy  denouement is unfortunately absolutely undramatic which will be  our only trouble in quarrying out the play  i mean we shall quarry  from it  characters  otto frederick john hereditary prince of  grunwald amelia seraphina princess conrad baron gondremarck  prime minister cancellarius greisengesang killian gottesacker  steward of the river farm ottilie his daughter the countess von  rosen  seven in all  a brave story i swear and a brave play  too if we can find the trick to make the end  the play i fear  will have to end darkly and that spoils the quality as i now see  it of a kind of crockery eighteenth century highlifebelow stairs life breaking up like ice in spring before the nature and  the certain modicum of manhood of my poor clever featherheaded  prince whom i love already  i see seraphina too  gondremarck is  not quite so clear  the countess von rosen i have ill never  tell you who she is its a secret but i have known the countess  well i will tell you its my old russian friend madame z   certain scenes are in conception the best i have ever made  except for hester noble  those at the end von rosen and the  princess the prince and princess and the princess and  gondremarck as i now see them from here should be nuts henley  nuts  it irks me not to go to them straight  but the emigrant  stops the way then a reassured scenario for hester then the  vendetta then two or three essays  benjamin franklin thoughts  on literature as an art dialogue on character and destiny between  two puppets the human compromise and then at length  come to  me my prince  o lord its going to be courtly  and there is not  an ugly person nor an ugly scene in it  the slate both fanny and i  have damned utterly it is too morbid ugly and unkind better  starvation  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    608 bush street san francisco march 1880  my dear colvin  my landlord and landladys little fouryearold  child is dying in the house and o what he has suffered  it has  really affected my health  o never never any family for me  i am  cured of that  i have taken a long holiday  have not worked for three days and  will not for a week for i was really weary  excuse this scratch  for the child weighs on me dear colvin  i did all i could to  help but all seems little to the point of crime when one of  these poor innocents lies in such misery  ever yours  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    san francisco cal april 16 1880  my dear gosse  you have not answered my last and i know you will  repent when you hear how near i have been to another world  for  about six weeks i have been in utter doubt it was a tossup for  life or death all that time but i won the toss sir and hades  went off once more discomfited  this is not the first time nor  will it be the last that i have a friendly game with that  gentleman  i know he will end by cleaning me out but the rogue is  insidious and the habit of that sort of gambling seems to be a  part of my nature it was i suspect too much indulged in youth  break your children of this tendency my dear gosse from the  first  it is when once formed a habit more fatal than opium  i  speak as st paul says like a fool  i have been very very sick  on the verge of a galloping consumption cold sweats prostrating  attacks of cough sinking fits in which i lost the power of speech  fever and all the ugliest circumstances of the disease and i have  cause to bless god my wife that is to be and one dr bamford a  name the muse repels that i have come out of all this and got my  feet once more upon a little hilltop with a fair prospect of life  and some new desire of living  yet i did not wish to die neither  only i felt unable to go on farther with that rough horseplay of  human life  a man must be pretty well to take the business in good  part  yet i felt all the time that i had done nothing to entitle  me to an honourable discharge that i had taken up many obligations  and begun many friendships which i had no right to put away from  me and that for me to die was to play the cur and slinking  sybarite and desert the colours on the eve of the decisive fight   of course i have done no work for i do not know how long and here  you can triumph  i have been reduced to writing verses for  amusement  a fact  the whirligig of time brings in its revenges  after all  but ill have them buried with me i think for i have  not the heart to burn them while i live  do write  i shall go to  the mountains as soon as the weather clears on the way thither i  marry myself then i set up my family altar among the pinewoods  3000 feet sir from the disputatious sea  i am dear weg most  truly yours  r l s    letter  to dr w bamford    san francisco april 1880  my dear sir  will you let me offer you this little book  if i  had anything better it should be yours  may you not dislike it  for it will be your own handiwork if there are other fruits from  the same tree  but for your kindness and skill this would have  been my last book and now i am in hopes that it will be neither my  last nor my best  you doctors have a serious responsibility  you recall a man from  the gates of death you give him health and strength once more to  use or to abuse  i hope i shall feel your responsibility added to  my own and seek in the future to make a better profit of the life  you have renewed me  i am my dear sir gratefully yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    san francisco april 1880  my dear colvin  you must be sick indeed of my demand for books  for you have seemingly not yet sent me one  still i live on  promises  waiting for penn for h jamess hawthorne for my  burns etc and now to make matters worse pending your  centuries etc i do earnestly desire the best book about  mythology if it be german so much the worse send a bunctionary  along with it and pray for me  this is why  if i recover i  feel called on to write a volume of gods and demigods in exile   pan jove cybele venus charon etc and though i should like to  take them very free i should like to know a little about em to  begin with  for two days till last night i had no night sweats  and my cough is almost gone and i digest well so all looks  hopeful  however i was near the other side of jordan  i send the  proof of thoreau to you so that you may correct and fill up the  quotation from goethe  it is a pity i was ill as for matter i  think i prefer that to any of my essays except burns but the  style though quite manly never attains any melody or lenity  so  much for consumption  i begin to appreciate what the emigrant must  be  as soon as i have done the last few pages of the emigrant they  shall go to you  but when will that be  i know not quite yet  i  have to be so careful  ever yours  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    san francisco april 1880  my dear colvin  my dear people telegraphed me in these words   count on 250 pounds annually  you may imagine what a blessed  business this was  and so now recover the sheets of the emigrant  and post them registered to me  and now please give me all your  venom against it say your worst and most incisively for now it  will be a help and ill make it right or perish in the attempt   now do you understand why i protested against your depressing  eloquence on the subject  when i had to go on any way for dear  life i thought it a kind of pity and not much good to discourage  me  now alls changed  god only knows how much courage and  suffering is buried in that ms  the second part was written in a  circle of hell unknown to dante  that of the penniless and dying  author  for dying i was although now saved  another week the  doctor said and i should have been past salvation  i think i  shall always think of it as my best work  there is one page in  part ii about having got to shore and sich which must have cost  me altogether six hours of work as miserable as ever i went  through  i feel sick even to think of it  ever your friend  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    san francisco may 1880  my dear colvin  i received your letter and proof today and was  greatly delighted with the last  i am now out of danger in but a short while ie as soon as the  weather is settled f and i marry and go up to the hills to look  for a place i to the hills will lift mine eyes from whence doth  come mine aid  once the place found the furniture will follow   there sir in i hope a ranche among the pinetrees and hard by a  running brook we are to fish hunt sketch study spanish french  latin euclid and history and if possible not quarrel  far  from man sir in the virgin forest  thence as my strength  returns you may expect works of genius  i always feel as if i  must write a work of genius some time or other and when is it more  likely to come off than just after i have paid a visit to styx and  go thence to the eternal mountains  such a revolution in a mans  affairs as i have somewhere written would set anybody singing   when we get installed lloyd and i are going to print my poetical  works so all those who have been poetically addressed shall  receive copies of their addresses  they are i believe pretty  correct literary exercises or will be with a few filings but  they are not remarkable for whitehot vehemence of inspiration  tepid works respectable versifications of very proper and even  original sentiments  kind of hayleyistic i fear  but no this is  morbid selfdepreciation  the family is all very shaky in health  but our motto is now al monte in the words of don lope in the  play the sister and i are just beating through with two bad  dictionaries and an insane grammar  i to the hills  yours ever  r l s    letter  to c w stoddard    east oakland cal may 1880  my dear stoddard  i am guilty in thy sight and the sight of god   however i swore a great oath that you should see some of my  manuscript at last and though i have long delayed to keep it yet  it was to be  you reread your story and were disgusted that is  the cold fit following the hot  i dont say you did wrong to be  disgusted yet i am sure you did wrong to be disgusted altogether   there was you may depend upon it some reason for your previous  vanity as well as your present mortification  i shall hear you  years from now timidly begin to retrim your feathers for a little  selflaudation and trot out this misdespised novelette as not the  worst of your performances  i read the album extracts with sincere  interest but i regret that you spared to give the paper more  development and i conceive that you might do a great deal worse  than expand each of its paragraphs into an essay or sketch the  excuse being in each case your personal intercourse the bulk when  that would not be sufficient to be made up from their own works  and stories  three at least  menken yelverton and keeler   could not fail of a vivid human interest  let me press upon you  this plan should any document be wanted from europe let me offer  my services to procure it  i am persuaded that there is stuff in  the idea  are you coming over again to see me some day soon  i keep  returning and now hand over fist from the realms of hades  i saw  that gentleman between the eyes and fear him less after each  visit  only charon and his rough boatmanship i somewhat fear  i have a desire to write some verses for your album so if you  will give me the entry among your gods goddesses and godlets  there will be nothing wanting but the muse  i think of the verses  like mark twain sometimes i wish fulsomely to belaud you  sometimes to insult your city and fellowcitizens sometimes to sit  down quietly with the slender reed and troll a few staves of  panic ecstasy  but fy fy as my ancestors observed the last is  too easy for a man of my feet and inches  at least stoddard you now see that although so costive when i  once begin i am a copious letterwriter  i thank you and au  revoir  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    san francisco may 1880  my dear colvin  it is a long while since i have heard from you  nearly a month i believe and i begin to grow very uneasy  at  first i was tempted to suppose that i had been myself to blame in  some way but now i have grown to fear lest some sickness or  trouble among those whom you love may not be the impediment  i  believe i shall soon hear so i wait as best i can  i am beyond a  doubt greatly stronger and yet still useless for any work and i  may say for any pleasure  my affairs and the bad weather still  keep me here unmarried but not i earnestly hope for long   whenever i get into the mountain i trust i shall rapidly pick up   until i get away from these sea fogs and my imprisonment in the  house i do not hope to do much more than keep from active harm   my doctor took a desponding fit about me and scared fanny into  blue fits but i have talked her over again  it is the change i  want and the blessed sun and a gentle air in which i can sit out  and see the trees and running water  these mere defensive  hygienics cannot advance one though they may prevent evil  i do  nothing now but try to possess my soul in peace and continue to  possess my body on any terms  calistoga napa county california  all which is a fortnight old and not much to the point nowadays   here we are fanny and i and a certain hound in a lovely valley  under mount saint helena looking around or rather wondering when  we shall begin to look around for a house of our own  i have  received the first sheets of the amateur emigrant not yet the  second bunch as announced  it is a pretty heavy emphatic piece  of pedantry but i dont care the public i verily believe will  like it  i have excised all you proposed and more on my own  movement  but i have not yet been able to rewrite the two special  pieces which as you said so badly wanted it it is hard work to  rewrite passages in proof and the easiest work is still hard to  me  but i am certainly recovering fast a married and convalescent  being  received jamess hawthorne on which i meditate a blast miss bird  dixons penn a wrong cornhill like my luck and coquelin  for  all which and especially the last i tender my best thanks  i  have opened only james it is very clever very well written and  out of sight the most insideout thing in the world i have dug up  the hatchet a scalp shall flutter at my belt ere long  i think my  new book should be good it will contain our adventures for the  summer so far as these are worth narrating and i have already a  few pages of diary which should make up bright  i am going to  repeat my old experiment after bucklingto a while to write more  correctly lie down and have a wallow  whether i shall get any of  my novels done this summer i do not know i wish to finish the  vendetta first for it really could not come after prince otto   lewis campbell has made some noble work in that agamemnon it  surprised me  we hope to get a house at silverado a deserted  miningcamp eight miles up the mountain now solely inhabited by a  mighty hunter answering to the name of rufe hansome who slew last  year a hundred and fifty deer  this is the motto i propose for the  new volume  vixerunt nonnulli in agris delectati re sua  familiari  his idem propositum fuit quod regibus ut ne qua re  egerent ne cui parerent libertate uterentur cujus proprium est  sic vivere ut velis  i always have a terror lest the wish should  have been father to the translation when i come to quote but that  seems too plain sailing  i should put regibus in capitals for the  pleasantrys sake  we are in the coast range that being so much  cheaper to reach the family i hope will soon follow  love to  all ever yours  r l s     chapter v  alpine winters and highland summers august 1880 october

of damned hotel discountenanced by god and man the food  sir you would do as well to cram your belly full of bran  the company  alas the day that i should dwell with such a crew with devil anything to say nor any one to say it to  the place  although they call it platz i will be bold and state my view its not a place at all  and thats the bottom verity my dew  there are as i will not deny innumerable inns a road several alps indifferent high the snows inviolable abode  eleven english parsons all entirely inoffensive four true human beings  what i call human  the deuce a cipher more  a climate of surprising worth innumerable dogs that bark some air some weather and some earth a native race  god save the mark   a race that works yet cannot work yodels but cannot yodel right such as unhelpd with rusty dirk i vow that i could wholly smite  a river that from morn to night down all the valley plays the fool not once she pauses in her flight nor knows the comfort of a pool  but still keeps up by straight or bend the selfsame pace she hath begun  still hurry hurry to the end  good god is that the way to run  if i a river were i hope that i should better realise the opportunities and scope of that romantic enterprise  i should not ape the merely strange but aim besides at the divine and continuity and change i still should labour to combine  here should i gallop down the race here charge the sterling like a bull there as a man might wipe his face lie pleased and panting in a pool  but what my dew in idle mood what prate i minding not my debt what do i talk of bad or good the best is still a cigarette  me whether evil fate assault or smiling providences crown  whether on high the eternal vault be blue or crash with thunder down   i judge the best whateer befall is

course will greatly change in form scope and order  this is just a birdseye glance  thank you for burt which came  and for your union notes  i have read onehalf about 900 pages  of wodrows correspondence with some improvement but great  fatigue  the doctor thinks well of my recovery which puts me in  good hope for the future  i should certainly be able to make a  fine history of this  my essays are going through the press and should be out in january  or february  ever affectionate son  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    hotel belvedere davos platz dec 6 1880  my dear weg  i have many letters that i ought to write in  preference to this but a duty to letters and to you prevails over  any private consideration  you are going to collect odes i could  not wish a better man to do so but i tremble lest you should  commit two sins of omission  you will not i am sure be so far  left to yourself as to give us no more of dryden than the hackneyed  st cecilia i know you will give us some others of those  surprising masterpieces where there is more sustained eloquence and  harmony of english numbers than in all that has been written since  there is a machine about a poetical young lady and another about  either charles or james i know not which and they are both  indescribably fine  is marvells horatian ode good enough  i  half think so  but my great point is a fear that you are one of  those who are unjust to our old tennysons duke of wellington  i  have just been talking it over with symonds and we agreed that  whether for its metrical effects for its brief plain stirring  words of portraiture as  he that never lost an english gun or   the soldier salute or for the heroic apostrophe to nelson that  ode has never been surpassed in any tongue or time  grant me the  duke o weg  i suppose you must not put in yours about the  warship you will have to admit worse ones however  ever yours  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    hotel belvedere davos dec 19 1880  this letter is a report of a long sederunt also steterunt in small  committee at davos platz dec 15 1880  its results are unhesitatingly shot at your head  my dear weg  we both insist on the duke of wellington  really it  cannot be left out  symonds said you would cover yourself with  shame and i add your friends with confusion if you leave it out   really you know it is the only thing you have since dryden where  that irregular odic odal odous  verse is used with mastery and  sense  and its one of our few english bloodboilers  2 byron  if anything  prometheus  3 shelley 1 the worlds great age from hellas we are both dead  on  after that you have of course the west wind thing  but we  think 1 would maybe be enough no more than two any way  4 herrick  meddowes and come my corinna  after that mr  wickes  two any way  5 leave out stanza 3rd of congreves thing like a dear we cant  stand the sigh nor the peruke  6 milton  time and the solemn music  we both agree we would  rather go without lallegro and il penseroso than these for the  reason that these are not so well known to the brutish herd  7 is the royal george an ode or only an elegy  its so good  8 we leave campbell to you  9 if you take anything from clough but we dont either of us  fancy you will let it be come back  10 quite right about dryden  i had a hankering after threnodia  augustalis but i find it long and with very prosaic holes   though o what fine stuff between whiles  11 right with collins  12 right about popes ode  but what can you give  the dying  christian or one of his inimitable courtesies  these last are  fairly odes by the horatian model just as my dear meddowes is an  ode in the name and for the sake of bandusia  13 whatever you do youll give us the greek vase  14 do you like jonsons loathed stage  verses 2 3 and 4 are  so bad also the last line  but there is a fine movement and  feeling in the rest  we will have the duke of wellington by god  pro symonds and  stevenson  r l s    letter  to charles warren stoddard    hotel belvedere davos platz switzerland december 1880  dear charles warren stoddard  many thanks to you for the letter  and the photograph  will you think it mean if i ask you to wait  till there appears a promised cheap edition  possibly the canny  scot does feel pleasure in the superior cheapness but the true  reason is this that i think to put a few words by way of notes  to each book in its new form because that will be the standard  edition without which no gs l will be complete  the edition  briefly sine qua non  before that i shall hope to send you my  essays which are in the printers hands  i look to get yours  soon  i am sorry to hear that the custom house has proved  fallible like all other human houses and customs  life consists  of that sort of business and i fear that there is a class of man  of which you offer no inapt type doomed to a kind of mild general  disappointment through life  i do not believe that a man is the  more unhappy for that  disappointment except with ones self is  not a very capital affair and the sham beatitude blessed is he  that expecteth little one of the truest and in a sense the most  christlike things in literature  alongside of you i have been all my days a red cannon ball of  dissipated effort here i am by the heels in this alpine valley  with just so much of a prospect of future restoration as shall make  my present caged estate easily tolerable to me  shall or should i  would not swear to the word before the trials done  i miss all my  objects in the meantime and thank god i have enough of my old  and maybe somewhat base philosophy to keep me on a good  understanding with myself and providence  the mere extent of a mans travels has in it something consolatory   that he should have left friends and enemies in many different and  distant quarters gives a sort of earthly dignity to his existence   and i think the better of myself for the belief that i have left  some in california interested in me and my successes  let me  assure you you who have made friends already among such various  and distant races that there is a certain phthisical scot who will  always be pleased to hear good news of you and would be better  pleased by nothing than to learn that you had thrown off your  present incubus largely consisting of letters i believe and had  sailed into some square work by way of change  and by way of change in itself let me copy on the other pages some  broad scotch i wrote for you when i was ill last spring in oakland   it is no muckle worth  but ye should na look a gien horse in the  moo  yours ever  r l stevenson    letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    december 21 1880  davos  my dear people  i do not understand these reproaches  the  letters come between seven and nine in the evening and every one  about the books was answered that same night and the answer left  davos by seven oclock next morning  perhaps the snow delayed  then if so tis a good hint to you not to be uneasy at apparent  silences  there is no hurry about my fathers notes i shall not  be writing anything till i get home again i believe  only i want  to be able to keep reading ad hoc all winter as it seems about all  i shall be fit for  about john brown i have been breaking my  heart to finish a scotch poem to him  some of it is not really  bad but the rest will not come and i mean to get it right before  i do anything else  the bazaar is over 160 pounds gained and everybodys health lost   altogether i never had a more uncomfortable time apply to fanny  for further details of the discomfort  we have our wogg in somewhat better trim now and vastly better  spirits  the weather has been bad  for davos but indeed it is a  wonderful climate  it never feels cold yesterday with a little  chill small northerly draught for the first time it was  pinching  usually it may freeze or snow or do what it pleases  you feel it not or hardly any  thanks for your notes that fishery question will come in as you  notice in the highland book as well as under the union it is  very important  i hear no word of hugh millers evictions i count  on that  what you say about the old and new statistical is odd   it seems to me very much as if i were gingerly embarking on a  history of modern scotland  probably tulloch will never carry it  out  and you see once i have studied and written these two  vols the transformation of the scottish highlands and scotland  and the union i shall have a good ground to go upon  the effect  on my mind of what i have read has been to awaken a livelier  sympathy for the irish although they never had the remarkable  virtues i fear they have suffered many of the injustices of the  scottish highlanders  ruedi has seen me this morning he says the  disease is at a standstill and i am to profit by it to take more  exercise  altogether he seemed quite hopeful and pleased  i am  your ever affectionate son  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    hotel belvedere davos christmas 1880  my dear colvin  thanks for yours i waited as said i would  i  now expect no answer from you regarding you as a mere dumb cock shy or a target at which we fire our arrows diligently all day  long with no anticipation it will bring them back to us  we are  both sadly mortified you are not coming but health comes first  alas that man should be so crazy  what fun we could have if we  were all well what work we could do what a happy place we could  make it for each other  if i were able to do what i want but then  i am not and may leave that vein  no  i do not think i shall require to know the gaelic few things  are written in that language or ever were if you come to that  the number of those who could write or even read it through  almost all my period must by all accounts have been incredibly  small  of course until the book is done i must live as much as  possible in the highlands and that suits my book as to health  it  is a most interesting and sad story and from the 45 it is all to  be written for the first time  this of course will cause me a  far greater difficulty about authorities but i have already  learned much and where to look for more  one pleasant feature is  the vast number of delightful writers i shall have to deal with   burt johnson boswell mrs grant of laggan scott  there will be  interesting sections on the ossianic controversy and the growth of  the taste for highland scenery  i have to touch upon rob roy  flora macdonald the strange story of lady grange the beautiful  story of the tenants on the forfeited estates and the odd inhuman  problem of the great evictions  the religious conditions are wild  unknown very surprising  and three out of my five parts remain  hitherto entirely unwritten  smack  yours ever  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    christmas sermon hotel belvedere davos december 26 1880  my dear mother  i was very tired yesterday and could not write  tobogganed so furiously all morning we had a delightful day  crowned by an incredible dinner  more courses than i have fingers  on my hands  your letter arrived duly at night and i thank you  for it as i should  you need not suppose i am at all insensible to  my fathers extraordinary kindness about this book he is a brick  i vote for him freely     the assurance you speak of is what we all ought to have and  might have and should not consent to live without  that people do  not have it more than they do is i believe because persons speak  so much in largedrawn theological similitudes and wont say out  what they mean about life and man and god in fair and square  human language  i wonder if you or my father ever thought of the  obscurities that lie upon human duty from the negative form in  which the ten commandments are stated or of how christ was so  continually substituting affirmations  thou shalt not is but an  example thou shalt is the law of god  it was this that seems  meant in the phrase that not one jot nor tittle of the law should  pass  but what led me to the remark is this  a kind of black  angry look goes with that statement of the law of negatives  to  love ones neighbour as oneself is certainly much harder but  states life so much more actively gladly and kindly that you  begin to see some pleasure in it and till you can see pleasure in  these hard choices and bitter necessities where is there any good  news to men  it is much more important to do right than not to do  wrong further the one is possible the other has always been and  will ever be impossible and the faithful design to do right is  accepted by god that seems to me to be the gospel and that was  how christ delivered us from the law  after people are told that  surely they might hear more encouraging sermons  to blow the  trumpet for good would seem the parsons business and since it is  not in our own strength but by faith and perseverance no account  made of slips that we are to run the race i do not see where  they get the material for their gloomy discourses  faith is not to  believe the bible but to believe in god if you believe in god  or for its the same thing have that assurance you speak about  where is there any more room for terror  there are only three  possible attitudes  optimism which has gone to smash pessimism  which is on the rising hand and very popular with many clergymen  who seem to think they are christians  and this faith which is  the gospel  once you hold the last it is your business 1 to  find out what is right in any given case and 2 to try to do it  if you fail in the last that is by commission christ tells you to  hope if you fail in the first that is by omission his picture of  the last day gives you but a black lookout  the whole necessary  morality is kindness and it should spring of itself from the one  fundamental doctrine faith  if you are sure that god in the long  run means kindness by you you should be happy and if happy  surely you should be kind  i beg your pardon for this long discourse it is not all right of  course but i am sure there is something in it  one thing i have  not got clearly that about the omission and the commission but  there is truth somewhere about it and i have no time to clear it  just now  do you know you have had about a cornhill page of  sermon  it is however true  lloyd heard with dismay fanny was not going to give me a present  so f and i had to go and buy things for ourselves and go through  a representation of surprise when they were presented next morning   it gave us both quite a santa claus feeling on xmas eve to see him  so excited and hopeful i enjoyed it hugely  your affectionate  son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    hotel belvedere davos spring 1881  my dear colvin  my health is not just what it should be i have  lost weight pulse respiration etc and gained nothing in the  way of my old bellows  but these last few days with tonic cod liver oil better wine there is some better now and perpetual  beeftea i think i have progressed  to say truth i have been  here a little over long  i was reckoning up and since i have  known you already quite a while i have not i believe remained  so long in any one place as here in davos  that tells on my old  gipsy nature like a violin hung up i begin to lose what music  there was in me and with the music i do not know what besides or  do not know what to call it but something radically part of life  a rhythm perhaps in ones old and so brutally overridden nerves  or perhaps a kind of variety of blood that the heart has come to  look for  i purposely knocked myself off first  as to f a s i believe i  am no sound authority i alternate between a stiff disregard and a  kind of horror  in neither mood can a man judge at all  i know  the thing to be terribly perilous i fear it to be now altogether  hopeless  luck has failed the weather has not been favourable  and in her true heart the mother hopes no more  but  well i  feel a great deal that i either cannot or will not say as you  well know  it has helped to make me more conscious of the  wolverine on my own shoulders and that also makes me a poor judge  and poor adviser  perhaps if we were all marched out in a row  and a piece of platoon firing to the drums performed it would be  well for us although i suppose  and yet i wonder  so ill for  the poor mother and for the dear wife  but you can see this makes  me morbid  sufficit explicit  you are right about the carlyle book f and i are in a world not  ours but pardon me as far as sending on goes we take another  view  the first volume a la bonne heure but not  never  the  second  two hours of hysterics can be no good matter for a sick  nurse and the strange hard old being in so lamentable and yet  human a desolation  crying out like a burnt child and yet always  wisely and beautifully  how can that end as a piece of reading  even to the strong  but on the brink of the most cruel kind of  weeping  i observe the old mans style is stronger on me than ever  it was and by rights too since i have just laid down his most  attaching book  god rest the baith o them  but even if they do  not meet again how we should all be strengthened to be kind and  not only in act in speech also that so much more important part   see what this apostle of silence most regrets not speaking out his  heart  i was struck as you were by the admirable sudden clear sunshine  upon southey  even on his works  symonds to whom i repeated it  remarked at once a man who was thus respected by both carlyle and  landor must have had more in him than we can trace  so i feel with  true humility  it was to save my brain that symonds proposed reviewing  he and  it appears leslie stephen fear a little some eclipse i am not  quite without sharing the fear  i know my own languor as no one  else does it is a dead downdraught a heavy fardel  yet if i  could shake off the wolverine aforesaid and his fangs are lighter  though perhaps i feel them more i believe i could be myself again  a while  i have not written any letter for a great time none  saying what i feel since you were here i fancy  be duly obliged  for it and take my most earnest thanks not only for the books but  for your letter  your affectionate  r l s  the effect of reading this on fanny shows me i must tell you i am  very happy peaceful and jolly except for questions of work and  the states of other people  woggin sends his love    letter  to horatio f brown    davos 1881  my dear brown  here it is with the mark of a san francisco  bouquiniste  and if ever in all my human conduct i have done a  better thing to any fellowcreature than handing on to you this  sweet dignified and wholesome book i know i shall hear of it on  the last day  to write a book like this were impossible at least  one can hand it on  with a wrench  one to another  my wife cries  out and my own heart misgives me but still here it is  i could  scarcely better prove myself  yours affectionately  r l stevenson    letter  to horatio f brown    davos 1881  my dear brown  i hope if you get thus far you will know what an  invaluable present i have made you  even the copy was dear to me  printed in the colony that penn established and carried in my  pocket all about the san francisco streets read in street cars and  ferryboats when i was sick unto death and found in all times and  places a peaceful and sweet companion  but i hope when you shall  have reached this note my gift will not have been in vain for  while just now we are so busy and intelligent there is not the man  living no nor recently dead that could put with so lovely a  spirit so much honest kind wisdom into words  r l s    letter  to horatio f brown    hotel belvedere davos spring 1881  my dear brown  nine years i have conded them  brave lads in olden musical centuries sang night by night adorable choruses sat late by alehouse doors in april chaunting in joy as the moon was rising  moonseen and merry under the trellises flushfaced they played with old polysyllables spring scents inspired old wine diluted love and apollo were there to chorus  now these the songs remain to eternity those only those the bountiful choristers gone  those are gone those unremembered sleep and are silent in earth for ever  so man himself appears and evanishes so smiles and goes as wanderers halting at some greenembowered house play their music play and are gone on the windy highway  yet dwells the strain enshrined in the memory long after they departed eternally forthfaring towrd far mountain summits cities of men on the sounding ocean  youth sang the song in years immemorial brave chanticleer he sang and was beautiful birdhaunted green treetops in springtime heard and were pleased by the voice of singing  youth goes and leaves behind him a prodigy  songs sent by thee afar from venetian seagrey lagunes seapaven highways dear to me here in my alpine exile  please my dear brown forgive my horrid delay  symonds overworked  and knocked up  i off my sleep my wife gone to paris  weather  lovely  yours ever  robert louis stevenson  monte generoso in may here i think till the end of april write  again to prove you are forgiving    letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    hotel du pavillon henry iv st germainenlaye sunday may 1st  1881  my dear people  a week in paris reduced me to the limpness and  lack of appetite peculiar to a kid glove and gave fanny a jumping  sore throat  its my belief there is death in the kettle there a  pestilence or the like  we came out here pitched on the star and  garter they call it somebodys pavilion found the place a bed of  lilacs and nightingales first time i ever heard one and also of  a bird called the piasseur cheerfulest of sylvan creatures an  ideal comic opera in itself  come along what fun heres pan in  the next glade at picnic and thisyers arcadia and its awful  fun and ive had a glass i will not deny but not to see it on  me that is his meaning as near as i can gather  well the place  forest of beeches all newfledged grass like velvet fleets of  hyacinth pleased us and did us good  we tried all ways to find a  cheaper place but could find nothing safe cold damp brick floored rooms and sich we could not leave paris till your seven  days sight on draft expired we dared not go back to be  miasmatised in these homes of putridity so here we are till  tuesday in the star and garter  my throat is quite cured appetite  and strength on the mend  fanny seems also picking up  if we are to come to scotland i will have firtrees and i want a  burn the firs for my physical the water for my moral health   ever affectionate son  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    pitlochry perthshire june 6 1881  my dear weg  here i am in my native land being gently blown and  hailed upon and sitting nearer and nearer to the fire  a cottage  near a moor is soon to receive our human forms it is also near a  burn to which professor blackie no less has written some verses  in his hot old age and near a farm from whence we shall draw cream  and fatness  should i be moved to join blackie i shall go upon my  knees and pray hard against temptation although since the new  version i do not know the proper form of words  the swollen  childish and pedantic vanity that moved the said revisers to put  bring  for lead is a sort of literary fault that calls for an  eternal hell it may be quite a small place a star of the least  magnitude and shabbily furnished there shall   the revisers  of the bible and other absolutely loathsome literary lepers dwell  among broken pens bad groundy ink and ruled blottingpaper made  in france  all eagerly burning to write and all inflicted with  incurable aphasia  i should not have thought upon that torture had  i not suffered it in moderation myself but it is too horrid even  for a hell lets let em off with an eternal toothache  all this talk is partly to persuade you that i write to you out of  good feeling only which is not the case  i am a beggar  ask  dobson saintsbury yourself and any other of these cheeses who  know something of the eighteenth century what became of jean  cavalier between his coming to england and his death in 1740  is  anything interesting known about him  whom did he marry  the  happy french smilingly following one another in a long procession  headed by the loud and empty napoleon peyrat say olympe dunoyer  voltaires old flame  vacquerie even thinks that they were rivals  and is very french and very literary and very silly in his  comments  now i may almost say it consists with my knowledge that  all this has not a shadow to rest upon  it is very odd and very  annoying i have splendid materials for cavalier till he comes to  my own country and there though he continues to advance in the  service he becomes entirely invisible to me  any information  about him will be greatly welcome  i may mention that i know as  much as i desire about the other prophets marion fage cavalier  de sonne my cavaliers cousin the unhappy lions and the  idiotic mr lacy so if any erudite starts upon that track you may  choke him off  if you can find aught for me or if you will but  try count on my undying gratitude  langs library is very  pleasant reading  my book will reach you soon for i write about it today  yours  ever  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    kinnaird cottage pitlochry perthshire june 1881  my dear colvin  the black man and other tales  the black man  i thrawn janet ii the devil on cramond sands the shadow on the bed the body snatchers the case bottle the kings horn the actors wife the wreck of the susanna  this is the new work on which i am engaged with fanny they are all  supernatural  thrawn janet is off to stephen but as it is all  in scotch he cannot take it i know  it was so good i could not  help sending it  my health improves  we have a lovely spot here   a little green glen with a burn a wonderful burn gold and green  and snowwhite singing loud and low in different steps of its  career now pouring over miniature crags now fretting itself to  death in a maze of rocky stairs and pots never was so sweet a  little river  behind great purple moorlands reaching to ben  vrackie  hunger lives here alone with larks and sheep  sweet  spot sweet spot  write me a word about bobs professoriate and landor and what you  think of the black man  the tales are all ghastly  thrawn janet  frightened me to death  there will maybe be another  the dead  mans a letter  i believe i shall recover and i am in this  blessed hope yours exuberantly  r l s    letter  to professor aeneas mackay    kinnaird cottage pitlochry wednesday june 21 1881  my dear mackay  what is this i hear  that you are retiring from  your chair  it is not i hope from illhealth  but if you are retiring may i ask if you have promised your  support to any successor  i have a great mind to try  the summer  session would suit me the chair would suit me  if only i would  suit it i certainly should work it hard  that i can promise  i  only wish it were a few years from now when i hope to have  something more substantial to show for myself  up to the present  time all that i have published even bordering on history has  been in an occasional form and i fear this is much against me  please let me hear a word in answer and believe me yours very  sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to professor aeneas mackay    kinnaird cottage pitlochry perthshire june 1881  my dear mackay  thank you very much for your kind letter and  still more for your good opinion  you are not the only one who has  regretted my absence from your lectures but you were to me then  only a part of a mangle through which i was being slowly and  unwillingly dragged  part of a course which i had not chosen   part in a word of an organised boredom  i am glad to have your reasons for giving up the chair they are  partly pleasant and partly honourable to you  and i think one may  say that every man who publicly declines a plurality of offices  makes it perceptibly more difficult for the next man to accept  them  every one tells me that i come too late upon the field every one  being pledged which seeing it is yet too early for any one to  come upon the field i must regard as a polite evasion  yet all  advise me to stand as it might serve me against the next vacancy   so stand i shall unless things are changed  as it is with my  health this summer class is a great attraction it is perhaps the  only hope i may have of a permanent income  i had supposed the  needs of the chair might be met by choosing every year some period  of history in which questions of constitutional law were involved  but this is to look too far forward  i understand 1st that no overt steps can be taken till your  resignation is accepted and 2nd that in the meantime i may  without offence mention my design to stand  if i am mistaken about these please correct me as i do not wish  to appear where i should not  again thanking you very heartily for your coals of fire i remain  yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to edmund gosse    kinnaird cottage pitlochry june 24 1881  my dear gosse  i wonder if i misdirected my last to you  i begin  to fear it  i hope however this will go right  i am in act to  do a mad thing  to stand for the edinburgh chair of history it is  elected for by the advocates quorum pars i am told that i am too  late this year but advised on all hands to go on as it is likely  soon to be once more vacant and i shall have done myself good for  the next time  now if i got the thing which i cannot it  appears i believe in spite of all my imperfections i could be  decently effectual  if you can think so also do put it in a  testimonial  heavens  je me sauve i have something else to say to you but  after that which is not a joke i shall keep it for another shoot   yours testimonially  robert louis stevenson  i surely need not add dear lad that if you dont feel like it  you will only have to pacify me by a long letter on general  subjects when i shall hasten to respond in recompense for my  assault upon the postal highway    letter  to edmund gosse    kinnaird cottage pitlochry july 1881  my dear weg  many thanks for the testimonial many thanks for  your blind wondering letter many wishes lastly for your swift  recovery  insomnia is the opposite pole from my complaint which  brings with it a nervous lethargy an unkind unwholesome and  ungentle somnolence fruitful in heavy heads and heavy eyes at  morning  you cannot sleep well i can best explain my state thus   i cannot wake  sleep like the lees of a posset lingers all day  leadheavy in my knees and ankles  weight on the shoulders  torpor on the brain  and there is more than too much of that from  an ungrateful hound who is now enjoying his first decently  competent and peaceful weeks for close upon two years happy in a  big brown moor behind him and an incomparable burn by his side  happy above all in some work  for at last i am at work with that  appetite and confidence that alone makes work supportable  i told you i had something else to say  i am very tedious  it is  another request  in august and a good part of september we shall  be in braemar in a house with some accommodation  now braemar is  a place patronised by the royalty of the sister kingdoms  victoria  and the cairngorms sir honouring that countryside by their  conjunct presence  this seems to me the spot for a bard  now can  you come to see us for a little while  i can promise you you must  like my father because you are a human being you ought to like  braemar because of your avocation and you ought to like me  because i like you and again you must like my wife because she  likes cats and as for my mother  well come and see what do you  think that is best  mrs gosse my wife tells me will have other  fish to fry and to be plain i should not like to ask her till i  had seen the house  but a lone man i know we shall be equal to   quen dis tu  viens  yours  r l s    letter  to p g hamerton    kinnaird cottage pitlochry july 1881  my dear mr hammerton  there goes the second m it is a  certainty  thank you for your prompt and kind answer little as i  deserved it though i hope to show you i was less undeserving than  i seemed  but just might i delete two words in your testimonial   the two words and legal were unfortunately winged by chance  against my weakest spot and would go far to damn me  it was not my bliss that i was interested in when i was married it  was a sort of marriage in extremis and if i am where i am it is  thanks to the care of that lady who married me when i was a mere  complication of cough and bones much fitter for an emblem of  mortality than a bridegroom  i had a fair experience of that kind of illness when all the women  god bless them turn round upon the streets and look after you  with a look that is only too kind not to be cruel  i have had  nearly two years of more or less prostration  i have done no work  whatever since the february before last until quite of late  to be  precise until the beginning of last month exactly two essays   all last winter i was at davos and indeed i am home here just now  against the doctors orders and must soon be back again to that  unkindly haunt upon the mountains visitant  there goes no angel  there but the angel of death  the deaths of last winter are still  sore spots to me    so you see i am not very likely to go on  a wild expedition cisstygian at least  the truth is i am  scarce justified in standing for the chair though i hope you will  not mention this and yet my health is one of my reasons for the  class is in summer  i hope this statement of my case will make my long neglect appear  less unkind  it was certainly not because i ever forgot you or  your unwonted kindness and it was not because i was in any sense  rioting in pleasures  i am glad to hear the catamaran is on her legs again you have my  warmest wishes for a good cruise down the saone and yet there  comes some envy to that wish for when shall i go cruising  here a  sheer hulk alas lies r l s  but i will continue to hope for a  better time canoes that will sail better to the wind and a river  grander than the saone  i heard by the way in a letter of counsel from a wellwisher one  reason of my towns absurdity about the chair of art  i fear it is  characteristic of her manners  it was because you did not call  upon the electors  will you remember me to mrs hamerton and your son  and believe  me etc etc  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    kinnaird cottage pitlochry july 1881  my dear colvin  i do believe i am better mind and body i am  tired just now for i have just been up the burn with wogg daily  growing better and boofler so do not judge my state by my style  in this  i am working steady four cornhill pages scrolled every  day besides the correspondence about this chair which is heavy in  itself  my first story thrawn janet all in scotch is accepted  by stephen my second the body snatchers is laid aside in a  justifiable disgust the tale being horrid my third the merry  men i am more than half through and think real well of  it is a  fantastic sonata about the sea and wrecks and i like it much above  all my other attempts at storytelling i think it is strange if  ever i shall make a hit i have the line now as i believe  fanny has finished one of hers the shadow on the bed and is now  hammering at a second for which we have no name as yet  not by  wilkie collins  tales for winter nights  yes that i think we will call the lot  of them when republished  why have you not sent me a testimonial  everybody else but you has  responded and symonds but im afraid hes ill  do think too if  anybody else would write me a testimonial  i am told quantity goes  far  i have good ones from rev professor campbell professor  meiklejohn leslie stephen lang gosse and a very shaky one from  hamerton  grant is an elector so cant but has written me kindly  from  tulloch i have not yet heard  do help me with suggestions  this  old chair with its 250 pounds and its light work would make me  it looks as if we should take caters chalet after all but o to  go back to that place it seems cruel  i have not yet received the  landor but it may be at home detained by my mother who returns  tomorrow  believe me dear colvin ever yours  r l s  yours came the class is in summer many thanks for the  testimonial it is bully arrived along with it another from  symonds also bully he is ill but not lungs thank god  fever  got in italy  we have taken caters chalet so we are now the  aristos of the valley  there is no hope for me but if there  were you would hear sweetness and light streaming from my lips  the merry men  chap i eilean aros

letter  to w e henley    kinnaird cottage pitlochry july 1881  my dear henley  i hope then to have a visit from you  if  before august here if later at braemar  tupe  and now mon bon i must babble

pirate in it as how should there not  he had  the root of romance in such places  aros is earraid where i lived  lang syne the ross of grisapol is the ross of mull ben ryan ben  more  i have written to the middle of chapter iv  like enough  when it is finished i shall discard all chapterings for the thing  is written straight through  it must unhappily be rewritten   too well written not to be  the chair is only three months in summer that is why i try for it   if i get it which i shall not i should be independent at once   sweet thought  i liked your byron well your berlioz better  no  one would remark these cuts even i who was looking for it knew  it not at all to be a torso  the paper strengthens me in my  recommendation to you to follow colvins hint  give us an 1830  you will do it well and the subject smiles widely on the world  1830  a chapter of artistic history by william ernest henley or  of social and artistic history as the thing might grow to you   sir you might be in the athenaeum yet with that and believe me  you might and would be far better the author of a readable book   yours ever  r l s  the following names have been invented for wogg by his dear papa  gruntypig when he is scratched rosemouth when he comes flying up with his roseleaf tongue  depending and hoofenboots when he has had his foots wet how would tales for winter nights do    letter  to w e henley    pitlochry if you please august 1881  dear henley  to answer a point or two  first the spanish ship  was slooprigged and clumsy because she was fitted out by some  private adventurers not over wealthy and glad to take what they  could get  is that not right  tell me if you think not  that at  least was how i meant it  as for the boatcloaks i am afraid  they are as you say false imagination but i love the name  nature and being of them so dearly that i feel as if i would  almost rather ruin a story than omit the reference  the proudest  moments of my life have been passed in the sternsheets of a boat  with that romantic garment over my shoulders  this without  prejudice to one glorious day when standing upon some water stairs  at lerwick i signalled with my pockethandkerchief for a boat to  come ashore for me  i was then aged fifteen or sixteen conceive  my glory  several of the phrases you object to are proper nautical or long shore phrases and therefore i think not out of place in this  longshore story  as for the two members which you thought at  first so illunited i confess they seem perfectly so to me  i  have chosen to sacrifice a longprojected story of adventure  because the sentiment of that is identical with the sentiment of  my uncle  my uncle himself is not the story as i see it only  the leading episode of that story  its really a story of wrecks  as they appear to the dweller on the coast  its a view of the  sea  goodness knows when i shall be able to rewrite i must first  get over this copperheaded cold  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    pitlochry august 1881  my dear colvin  this is the first letter i have written this good  while  i have had a brutal cold not perhaps very wisely treated  lots of blood  for me i mean  i was so well however before  that i seem to be sailing through with it splendidly  my appetite  never failed indeed as i got worse it sharpened  a sort of  reparatory instinct  now i feel in a fair way to get round soon  monday august 2nd is it  we set out for the spital of  glenshee and reach braemar on tuesday  the braemar address we  cannot learn it looks as if braemar were all that was necessary  if particular you can address 17 heriot row  we shall be  delighted to see you whenever and as soon as ever you can make it  possible     i hope heartily you will survive me and do not doubt it   there are seven or eight people it is no part of my scheme in life  to survive  yet if i could but heal me of my bellowses i could  have a jolly life  have it even now when i can work and stroll a  little as i have been doing till this cold  i have so many things  to make life sweet to me it seems a pity i cannot have that other  one thing  health  but though you will be angry to hear it i  believe for myself at least what is is best  i believed it all  through my worst days and i am not ashamed to profess it now  landor has just turned up but i had read him already  i like him  extremely i wonder if the cuts were perhaps not advantageous   it seems quite full enough but then you know i am a  compressionist  if i am to criticise it is a little staid but the classical is  apt to look so  it is in curious contrast to that inexpressive  unplanned wilderness of forsters clear readable precise and  sufficiently human  i see nothing lost in it though i could have  wished in my scotch capacity a trifle clearer and fuller  exposition of his moral attitude which is not quite clear from  here  he and his tyrannicide  i am in a mad fury about these explosions   if that is the new world  damn odonovan rossa damn him behind  and before above below and roundabout damn deracinate and  destroy him root and branch self and company world without end   amen  i write that for sport if you like but i will pray in  earnest o lord if you cannot convert kindly delete him  stories naturally at  halt  henley has seen one and approves  i  believe it to be good myself even real good  he has also seen and  approved one of fannys  it will snake a good volume  we have now  thrawn janet with stephen proof today the shadow on the bed fannys copying the merry men scrolled the body snatchers scrolled  in germis  the travelling companion the torn surplice not final title  yours ever  r l s    letter  to dr alexander japp    the cottage castleton of braemar sunday august 1881  my dear sir  i should long ago have written to thank you for your  kind and frank letter but in my state of health papers are apt to  get mislaid and your letter has been vainly hunted for until this  sunday morning  i regret i shall not be able to see you in edinburgh one visit to  edinburgh has already cost me too dear in that invaluable  particular health but if it should be at all possible for you to  push on as far as braemar i believe you would find an attentive  listener and i can offer you a bed a drive and necessary food  etc  if however you should not be able to come thus far i can promise  you two things  first i shall religiously revise what i have  written and bring out more clearly the point of view from which i  regarded thoreau second i shall in the preface record your  objection  the point of view and i must ask you not to forget that any such  short paper is essentially only a section through a man was this   i desired to look at the man through his books  thus for  instance when i mentioned his return to the pencilmaking i did  it only in passing perhaps i was wrong because it seemed to me  not an illustration of his principles but a brave departure from  them  thousands of such there were i do not doubt still they  might be hardly to my purpose though as you say so some of them  would be  our difference as to pity i suspect was a logomachy of my making   no pitiful acts on his part would surprise me i know he would be  more pitiful in practice than most of the whiners but the spirit  of that practice would still seem to be unjustly described by the  word pity  when i try to be measured i find myself usually suspected of a  sneaking unkindness for my subject but you may be sure sir i  would give up most other things to be so good a man as thoreau   even my knowledge of him leads me thus far  should you find yourself able to push on to braemar  it may even  be on your way  believe me your visit will be most welcome  the  weather is cruel but the place is as i dare say you know the  very wale of scotland  bar tummelside  yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs sitwell    the cottage castleton of braemar august 1881   well i have been pretty mean but i have not yet got over my  cold so completely as to have recovered much energy  it is really  extraordinary that i should have recovered as well as i have in  this blighting weather the wind pipes the rain comes in squalls  great black clouds are continually overhead and it is as cold as  march  the country is delightful more cannot be said it is very  beautiful a perfect joy when we get a blink of sun to see it in   the queen knows a thing or two i perceive she has picked out the  finest habitable spot in britain  i have done no work and scarce written a letter for three weeks  but i think i should soon begin again my cough is now very  trifling  i eat well and seem to have lost but i little flesh in  the meanwhile  i was wonderfully well before i caught this horrid  cold  i never thought i should have been as well again i really  enjoyed life and work and of course i now have a good hope that  this may return  i suppose you heard of our ghost stories  they are somewhat  delayed by my cold and a bad attack of laziness embroidery etc  under which fanny had been some time prostrate  it is horrid that  we can get no better weather  i did not get such good accounts of  you as might have been  you must imitate me  i am now one of the  most conscientious people at trying to get better you ever saw  i  have a white hat it is much admired also a plaid and a heavy  stoop so i take my walks abroad witching the world  last night i was beaten at chess and am still grinding under the  blow  ever your faithful friend  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    the cottage late the late miss mgregors castleton of braemar  august 10 1881  my dear gosse  come on the 24th there is a dear fellow   everybody else wants to come later and it will be a godsend for  sir  yours sincerely  you can stay as long as you behave decently and are not sick of  sir  your obedient humble servant  we have family worship in the home of sir  yours respectfully  braemar is a fine country but nothing to what you will also see  the maps of sir  yours in the lord  a carriage and two spanking hacks draw up daily at the hour of two  before the house of sir  yours truly  the rain rains and the winds do beat upon the cottage of the late  miss macgregor and of sir  yours affectionately  it is to be trusted that the weather may improve ere you know the  halls of sir  yours emphatically  all will be glad to welcome you not excepting sir  yours ever  you will now have gathered the lamentable intellectual collapse of  sir  yours indeed  and nothing remains for me but to sign myself sir  yours  robert louis stevenson  nb  each of these clauses has to be read with extreme glibness  coming down whack upon the sir  this is very important  the  fine stylistic inspiration will else be lost  i commit the man who made the man who sold and the woman who  supplied me with my present excruciating gilt nib to that place  where the worm never dies  the reference to a deceased highland lady tending as it does to  foster unavailing sorrow may be with advantage omitted from the  address which would therefore run  the cottage castleton of  braemar    letter  to edmund gosse    the cottage castleton of braemar august 19 1881  if you had an uncle who was a sea captain and went to the north  pole you had better bring his outfit  verbum sapientibus  i look  towards you  r l stevenson    letter  to edmund gosse    braemar august 19 1881  my dear weg  i have by an extraordinary drollery of fortune sent  off to you by this days post a p c inviting you to appear in  sealskin  but this had reference to the weather and not at all  as you may have been led to fancy to our rustic raiment of an  evening  as to that question i would deal in so far as in me lies fairly  with all men  we are not dressy people by nature but it sometimes  occurs to us to entertain angels  in the country i believe even  angels may be decently welcomed in tweed i have faced many great  personages for my own part in a tasteful suit of seacloth with  an end of carpet pending from my gullet  still we do maybe twice  a summer burst out in the direction of blacks    and yet we do  it seldom    in short let your own heart decide and the  capacity of your portmanteau  if you came in camels hair you  would still although conspicuous be welcome  the sooner the better after tuesday  yours ever  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w e henley    braemar august 25 1881  my dear henley  of course i am a rogue  why lord its known  man but you should remember i have had a horrid cold  now im  better i think and see here  nobody not you nor lang nor the  devil will hurry me with our crawlers  they are coming  four of  them are as good as done and the rest will come when ripe but i  am now on another lay for the moment purely owing to lloyd this  one but i believe theres more coin in it than in any amount of  crawlers  now see here the sea cook or treasure island  a  story for boys  if this dont fetch the kids why they have gone rotten since my  day  will you be surprised to learn that it is about buccaneers  that it begins in the admiral benbow publichouse on devon coast  that its all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny and a  derelict ship and a current and a fine old squire trelawney the  real tre purged of literature and sin to suit the infant mind  and a doctor and another doctor and a seacook with one leg and  a seasong with the chorus yohohoand a bottle of rum at the  third ho you heave at the capstan bars which is a real  buccaneers song only known to the crew of the late captain flint  died of rum at key west much regretted friends will please  accept this intimation and lastly would you be surprised to  hear in this connection the name of routledge  thats the kind  of man i am blast your eyes  two chapters are written and have  been tried on lloyd with great success the trouble is to work it  off without oaths  buccaneers without oaths  bricks without  straw  but youth and the fond parient have to be consulted  and now look here  this is next day  and three chapters are  written and read  chapter i the old seadog at the admiral  benbow  chapter ii black dog appears and disappears  chapter  iii the black spot  all now heard by lloyd f and my father and  mother with high approval  its quite silly and horrid fun and  what i want is the best book about the buccaneers that can be had   the latter bs above all blackbeard and sich and get nutt or bain  to send it skimming by the fastest post  and now i know youll  write to me for the sea cooks sake  your admiral guinea is curiously near my line but of course im  fooling and your admiral sounds like a shublime gent  stick to  him like wax  hell do  my trelawney is as i indicate several  thousand seamiles off the lie of the original or your admiral  guinea and besides i have no more about him yet but one mention  of his name and i think it likely he may turn yet farther from the  model in the course of handling  a chapter a day i mean to do  they are short and perhaps in a month the sea cook may to  routledge go yohoho and a bottle of rum  my trelawney has a  strong dash of landor as i see him from here  no women in the  story lloyds orders and who so blithe to obey  its awful fun  boys stories you just indulge the pleasure of your heart thats  all no trouble no strain  the only stiff thing is to get it  ended  that i dont see but i look to a volcano  o sweet o  generous o human toils  you would like my blind beggar in chapter  iii i believe no

whenever he likes  i will write  my story up to its legitimate conclusion and then we shall be in a  position to judge whether a sequel would be desirable and i would  then myself know better about its practicability from the story tellers point of view  yours ever very sincerely  r l stevenson    letter  to w e henley    braemar september 1881  my dear henley  thanks for your last  the 100

the pirate by capn marryat  since this was written the cook is in his nineteenth chapter   yoheave ho  r l s    letter  to thomas stevenson    chalet am stein davos autumn 1881  my dear father  it occurred to me last night in bed that i could  write  the murder of red colin a story of the forfeited estates  this i have all that is necessary for with the following  exceptions  trials of the sons of roy rob with anecdotes  edinburgh 1818 and  the second volume of blackwoods magazine  you might also look in arnots criminal trials up in my room and  see what observations he has on the case trial of james stewart in  appin for murder of campbell of glenure 1752 if he has none  perhaps you could see  o yes see if burton has it in his two  vols of trial stories  i hope he hasnt but care not do it over  again anyway  the two named authorities i must see  with these i could soon  pull off this article and it shall be my first for the electors   ever affectionate son  r l s    letter  to p g hamerton    chalet am stein davos autumn 1881  my dear mr hamerton  my conscience has long been smiting me  till it became nearly chronic  my excuses however are many and  not pleasant  almost immediately after i last wrote to you i had  a hemorreage i cant spell it was badly treated by a doctor in  the country and have been a long while picking up  still in  fact have much to desire on that side  next as soon as i got  here my wife took ill she is i fear seriously so and this  combination of two invalids very much depresses both  i have a volume of republished essays coming out with chatto and  windus i wish they would come that my wife might have the reviews  to divert her  otherwise my news is nil  i am up here in a little  chalet on the borders of a pinewood overlooking a great part of  the davos thal a beautiful scene at night with the moon upon the  snowy mountains and the lights warmly shining in the village  j  a symonds is next door to me just at the foot of my hill  difficulty this you will please regard as the house beautiful  and his society is my great standby  did you see i had joined the band of the rejected  hardly one of  us said my confreres at the bar  i was blamed by a common friend for asking you to give me a  testimonial in the circumstances he thought it was indelicate   lest by some calamity you should ever have felt the same way i  must say in two words how the matter appeared to me  that silly  story of the election altered in no tittle the value of your  testimony  so much for that  on the other hand it led me to take  quite a particular pleasure in asking you to give it and so much  for the other  i trust even if you cannot share it you will  understand my view  i am in treaty with bentley for a life of hazlitt i hope it will  not fall through as i love the subject and appear to have found a  publisher who loves it also  that i think makes things more  pleasant  you know i am a fervent hazlittite i mean regarding him  as the english writer who has had the scantiest justice  besides  which i am anxious to write biography really if i understand  myself in quest of profit i think it must be good to live with  another man from birth to death  you have tried it and know  how has the cruising gone  pray remember me to mrs hamerton and  your son and believe me yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    chalet am stein davos december 5 1881  my dear charles  we have been in miserable case here my wife  worse and worse and now sent away with lloyd for sick nurse i not  being allowed to go down  i do not know what is to become of us  and you may imagine how rotten i have been feeling and feel now  alone with my weaseldog and my german maid on the top of a hill  here heavy mist and thin snow all about me and the devil to pay  in general  i dont care so much for solitude as i used to  results i suppose of marriage  pray write me something cheery  a little edinburgh gossip in  heavens name  ah what would i not give to steal this evening  with you through the big echoing college archway and away south  under the street lamps and away to dear brashs now defunct  but  the old time is dead also never never to revive  it was a sad  time too but so gay and so hopeful and we had such sport with all  our low spirits and all our distresses that it looks like a kind  of lamplit fairyland behind me  o for ten edinburgh minutes   sixpence between us and the everglorious lothian road or dear  mysterious leith walk  but here a sheer hulk lies poor tom  bowling here in this strange place whose very strangeness would  have been heaven to him then and aspires yes c b with tears  after the past  see what comes of being left alone  do you  remember brash the sheet of glass that we followed along george  street  granton the blight at bonny mainhead the compass near  the sign of the twinkling eye the night i lay on the pavement in  misery  i swear it by the eternal sky johnson  nor thomson  neer shall die  yet i fancy they are dead too dead like brash  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    chalet buol davosplatz december 26 1881  my dear mother  yesterday sunday and christmas we finished this  eventful journey by a drive in an open sleigh  none others were to  be had  seven hours on end through whole forests of christmas  trees  the cold was beyond belief  i have often suffered less at  a dentists  it was a clear sunny day but the sun even at noon  falls at this season only here and there into the prattigau  i  kept up as long as i could in an imitation of a street singer  away ye gay landscapes ye gardens of roses etc  at last lloyd remarked a blue mouth speaking from a corpse coloured face you seem to be the only one with any courage left   and do you know with that word my courage disappeared and i made  the rest of the stage in the same dumb wretchedness as the others   my only terror was lest fanny should ask for brandy or laudanum  or something  so awful was the idea of putting my hands out that  i half thought i would refuse  well none of us are a penny the worse lloyds cold better i  with a twinge of the rheumatic and fanny better than her ordinary  general conclusion between lloyd and me as to the journey  a  prolonged visit to the dentists complicated with the fear of  death  never o never do you get me there again  ever affectionate son  r l s    letter  to alison cunningham    chalet am stein davosplatz february 1882  my dear cummy  my wife and i are very much vexed to hear you are  still unwell  we are both keeping far better she especially seems  quite to have taken a turn  the turn we shall hope  please let  us know how you get on and what has been the matter with you  braemar i believe  the vile hole  you know what a lazy rascal i  am so you wont be surprised at a short letter i know indeed  you will be much more surprised at my having had the decency to  write at all  we have got rid of our young pretty and  incompetent maid and now we have a fine canny twinkling shrewd  auldfarrant peasant body who gives us good food and keeps us in  good spirits  if we could only understand what she says  but she  speaks davos language which is to german what aberdeenawa is to  english so it comes heavy  god bless you my dear cummy and so  says fanny forbye  ever your affectionate  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    chalet am stein davos 22nd february 82  my dear charles  your most welcome letter has raised clouds of  sulphur from my horizon     i am glad you have gone back to your music  life is a poor thing  i am more and more convinced without an art that always waits for  us and is always new  art and marriage are two very good stand bys  in an article which will appear sometime in the cornhill talk and  talkers and where i have fulllengthened the conversation of bob  henley jenkin simpson symonds and gosse i have at the end one  single word about yourself  it may amuse you to see it  we are coming to scotland after all so we shall meet which  pleases me and i do believe i am strong enough to stand it this  time  my knee is still quite lame  my wife is better again    but we take it by turns it is the  dog that is ill now  ever yours  r l s    letter  to w e henley    chalet am stein davosplatz february 1882  my dear henley  here comes the letter as promised last night   and first two requests  pray send the enclosed to co blackmores  publisher tis from fanny second pray send us routledges  shilling book edward mayhews dogs by return if it can be  managed  our dog is very ill again poor fellow looks very ill too only  sleeps at night because of morphine and we do not know what ails  him only fear it to be canker of the ear  he makes a bad black  spot in our life poor selfish silly little tangle and my wife  is wretched  otherwise she is better steadily and slowly moving  up through all her relapses  my knee never gets the least better  it hurts tonight which it has not done for long  i do not  suppose my doctor knows any least thing about it  he says it is a  nerve that i struck but i assure you he does not know  i have just finished a paper a gossip on romance in which i  have tried to do very popularly about onehalf of the matter you  wanted me to try  in a way i have found an answer to the  question  but the subject was hardly fit for so chatty a paper  and it is all loose ends  if ever i do my book on the art of  literature i shall gather them together and be clear  tomorrow having once finished off the touches still due on this  i shall tackle san francisco for you  then the tide of work will  fairly bury me lost to view and hope  you have no idea what it  costs me to wring out my work now  i have certainly been a  fortnight over this romance sometimes five hours a day and yet it  is about my usual length  eight pages or so and would be a dd  sight the better for another curry  but i do not think i can  honestly rewrite it all so i call it done and shall only  straighten words in a revision currently  i had meant to go on for a great while and say all manner of  entertaining things  but alls gone  i am now an idiot  yours  ever  r l s    letter  to w e henley    chalet am stein davos march 1882  my dear henley     last night we had a dinnerparty  consisting of the john addington curry onions lovely onions  and beefsteak  so unusual is any excitement that f and i feel  this morning as if we had been to a coronation  however i must i  suppose write  i was sorry about your female contributor squabble  tis very  comic but really unpleasant  but what care i  now that i  illustrate my own books i can always offer you a situation in our  house  s  l osbourne and co  as an author gets a halfpenny a  copy of verses and an artist a penny a cut perhaps a proofreader  might get several pounds a year  o that coronation  what a shouting crowd there was  i obviously  got a firework in each eye  the king looked very magnificent to  be sure and that great hall where we feasted on seven hundred  delicate foods and drank fifty royal wines  quel coup doeil but  was it not overdone even for a coronation  almost a vulgar  luxury  and eleven is certainly too late to begin dinner  it was  really 630 instead of 530  your list of books that cassells have refused in these weeks is not  quite complete they also refused  1 six undiscovered tragedies one romantic comedy a fragment of  journal extending over six years and an unfinished autobiography  reaching up to the first performance of king john  by william  shakespeare  2 the journals and private correspondence of david king of  israel  3 poetical works of arthur iron dook of wellington including a  monody on napoleon  4 eight books of an unfinished novel solomon crabb  by henry  fielding  5 stevensons moral emblems  you also neglected to mention as per contra that they had during  the same time accepted and triumphantly published browns handbook  to cricket joness first french reader and robinsons picturesque  cheshire uniform with the same authors stately homes of salop  o if that list could come true  how we would tear at solomon  crabb  o what a bully bully bully business  which would you  read first  shakespeares autobiography or his journals  what  sport the monody on napoleon would be  what wooden verse what  stucco ornament  i should read both the autobiography and the  journals before i looked at one of the plays beyond the names of  them which shows that saintsbury was right and i do care more for  life than for poetry  no  i take it back  do you know one of the  tragedies  a bible tragedy too  david  was written in his third  period  much about the same time as lear  the comedy april rain  is also a late work  beckett is a fine ranting piece like richard  ii but very fine for the stage  irving is to play it this autumn  when im in town the part rather suits him  but who is to play  henry  a tremendous creation sir  betterton in his private  journal seems to have seen this piece and he says distinctly that  henry is the best part in any play  though he adds how it be  with the ancient plays i know not  but in this i have ever feared  to do ill and indeed will not be persuaded to that undertaking   so says betterton  rufus is not so good i am not pleased with  rufus plainly a rifaccimento of some inferior work but there are  some damned fine lines  as for the purely satiric illminded  abelard and heloise another troilus quoi it is not pleasant  truly but what strength what verve what knowledge of life and  the canon  what a finished humorous rich picture is the canon   ah there was nobody like shakespeare  but what i like is the  david and absalom business  absalom is so well felt  you love him  as david did davids speech is one roll of royal music from the  first act to the fifth  i am enjoying solomon crabb extremely solomons capital adventure  with the two highwaymen and squire trecothick and parson vance it  is as good i think as anything in joseph andrews  i have just  come to the part where the highwayman with the black patch over his  eye has tricked poor solomon into his place and the squire and the  parson are hearing the evidence  parson vance is splendid  how  good too is old mrs crabb and the coastguardsman in the third  chapter or her delightful quarrel with the sexton of seaham lord  conybeare is surely a little overdone but i dont know either  hes such damned fine sport  do you like sally barnes  im in  love with her  constable muddon is as good as dogberry and verges  put together when he takes solomon to the cage and the highwayman  gives him solomons own guinea for his pains and kisses mrs  muddon and just then up drives lord conybeare and instead of  helping solomon calls him all the rascals in christendom  o henry  fielding henry fielding  yet perhaps the scenes at seaham are the  best  but im bewildered among all these excellences  stay cried a voice that made the welkin crack  this heres a dream return and study black   ever yours  r l s    letter  to alexander ireland    chalet am stein davos march 1882  my dear sir  this formidable paper need not alarm you it argues  nothing beyond penury of other sorts and is not at all likely to  lead me into a long letter  if i were at all grateful it would  for yours has just passed for me a considerable part of a stormy  evening  and speaking of gratitude let me at once and with  becoming eagerness accept your kind invitation to bowdon  i shall  hope if we can agree as to dates when i am nearer hand to come to  you sometime in the month of may  i was pleased to hear you were a  scot i feel more at home with my compatriots always perhaps the  more we are away the stronger we feel that bond  you ask about davos i have discoursed about it already rather  sillily i think in the pall mall and i mean to say no more but  the ways of the muse are dubious and obscure and who knows  i may  be wiled again  as a place of residence beyond a splendid  climate it has to my eyes but one advantage  the neighbourhood of  j a symonds  i dare say you know his work but the man is far  more interesting  it has done me in my two winters alpine exile  much good so much that i hope to leave it now for ever but would  not be understood to boast  in my present unpardonably crazy  state any cold might send me skipping either back to davos or  further off  let us hope not  it is dear a little dreary very  far from many things that both my taste and my needs prompt me to  seek and altogether not the place that i should choose of my free  will  i am chilled by your description of the man in question though i  had almost argued so much from his cold and undigested volume  if  the republication does not interfere with my publisher it will not  interfere with me but there of course comes the hitch  i do not  know mr bentley and i fear all publishers like the devil from  legend and experience both  however when i come to town we  shall i hope meet and understand each other as well as author and  publisher ever do  i liked his letters they seemed hearty kind  and personal  still  i am notedly suspicious of the trade  your  news of this republication alarms me  the best of the present french novelists seems to me incomparably  daudet  les rois en exil comes very near being a masterpiece  for  zola i have no toleration though the curious eminently bourgeois  and eminently french creature has power of a kind  but i would he  were deleted  i would not give a chapter of old dumas meaning  himself not his collaborators for the whole boiling of the zolas   romance with the smallpox  as the great one  diseased anyway and  blackhearted and fundamentally at enmity with joy  i trust that mrs ireland does not object to smoking and if you  are a teetotaller i beg you to mention it before i come  i have  all the vices some of the virtues also let us hope  that at  least of being a scotchman and yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson  ps  my father was in the old high school the last year and  walked in the procession to the new  i blush to own i am an  academy boy it seems modern and smacks not of the soil  pps  i enclose a good joke  at least i think so  my first  efforts at wood engraving printed by my stepson a boy of thirteen   i will put in also one of my later attempts  i have been nine days  at the art  observe my progress  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    davos march 23 1882  my dear weg  and i had just written the best note to mrs gosse  that was in my power  most blameable  i now send for mrs gosse  black canyon  also an advertisement of my new appearance as poet bard rather  and hartis on wood  the cut represents the hero and the eagle and  is emblematic of cortez first viewing the pacific ocean which  according to the bard keats it took place in darien  the cut is  much admired for the sentiment of discovery the manly proportions  of the voyager and the fine impression of tropical scenes and the  untrodden waste so aptly rendered by the hartis  i would send you the book but i declare im ruined  i got a penny  a cut and a halfpenny a set of verses from the flinthearted  publisher and only one specimen copy as im a sinner   was  apostolic alongside of osbourne  i hope you will be able to decipher this written at steam speed  with a breaking pen the hotfast postman at my heels  no excuse  says you  none sir says i and touches my at most civil  extraordinary evolution of pen now quite doomed  to resume     i have not put pen to the bloody murder yet  but it is early on my  list and when once i get to it three weeks should see the last  bloodstain  maybe a fortnight  for i am beginning to combine an  extraordinary laborious slowness while at work with the most  surprisingly quick results in the way of finished manuscripts  how  goes gray  colvin is to do keats  my wife is still not well   yours ever  r l s    letter  to dr alexander japp    chalet am stein davos march 1882  my dear dr japp  you must think me a forgetful rogue as indeed  i am for i have but now told my publisher to send you a copy of  the familiar studies  however i own i have delayed this letter  till i could send you the enclosed  remembering the nights at  braemar when we visited the picture gallery i hoped they might  amuse you  you see we do some publishing hereaway  i shall hope  to see you in town in may  always yours faithfully  robert louis stevenson    letter  to dr alexander japp    chalet buol davos april 1 1882  my dear dr japp  a good day to date this letter which is in  fact a confession of incapacity  during my wifes illness i  somewhat lost my head and entirely lost a great quire of corrected  proofs  this is one of the results i hope there are none more  serious  i was never so sick of any volume as i was of that was  continually receiving fresh proofs with fresh infinitesimal  difficulties  i was ill  i did really fear my wife was worse than  ill  well its out now and though i have observed several  carelessnesses myself and now heres another of your finding  of  which indeed i ought to be ashamed  it will only justify the  sweeping humility of the preface  symonds was actually dining with us when your letter came and i  communicated your remarks    he is a far better and more  interesting thing than any of his books  the elephant was my wifes so she is proportionately elate you  should have picked it out for praise  from a collection let me  add so replete with the highest qualities of art  my wicked carcase as john knox calls it holds together  wonderfully  in addition to many other things and a volume of  travel i find i have written since december 90 cornhill pages of  magazine work  essays and stories  40000 words and i am none  the worse  i am the better  i begin to hope i may if not outlive  this wolverine upon my shoulders at least carry him bravely like  symonds and alexander pope  i begin to take a pride in that hope  i shall be much interested to see your criticisms you might  perhaps send them to me  i believe you know that is not dangerous  one folly i have not  i am not touchy under criticism  lloyd and my wife both beg to be remembered and lloyd sends as a  present a work of his own  i hope you feel flattered for this is  simply the first time he has ever given one away  i have to buy my  own works i can tell you  yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w e henley    chalet am stein davos april 1882  my dear henley  i hope and hope for a long letter  soon i hope  to be superseded by long talks  and it comes not  i remember i  have never formally thanked you for that hundred quid nor in  general for the introduction to chatto and windus and continue to  bury you in copy as if you were my private secretary  well i am  not unconscious of it all but i think least said is often best  generally best gratitude is a tedious sentiment its not ductile  not dramatic  if chatto should take both cui dedicare  i am running out of  dedikees if i do the whole fun of writing is stranded  treasure  island if it comes out and i mean it shall of course goes to  lloyd  lemme see i have now dedicated to  w e h william ernest henley  s c sidney colvin  t s thomas

seventh i  begin to see i shall know about it  you will be astonished when  you come to reread it i had no idea of the matter  human red  matter he has contrived to plug and pack into that strange and  admirable book  willoughby is of course a pure discovery a  complete set of nerves not heretofore examined and yet running  all over the human body  a suit of nerves  clara is the best girl  ever i saw anywhere  vernon is almost as good  the manner and the  faults of the book greatly justify themselves on further study   only dr middleton does not hang together and ladies busshe and  culmer sont des monstruosites  vernons conduct makes a wonderful  odd contrast with daniel derondas  i see more and more that  meredith is built for immortality  talking of which heywood as a small immortal an immortalet  claims some attention  the woman killed with kindness is one of  the most striking novels  not plays though its more of a play  than anything else of his  i ever read  he had such a sweet  sound soul the old boy  the death of the two pirates in fortune  by sea and land is a document  he had obviously been present and  heard purser and clinton take death by the beard with similar  braggadocios  purser and clinton names of pirates scarlet and  bobbington names of highwaymen  he had the touch of names i  think  no man i ever knew had such a sense such a tact for  english nomenclature  rainsforth lacy audley forrest acton  spencer frankford  so his names run  byron not only wrote don juan he called joan of arc a fanatical  strumpet  these are his words  i think the

davos never mind it has been a good though a dear lesson  now  with my improved health if i can pass the summer i believe i  shall be able no more to exceed no more to draw on you  it is  time i sufficed for myself indeed  and i believe i can  i am still far from satisfied about fanny she is certainly better  but it is by fits a good deal and the symptoms continue which  should not be  i had her persuaded to leave without me this very  day saturday 8th but the disclosure of my mismanagement broke up  that plan she would not leave me lest i should mismanage more  i  think this an unfair revenge but i have been so bothered that i  cannot struggle  all davos has been drinking our wine  during the  month of march three litres a day were drunk  o it is too  sickening  and that is only a specimen  it is enough to make any  one a misanthrope but the right thing is to hate the donkey that  was duped  which i devoutly do  i have this winter finished treasure island written the preface to

though  my memory speaks delightfully of it  i have been very tired and seedy or i should have written before  inter alia to tell you that i had visited my murder place and  found living traditions

forth a man and a good man too and honestly i doubt if i  could have done the same  this may seem egoistic but you are not  such a fool as to think so  it is the natural expression of real  praise  the book as a whole is readable your subject peeps every  here and there out of the crannies like a shy violet  he could do  no more  and his aroma hangs there  i write to catch a minion of the post

fishingbasket and he borrows even a rod from the  landlord  he walked here over the hills from sanquhar singin  he says like a mavis  i naturally asked him about hazlitt  he  wouldnae take his drink he said a queer queer fellow  but  did not seem further communicative  he says he has become  releegious but still swears like a trooper  i asked him if he  had no headquarters  no likely said he  he says he is writing  his memoirs which will be interesting  he once met borrow they  boxed and geordie says the old man chuckling gave me the  damnedest hiding  of wordsworth he remarked he wasnae sound in  the faith sir and a milkblooded bluespectacled bitch forbye   but his pomes are grand  theres no denying that  i asked him  what his book was  i havenae mind said he  that was his only  book  on turning it out i found it was one of my own and on  showing it to him he remembered it at once  o aye he said i  mind now  its pretty bad yell have to do better than that  chieldy and chuckled chuckled  he is a strange old figure to  be sure  he cannot endure pirbright smith  a mere aesthatic he  said  pooh  fishin and releegion  these are my aysthatics  he wound up  i thought this would interest you so scribbled it down  i still  hope to get more out of him about hazlitt though he utterly pooh poohed the idea of writing hs life  ma life now he said  theres been queer things in it  he

marseilles october 16 1882  sir  it has come to my ears that you have lent the authority of  your columns to an error  more than half in pleasantry  and i now think the pleasantry ill judged  i complained in a note to my new arabian nights that some  one who shall remain nameless for me had borrowed the idea of a  story from one of mine  as if i had not borrowed the ideas of the  half of my own  as if any one who had written a story ill had a  right to complain of any other who should have written it better   i am indeed thoroughly ashamed of the note and of the principle  which it implies  but it is no mere abstract penitence which leads me to beg a corner  of your paper  it is the desire to defend the honour of a man of  letters equally known in america and england of a man who could  afford to lend to me and yet be none the poorer and who if he  would so far condescend has my free permission to borrow from me  all that he can find worth borrowing  indeed sir i am doubly surprised at your correspondents error   that james payn should have borrowed from me is already a strange  conception  the author of lost sir massingberd and by proxy may be  trusted to invent his own stories  the author of a grape from a  thorn knows enough in his own right of the humorous and pathetic  sides of human nature  but what is far more monstrous  what argues total ignorance of the  man in question  is the idea that james payn could ever have  transgressed the limits of professional propriety  i may tell his  thousands of readers on your side of the atlantic that there  breathes no man of letters more inspired by kindness and generosity  to his brethren of the profession and to put an end to any  possibility of error i may be allowed to add that i often have  recourse and that i had recourse once more but a few weeks ago to  the valuable practical help which he makes it his pleasure to  extend to younger men  i send a duplicate of this letter to a london weekly for the  mistake first set forth in your columns has already reached  england and my wanderings have made me perhaps last of the persons  interested to hear a word of it  i am etc  robert louis stevenson

begged i would not split upon  her she felt so guilty but as i believe she is better this  evening and has a good chance to be right again in a day or two i  will disregard her orders  i do not go back but do not go forward   or not much  it is in one way miserable  for i can do no  work a very little woodcutting the newspapers and a note about  every two days to write completely exhausts my surplus energy  even patience i have to cultivate with parsimony  i see if i  could only get to work that we could live here with comfort  almost with luxury  even as it is we should be able to get  through a considerable time of idleness  i like the place  immensely though i have seen so little of it  i have only been  once outside the gate since i was here  it puts me in mind of a  summer at prestonpans and a sickly child you once told me of  thirtytwo years now finished  my twentyninth was in san  francisco i remember  rather a bleak birthday  the twentyeighth  was not much better but

frenchies and the  german folk in twa volumes  sae hes in luck ye see  yours  thomson    letter  to alison cunningham    nice february 1883  my dear cummy  you must think and quite justly that i am one of  the meanest rogues in creation  but though i do not write which  is a thing i hate it by no means follows that people are out of  my mind  it is natural that i should always think more or less  about you and still more natural that i should think of you when i  went back to nice  but the real reason why you have been more in  my mind than usual is because of some little verses that i have  been writing and that i mean to make a book of and the real  reason of this letter although i ought to have written to you  anyway is that i have just seen that the book in question must be  dedicated to  alison cunningham  the only person who will really understand it  i dont know when  it may be ready for it has to be illustrated but i hope in the  meantime you may like the idea of what is to be and when the time  comes i shall try to make the dedication as pretty as i can make  it  of course this is only a flourish like taking off ones hat  but still a person who has taken the trouble to write things does  not dedicate them to any one without meaning it and you must just  try to take this dedication in place of a great many things that i  might have said and that i ought to have done to prove that i am  not altogether unconscious of the great debt of gratitude i owe  you  this little book which is all about my childhood should  indeed go to no other person but you who did so much to make that  childhood happy  do you know we came very near sending for you this winter  if we  had not had news that you were ill too i almost believe we should  have done so we were so much in trouble  i am now very well but my wife has had a very very bad spell  through overwork and anxiety when i was lost  i suppose you heard  of that  she sends you her love and hopes you will write to her  though she no more than i deserves it  she would add a word  herself but she is too played out  i am ever your old boy  r l s    letter  to w e henley    nice march 1883  my dear lad  this is to announce to you the ms of nursery  verses now numbering xlviii pieces or 599 verses which of  course one might augment ad infinitum  but here is my notion to make all clear  i do not want a big ugly quarto my soul sickens at the look of a  quarto  i want a refined octavo not large  not larger than the  donkey book at any price  i think the full page might hold four verses of four lines that is  to say counting their blanks at two of twentytwo lines in  height  the first page of each number would only hold two verses  or ten lines the title being low down  at this rate we should  have seventyeight or eighty pages of letterpress  the designs should not be in the text but facing the poem so that  if the artist liked he might give two pages of design to every  poem that turned the leaf ie longer than eight lines ie to  twentyeight out of the fortysix  i should say he would not use  this privilege  above five times and some he might scorn to  illustrate at all so we may say fifty drawings  i shall come to  the drawings next  but now you see my book of the thickness since the drawings count  two pages of 180 pages and since the paper will perhaps be  thicker of near two hundred by bulk  it is bound in a quiet green  with the words in thin gilt  its shape is a slender tall octavo   and it sells for the publishers fancy and it will be a darling to  look at in short it would be like one of the original heine books  in type and spacing  now for the pictures  i take another sheet and begin to jot notes  for them when my imagination serves  i will run through the book  writing when i have an idea  there i have jotted enough to give  the artist a notion  of course i dont do more than contribute  ideas but i will be happy to help in any and every way  i may as  well add another idea when the artist finds nothing much to  illustrate a good drawing of any object mentioned in the text  were it only a loaf of bread or a candlestick is a most delightful  thing to a young child  i remember this keenly  of course if the artist insists on a larger form i must i  suppose bow my head  but my idea i am convinced is the best and  would make the book truly not fashionably pretty  i forgot to mention that i shall have a dedication i am going to  dedicate em to cummy it will please her and lighten a little my  burthen of ingratitude  a low affair is the muse business  i will add no more to this lest you should want to communicate with  the artist try another sheet  i wonder how many ill keep  wandering to  o i forgot  as for the title i think nursery verses the best   poetry is not the strong point of the text and i shrink from any  title that might seem to claim that quality otherwise we might  have nursery muses or new songs of innocence but that were a  blasphemy or rimes of innocence  the last not bad or  an  idea  the jews harp or  now i have it  the penny whistle   the penny whistle nursery verses by robert louis stevenson illustrated by      and here we have an excellent frontispiece of a party playing on a  p w to a little ring of dancing children   the penny whistle is the name for me   fool this is all wrong here is the true name   penny whistles for small whistlers   the second title is queried it is perhaps better as simply penny  whistles   nor you o penny whistler grudge that i your instrument debase by worse performers still we judge and give that fife a second place  crossed penny whistles on the cover or else a sheaf of em   suggestions   iv the procession  the child running behind it  the procession  tailing off through the gates of a cloudy city  ix foreign lands  this will i think want two plates  the  child climbing his first glimpse over the garden wall with what  he sees  the tree shooting higher and higher like the beanstalk  and the view widening  the river slipping in  the road arriving  in fairyland  x windy nights  the child in bed listening  the horseman  galloping  xii the child helplessly watching his ship  then he gets smaller  and the doll joyfully comes alive  the pair landing on the island   the ships deck with the doll steering and the child firing the  penny canon

should have feared you were worse again  as it is i  hope we shall hear from you today or tomorrow at latest  health  our news is good  fanny never got so bad as we feared and we hope  now that this attack may pass off in threatenings  i am greatly  better have gained flesh strength spirits eat well walk a good  deal and do some work without fatigue  i am off the sick list  lodging  we have found a house up the hill close to the town an excellent  place though very very little  if i can get the landlord to agree  to let us take it by the month just now and let our months rent  count for the year in case we take it on you may expect to hear we  are again installed and to receive a letter dated thus   la solitude hyereslespalmiers var   if the man wont agree to that of course i must just give it up  as the house would be dear enough anyway at 2000 f  however i  hope we may get it as it is healthy cheerful and close to shops  and society and civilisation  the garden which is above is  lovely and will be cool in summer  there are two rooms below with  a kitchen and four rooms above all told  ever your affectionate  son  r l stevenson    letter  to thomas stevenson    hotel des iles dor but my address will be chalet la solitude  hyereslepalmiers var france march 17 1883  dear sir  your undated favour from eastbourne came to hand in  course of post and i now hasten to acknowledge its receipt  we  must ask you in future for the convenience of our business  arrangements to struggle with and tread below your feet this most  unsatisfactory and uncommercial habit  our mr cassandra is  better our mr wogg expresses himself dissatisfied with our new  place of business when left alone in the front shop he bawled  like a parrot it is supposed the offices are haunted  to turn to the matter of your letter your remarks on great  expectations are very good  we have both reread it this winter  and i in a manner twice  the object being a play the play in  its rough outline i now see  and it is extraordinary how much of  dickens had to be discarded as unhuman impossible and  ineffective  all that really remains is the loan of a file but  from a grownup young man who knows what he was doing and to a  convict who although he does not know it is his father  the  father knows it is his son and the fact of the convictfathers  return and disclosure of himself to the son whom he has made rich   everything else has been thrown aside and the position has had to  be explained by a prologue which is pretty strong  i have great  hopes of this piece which is very amiable and in places very  strong indeed  but it was curious how dickens had to be rolled  away he had made his story turn on such improbabilities such  fantastic trifles not on a good human basis such as i recognised   you are right about the casts they were a capital idea a good  description of them at first and then afterwards say second for  the lawyer to have illustrated points out of the history of the  originals dusting the particular bust  that was all the  development the thing would bear  dickens killed them  the only  really well executed scenes are the riverside ones the escape in  particular is excellent and i may add the capture of the two  convicts at the beginning  miss havisham is probably the worst  thing in human fiction  but wemmick i like and i like trabbs  boy and mr wopsle as hamlet is splendid  the weather here is greatly improved and i hope in three days to  be in the chalet  that is if i get some money to float me there  i hope you are all right again and will keep better  the month of  march is past its mid career it must soon begin to turn toward the  lamb here it has already begun to do so and i hope milder weather  will pick you up  wogg has eaten a forpet of rice and milk his  beard is streaming his eyes wild  i am besieged by demands of  work from america  the 50 pounds has just arrived many thanks i am now at ease   ever your affectionate son pro cassandra wogg and co  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    chalet la solitude hyeres april 1883  my dear friend  i am one of the lowest of the  but thats  understood  i received the copy excellently written with i think  only one slip from first to last  i have struck out two and added  five or six so they now number fortyfive when they are fifty  they shall out on the world  i have not written a letter for a  cruel time i have been and am so busy drafting a long story  for me i mean about a hundred cornhill pages or say about as  long as the donkey book  prince otto it is called and is at the  present hour a sore burthen but a hopeful  if i had him all  drafted i should whistle and sing  but no  then ill have to  rewrite him and then there will be the publishers alas  but some  time or other i shall whistle and sing i make no doubt  i am going to make a fortune it has not yet begun for i am not  yet clear of debt but as soon as i can i begin upon the fortune   i shall begin it with a halfpenny and it shall end with horses and  yachts and all the fun of the fair  this is the first real grey  hair in my character  rapacity has begun to show the greed of the  protuberant guttler  well doubtless when the hour strikes we  must all guttle and protube  but it comes hard on one who was  always so willowslender and as careless as the daisies  truly i am in excellent spirits  i have crushed through a  financial crisis fanny is much better i am in excellent health  and work from four to five hours a day  from one to two above my  average that is and we all dwell together and make fortunes in  the loveliest house you ever saw with a garden like a fairy story  and a view like a classical landscape  little  well it is not large  and when you come to see us you  will probably have to bed at the hotel which is hard by  but it  is eden madam eden and beulah and the delectable mountains and  eldorado and the hesperidean isles and bimini  we both look forward my dear friend with the greatest eagerness  to have you here  it seems it is not to be this season but i  appoint you with an appointment for next season  you cannot see us  else  remember that  till my health has grown solid like an oak tree till my fortune begins really to spread its boughs like the  same monarch of the woods and the acorn ay de mi is not yet  planted i expect to be a prisoner among the palms  yes it is like old times to be writing you from the riviera and  after all that has come and gone who can predict anything  how  fortune tumbles men about  yet i have not found that they change  their friends thank god  both of our loves to your sister and yourself  as for me if i am  here and happy i know to whom i owe it i know who made my way for  me in life if that were all and i remain with

though it must be done i am so stupid that i  can only boldly recapitulate  a phrase of three members is the  outside of my syntax  first i liked the rover better than any of your other verse  i  believe you are right and can make stories in verse  the last two  stanzas and one or two in the beginning  but the two last above  all  i thought excellent  i suggest a pursuit of the vein  if  you want a good story to treat get the memoirs of the chevalier  johnstone and do his passage of the tay it would be excellent   the dinner in the field the woman he has to follow the dragoons  the timid boatmen the brave lasses  it would go like a charm  look at it and you will say you owe me one  second gilder asking me for fiction i suddenly took a great  resolve and have packed off to him my new work the silverado  squatters  i do not for a moment suppose he will take it but pray  say all the good words you can for it  i should be awfully glad to  get it taken  but if it does not mean dibbs at once i shall be  ruined for life  pray write soon and beg gilder your prettiest for  a poor gentleman in pecuniary sloughs  fourth next time i am supposed to be at deaths door write to me  like a

jest to keep the answer till my  next letter  for two cents i would do so  shall i  anyway ill  turn the page first  no  well  a hundred pounds all alive o   a hundred jingling tingling golden minted

finished dedication and all and out of my  hands  you may tell cummy silverado is done too and cast upon  the waters and this novel so near completion it does look as if i  should support myself without trouble in the future  if i have  only health i can i thank god  it is dreadful to be a great big  man and not be able to buy bread  o that this may last  i have today paid my rent for the half year till the middle of  september and got my lease  why they have been so long i know  not  i wish you all sorts of good things  when is our marriage day  your loving and ecstatic son  treesure

have a most troubled existence of work and business  but  the work goes well which is the great affair  i meant to have  written a most delightful letter too tired however and must  stop  perhaps ill find time to add to it ere post  i have returned refreshed from eating but have little time as  lloyd will go soon with the letters on his way to his tutor louis  robert  with whom he learns latin in french and french i  suppose in latin which seems to me a capital education  he  lloyd is a great bicycler already and has been long distances he  is most newfangled over his instrument and does not willingly  converse on other subjects  our lovely garden is a prey to snails i have gathered about a  bushel which not having the heart to slay i steal forth withal  and deposit near my neighbours garden wall  as a case of  casuistry this presents many points of interest  i loathe the  snails but from loathing to actual butchery trucidation of  multitudes there is still a step that i hesitate to take  what  then to do with them  my neighbours vineyard pardy  it is a  rich villa pleasuregarden of course if it were a peasants  patch the snails i suppose would have to perish  the weather these last three days has been much better though it  is still windy and unkind  i keep splendidly well and am cruelly  busy with mighty little time even for a walk  and to write at  all under such pressure must be held to lean to virtues side  my financial prospects are shining  o if the health will hold i  should easily support myself  your ever affectionate son  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var may 20 1883  my dear gosse  i enclose the receipt and the corrections  as for  your letter and gilders i must take an hour or so to think the  matter much importing  to me  the 40 pounds was a heavenly thing  i send the ms by henley because he acts for me in all matters  and had the thing like all my other books in his detention  he  is my unpaid agent  an admirable arrangement for me and one that  has rather more than doubled my income on the spot  if i have been long silent think how long you were so and blush  sir blush  i was rendered unwell by the arrival of your cheque and like  pepys my hand still shakes to write of it  to this grateful  emotion and not to dt please attribute the raggedness of my  hand  this year i should be able to live and keep my family on my own  earnings and that in spite of eight months and more of perfect  idleness at the end of last and beginning of this  it is a sweet  thought  this spot our garden and our view are subcelestial  i sing  daily with my bunyan that great bard   i dwell already the next door to heaven   if you could see my roses and my aloes and my figmarigolds and  my olives and my view over a plain and my view of certain  mountains as graceful as apollo as severe as zeus you would not  think the phrase exaggerated  it is blowing today a hot mistral which is the devil or a near

in time if it doesnt of course  things will go on in the way proposed  the 40 pounds or as i  prefer to put it the 1000 francs has been such a piercing sunray  as my whole grey life is gilt withal  on the back of it i can  endure  if these good days of longman and the century only last  it will be a very green world this that we dwell in and that  philosophers miscall  i have no taste for that philosophy give me  large sums paid on the receipt of the ms and copyright reserved  and what do i care about the nonbeent  only i know it cant last   the devil always has an imp or two in every house

nothing about my subject for a poem  dont you like it   my own fishy eye has been fixed on it for prose but i believe it  could be thrown out finely in verse and hence i resign and pass  the hand

the sight of your maimed  strength and masterfulness that begot john silver in treasure  island  of course he is not in any other quality or feature the  least like you but the idea of the maimed man ruling and dreaded  by the sound was entirely taken from you  otto is as you say not a thing to extend my public on  it is  queer and a little little bit free and some of the parties are  immoral and the whole thing is not a romance nor yet a comedy  nor yet a romantic comedy but a kind of preparation of some of the  elements of all three in a glass jar  i think it is not without  merit but i am not always on the level of my argument and some  parts are false and much of the rest is thin it is more a triumph  for myself than anything else for i see beyond it better stuff   i have nine chapters ready or almost ready for press  my feeling  would be to get it placed anywhere for as much as could be got for  it and rather in the shadow till one saw the look of it in print   ever yours  pretty sick    letter  to w e henley    la solitude hyereslespalmiers may 1883  my dear lad  the books came some time since but i have not had  the pluck to answer  a shower of small troubles having fallen in  or troubles that may be very large  i have had to incur a huge vague debt for cleaning sewers our  house was of course riddled with hidden cesspools but that was  infallible  i have the fever and feel the duty to work very heavy  on me at times yet go it must  i have had to leave fontainebleau  when three hours would finish it and go fulltilt at tushery for a  while  but it will come soon  i think i can give you a good article on hokusai but that is for  afterwards fontainebleau is first in hand  by the way my view is to give the penny whistles to crane or  greenaway  but crane i think is likeliest he is a fellow who  at least always does his best  shall i ever have money enough to write a play  o dire necessity  a word in your ear  i dont like trying to support myself  i hate

tushes the brightness of the day  the frog among the rushes sits singing in the blue byr lakin but these tushes are wearisome to do  the task entirely crushes the spirit of the bard god pity him who tushes  his task is very hard  the filthy gutter slushes the clouds are full of rain but doomed is he who tushes to tush and tush again  at morn with his hairbrushes still tush he says and weeps at night again he tushes and tushes till he sleeps  and when at length he pushes beyond the river dark  las to the man who tushes tush shall be gods remark    letter  to w e henley    chalet la solitude hyeres may 1883  dear henley  you may be surprised to hear that i am now a great  writer of verses that is however so  i have the mania now like  my betters and faith if i live till i am forty i shall have a  book of rhymes like pollock gosse or whom you please  really i  have begun to learn some of the rudiments of that trade and have  written three or four pretty enough pieces of octosyllabic  nonsense semiserious semismiling  a kind of prose herrick  divested of the gift of verse and you behold the bard  but i like  it  r l s    letter  to w e henley    hyeres june 1883  dear lad  i was delighted to hear the good news about   bravo  he goes uphill fast  let him beware of vanity and he will go  higher let him be still discontented and let him if it might be  see the merits and not the faults of his rivals and he may swarm  at last to the topgallant  there is no other way  admiration is  the only road to excellence and the critical spirit kills but  envy and injustice are putrefaction on its feet  thus far the moralist  the eager author now begs to know whether  you may have got the other whistles and whether a fresh proof is  to be taken also whether in that case the dedication should not be  printed therewith bulk delights publishers original aphorism to  be said sixteen times in succession as a test of sobriety  your wild and ravening commands were received but cannot be  obeyed  and anyway i do assure you i am getting better every day  and if the weather would but turn i should soon be observed to  walk in hornpipes  truly i am on the mend  i am still very  careful  i have the new dictionary a joy a thing of beauty and   bulk  i shall be raked i the mools before its finished that  is the only pity but meanwhile i sing  i beg to inform you that i robert louis stevenson author of  brashiana and other works am merely beginning to commence to  prepare to make a first start at trying to understand my  profession  o the height and depth of novelty and worth in any  art and o that i am privileged to swim and shoulder through such  oceans  could one get out of sight of land  all in the blue   alas not being anchored here in flesh and the bonds of logic  being still about us  but what a great space and a great air there is in these small  shallows where alone we venture and how new each sight squall  calm or sunrise  an art is a fine fortune a palace in a park a  band of music health and physical beauty all but love  to any  worthy practiser  i sleep upon my art for a pillow i waken in my  art i am unready for death because i hate to leave it  i love my  wife i do not know how much nor can nor shall unless i lost  her but while i can conceive my being widowed i refuse the  offering of life without my art  i am not but in my art it is me  i am the body of it merely  and yet i produce nothing am the author of brashiana and other  works  tiddyiddity  as if the works one wrote were anything but  prentices experiments  dear reader i deceive you with husks  the real works and all the pleasure are still mine and  incommunicable  after this break in my work beginning to return  to it as from light sleep i wax exclamatory as you see  sursum corda heave ahead heres luck art and blue heaven april and gods larks green reeds and the skyscattering river a stately music enter god  r l s  ay but you know until a man can write that enter god he has  made no art  none  come let us take counsel together and make  some    letter  to w e henley    la solitude hyeres summer 1883  dear lad  glad you like fontainebleau  i am going to be the  means under heaven of aerating or liberating your pages  the  idea that because a thing is a picturebook all the writing should  be on the wrong tack is triste but widespread  thus hokusai will  be really a gossip on convention or in great part  and the skelt  will be as like a charles lamb as i can get it  the writer should  write and not illustrate pictures  else its bosh     your remarks about the ugly are my eye  ugliness is only the prose  of horror  it is when you are not able to write macbeth that you  write therese raquin  fashions are external  the essence of art  only varies in so far as fashion widens the field of its  application art is a mill whose thirlage in different ages  widens and contracts but in any case and under any fashion the  great man produces beauty terror and mirth and the little man  produces cleverness personalities psychology instead of beauty  ugliness instead of terror and jokes instead of mirth  as it was  in the beginning is now and shall be ever world without end   amen  and even as you read you say of course quelle rengaine  r l s    letter  to alison cunningham    la solitude hyeres summer 1883  my dear cummy  yes i own i am a real bad correspondent and am  as bad as can be in most directions  i have been adding some more poems to your book  i wish they would  look sharp about it but you see they are trying to find a good  artist to make the illustrations without which no child would give  a kick for it  it will be quite a fine work i hope  the  dedication is a poem too and has been quite a long while written  but i do not mean you to see it till you get the book keep the  jelly for the last you know as you would often recommend in  former days so now you can take your own medicine  i am very sorry to hear you have been so poorly i have been very  well it used to be quite the other way used it not  do you  remember making the whistle at mount chessie  i do not think it  was my knife i believe it was yours but rhyme is a very great  monarch and goes before honesty in these affairs at least  do  you remember at warriston one autumn sunday when the beech nuts  were on the ground seeing heaven open  i would like to make a  rhyme of that but cannot  is it not strange to think of all the changes  bob cramond  delhi minnie and henrietta all married and fathers and mothers  and your humble servant just the one point better off  and such a  little while ago all children together  the time goes swift and  wonderfully even and if we are no worse than we are we should be  grateful to the power that guides us  for more than a generation i  have now been to the fore in this rough world and been most  tenderly helped and done cruelly wrong and yet escaped and here  i am still the worse for wear but with some fight in me still  and not unthankful  no surely not unthankful or i were then the  worst of human beings  my little dog is a very much better child in every way both more  loving and more amiable but he is not fond of strangers and is  like most of his kind a great specious humbug  fanny has been ill but is much better again she now goes donkey  rides with an old woman who compliments her on her french  that  old woman  seventy odd  is in a parlous spiritual state  pretty soon in the new sixpenny illustrated magazine woggs  picture is to appear  this is a great honour  and the poor soul  whose vanity would just explode if he could understand it will  never be a bit the wiser  with much love in which fanny joins  believe me your affectionate boy  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w e henley    la solitude hyeres summer 1883  dear lad  snatches in return for yours for this little once im  well to windward of you  seventeen chapters of otto are now drafted and finding i was  working through my voice and getting screechy i have turned back  again to rewrite the earlier part  it has i do believe some  merit  of what order of course i am the last to know and  triumph of triumphs my wife  my wife who hates and loathes and  slates my women  admits a great part of my countess to be on the  spot  yes i could borrow but it is the joy of being before the public  for once  really 100 pounds is a sight more than treasure island  is worth  the reason of my deche  well if you begin one house have to  desert it begin another and are eight months without doing any  work you will be in a deche too  i am not in a deche however  distinguo  i would fain distinguish i am rather a swell but not  solvent  at a touch the edifice aedificium might collapse  if  my creditors began to babble around me i would sink with a slow  strain of music into the crimson west  the difficulty in my  elegant villa is to find oil oleum for the dam axles  but ive  paid my rent until september and beyond the chemist the grocer  the baker the doctor the gardener lloyds teacher and the great  thief creditor death i can snap my fingers at all men  why will  people spring bills on you  i try to make em charge me at the  moment they wont the money goes the debt remains  the  required play is in the merry men  q e f  i thus render honour to your flair it came on me of a clap i do  not see it yet beyond a kind of sunset glory  but its there   passion romance the picturesque involved  startling simple  horrid  a seapink in seafroth  sagit de la desenterrer   help cries a buried masterpiece  once i see my way to the years end clear i turn to plays till  then i grind at letters finish otto write say a couple of my  travellers tales and then if all my ships come home i will  attack the drama in earnest  i cannot mix the skeins  thus  though im morally sure there is a play in otto i dare not look  for it  i shoot straight at the story  as a story a comedy i think otto very well constructed the  echoes are very good all the sentiments change round and the  points of view are continually and i think if you please  happily contrasted  none of it is exactly funny but some of it is  smiling  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    la solitude hyeres summer 1883  my dear gosse  i have now leisurely read your volume pretty  soon by the way you will receive one of mine  it is a pleasant instructive and scholarly volume  the three  best being quite out of sight  crashaw otway and etherege   they are excellent i hesitate between them but perhaps crashaw is  the most brilliant  your webster is not my webster nor your herrick my herrick  on  these matters we must fire a gun to leeward show our colours and  go by  argument is impossible  they are two of my favourite  authors  herrick above all  i suppose they are two of yours   well januslike they do behold us two with diverse countenances  few features are common to these different avatars and we can but  agree to differ but still with gratitude to our entertainers like  two guests at the same dinner one of whom takes clear and one  white soup  by my way of thinking neither of us need be wrong  the other papers are all interesting adequate clear and with a  pleasant spice of the romantic  it is a book you may be well  pleased to have so finished and will do you much good  the  crashaw is capital  capital i like the taste of it  preface  clean and dignified  the handling throughout workmanlike with  some four or five touches of preciosity which i regret  with my thanks for information entertainment and a pleasurable  envy here and there  yours affectionately  r l s    letter  to w e henley    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var september 19 1883  dear boy  our letters vigorously cross  you will ere this have  received a note to coggie  god knows what was in it  it is strange a little before the first word you sent me  so late   kindly late i know and feel  i was thinking in my bed when i  knew you i had six friends  bob i had by nature then came the  good james walter  with all his failings  the gentleman of the  lot alas to sink so low alas to do so little but now thank god  in his quiet rest next i found baxter  well do i remember telling  walter i had unearthed a ws that i thought would do  it was in  the academy lane and he questioned me as to the signets  qualifications fourth came simpson somewhere about the same time  i began to get intimate with jenkin last came colvin  then one  black winter afternoon long leslie stephen in his velvet jacket  met me in the spec by appointment took me over to the infirmary  and in the crackling blighting gaslight showed me that old head  whose excellent representation i see before me in the photograph   now when a man has six friends to introduce a seventh is usually  hopeless  yet when you were presented you took to them and they  to you upon the nail  you must have been a fine fellow but what a  singular fortune i must have had in my six friends that you should  take to all  i dont know if it is good latin most probably not   but this is enscrolled before my eye for walter  tandem e nubibus  in apricum properat  rest i suppose i know was all that  remained but o to look back to remember all the mirth all the  kindness all the humorous limitations and loved defects of that  character to think that he was young with me sharing that  weatherbeaten fergussonian youth looking forward through the  clouds to the sunburst and now clean gone from my path silent   well well  this has been a strange awakening  last night when i  was alone in the house with the window open on the lovely still  night i could have sworn he was in the room with me i could show  you the spot and what was very curious i heard his rich  laughter a thing i had not called to mind for i know not how long  i see his coral waistcoat studs that he wore the first time he  dined in my house i see his attitude leaning back a little  already with something of a portly air and laughing internally   how i admired him  and now in the west kirk  i am trying to write out this haunting bodily sense of absence  besides what else should i write of  yes looking back i think of him as one who was good though  sometimes clouded  he was the only gentle one of all my friends  save perhaps the other walter  and he was certainly the only  modest man among the lot  he never gave himself away he kept back  his secret there was always a gentle problem behind all  dear  dear what a wreck and yet how pleasant is the retrospect  god  doeth all things well though by what strange solemn and  murderous contrivances  it is strange  he was the only man i ever loved who did not  habitually interrupt  the fact draws my own portrait  and it is  one of the many reasons why i count myself honoured by his  friendship  a man like you had to like me you could not help  yourself but ferrier was above me we were not equals his true  self humoured and smiled paternally upon my failings even as i  humoured and sorrowed over his  well first his mother then himself they are gone  in their  resting graves  when i come to think of it i do not know what i said to his  sister and i fear to try again  could you send her this  there  is too much both about yourself and me in it but that if you do  not mind is but a mark of sincerity  it would let her know how  entirely in the mind of i suppose his oldest friend the good  true ferrier obliterates the memory of the other who was only his  lunatic brother  judge of this for me and do as you please anyway i will try to  write to her again my last was some kind of scrawl that i could  not see for crying  this came upon me remember with terrible  suddenness i was surprised by this death and it is fifteen or  sixteen years since first i saw the handsome face in the spec  i  made sure besides to have died first  love to you your wife  and her sisters   ever yours dear boy  r l s  i never knew any man so superior to himself as poor james walter   the best of him only came as a vision like corsica from the  corniche  he never gave his measure either morally or  intellectually  the curse was on him  even his friends did not  know him but by fits  i have passed hours with him when he was so  wise good and sweet that i never knew the like of it in any  other  and for a beautiful good humour he had no match  i  remember breaking in upon him once with a whole redhot story in  my worst manner pouring words upon him by the hour about some  truck not worth an egg that had befallen me and suddenly some  half hour after finding that the sweet fellow had some concern of  his own of infinitely greater import that he was patiently and  smilingly waiting to consult me on  it sounds nothing but the  courtesy and the unselfishness were perfect  it makes me rage to  think how few knew him and how many had the chance to sneer at  their better  well he was not wasted that we know though if anything looked  liker irony than this fitting of a man out with these rich  qualities and faculties to be wrecked and aborted from the very  stocks i do not know the name of it  yet we see that he has left  an influence the memory of his patient courtesy has often checked  me in rudeness has it not you  you can form no idea of how handsome walter was  at twenty he was  splendid to see then too he had the sense of power in him and  great hopes he looked forward ever jesting of course but he  looked to see himself where he had the right to expect  he  believed in himself profoundly but he never disbelieved in others   to the roughest highland student he always had his fine kind open  dignity of manner and a good word behind his back  the last time that i saw him before leaving for america  it was a  sad blow to both of us  when he heard i was leaving and that  might be the last time we might meet  it almost was so  he was  terribly upset and came round at once  we sat late in baxters  empty house where i was sleeping  my dear friend walter ferrier   o if i had only written to him more if only one of us in these  last days had been well  but i ever cherished the honour of his  friendship and now when he is gone i know what i have lost still  better  we live on meaning to meet but when the hope is gone  the pang comes  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    la solitude hyereslespalmiers 26th september 1883  my dear gosse  it appears a bolt from transatlantica is necessary  to produce four lines from you  it is not flattering but as i was  always a bad correspondent tis a vice to which i am lenient  i  give you to know however that i have already twice this makes  three times sent you what i please to call a letter and received  from you in return a subterfuge  or nothing     my present purpose however which must not be postponed is to ask  you to telegraph to the americans  after a summer of good health of a very radiant order toothache  and the death of a very old friend which came upon me like a  thunderclap have rather shelved my powers  i stare upon the  paper not write  i wish i could write like your sculptors yet i  am well aware that i should not try in that direction  a certain  warmth tepid enough and a certain dash of the picturesque are my  poor essential qualities and if i went fooling after the too  classical i might lose even these  but i envied you that page  i am of course deep in schemes i was so ever  execution alone  somewhat halts  how much do you make per annum i wonder  this  year for the first time i shall pass 300 pounds i may even get  halfway to the next milestone  this seems but a faint  remuneration and the devil of it is that i manage with sickness  and moves and education and the like to keep steadily in front  of my income  however i console myself with this that if i were  anything else under gods heaven and had the same crank health i  should make an even zero  if i had with my present knowledge  twelve months of my old health i would could and should do  something neat  as it is i have to tinker at my things in little  sittings and the rent or the butcher or something is always  calling me off to rattle up a potboiler  and then comes a back set of my health and i have to twiddle my fingers and play  patience  well i do not complain but i do envy strong health where it is  squandered  treasure your strength and may you never learn by  experience the profound ennui and irritation of the shelved artist   for then what is life  all that one has done to make ones life  effective then doubles the itch of inefficiency  i trust also you may be long without finding out the devil that  there is in a bereavement  after love it is the one great surprise  that life preserves for us  now i dont think i can be astonished  any more  yours affectionately  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var october 1883  colvin colvin colvin  yours received also interesting

error to the child the stars appear to be  there any word that suggests illusion is a horror  4 i dont care i take a different view of the vocative  5 bewildering and childering are good enough for me  these are  rhymes jingles i dont go for eternity and the three unities  i will delete some of those condemned but not all  i dont care  for the name penny whistles i sent a sheaf to henley when i sent  em  but ive forgot the others  i would just as soon call em  rimes for children as anything else  i am not proud nor  particular  your remarks on the black arrow are to the point  i am pleased you  liked crookback he is a fellow whose hellish energy has always  fired my attention  i wish shakespeare had written the play after  he had learned some of the rudiments of literature and art rather  than before  some day i will retickle the sable missile and  shoot it moyennant finances once more into the air i can lighten  it of much and devote some more attention to dick o gloucester   its great sport to write tushery  by this i reckon you will have heard of my proposed excursiolorum  to the isles of greece the isles of greece and kindred sites  if  the excursiolorum goes on that is if moyennant finances comes  off i shall write to beg you to collect introductiolorums for me  distinguo  1 silverado was not written in america but in  switzerlands icy mountains  2 what you read is

seeley is too clever to live and the book a gem  but why has  he read too much arnold  why will he avoid  obviously avoid   fine writing up to which he has led  this is a winking curled andoiled ultracultured oxforddon sort of an affectation that  infuriates my honest soul  you see  they say  how unbombastic  we are we come right up to eloquence and when its hanging on  the pen dammy we scorn it  it is literary derondaism  if you  dont want the woman the image or the phrase mortify your vanity  and avoid the appearance of wanting them    letter  to w h low    la solitude hyeres october 1883  my dear low     some day or other in cassells magazine of  art you will see a paper which will interest you and where your  name appears  it is called fontainebleau  village communities of  artists and the signature of r l stevenson will be found  annexed  please tell the editor of manhattan the following secrets for me   1st that i am a beast 2nd that i owe him a letter 3rd that i  have lost his and cannot recall either his name or address 4th  that i am very deep in engagements which my absurd health makes it  hard for me to overtake but 5th that i will bear him in mind 6th  and last that i am a brute  my address is still the same and i live in a most sweet corner of  the universe sea and fine hills before me and a rich variegated  plain and at my back a craggy hill loaded with vast feudal ruins   i am very quiet a person passing by my door half startles me but  i enjoy the most aromatic airs and at night the most wonderful  view into a moonlit garden  by day this garden fades into nothing  overpowered by its surroundings and the luminous distance but at  night and when the moon is out that garden the arbour the flight  of stairs that mount the artificial hillock the plumed blue gum trees that hang trembling become the very skirts of paradise   angels i know frequent it and it thrills all night with the flutes  of silence  damn that garden and by day it is gone  continue to testify boldly against realism  down with dagon the  fish god  all art swings down towards imitation in these days  fatally  but the man who loves art with wisdom sees the joke it  is the lustful that tremble and respect her ladyship but the  honest and romantic lovers of the muse can see a joke and sit down  to laugh with apollo  the prospect of your return to europe is very agreeable and i was  pleased by what you said about your parents  one of my oldest  friends died recently and this has given me new thoughts of death   up to now i had rather thought of him as a mere personal enemy of  my own but now that i see him hunting after my friends he looks  altogether darker  my own father is not well and henley of whom  you must have heard me speak is in a questionable state of health   these things are very solemn and take some of the colour out of  life  it is a great thing after all to be a man of reasonable  honour and kindness  do you remember once consulting me in paris  whether you had not better sacrifice honesty to art and how after  much confabulation we agreed that your art would suffer if you  did  we decided better than we knew  in this strange welter where  we live all hangs together by a million filaments and to do  reasonably well by others is the first prerequisite of art  art  is a virtue and if i were the man i should be my art would rise  in the proportion of my life  if you were privileged to give some happiness to your parents i  know your art will gain by it  by god it will  sic subscribitur  r l s    letter  to r a m stevenson    la solitude hyereslespalmiers october 1883  my dear bob  yes i got both your letters at lyons but have been  since then decading in several steps toothache fever ferriers  death lung  now it is decided i am to leave tomorrow penniless  for nice to see dr williams  i was much struck by your last  i have written a breathless note  on realism for henley a fifth part of the subject hurriedly  touched which will show you how my thoughts are driving  you are  now at last beginning to think upon the problems of executive  plastic art for you are now for the first time attacking them   hitherto you have spoken and thought of two things  technique and  the ars artium or common background of all arts  studio work is  the real touch  that is the genial error of the present french  teaching  realism i regard as a mere question of method  the  brown foreground old mastery and the like ranking with  villanelles as technical sports and pastimes  real art whether  ideal or realistic addresses precisely the same feeling and seeks  the same qualities  significance or charm  and the same  very  same  inspiration is only methodically differentiated according as  the artist is an arrant realist or an arrant idealist  each by  his own method seeks to save and perpetuate the same significance  or charm the one by suppressing the other by forcing detail   all other idealism is the brown foreground over again and hence  only art in the sense of a game like cup and ball  all other  realism is not art at all  but not at all  it is then an  insincere and showy handicraft  were you to reread some balzac as i have been doing it would  greatly help to clear your eyes  he was a man who never found his  method  an inarticulate shakespeare smothered under forcible feeble detail  it is astounding to the riper mind how bad he is  how feeble how untrue how tedious and of course when he  surrendered to his temperament how good and powerful  and yet  never plain nor clear  he could not consent to be dull and thus  became so  he would leave nothing undeveloped and thus drowned  out of sight of land amid the multitude of crying and incongruous  details  there is but one art  to omit  o if i knew how to omit  i would ask no other knowledge  a man who knew how to omit would  make an iliad of a daily paper  your definition of seeing is quite right  it is the first part of  omission to be partly blind  artistic sight is judicious  blindness  sam bough must have been a jolly blind old boy  he  would turn a corner look for onehalf or quarter minute and then  say thisll do lad  down he sat there and then with whole  artistic plan scheme of colour and the like and begin by laying  a foundation of powerful and seemingly incongruous colour on the  block  he saw not the scene but the watercolour sketch  every  artist by sixty should so behold nature  where does he learn that   in the studio i swear  he goes to nature for facts relations  values  material as a man before writing a historical novel  reads up memoirs  but it is not by reading memoirs that he has  learned the selective criterion  he has learned that in the  practice of his art and he will never learn it well but when  disengaged from the ardent struggle of immediate representation of  realistic and ex facto art  he learns it in the crystallisation of  daydreams in changing not in copying fact in the pursuit of  the ideal not in the study of nature  these temples of art are  as you say inaccessible to the realistic climber  it is not by  looking at the sea that you get   the multitudinous seas incarnadine   nor by looking at mont blanc that you find   and visited all night by troops of stars   a kind of ardour of the blood is the mother of all this and  according as this ardour is swayed by knowledge and seconded by  craft the art expression flows clear and significance and charm  like a moon rising are born above the barren juggle of mere  symbols  the painter must study more from nature than the man of words  but  why  because literature deals with mens business and passions  which in the game of life we are irresistibly obliged to study  but painting with relations of light and colour and  significances and form which from the immemorial habit of the  race we pass over with an unregardful eye  hence this crouching  upon campstools and these crusts  but neither one nor other is a  part of art only preliminary studies  i want you to help me to get people to understand that realism is a  method and only methodic in its consequences when the realist is  an artist that is and supposing the idealist with whom you  compare him to be anything but a farceur and a dilettante  the two  schools of working do and should lead to the choice of different  subjects  but that is a consequence not a cause  see my chaotic  note which will appear i fancy in november in henleys sheet  poor ferrier it bust me horrid  he was after you the oldest of  my friends  i am now very tired and will go to bed having prelected freely   fanny will finish  r l s    letter  to thomas stevenson    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var 12th october 1883  my dear father  i have just lunched the day is exquisite the  air comes though the open window rich with odour and i am by no  means spiritually minded  your letter however was very much  valued and has been read oftener than once  what you say about  yourself i was glad to hear a little decent resignation is not  only becoming a christian but is likely to be excellent for the  health of a stevenson  to fret and fume is undignified suicidally  foolish and theologically unpardonable we are here not to make  but to tread predestined pathways we are the foam of a wave and  to preserve a proper equanimity is not merely the first part of  submission to god but the chief of possible kindnesses to those  about us  i am lecturing myself but you also  to do our best is  one part but to wash our hands smilingly of the consequence is the  next part of any sensible virtue  i have come for the moment to a pause in my moral works for i  have many irons in the fire and i wish to finish something to  bring coin before i can afford to go on with what i think  doubtfully to be a duty  it is a most difficult work a touch of  the parson will drive off those i hope to influence a touch of  overstrained laxity besides disgusting like a grimace may do  harm  nothing that i have ever seen yet speaks directly and  efficaciously to young men and i do hope i may find the art and  wisdom to fill up a gap  the great point as i see it is to ask  as little as possible and meet if it may be every view or  absence of view and it should be must be easy  honesty is the  one desideratum but think how hard a one to meet  i think all the  time of ferrier and myself these are the pair that i address   poor ferrier so much a better man than i and such a temporal  wreck  but the thing of which we must divest our minds is to look  partially upon others all is to be viewed and the creature  judged as he must be by his creator not dissected through a prism  of morals but in the unrefracted ray  so seen and in relation to  the almost omnipotent surroundings who is to distinguish between  f and such a man as dr candlish or between such a man as david  hume and such an one as robert burns  to compare my poor and good  walter with myself is to make me startle he upon all grounds  above the merely expedient was the nobler being  yet wrecked  utterly ere the full age of manhood and the last skirmishes so  well fought so humanly useless so pathetically brave only the  leaps of an expiring lamp  all this is a very pointed instance   it shuts the mouth  i have learned more in some ways from him  than from any other soul i ever met and he strange to think was  the best gentleman in all kinder senses that i ever knew  ever  your affectionate son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w h low    chalet la solitude hyeres oct 23 1883  my dear low  cest dun bon camarade and i am much obliged to  you for your two letters and the inclosure  times are a lityle  changed with all of us since the ever memorable days of lavenue   hallowed be his name hallowed his old fleury  of which you did  not see  i think  as i did  the glorious apotheosis  advanced  on a tuesday to three francs on the thursday to six and on friday  swept off holus bolus for the proprietors private consumption   well we had the start of that proprietor  many a good bottle came  our way and was i think worthily made welcome  i am pleased that mr gilder should like my literature and i ask  you particularly to thank mr bunner have i the name right for  his notice which was of that friendly headlong sort that really  pleases an author like what the french call a shakehands  it  pleased me the more coming from the states where i have met not  much recognition save from the buccaneers and above all from  pirates who misspell my name  i saw my book advertised in a number  of the critic as the work of one r l stephenson and i own i  boiled  it is so easy to know the name of the man whose book you  have stolen for there it is at full length on the titlepage of  your booty  but no damn him not he  he calls me stephenson   these woes i only refer to by the way as they set a higher value  on the century notice  i am now a person with an established illhealth  a wife  a dog  possessed with an evil a gadarene spirit  a chalet on a hill  looking out over the mediterranean  a certain reputation  and  very obscure finances  otherwise very much the same i guess and  were a bottle of fleury a thing to be obtained capable of  developing theories along with a fit spirit even as of yore  yet i  now draw near to the middle ages nearly three years ago that  fatal thirty struck and yet the great work is not yet done  not  yet even conceived  but so as one goes on the wood seems to  thicken the footpath to narrow and the house beautiful on the  hills summit to draw further and further away  we learn indeed  to use our means but only to learn along with it the paralysing  knowledge that these means are only applicable to two or three poor  commonplace motives  eight years ago if i could have slung ink as  i can now i should have thought myself well on the road after  shakespeare and now  i find i have only got a pair of walking shoes and not yet begun to travel  and art is still away there on  the mountain summit  but i need not continue for of course this  is your story just as much as it is mine and strange to think it  was shakespeares too and beethovens and phidiass  it is a  blessed thing that in this forest of art we can pursue our wood lice and sparrows and not catch them with almost the same fervour  of exhilaration as that with which sophocles hunted and brought  down the mastodon  tell me something of your work and your wife  my dear fellow i  am yours ever  r l stevenson  my wife begs to be remembered to both of you i cannot say as much  for my dog who has never seen you but he would like on general  principles to bite you    letter  to w e henley    hyeres november 1883  my dear lad      of course my seamanship is jimmy  did i not  beseech you i know not how often to find me an ancient mariner   and you whose own wifes own brother is one of the ancientest did  nothing for me  as for my seamen did runciman ever know  eighteenth century buccaneers  no  well no more did i  but i  have known and sailed with seamen too and lived and eaten with  them and i made my putup shot in no great ignorance but as a  putup thing has to be made ie to be coherent and picturesque  and damn the expense  are they fairly lively on the wires  then  favour me with your tongues  are they wooden and dim and no  sport  then it is i that am silent otherwise not  the work  strange as it may sound in the ear is not a work of realism  the  next thing i shall hear is that the etiquette is wrong in ottos  court  with a warrant and i mean it to be so and the whole  matter never cost me half a thought  i make these paper people to  please myself and skelt and god almighty and with no ulterior  purpose  yet am i mortal myself for as i remind you i begged  for a supervising mariner  however my heart is in the right  place  i have been to sea but i never crossed the threshold of a  court and the courts shall be the way i want em  im glad to think i owe you the review that pleased me best of all  the reviews i ever had the one i liked best before that was s on  the arabians  these two are the flowers of the collection  according to me  to live reading such reviews and die eating  ortolans  sich is my aspiration  whenever you come you will be equally welcome  i am trying to  finish otto ere you shall arrive so as to take and be able to  enjoy a wellearned  o yes a wellearned  holiday  longman  fetched by otto  is it a spoon or a spoilt horn  momentous if  the latter if the former a spoon to dip much praise and pudding  and to give i do think much pleasure  the last part now in  hand much smiles upon me  ever yours  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    la solitude hyeres november 1883  my dear mother  you must not blame me too much for my silence i  am over head and ears in work and do not know what to do first  i  have been hard at otto hard at silverado proofs which i have  worked over again to a tremendous extent cutting adding  rewriting until some of the worst chapters of the original are  now to my mind as good as any  i was the more bound to make it  good as i had such liberal terms its not for want of trying if i  have failed  i got your letter on my birthday indeed that was how i found it  out about three in the afternoon when postie comes  thank you for  all you said  as for my wife that was the best investment ever  made by man but in our branch of the family we seem to marry  well  i considering my piles of work am wonderfully well i have  not been so busy for i know not how long  i hope you will send me  the money i asked however as i am not only penniless but shall  remain so in all human probability for some considerable time  i  have got in the mass of my expectations and the 100 pounds which  is to float us on the new year can not come due till silverado is  all ready i am delaying it myself for the moment then will follow  the binders and the travellers and an infinity of other nuisances  and only at the last the jinglingtingling  do you know that treasure island has appeared  in the november  number of henleys magazine a capital number anyway there is a  funny publishers puff of it for your book also a bad article by  me  lang dotes on treasure island  except tom sawyer and the  odyssey he writes i never liked any romance so much  i will  inclose the letter though  the bogue is angelic although very  dirty  it has rained  at last  it was jolly cold when the rain  came  i was overjoyed to hear such good news of my father  let him go on  at that  ever your affectionate  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var november 1883  my dear colvin  i have been bad but as you were worse i feel no  shame  i raise a blooming countenance not the evidence of a self righteous spirit  i continue my uphill fight with the twin spirits of bankruptcy and  indigestion  duns rage about my portal at least to fancys ear  i suppose you heard of ferriers death  my oldest friend except  bob  it has much upset me  i did not fancy how much  i am  strangely concerned about it  my house is the loveliest spot in the universe the moonlight  nights we have are incredible love poetry and music and the  arabian nights inhabit just my corner of the world  nest there  like mavises   here lies the carcase of robert louis stevenson an active austere and not inelegant writer who at the termination of a long career wealthy wise benevolent and honoured by the attention of two hemispheres yet owned it to have been his crowning favour to inhabit la solitude   with the consent of the intelligent edility of hyeres he has been  interred below this frugal stone in the garden which he honoured  for so long with his poetic presence  i must write more solemn letters  adieu  write  r l s    letter  to mrs milne    la solitude hyeres november 1883  my dear henrietta  certainly who else would they be  more by  token on that particular occasion you were sailing under the  title of princess royal i after a furious contest under that of  prince alfred and willie still a little sulky as the prince of  wales  we were all in a buck basket about halfway between the  swing and the gate and i can still see the pirate squadron heave  in sight upon the weather bow  i wrote a piece besides on giant bunker but i was not happily  inspired and it is condemned  perhaps ill try again he was a  horrid fellow giant bunker and some of my happiest hours were  passed in pursuit of him  you were a capital fellow to play  how  few there were who could  none better than yourself  i shall  never forget some of the days at bridge of allan they were one  golden dream  see a good boy in the penny whistles much of the  sentiment of which is taken direct from one evening at b of a  when we had had a great play with the little glasgow girl   hallowed be that fat book of fairy tales  do you remember acting  the fair one with golden locks  what a romantic drama  generally  speaking whenever i think of play it is pretty certain that you  will come into my head  i wrote a paper called childs play  once where i believe you or willie would recognise things     surely willie is just the man to marry and if his wife wasnt a  happy woman i think i could tell her who was to blame  is there  no word of it  well these things are beyond arrangement and the  wind bloweth where it listeth  which i observe is generally  towards the west in scotland  here it prefers a southeasterly  course and is called the mistral  usually with an adjective in  front  but if you will remember my yesterdays toothache and this  mornings crick you will be in a position to choose an adjective  for yourself  not that the wind is unhealthy only when it comes  strong it is both very high and very cold which makes it the dv l  but as i am writing to a lady i had better avoid this topic  winds requiring a great scope of language  please remember me to all at home give ramsay a pennyworth of  acidulated drops for his good taste  and believe me your  affectionate cousin  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss ferrier    la solitude hyeres var november 22 1883  dear miss ferrier  many thanks for the photograph  it is  well  it is like most photographs  the sun is an artist of too much  renown and at any rate we who knew walter in the brave days of  old will be difficult to please  i was inexpressibly touched to get a letter from some lawyers as to  some money  i have never had any account with my friends some  have gained and some lost and i should feel there was something  dishonest in a partial liquidation even if i could recollect the  facts which i cannot  but the fact of his having put aside this  memorandum touched me greatly  the mystery of his life is great  our chemist in this place who  had been at malvern recognised the picture  you may remember  walter had a romantic affection for all pharmacies and the bottles  in the window were for him a poem  he said once that he knew no  pleasure like driving through a lamplit city waiting for the  chemists to go by  all these things return now  he had a pretty full translation of schillers aesthetic letters  which we read together as well as the second part of faust in  gladstone terrace he helping me with the german  there is no  keepsake i should more value than the ms of that translation   they were the best days i ever had with him little dreaming all  would so soon be over  it needs a blow like this to convict a man  of mortality and its burthen  i always thought i should go by  myself not to survive  but now i feel as if the earth were  undermined and all my friends have lost one thickness of reality  since that one passed  those are happy who can take it otherwise  with that i found things all beginning to dislimn  here we have no  abiding city and one felt as though he had  and o too much acted  but if you tell me he did not feel my silence  however he must  have done so and my guilt is irreparable now  i thank god at  least heartily that he did not resent it  please remember me to sir alexander and lady grant to whose care i  will address this  when next i am in edinburgh i will take  flowers alas to the west kirk  many a long hour we passed in  graveyards the man who has gone and i  or rather not that man   but the beautiful genial witty youth who so betrayed him  dear  miss ferrier i am yours most sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w h low    la solitude hyeres var 13th december 1883  my dear low     i was much pleased with what you send about my  work  illhealth is a great handicapper in the race  i have never  at command that press of spirits that are necessary to strike out a  thing redhot  silverado is an example of stuff worried and pawed  about god knows how often in poor health and you can see for  yourself the result  good pages an imperfect fusion a certain  languor of the whole  not in short art  i have told roberts to  send you a copy of the book when it appears where there are some  fair passages that will be new to you  my brief romance prince  otto  far my most difficult adventure up to now  is near an end   i have still one chapter to write de fond en comble and three or  four to strengthen or recast  the rest is done  i do not know if  i have made a spoon or only spoiled a horn but i am tempted to  hope the first  if the present bargain hold it will not see the  light of day for some thirteen months  then i shall be glad to  know how it strikes you  there is a good deal of stuff in it both  dramatic and i think poetic and the story is not like these  purposeless fables of today but is at least intended to stand  firm upon a base of philosophy  or morals  as you please  it has  been long gestated and is wrought with care  enfin nous verrons   my labours have this year for the first time been rewarded with  upwards of 350 pounds that of itself so base we are encourages  me and the better tenor of my health yet more  remember me to  mrs low and believe me yours most sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to thomas stevenson    la solitude december 20 1883  my dear father  i do not know which of us is to blame i suspect  it is you this time  the last accounts of you were pretty good i  was pleased to see i am on the whole very well  suffering a  little still from my fever and liver complications but better  i have just finished rereading a book which i counsel you above  all things not to read as it has made me very ill and would make  you worse  lockharts scott  it is worth reading as all things  are from time to time that keep us nose to nose with fact though i  think such reading may be abused and that a great deal of life is  better spent in reading of a light and yet chivalrous strain   thus no waverley novel approaches in power blackness bitterness  and moral elevation to the diary and lockharts narrative of the  end and yet the waverley novels are better reading for every day  than the life  you may take a tonic daily but not phlebotomy  the great double danger of taking life too easily and taking it  too hard how difficult it is to balance that  but we are all too  little inclined to faith we are all in our serious moments too  much inclined to forget that all are sinners and fall justly by  their faults and therefore that we have no more to do with that  than with the thundercloud only to trust and do our best and  wear as smiling a face as may be for others and ourselves  but  there is no royal road among this complicated business  hegel the  german got the best word of all philosophy with his antinomies   the contrary of everything is its postulate  that is of course  grossly expressed but gives a hint of the idea which contains a  great deal of the mysteries of religion and a vast amount of the  practical wisdom of life  for your part there is no doubt as to  your duty  to take things easy and be as happy as you can for  your sake and my mothers and that of many besides  excuse this  sermon  ever your loving son  r l s    letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    la solitude december 25 1883  my dear father and mother  this it is supposed will reach you  about christmas and i believe i should include lloyd in the  greeting  but i want to lecture my father he is not grateful  enough he is like fanny his resignation is not the true blue   a man who has gained a stone whose son is better and after so  many fears to the contrary i dare to say a credit to him whose  business is arranged whose marriage is a picture  what i should  call resignation in such a case as his would be to take down his  fiddle and play as lood as ever he could  that and nought else   and now you dear old pious ingrate on this christmas morning  think what your mercies have been and do not walk too far before  your breakfast  as far as to the top of india street then to the  top of dundas street and then to your ain stair heid and do not  forget that even as laborare so joculari est orare and to be  happy the first step to being pious  i have as good as finished my novel and a hard job it has been   but now practically over  laus deo  my financial prospects better  than ever before my excellent wife a touch dolorous like mr  tommy my bogue quite converted and myself in good spirits  o  send curry powder per baxter  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    la solitude hyeres last sunday of 83  my dear mother  i give my father up  i give him a parable  that  the waverley novels are better reading for every day than the  tragic life  and he takes it backside foremost and shakes his  head and is gloomier than ever  tell him that i give him up  i  dont want no such a parent  this is not the man for my money  i  do not call that by the name of religion which fills a man with  bile  i write him a whole letter bidding him beware of extremes  and telling him that his gloom is gallowsworthy and i get back an  answer  perish the thought of it  here am i on the threshold of another year when according to all  human foresight i should long ago have been resolved into my  elements here am i who you were persuaded was born to disgrace  you  and i will do you the justice to add on no such  insufficient grounds  no very burning discredit when all is done  here am i married and the marriage recognised to be a blessing of  the first order a1 at lloyds  there is he at his not first  youth able to take more exercise than i at thirtythree and  gaining a stones weight a thing of which i am incapable  there  are you has the man no gratitude  there is smeoroch  is he  blind  tell him from me that all this is  not the true blue  i will think more of his prayers when i see in him a spirit of  praise  piety is a more childlike and happy attitude than he  admits  martha martha do you hear the knocking at the door  but  mary was happy  even the shorter catechism not the merriest  epitome of religion and a work exactly as pious although not quite  so true as the multiplication table  even that dryasdust epitome  begins with a heroic note  what is mans chief end  let him study  that and ask himself if to refuse to enjoy gods kindest gifts is  in the spirit indicated  up dullard  it is better service to  enjoy a novel than to mump  i have been most unjust to the shorter catechism i perceive  i  wish to say that i keenly admire its merits as a performance and  that all that was in my mind was its peculiarly unreligious and  unmoral texture from which defect it can never of course  exercise the least influence on the minds of children  but they  learn fine style and some austere thinking unconsciously  ever  your loving son  r l s    letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var january 1 1884  my dear people  a good new year to you  the year closes leaving  me with 50 pounds in the bank owing no man nothing 100 pounds  more due to me in a week or so and 150 pounds more in the course  of the month and i can look back on a total receipt of 465 pounds  0s 6d for the last twelve months  and yet i am not happy  yet i beg  here is my beggary  1 sellars trial 2 george borrows book about wales 3 my grandfathers trip to holland 4 and but this is i fear impossible the bell rock book  when i think of how last year began after four months of sickness  and idleness all my plans gone to water myself starting alone a  kind of spectre for nice  should i not be grateful  come let us  sing unto the lord  nor should i forget the expected visit but i will not believe in  that till it befall i am no cultivator of disappointments tis a  herb that does not grow in my garden but i get some good crops  both of remorse and gratitude  the last i can recommend to all  gardeners it grows best in shiny weather but once well grown is  very hardy it does not require much labour only that the  husbandman should smoke his pipe about the flowerplots and admire  gods pleasant wonders  winter green otherwise known as  resignation or the false gratitude plant springs in much the  same soil is little hardier if at all and requires to be so dug  about and dunged that there is little margin left for profit  the  variety known as the black winter green h v stevensoniana is  rather for ornament than profit  john do you see that bed of resignation  its doin bravely  sir  john i will not have it in my garden it flatters not the  eye and comforts not the stomach root it out  sir i hae seen  o them that rase as high as nettles gran plants  what then   were they as tall as alps if still unsavoury and bleak what  matters it  out with it then and in its place put laughter and a  good conceit that capital home evergreen and a bush of flowering  piety  but see it be the flowering sort  the other species is no  ornament to any gentlemans back garden  jno bunyan    letter  to sidney colvin    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var 9th march 1884  my dear s c  you will already have received a not very sane  note from me so your patience was rewarded  may i say your  patient silence  however now comes a letter which on receipt i  thus acknowledge  i have already expressed myself as to the political aspect  about  grahame i feel happier it does seem to have been really a good  neat honest piece of work  we do not seem to be so badly off for  commanders  wolseley and roberts and this pile of woods  stewarts alisons grahames and the like  had we but one  statesman on any side of the house  two chapters of otto do remain  one to rewrite one to create and  i am not yet able to tackle them  for me it is my chief o works  hence probably not so for others since it only means that i have  here attacked the greatest difficulties  but some chapters towards  the end  three in particular  i do think come off  i find them  stirring dramatic and not unpoetical  we shall see however as  like as not the effort will be more obvious than the success   for of course i strung myself hard to carry it out  the next  will come easier and possibly be more popular  i believe in the  covering of much paper each time with a definite and not too  difficult artistic purpose and then from time to time drawing  oneself up and trying in a superior effort to combine the  facilities thus acquired or improved  thus one progresses  but  mind it is very likely that the big effort instead of being the  masterpiece may be the blotted copy the gymnastic exercise  this  no man can tell only the brutal and licentious public snouting in  mudies washtrough can return a dubious answer  i am today thanks to a pure heaven and a beneficent loud talking antiseptic mistral on the high places as to health and  spirits  money holds out wonderfully  fanny has gone for a drive  to certain meadows which are now one sheet of jonquils  seabound  meadows the thought of which may freshen you in bloomsbury  ye  have been fresh and fair ye have been filled with flowers  i  fear i misquote  why do people babble  surely herrick in his  true vein is superior to martial himself though martial is a very  pretty poet  did you ever read st augustine  the first chapters of the  confessions are marked by a commanding genius  shakespearian in  depth  i was struck dumb but alas when you begin to wander into  controversy the poet drops out  his description of infancy is  most seizing  and how is this  sed majorum nugae negotia  vocantur puerorum autem talia cum sint puniuntur a majoribus   which is quite after the heart of r l s  see also his splendid  passage about the luminosus limes amicitiae and the nebulae de  limosa concupiscentia carnis going on utrumque in confuso  aestuabat et rapiebat imbecillam aetatem per abrupta cupiditatum   that utrumque is a real contribution to lifes science  lust  alone is but a pigmy but it never or rarely attacks us single handed  do you ever read to go miles off indeed the incredible barbey  daurevilly  a psychological poe  to be for a moment henley  i  own with pleasure i prefer him with all his folly rot sentiment  and mixed metaphors to the whole modern school in france  it  makes me laugh when its nonsense and when he gets an effect  though its still nonsense and mere poery not poesy it wakens  me  ce qui ne meurt pas nearly killed me with laughing and left  me  well it left me very nearly admiring the old ass  at least  its the kind of thing one feels one couldnt do  the dreadful  moonlight when they all three sit silent in the room  by george  sir its imagined  and the brief scene between the husband and  wife is all there  quant au fond the whole thing of course is a  fever dream and worthy of eternal laughter  had the young man  broken stones and the two women been hardworking honest  prostitutes there had been an end of the whole immoral and  baseless business  you could at least have respected them in that  case  i also read petronius arbiter which is a rum work not so immoral  as most modern works but singularly silly  i tackled some tacitus  too  i got them with a dreadful french crib on the same page with  the text which helps me along and drives me mad  the french do  not even try to translate  they try to be much more classical than  the classics with astounding results of barrenness and tedium   tacitus i fear was too solid for me  i liked the war part but  the dreary intriguing at rome was too much  r l s    letter  to mr dick    la solitude hyeres var 12th march 1884  my dear mr dick  i have been a great while owing you a letter  but i am not without excuses as you have heard  i overworked to  get a piece of work finished before i had my holiday thinking to  enjoy it more and instead of that the machinery near hand came  sundry in my hands like murdies uniform  however i am now i  think in a fair way of recovery i think i was made what there is  of me of whipcord and thornswitches surely i am tough  but i  fancy i shall not overdrive again or not so long  it is my theory  that work is highly beneficial but that it should if possible  and certainly for such partially brokendown instruments as the  thing i call my body be taken in batches with a clear break and  breathing space between  i always do vary my work laying one  thing aside to take up another not merely because i believe it  rests the brain but because i have found it most beneficial to the  result  reading bacon says makes a full man but what makes me  full on any subject is to banish it for a time from all my  thoughts  however what i now propose is out of every quarter to  work two months and rest the third  i believe i shall get more  done as i generally manage on my present scheme to have four  months impotent illness and two of imperfect health  one before  one after i break down  this at least is not an economical  division of the year  i reread the other day that heartbreaking book the life of scott   one should read such works now and then but o not often  as i  live i feel more and more that literature should be cheerful and  bravespirited even if it cannot be made beautiful and pious and  heroic  we wish it to be a green place the waverley novels are  better to reread than the overtrue life fine as dear sir walter  was  the bible in most parts is a cheerful book it is our  little piping theologies tracts and sermons that are dull and  dowie and even the shorter catechism which is scarcely a work of  consolation opens with the best and shortest and completest sermon  ever written  upon mans chief end  believe me my dear mr  dick very sincerely yours  robert louis stevenson  ps  you see i have changed my hand  i was threatened apparently  with scriveners cramp and at any rate had got to write so small  that the revisal of my ms tried my eyes hence my signature alone  remains upon the old model for it appears that if i changed that  i should be cut off from my vivers  r l s    letter  to cosmo monkhouse    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var march 16 1884  my dear monkhouse  you see with what promptitude i plunge into  correspondence but the truth is i am condemned to a complete  inaction stagnate dismally and love a letter  yours which would  have been welcome at any time was thus doubly precious  dover sounds somewhat shiveringly in my ears  you should see the  weather i have  cloudless clear as crystal with just a punkah draft of the most aromatic air all pine and gum tree  you would  be ashamed of dover you would scruple to refer sir to a spot so  paltry  to be idle at dover is a strange pretension pray how do  you warm yourself  if i were there i should grind knives or write  blank verse or   but at least you do not bathe  it is idle to  deny it  i have  i may say i nourish  a growing jealousy of the  robust largelegged healthy britaindwellers patient of grog  scorners of the timid umbrella innocuously breathing fog  all  which i once was and i am ashamed to say liked it  how ignorant  is youth grossly rolling among unselected pleasures and how  nobler purer sweeter and lighter to sip the choice tonic to  recline in the luxurious invalid chair and to tread wellshawled  the little round of the constitutional  seriously do you like to  repose  ye gods i hate it  i never rest with any acceptation i  do not know what people mean who say they like sleep and that  damned bedtime which since long ere i was breeched has rung a  knell to all my days doings and beings  and when a man seemingly  sane tells me he has fallen in love with stagnation i can only  say to him you will never be a pirate  this may not cause any  regret to mrs monkhouse but in your own soul it will clang hollow   think of it  never  after all boyhoods aspirations and youths  immoral daydreams you are condemned to sit down grossly draw in  your chair to the fat board and be a beastly burgess till you die   can it be  is there not some escape some furlough from the moral  law some holiday jaunt contrivable into a better land  shall we  never shed blood  this prospect is too grey   here lies a man who never did anything but what he was bid who lived his life in paltry ease and died of commonplace disease   to confess plainly i had intended to spend my life or any leisure  i might have from piracy upon the high seas as the leader of a  great horde of irregular cavalry devastating whole valleys  i can  still looking back see myself in many favourite attitudes  signalling for a boat from my pirate ship with a pocket handkerchief i at the jetty end and one or two of my bold blades  keeping the crowd at bay or else turning in the saddle to look  back at my whole command some five thousand strong following me  at the handgallop up the road out of the burning valley  this  last by moonlight  et point du tout  i am a poor scribe and have scarce broken a  commandment to mention and have recently dined upon cold veal  as  for you who probably had some ambitions i hear of you living at  dover in lodgings like the beasts of the field  but in heaven  when we get there we shall have a good time and see some real  carnage  for heaven is  must be  that great kingdom of  antinomia which lamb saw dimly adumbrated in the country wife  where the worm which never dies the conscience peacefully  expires and the sinner lies down beside the ten commandments   till then here a sheer hulk lies poor tom bowling with neither  health nor vice for anything more spirited than procrastination  which i may well call the consolation stakes of wickedness and by  whose diligent practice without the least amusement to ourselves  we can rob the orphan and bring down grey hairs with sorrow to the  dust  this astonishing gush of nonsense i now hasten to close envelope  and expedite to shakespeares cliff  remember me to shakespeare  and believe me yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to edmund gosse    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var march 17 1884  my dear gosse  your office  office is profanely said  your  bower upon the leads is divine  have you like pepys the right  to fiddle there  i see you mount the companion barbiton in hand  and fluttered about by city sparrows pour forth your spirit in a  voluntary  now when the spring begins you must lay in your  flowers  how do you say about a potted hawthorn  would it bloom   wallflower is a choice potherb lilyofthevalley too and  carnation and indian cress trailed about the window is not only  beautiful by colour but the leaves are good to eat  i recommend  thyme and rosemary for the aroma which should not be left upon one  side they are good quiet growths  on one of your tables keep a great map spread out a chart is still  better  it takes one further  the havens with their little  anchors the rocks banks and soundings are adorably marine and  such furniture will suit your shipshape habitation  i wish i  could see those cabins they smile upon me with the most intimate  charm  from your leads do you behold st pauls  i always like  to see the foolscap it is london per se and no spot from which it  is visible is without romance  then it is good company for the man  of letters whose veritable nursing paternoster is so near at  hand  i am all at a standstill as idle as a painted ship but not so  pretty  my romance which has so nearly butchered me in the  writing not even finished though so near thank god that a few  days of tolerable strength will see the roof upon that structure   i have worked very hard at it and so do not expect any great  public favour  in moments of effort one learns to do the easy  things that people like  there is the golden maxim thus one  should strain and then play strain again and play again  the  strain is for us it educates the play is for the reader and  pleases  do you not feel so  we are ever threatened by two  contrary faults  both deadly  to sink into what my forefathers  would have called rank conformity and to pour forth cheap  replicas upon the one hand upon the other and still more  insidiously present to forget that art is a diversion and a  decoration that no triumph or effort is of value nor anything  worth reaching except charm  yours affectionately  r l s    letter  to miss ferrier    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var march 22 1884  my dear miss ferrier  are you really going to fall us  this  seems a dreadful thing  my poor wife who is not well off for  friends on this bare coast has been promising herself and i have  been promising her a rare acquisition  and now miss burn has  failed and you utter a very doubtful note  you do not know how  delightful this place is nor how anxious we are for a visit  look  at the names  the solitude  is that romantic  the palmtrees   how is that for the gorgeous east  var the name of a river   the quiet waters by  tis true they are in another department  and consist of stones and a biennial spate but what a music what  a plash of brooks for the imagination  we have hills we have  skies the roses are putting forth as yet sparsely the meadows by  the sea are one sheet of jonquils the birds sing as in an english  may  for considering we are in france and serve up our song birds i am ashamed to say on a little field of toast and with a  sprig of thyme my own receipt in their most innocent and now  unvocal bellies  considering all this we have a wonderfully fair  woodmusic round this solitude of ours  what can i say more  all  this awaits you  kennst du das land in short  your sincere  friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w h low    la solitude hyereslespalmiers var april 1884  my dear low  the blind man in these sprawled lines sends  greeting  i have been ill as perhaps the papers told you  the  news  great news  glorious news  second edition  went the  round in england  anyway i now thank you for your pictures which particularly the  arcadian one we all bob included he was here sicknursing me  much liked  herewith are a set of verses which i thought pretty enough to send  to press  then i thought of the manhattan towards whom i have  guilty and compunctious feelings  last i had the best thought of  all  to send them to you in case you might think them suitable for  illustration  it seemed to me quite in your vein  if so good if  not hand them on to manhattan century or lippincott at your  pleasure as all three desire my work or pretend to  but i trust  the lines will not go unattended  some riverside will haunt you  and o be tender to my bathing girls  the lines are copied in my  wifes hand as i cannot see to write otherwise than with the pen  of cormoran gargantua or nimrod  love to your wife  yours  ever  r l s  copied it myself    letter  to thomas stevenson    la solitude april 19 1884  my dear father  yesterday i very powerfully stated the heresis  stevensoniana or the complete body of divinity of the family  theologian to miss ferrier  she was much impressed so was i   you are a great heresiarch and i know no better  whaur the devil  did ye get thon about the soap  is it altogether your own  i  never heard it elsewhere and yet i suspect it must have been held  at some time or other and if you were to look up you would  probably find yourself condemned by some council  i am glad to hear you are so well  the hear is excellent  the  cornhills came i made miss ferrier read us thrawn janet and was  quite bowled over by my own works  the merry men i mean to make  much longer with a whole new denouement not yet quite clear to  me  the story of a lie i must rewrite entirely also as it is  too weak and ragged yet is worth saving for the admiral  did i  ever tell you that the admiral was recognised in america  when they are all on their legs this will make an excellent  collection  has davie never read guy mannering rob roy or the antiquary  all  of which are worth three waverleys  i think kenilworth better than  waverley nigel too and quentin durward about as good  but it  shows a true piece of insight to prefer waverley for it is  different and though not quite coherent better worked in parts  than almost any other  surely more carefully  it is undeniable  that the love of the slapdash and the shoddy grew upon scott with  success  perhaps it does on many of us which may be the granite  on which ds opinion stands  however i hold it in patrick  walkers phrase for an old condemned damnable error  dr  simson was condemned by p w as being a bagful of such  one of  patricks amenities  another ground there may be to ds opinion those who avoid or  seek to avoid scotts facility are apt to be continually straining  and torturing their style to get in more of life  and to many the  extra significance does not redeem the strain  doctor stevenson    letter  to cosmo monkhouse    la solitude hyeres april 24 1884  dear monkhouse  if you are in love with repose here is your  occasion  change with me  i am too blind to read hence no  reading i am too weak to walk hence no walking i am not allowed  to speak hence no talking but the great simplification has yet to  be named for if this goes on i shall soon have nothing to eat   and hence o hallelujah hence no eating  the offer is a fair one   i have not sold myself to the devil for i could never find him  i  am married but so are you  i sometimes write verses but so do  you  come  hic quies  as for the commandments i have broken  them so small that they are the dust of my chambers you walk upon  them triturate and toothless and with the golosh of philosophy  they shall not bite your heel  true the tenement is falling  ay  friend but yours also  take a larger view what is a year or two  dust in the balance  tis done behold you cosmo stevenson and me  r l monkhouse you at hyeres i in london you rejoicing in the  clammiest repose me proceeding to tear your tabernacle into rags  as i have already so admirably torn my own  my place to which i now introduce you  it is yours  is like a  london house high and very narrow upon the lungs i will not  linger the heart is large enough for a ballroom the belly greedy  and inefficient the brain stocked with the most damnable  explosives like a dynamiters den  the whole place is well  furnished though not in a very pure taste corinthian much of it  showy and not strong  about your place i shall try to find my way alone an interesting  exploration  imagine me as i go to bed falling over a blood stained remorse opening that cupboard in the cerebellum and being  welcomed by the spirit of your murdered uncle  i should probably  not like your remorses i wonder if you will like mine i have a  spirited assortment they whistle in my ear o nights like a north easter  i trust yours dont dine with the family mine are better  mannered you will hear nought of them till 2 am except one to  be sure that i have made a pet of but he is small i keep him in  buttons so as to avoid commentaries you will like him much  if  you like what is genuine  must we likewise change religions  mine is a good article with a  trick of stopping cathedral bell note ornamental dial supported  by venus and the graces quite a summerparlour piety  of yours  since your last i fear there is little to be said  there is one article i wish to take away with me  my spirits   they suit me  i dont want yours i like my own i have had them a  long while in bottle  it is my only reservation  yours as you  decide  r l monkhouse    letter  to w e henley    hyeres may 1884  dear boy  old mortality is out and i am glad to say coggie likes  it  we like her immensely  i keep better but no great shakes yet cannot work  cannot  that  is flat not even verses  as for prose that more active place is  shut on me long since  my view of life is essentially the comic and the romantically  comic  as you like it is to me the most birdhaunted spot in  letters tempest and twelfth night follow  these are what i mean  by poetry and nature  i make an effort of my mind to be quite one  with moliere except upon the stage where his inimitable jeux de  scene beggar belief but you will observe they are stageplays   things ad hoc not great olympian debauches of the heart and fancy  hence more perfect and not so great  then i come after great  wanderings to carmosine and to fantasio to one part of la  derniere aldini which by the by we might dramatise in a week  to the notes that meredith has found evan and the postillion evan  and rose harry in germany  and to me these things are the good  beauty touched with sex and laughter beauty with gods earth for  the background  tragedy does not seem to me to come off and when  it does it does so by the heroic illusion the antimasque has  been omitted laughter which attends on all our steps in life and  sits by the deathbed and certainly redacts the epitaph laughter  has been lost from these greathearted lies  but the comedy which  keeps the beauty and touches the terrors of our life laughter and  tragedyinagoodhumour having kissed that is the last word of  moved representation embracing the greatest number of elements of  fate and character and telling its story not with the one eye of  pity but with the two of pity and mirth  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    from my bed may 29 1884  dear gosse  the news of the professorate found me in the article  of  well of heads or tails i am still in bed and a very poor  person  you must thus excuse my damned delay but i assure you i  was delighted  you will believe me the more if i confess to you  that my first sentiment was envy yes sir on my bloodboltered  couch i envied the professor  however it was not of long  duration the double thought that you deserved and that you would  thoroughly enjoy your success fell like balsam on my wounds  how  came it that you never communicated my rejection of gilders offer  for the rhone  but it matters not  such earthly vanities are over  for the present  this has been a fine wellconducted illness  a  month in bed a month of silence a fortnight of not stirring my  right hand a month of not moving without being lifted  come  ca  y est  devilish like being dead  yours dear professor  academically  r l s  i am soon to be moved to royat an invalid valet goes with me  i  got him cheap  secondhand  in turning over my late friend ferriers commonplace book i find  three poems from viol and flute copied out in his hand  when  flowertime love in winter and mistrust  they are capital  too  but i thought the fact would interest you  he was no poetist  either so it means the more  love in w i like the best     letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    hotel chabassiere royat july 1884  my dear people  the weather has been demoniac i have had a skiff  of cold and was finally obliged to take to bed entirely today  however it has cleared the sun shines and i begin to  several days after  i have been out once but now am back in bed  i am better and  keep better but the weather is a mere injustice  the imitation of  edinburgh is at times deceptive there is a note among the  chimney pots that suggests howe street though i think the  shrillest spot in christendom was not upon the howe street side  but in front just under the miss graemes big chimney stack  it  had a fine alto character  a sort of bleat that used to divide the  marrow in my joints  say in the wee slack hours  that music is  now lost to us by rebuilding another air that i remember not  regret was the solo of the gasburner in the little front room a  knickering flighty fleering and yet spectral cackle  i mind it  above all on winter afternoons late when the window was blue and  spotted with rare raindrops and looking out the cold evening  was seen blue all over with the lamps of queens and fredericks  street dotting it with yellow and flaring eastward in the  squalls  heavens how unhappy i have been in such circumstances   i who have now positively forgotten the colour of unhappiness who  am full like a fed ox and dull like a fresh turf and have no more  spiritual life for good or evil than a french bagman  we are at chabassieres for of course it was nonsense to go up the  hill when we could not walk  the childs poems in a far extended form are likely soon to be  heard of  which cummy i dare say will be glad to know  they will  make a book of about one hundred pages  ever your affectionate  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    royat july 1884     here is a quaint thing i have read robinson colonel jack  moll flanders memoirs of a cavalier history of the plague  history of the great storm scotch church and union  and there my  knowledge of defoe ends  except a book the name of which i  forget about peterborough in spain which defoe obviously did not  write and could not have written if he wanted  to which of these  does b j refer  i guess it must be the history of the scottish  church  i jest for of course i know it must be a book i have  never read and which this makes me keen to read  i mean captain  singleton  can it be got and sent to me  if treasure island is at  all like it it will be delightful  i was just the other day  wondering at my folly in not remembering it when i was writing t  i as a mine for pirate tips  t i came out of kingsleys at  last where i got the dead mans chest  and that was the seed   and out of the great captain johnsons history of notorious  pirates  the scenery is californian in part and in part chic  i was downstairs today  so now i am a made man  till the next  time  r l stevenson  if it was captain singleton send it to me wont you  later  my life dwindles into a kind of valley of the shadow  picnic  i cannot read so much of the time as today i must not  speak above my breath that to play patience or to see my wife  play it is become the beall and the endall of my dim career  to  add to my gaiety i may write letters but there are few to answer   patience and poesy are thus my rod and staff with these i not  unpleasantly support my days  i am very dim dumb dowie and damnable  i hate to be silenced  and if to talk by signs is my forte as i contend to understand  them cannot be my wifes  do not think me unhappy i have not been  so for years but i am blurred inhabit the debatable frontier of  sleep and have but dim designs upon activity  all is at a

bournemouth october 1884  dear boy  i trust this finds you well it leaves me soso  the  weather is so cold that i must stick to bed which is rotten and  tedious but cant be helped  i find in the blotting book the enclosed which i wrote to you the  eve of my blood  is it not strange  that night when i naturally  thought i was coopered the thought of it was much in my mind i  thought it had gone and i thought what a strange prophecy i had  made in jest and how it was indeed like to be the end of many  letters  but i have written a good few since and the spell is  broken  i am just as pleased for i earnestly desire to live   this pleasant middle age into whose port we are steering is quite  to my fancy  i would cast anchor here and go ashore for twenty  years and see the manners of the place  youth was a great time  but somewhat fussy  now in middle age bar lucre all seems mighty  placid  it likes me i spy a little bright cafe in one corner of  the port in front of which i now propose we should sit down   there is just enough of the bustle of the harbour and no more and  the ships are close in regarding us with sternwindows  the ships  that bring deals from norway and parrots from the indies  let us  sit down here for twenty years with a packet of tobacco and a  drink and talk of art and women  byandby the whole city will  sink and the ships too and the table and we also but we shall  have sat for twenty years and had a fine talk and by that time  who knows exhausted the subject  i send you a book which or i am mistook will please you it  pleased me  but i do desire a book of adventure  a romance  and  no man will get or write me one  dumas i have read and reread too  often scott too and i am short  i want to hear swords clash  i  want a book to begin in a good way a book i guess like treasure  island alas which i have never read and cannot though i live to  ninety  i would god that some one else had written it  by all  that i can learn it is the very book for my complaint  i like the  way i hear it opens and they tell me john silver is good fun  and  to me it is and must ever be a dream unrealised a book  unwritten  o my sighings after romance or even skeltery and o  the weary age which will produce me neither   chapter i   the night was damp and cloudy the ways foul  the single horseman  cloaked and booted who pursued his way across willesden

my dear campbell  the books came duly to hand  my wife has  occupied the translation ever since nor have i yet been able to  dislodge her  as for the primer i have read it with a very  strange result  that i find no fault  if you knew how dogmatic  and pugnacious i stand warden on the literary art you would the  more appreciate your success and my  well i will own it    disappointment  for i love to put people right or wrong about  the arts  but what you say of tragedy and of sophocles very amply  satisfies me it is well felt and well said a little less  technically than it is my weakness to desire to see it put but  clear and adequate  you are very right to express your admiration  for the resource displayed in oedipus king it is a miracle  would  it not have been well to mention voltaires interesting onslaught  a thing which gives the best lesson of the difference of neighbour  arts  since all his criticisms which had been fatal to a  narrative do not amount among them to exhibit one flaw in this  masterpiece of drama  for the drama it is perfect though such a  fable in a romance might make the reader crack his sides so  imperfect so ethereally slight is the verisimilitude required of  these conventional rigid and eggdancing arts  i was sorry to see no more of you but shall conclude by hoping for  better luck next time  my wife begs to be remembered to both of  you  yours sincerely    robert louis stevenson    letter  to andrew chatto    wensleydale bournemouth october 3 1884  dear mr chatto  i have an offer of 25 pounds for otto from  america  i do not know if you mean to have the american rights  from the nature of the contract i think not but if you understood  that you were to sell the sheets i will either hand over the  bargain to you or finish it myself and hand you over the money if  you are pleased with the amount  you see i leave this quite in  your hands  to parody an old scotch story of servant and master   if you dont know that you have a good author i know that i have a  good publisher  your fair open and handsome dealings are a good  point in my life and do more for my crazy health than has yet been  done by any doctor  very truly yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w h low    bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth hants england first  week in november i guess 1884  my dear low  now look here the above is my address for three  months i hope continue on your part if you please to write to  edinburgh which is safe but if mrs low thinks of coming to  england she might take a run down from london four hours from  waterloo main line and stay a day or two with us among the pines   if not i hope it will be only a pleasure deferred till you can  join her  my childrens verses will be published here in a volume called a  childs garden  the sheets are in hand i will see if i cannot  send you the lot so that you might have a bit of a start  in that  case i would do nothing to publish in the states and you might try  an illustrated edition there which if the book went fairly over  here might when ready be imported  but of this more fully ere  long  you will see some verses of mine in the last magazine of  art with pictures by a young lady rather pretty i think  if we  find a market for phasellulus loquitur we can try another  i hope  it isnt necessary to put the verse into that rustic printing  i  am philistine enough to prefer clean printers type indeed i can  form no idea of the verses thus transcribed by the incult and  tottering hand of the draughtsman nor gather any impression beyond  one of weariness to the eyes  yet the other day in the century i  saw it imputed as a crime to vedder that he had not thus travestied  omar khayyam  we live in a rum age of music without airs stories  without incident pictures without beauty american wood engravings  that should have been etchings and drypoint etchings that ought  to have been mezzotints  i think of giving em literature without  words and i believe if you were to try invisible illustration it  would enjoy a considerable vogue  so long as an artist is on his  head is painting with a flute or writes with an etchers needle  or conducts the orchestra with a meataxe all is well and  plaudits shower along with roses  but any plain man who tries to  follow the obtrusive canons of his art is but a commonplace  figure  to hell with him is the motto or at least not that for  he will have his reward but he will never be thought a person of  parts  january 3 1885  and here has this been lying near two months  i have failed to get  together a preliminary copy of the childs verses for you in spite  of doughty efforts but yesterday i sent you the first sheet of the  definitive edition and shall continue to send the others as they  come  if you can and care to work them  why so well  if not  i send you fodder  but the time presses for though i will delay a  little over the proofs and though  it is even possible they may  delay the english issue until easter it will certainly not be  later  therefore perpend and do not get caught out  of course  if you can do pictures it will be a great pleasure to me to see  our names joined and more than that a great advantage as i  daresay you may be able to make a bargain for some share a little  less spectral than the common for the poor author  but this is all  as you shall choose i give you carte blanche to do or not to do   yours most sincerely  robert louis stevenson  o sargent has been and painted my portrait a very nice fellow he  is and is supposed to have done well it is a poetical but very  chickenboned figurehead as thus represented  r l s go on  pps  your picture came and let me thank you for it very much   i am so hunted i had near forgotten  i find it very graceful and  i mean to have it framed    letter  to thomas stevenson    bonallie towers bournemouth november 1884  my dear father  i have no hesitation in recommending you to let  your name go up please yourself about an address though i think  if we could meet we could arrange something suitable  what you  propose would be well enough in a way but so modest as to suggest  a whine  from that point of view it would be better to change a  little but this whether we meet or not we must discuss  tait  chrystal the royal society and i all think you amply deserve  this honour and far more it is not the true blue to call this  serious compliment a trial you should be glad of this  recognition  as for resigning that is easy enough if found  necessary but to refuse would be husky and unsatisfactory  sic  subs  r l s  my cold is still very heavy but i carry it well  fanny is very  very much out of sorts principally through perpetual misery with  me  i fear i have been a little in the dumps which as you know  sir is a very great sin  i must try to be more cheerful but my  cough is so severe that i have sometimes most exhausting nights and  very peevish wakenings  however this shall be remedied and last  night i was distinctly better than the night before  there is my  dear mr stevenson so i moralise blandly as we sit together on the  devils gardenwall no more abominable sin than this gloom this  plaguey peevishness why say i what matters it if we be a little  uncomfortable  that is no reason for mangling our unhappy wives   and then i turn and girn on the unfortunate cassandra  your  fellow culprit  r l s    letter  to w e henley    wensleydale bournemouth november 1884  dear henley  we are all to pieces in health and heavily  handicapped with arabs  i have a dreadful cough whose attacks  leave me aetat 90  i never let up on the arabs all the same and  rarely get less than eight pages out of hand though hardly able to  come downstairs for twittering knees  i shall put in s letter  he says so little of his circumstances  that i am in an impossibility to give him advice more specific than  a copybook  give him my love however and tell him it is the mark  of the parochial gentleman who has never travelled to find all  wrong in a foreign land  let him hold on and he will find one  country as good as another and in the meanwhile let him resist the  fatal british tendency to communicate his dissatisfaction with a  country to its inhabitants  tis a good idea but it somehow fails  to please  in a fortnight if i can keep my spirit in the box at  all i should be nearly through this arabian desert so can tackle  something fresh  yours ever  r l s    letter  to thomas stevenson    bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth the three bs  november 5 1884  my dear father  allow me to say in a strictly pickwickian sense  that you are a silly fellow  i am pained indeed but how should i  be offended  i think you exaggerate i cannot forget that you had  the same impression of the deacon and yet when you saw it played  were less revolted than you looked for and i will still hope that  the admiral also is not so bad as you suppose  there is one point  however where i differ from you very frankly  religion is in the  world i do not think you are the man to deny the importance of its  role and i have long decided not to leave it on one side in art   the opposition of the admiral and mr pew is not to my eyes  either horrible or irreverent but it may be and it probably is  very ill done  what then  this is a failure better luck next  time more power to the elbow more discretion more wisdom in the  design and the old defeat becomes the scene of the new victory   concern yourself about no failure they do not cost lives as in  engineering they are the pierres perdues of successes  fame is  truly a vapour do not think of it if the writer means well and  tries hard no failure will injure him whether with god or man  i wish i could hear a brighter account of yourself but i am  inclined to acquit the admiral of having a share in the  responsibility  my very heavy cold is i hope drawing off and  the change to this charming house in the forest will i hope  complete my reestablishment  with love to all believe me your  ever affectionate  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth

have hoped  at least a turret  we are all vilely unwell  i put in the dark  watches imitating a donkey with some success but little pleasure  and in the afternoon i indulge in a smart fever accompanied by  aches and shivers  there is thus little monotony to be deplored   i at least am a regular invalid i would scorn to bray in the  afternoon i would indignantly refuse the proposal to fever in the  night  what is bred in the bone will come out sir in the flesh  and the same spirit that prompted me to date my letter regulates  the hour and character of my attacks  i am sir yours

own fault i wished to  acknowledge such a gift from you in some of my inapt and slovenly  rhymes but you should have sent me your pen and not your desk   the verses stand up to the axles in a miry crossroad whence the  coursers of the sun shall never draw them hence i am constrained  to this uncourtliness that i must appear before one of the kings  of that country of rhyme without my singing robes  for less than  this if we may trust the book of esther favourites have tasted  death but i conceive the kingdom of the muses mildlier mannered  and in particular that county which you administer and which i seem  to see as a halfsuburban land a land of hollyhocks and country  houses a land where at night in thorny and sequestered bypaths  you will meet masqueraders going to a ball in their sedans and the  rector steering homeward by the light of his lantern a land of the  windmill and the west wind and the flowering hawthorn with a  little scented letter in the hollow of its trunk and the kites  flying over all in the season of kites and the far away blue  spires of a cathedral city  will you forgive me then for my delay and accept my thanks not  only for your present but for the letter which followed it and  which perhaps i more particularly value and believe me to be with  much admiration yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth december 8 1884  my dear henry james   this is a very brave hearing from more  points than one  the first point is that there is a hope of a  sequel  for this i laboured  seriously from the dearth of  information and thoughtful interest in the art of literature those  who try to practise it with any deliberate purpose run the risk of  finding no fit audience  people suppose it is the stuff that  interests them they think for instance that the prodigious fine  thoughts and sentiments in shakespeare impress by their own weight  not understanding that the unpolished diamond is but a stone  they  think that striking situations or good dialogue are got by  studying life they will not rise to understand that they are  prepared by deliberate artifice and set off by painful  suppressions  now i want the whole thing well ventilated for my  own education and the publics and i beg you to look as quick as  you can to follow me up with every circumstance of defeat where we  differ and to prevent the flouting of the laity to emphasise the  points where we agree  i trust your paper will show me the way to  a rejoinder and that rejoinder i shall hope to make with so much  art as to woo or drive you from your threatened silence  i would  not ask better than to pass my life in beating out this quarter of  corn with such a seconder as yourself  point the second  i am rejoiced indeed to hear you speak so kindly  of my work rejoiced and surprised  i seem to myself a very rude  lefthanded countryman not fit to be read far less complimented  by a man so accomplished so adroit so craftsmanlike as you  you  will happily never have cause to understand the despair with which  a writer like myself considers say the park scene in lady  barberina  every touch surprises me by its intangible precision  and the effect when done as light as syllabub as distinct as a  picture fills me with envy  each man among us prefers his own  aim and i prefer mine but when we come to speak of performance i  recognise myself compared with you to be a lout and slouch of the  first water  where we differ both as to the design of stories and the  delineation of character i begin to lament  of course i am not  so dull as to ask you to desert your walk but could you not in  one novel to oblige a sincere admirer and to enrich his shelves  with a beloved volume could you not and might you not cast your  characters in a mould a little more abstract and academic dear  mrs pennyman had already among your other work a taste of what i  mean and pitch the incidents i do not say in any stronger but  in a slightly more emphatic key  as it were an episode from one of  the old socalled novels of adventure  i fear you will not and  i suppose i must sighingly admit you to be right  and yet when i  see as it were a book of tom jones handled with your exquisite  precision and shot through with those sidelights of reflection in  which you excel i relinquish the dear vision with regret  think  upon it  as you know i belong to that besotted class of man the invalid   this puts me to a stand in the way of visits  but it is possible  that some day you may feel that a day near the sea and among  pinewoods would be a pleasant change from town  if so please let  us know and my wife and i will be delighted to put you up and  give you what we can to eat and drink i have a fair bottle of  claret  on the back of which believe me yours sincerely  robert louis stevenson  ps  i reopen this to say that i have reread my paper and  cannot think i have at all succeeded in being either veracious or  polite  i knew of course that i took your paper merely as a pin  to hang my own remarks upon but alas what a thing is any paper   what fine remarks can you not hang on mine  how i have sinned  against proportion and with every effort to the contrary against  the merest rudiments of courtesy to you  you are indeed a very  acute reader to have divined the real attitude of my mind and i  can only conclude not without closed eyes and shrinking shoulders  in the wellworn words  lay on macduff    letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    bonallie towers bournemouth december 9 1884  my dear people  the dreadful tragedy of the pall mall has come to  a happy but ludicrous ending  i am to keep the money the tale  writ for them is to be buried certain fathoms deep and they are to  flash out before the world with our old friend of kinnaird the  body snatcher  when you come please to bring   1 my montaigne or at least the two last volumes 2 my milton in the three vols in green 3 the shakespeare that babington sent me for a weddinggift 4 hazlitts table talk and plain speaker  if you care to get a box of books from douglas and foulis let them  be solid  croker papers correspondence of napoleon history of  henry iv langs folk lore would be my desires  i had a charming letter from henry james about my longman paper  i  did not understand queries about the verses the pictures to the  seagull i thought charming those to the second have left me with a  pain in my poor belly and a swimming in the head  about money i am afloat and no more and i warn you unless i have  great luck i shall have to fall upon you at the new year like a  hundredweight of bricks  doctor rent chemist are all  threatening sickness has bitterly delayed my work and unless as  i say i have the mischiefs luck i shall completely break down   verbum sapientibus  i do not live cheaply and i question if i  ever shall but if only i had a halfpenny worth of health i could  now easily suffice  the last breakdown of my head is what makes  this bankruptcy probable  fanny is still out of sorts bogue better self fair but a  stranger to the blessings of sleep  ever affectionate son  r l s    letter  to w e henley    bonallie towers bournemouth december 1884  dear lad  i have made up my mind about the p m g and send you  a copy which please keep or return  as for not giving a  reduction what are we  are we artists or city men  why do we  sneer at stockbrokers  o nary i will not take the 40 pounds  i  took that as a fair price for my best work i was not able to  produce my best and i will be damned if i steal with my eyes open   sufficit  this is my lookout  as for the paper being rich  certainly it is but i am honourable  it is no more above me in  money than the poor slaveys and cads from whom i look for honesty  are below me  am i pepys that because i can find the countenance  of some of our ablest merchants that because  and  pour forth  languid twaddle and get paid for it i too should cheerfully  continue to steal  i am not pepys  i do not live much to god and  honour but i will not wilfully turn my back on both  i am like  all the rest of us falling ever lower from the bright ideas i  began with falling into greed into idleness into middleaged and  slippered fireside cowardice but is it you my bold blade that i  hear crying this sordid and rank twaddle in my ear  preaching the  dankest grundyism and upholding the rank customs of our trade   you who are so cruel hard upon the customs of the publishers  o  man look at the beam in our own eyes and whatever else you do do  not plead satans cause or plead it for all either embrace the  bad or respect the good when you see a poor devil trying for it   if this is the honesty of authors  to take what you can get and  console yourself because publishers are rich  take my name from  the rolls of that association  tis a caucus of weaker thieves  jealous of the stronger  ever yours  the roaring r l s  you will see from the enclosed that i have stuck to what i think my  dues pretty tightly in spite of this flourish  these are my words  for a poor tenpound note    letter  to w e henley    bonallie towers bournemouth winter 1884  my dear lad  here was i in bed not writing not hearing and  finding myself gently and agreeably ill used and behold i learn  you are bad yourself  get your wife to send us a word how you are   i am better decidedly  bogue got his christmas card and behaved  well for three days after  it may interest the cynical to learn  that i started my last haemorrhage by too sedulous attentions to my  dear bogue  the stick was broken and that night bogue who was  attracted by the extraordinary aching of his bones and is always  inclined to a serious view of his own ailments announced with his  customary pomp that he was dying  in this case however it was  not the dog that died  he had tried to bite his mothers ankles   i have written a long and peculiarly solemn paper on the technical  elements of style  it is pathbreaking and epochmaking but i do  not think the public will be readily convoked to its perusal  did  i tell you that s c had risen to the paper on james  at last  o  but i was pleased hes like johnnie been lang lang o comin  but here he is  he will not object to my future manoeuvres in the  same field as he has to my former  all the family are here my  father better than i have seen him these two years my mother the  same as ever  i do trust you are better and i am yours ever  r l s    letter  to h a jones    bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth dec 30 1884  dear sir  i am so accustomed to hear nonsense spoken about all  the arts and the drama in particular that i cannot refrain from  saying thank you for your paper  in my answer to mr james in  the december longman you may see that i have merely touched i  think in a parenthesis on the drama but i believe enough was said  to indicate our agreement in essentials  wishing you power and health to further enunciate and to act upon  these principles believe me dear sir yours truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    bonallie towers branksome park bournemouth jan 4 1885  dear s c  i am on my feet again and getting on my boots to do  the iron duke  conceive my glee  i have refused the 100 pounds  and am to get some sort of royalty not yet decided instead  tis  for longmans english worthies edited by a lang  aw haw haw  now look here could you get me a loan of the despatches or is  that a dream  i should have to mark passages i fear and certainly  note pages on the fly  if you think it a dream will bain get me a  secondhand copy or who would  the sooner and cheaper i can get  it the better  if there is anything in your weird library that  bears on either the man or the period put it in a mortar and fire  it here instanter i shall catch  i shall want of course an  infinity of books  among which any lives there may be a

thiers idle thiers also  can you help a man getting into  his boots for such a huge campaign  how are you  a good new year  to you  i mean to have a good one but on whose funds i cannot  fancy  not mine leastways as i am a mere derelict and drift beam on to bankruptcy  for gods sake remember the man who set out for to conquer arthur  wellesley with a broken bellows and an empty pocket  yours ever  r l stevenson    letter  to thomas stevenson    bonallie towers bournemouth 14th january 1885  my dear father  i am glad you like the changes  i own i was  pleased with my hands darg you may observe i have corrected  several errors which you may tell mr dick he had allowed to pass  his eagle eye i wish there may be none in mine at least the  order is better  the second title some new engineering questions  involved in the m s c scheme of last session of p likes me  the best  i think it a very good paper and i am vain enough to  think i have materially helped to polish the diamond  i ended by  feeling quite proud of the paper as if it had been mine the next  time you have as good a one i will overhaul it for the wages of  feeling as clever as i did when i had managed to understand and  helped to set it clear  i wonder if i anywhere misapprehended you   i rather think not at the last at the first shot i know i missed a  point or two  some of what may appear to you to be wanton changes  a little study will show to be necessary  yes carlyle was ashamed of himself as few men have been and let  all carpers look at what he did  he prepared all these papers for  publication with his own hand all his wifes complaints all the  evidence of his own misconduct  who else would have done so much   is repentance which god accepts to have no avail with men nor  even with the dead  i have heard too much against the thrawn  discomfortable dog  dead he is and we may be glad of it but he  was a better man than most of us no less patently than he was a  worse  to fill the world with whining is against all my views  i  do not like impiety  but  but  there are two sides to all  things and the old scalded baby had his noble side  ever  affectionate son  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    bonallie towers bournemouth january 1885  dear s c  i have addressed a letter to the g o m a propos  of wellington and i became aware you will be interested to hear  of an overwhelming respect for the old gentleman  i can blaguer  his failures but when you actually address him and bring the two  statures and records to confrontation dismay is the result  by  mere continuance of years he must impose the man who helped to  rule england before i was conceived strikes me with a new sense of  greatness and antiquity when i must actually beard him with the  cold forms of correspondence  i shied at the necessity of calling  him plain sir  had he been my lord i had been happier no i  am no equalitarian  honour to whom honour is due and if to none  why then honour to the old  these o slade professor are my unvarnished sentiments  i was a  little surprised to find them so extreme and therefore i  communicate the fact  belabour thy brains as to whom it would be well to question  i  have a small space i wish to make a popular book nowhere obscure  nowhere if it can be helped unhuman  it seems to me the most  hopeful plan to tell the tale so far as may be by anecdote  he  did not die till so recently there must be hundreds who remember  him and thousands who have still ungarnered stories  dear man to  the breach  up soldier of the iron dook up slades and at em  which conclusively he did not say  the at emic theory is to  be dismissed  you know piles of fellows who must reek with  matter help help  yours ever  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    bonallie towers bournemouth february 1885  my dear colvin  you are indeed a backward correspondent and much  may be said against you  but in this weather and o dear in this  political scene of degradation much must be forgiven  i fear  england is dead of burgessry and only walks about galvanised  i  do not love to think of my countrymen these days nor to remember  myself  why was i silent  i feel i have no right to blame any  one but i wont write to the g o m  i do really not see my way  to any form of signature unless your fellow criminal in the eyes  of god which might disquiet the proprieties  about your book i have always said  go on  the drawing of  character is a different thing from publishing the details of a  private career  no one objects to the first or should object if  his name be not put upon it at the other i draw the line  in a  preface if you chose you might distinguish it is besides a  thing for which you are eminently well equipped and which you  would do with taste and incision  i long to see the book  people  like themselves to explain a little more no one likes his life  which is a misbegotten issue and a tale of failure  to see these  failures either touched upon or coasted to get the idea of a  spying eye and blabbing tongue about the house is to lose all  privacy in life  to see that thing which we do love our  character set forth is ever gratifying  see how my talk and  talkers went every one liked his own portrait and shrieked about  other peoples so it will be with yours  if you are the least  true to the essential the sitter will be pleased very likely not  his friends and that from various motives  r l s  when will your holiday be  i sent your letter to my wife and  forget  keep us in mind and i hope we shall he able to receive  you    letter  to j a symonds    bournemouth february 1885  my dear symonds  yes we have both been very neglectful  i had  horrid luck catching two thundering influenzas in august and  november  i recovered from the last with difficulty but have come  through this blustering winter with some general success in the  house up and down  my wife however has been painfully upset by  my health  last year of course was cruelly trying to her nerves  nice and hyeres are bad experiences and though she is not ill the  doctor tells me that prolonged anxiety may do her a real mischief  i feel a little old and fagged and chary of speech and not very  sure of spirit in my work but considering what a year i have  passed and how i have twice sat on charons pierhead i am  surprising  my father has presented us with a very pretty home in this place  into which we hope to move by may  my childs verses come out next  week  otto begins to appear in april more new arabian nights as  soon as possible  moreover i am neck deep in wellington also a  story on the stocks great north road  o i am busy lloyd is at  college in edinburgh  that is i think all that can be said by  way of news  have you read huckleberry finn  it contains many excellent things  above all the whole story of a healthy boys dealings with his  conscience incredibly well done  my own conscience is badly seared a want of piety yet i pray for  it tacitly every day believing it after courage the only gift  worth having and its want in a man of any claims to honour quite  unpardonable  the tone of your letter seemed to me very sound  in  these dark days of public dishonour i do not know that one can do  better than carry our private trials piously  what a picture is  this of a nation  no man that i can see on any side or party  seems to have the least sense of our ineffable shame  the  desertion of the garrisons  i tell my little parable that germany  took england and then there was an indian mutiny and bismarck  said  quite right  let delhi and calcutta and bombay fall and  let the women and children be treated sepoy fashion and people  say o but that is very different  and then i wish i were dead   millais i hear was painting gladstone when the news came of  gordons death millais was much affected and gladstone said  why  it is the mans own temerity  voila le bourgeois le voila  nu  but why should i blame gladstone when i too am a bourgeois  when i have held my peace  why did i hold my peace  because i am  a sceptic  ie a bourgeois  we believe in nothing symonds you  dont and i dont and these are two reasons out of a handful of  millions why england stands before the world dripping with blood  and daubed with dishonour  i will first try to take the beam out  of my own eye trusting that even private effort somehow betters  and braces the general atmosphere  see for example if england  has shown i put it hypothetically one spark of manly sensibility  they have been shamed into it by the spectacle of gordon  police officer cole is the only man that i see to admire  i dedicate my  new arabs to him and cox in default of other great public  characters  yours ever most affectionately  robert louis stevenson    letter  to edmund gosse    bonallie towers bournemouth march 12 1885  my dear gosse  i was indeed much exercised how i could be worked  into gray and lo when i saw it the passage seemed to have been  written with a single eye to elucidate the  worst  well not a  very good poem of grays  your little life is excellent clean  neat efficient  i have read many of your notes too with  pleasure  your connection with gray was a happy circumstance it  was a suitable conjunction  i did not answer your letter from the states for what was i to  say  i liked getting it and reading it i was rather flattered  that you wrote it to me and then ill tell you what i did  i put  it in the fire  why  well just because it was very natural and  expansive and thinks i to myself if i die one of these fine  nights this is just the letter that gosse would not wish to go  into the hands of third parties  was i well inspired  and i did  not answer it because you were in your high places sailing with  supreme dominion and seeing life in a particular glory and i was  peddling in a corner confined to the house overwhelmed with  necessary work which i was not always doing well and in the very  mild form in which the disease approaches me touched with a sort  of bustling cynicism  why throw cold water  how ape your  agreeable frame of mind  in short i held my tongue  i have now published on 101 small pages the complete proof of mr  r l stevensons incapacity to write verse in a series of  graduated examples with table of contents  i think i shall issue a  companion volume of exercises  analyse this poem  collect and  comminate the ugly words  distinguish and condemn the chevilles   state mr stevensons faults of taste in regard to the measure   what reasons can you gather from this example for your belief that  mr s is unable to write any other measure  they look ghastly in the cold light of print but there is  something nice in the little ragged regiment for all the  blackguards seem to me to smile to have a kind of childish treble  note that sounds in my ears freshly not song if you will but a  childs voice  i was glad you enjoyed your visit to the states  most englishmen  go there with a confirmed design of patronage as they go to france  for that matter and patronage will not pay  besides in this year  of  grace said i  of disgrace who should creep so low as an  englishman  it is not to be thought of that the flood  ah  wordsworth you would change your note were you alive today  i am now a beastly householder but have not yet entered on my  domain  when i do the social revolution will probably cast me  back upon my dung heap  there is a person called hyndman whose eye  is on me his step is behynd me as i go  i shall call

been disposed of a good  while ago but it was only day before yesterday that i settled the  new volume of arabs  however for the future you and the sons of  the deified scribner are the men for me  really they have behaved  most handsomely  i cannot lay my hand on the papers or i would  tell you exactly how it compares with my english bargain but it  compares well  ah if we had that copyright i do believe it would  go far to make me solvent illhealth and all  i wrote you a letter to the rembrandt in which i stated my views  about the dedication in a very brief form  it will give me sincere  pleasure and will make the second dedication i have received the  other being from john addington symonds  it is a compliment i  value much i dont know any that i should prefer  i am glad to hear you have windows to do that is a fine business  i think but alas the glass is so bad nowadays realism invading  even that as well as the huge inferiority of our technical  resource corrupting every tint  still anything that keeps a man  to decoration is in this age good for the artists spirit  by the way have you seen james and me on the novel  james i  think in the august or september  r  l s in the december  longman  i own i think the ecole bete of which i am the champion  has the whip hand of the argument but as james is to make a  rejoinder i must not boast  anyway the controversy is amusing to  see  i was terribly tied down to space which has made the end  congested and dull  i shall see if i can afford to send you the  april contemporary  but i dare say you see it anyway  as it will  contain a paper of mine on style a sort of continuation of old  arguments on art in which you have wagged a most effective tongue   it is a sort of start upon my treatise on the art of literature  a  small arid book that shall some day appear  with every good wish from me and mine should i not say she and  hers to you and yours believe me yours ever  robert louis stevenson    letter  to p g hamerton    bournemouth march 16 1885  my dear hamerton  various things have been reminding me of my  misconduct  first swans application for your address second a  sight of the sheets of your landscape book and last your note to  swan which he was so kind as to forward  i trust you will never  suppose me to be guilty of anything more serious than an idleness  partially excusable  my illhealth makes my rate of life heavier  than i can well meet and yet stops me from earning more  my  conscience sometimes perhaps too easily stifled but still for my  time of life and the public manners of the age fairly well alive  forces me to perpetual and almost endless transcriptions  on the  back of all this my correspondence hangs like a thundercloud and  just when i think i am getting through my troubles crack down  goes my health i have a long costly sickness and begin the world  again  it is fortunate for me i have a father or i should long  ago have died but the opportunity of the aid makes the necessity  none the more welcome  my father has presented me with a beautiful  house here  or so i believe for i have not yet seen it being a  cage bird but for nocturnal sorties in the garden  i hope we shall  soon move into it and i tell myself that some day perhaps we may  have the pleasure of seeing you as our guest  i trust at least  that you will take me as i am a thoroughly bad correspondent and  a man a hater indeed of rudeness in others but too often rude  in all unconsciousness himself and that you will never cease to  believe the sincere sympathy and admiration that i feel for you and  for your work  about the landscape which i had a glimpse of while a friend of  mine was preparing a review i was greatly interested and could  write and wrangle for a year on every page one passage  particularly delighted me the part about ulysses  jolly  then  you know that is just what i fear i have come to think landscape  ought to be in literature so there we should be at odds  or  perhaps not so much as i suppose as montaigne says it is a pot  with two handles and i own i am wedded to the technical handle  which i likewise own and freely you do well to keep for a  mistress  i should much like to talk with you about some other  points it is only in talk that one gets to understand  your  delightful wordsworth trap i have tried on two hardened  wordsworthians not that i am not one myself  by covering up the  context and asking them to guess what the passage was both and  both are very clever people one a writer one a painter  pronounced it a guidebook  do you think it an unusually good  guidebook i asked and both said no not at all  their  grimace was a picture when i showed the original  i trust your health and that of mrs hamerton keep better your  last account was a poor one  i was unable to make out the visit i  had hoped as i do not know if you heard of it i had a very  violent and dangerous haemorrhage last spring  i am almost glad to  have seen death so close with all my wits about me and not in the  customary lassitude and disenchantment of disease  even thus  clearly beheld i find him not so terrible as we suppose  but  indeed with the passing of years the decay of strength the loss  of all my old active and pleasant habits there grows more and more  upon me that belief in the kindness of this scheme of things and  the goodness of our veiled god which is an excellent and pacifying  compensation  i trust if your health continues to trouble you  you may find some of the same belief  but perhaps my fine  discovery is a piece of art and belongs to a character cowardly  intolerant of certain feelings and apt to selfdeception  i dont  think so however and when i feel what a weak and fallible vessel  i was thrust into this hurlyburly and with what marvellous  kindness the wind has been tempered to my frailties i think i  should be a strange kind of ass to feel anything but gratitude  i do not know why i should inflict this talk upon you but when i  summon the rebellous pen he must go his own way i am no michael  scott to rule the fiend of correspondence  most days he will none  of me and when he comes it is to rape me where he will  yours  very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to william archer    bournemouth march 29 1885  dear mr archer  yes i have heard of you and read some of your  work but i am bound in particular to thank you for the notice of  my verses  there i said throwing it over to the friend who was  staying with me its worth writing a book to draw an article like  that  had you been as hard upon me as you were amiable i try to  tell myself i should have been no blinder to the merits of your  notice  for i saw there to admire and to be very grateful for a  most sober agile pen an enviable touch the marks of a reader  such as one imagines for ones self in dreams thoughtful  critical and kind and to put the top on this memorial column a  greater readiness to describe the author criticised than to display  the talents of his censor  i am a man blase to injudicious praise though i hope some of it  may be judicious too but i have to thank you for the best  criticism i ever had and am therefore dear mr archer the most  grateful critickee now extant  robert louis stevenson  ps  i congratulate you on living in the corner of all london  that i like best  a propos you are very right about my voluntary  aversion from the painful sides of life  my childhood was in  reality a very mixed experience full of fever nightmare  insomnia painful days and interminable nights and i can speak  with less authority of gardens than of that other land of  counterpane  but to what end should we renew these sorrows  the  sufferings of life may be handled by the very greatest in their  hours of insight it is of its pleasures that our common poems  should be formed these are the experiences that we should seek to  recall or to provoke and i say with thoreau what right have i to  complain who have not ceased to wonder and to add a rider of my  own who have no remedy to offer  r l s    letter  to mrs fleeming jenkin    skerryvore bournemouth june 1885  my dear mrs jenkin  you know how much and for how long i have  loved respected and admired him i am only able to feel a little  with you  but i know how he would have wished us to feel  i never  knew a better man nor one to me more lovable we shall all feel  the loss more greatly as time goes on  it scarce seems life to me  what must it be to you  yet one of the last things that he said to  me was that from all these sad bereavements of yours he had  learned only more than ever to feel the goodness and what we in  our feebleness call the support of god he had been ripening so  much  to other eyes than ours we must suppose he was ripe and  try to feel it  i feel it is better not to say much more  it will  be to me a great pride to write a notice of him  the last i can  now do  what more in any way i can do for you please to think and  let me know  for his sake and for your own i would not be a  useless friend  i know you know me a most warm one please  command me or my wife in any way  do not trouble to write to me  austin i have no doubt will do so if you are as i fear you will  be unfit  my heart is sore for you  at least you know what you have been to  him how he cherished and admired you how he was never so pleased  as when he spoke of you with what a boys love up to the last he  loved you  this surely is a consolation  yours is the cruel part   to survive you must try and not grudge to him his better  fortune to go first  it is the sad part of such relations that  one must remain and suffer i cannot see my poor jenkin without  you  nor you indeed without him but you may try to rejoice that  he is spared that extremity  perhaps i as i was so much his  confidant know even better than you can do what your loss would  have been to him he never spoke of you but his face changed it  was  you were  his religion  i write by this post to austin and to the academy  yours most  sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs fleeming jenkin    skerryvore bournemouth june 1885  my dear mrs jenkin  i should have written sooner but we are in  a bustle and i have been very tired though still well  your very  kind note was most welcome to me  i shall be very much pleased to  have you call me louis as he has now done for so many years   sixteen you say is it so long  it seems too short now but of  that we cannot judge and must not complain  i wish that either i or my wife could do anything for you when we  can you will i am sure command us  i trust that my notice gave you as little pain as was possible  i  found i had so much to say that i preferred to keep it for another  place and make but a note in the academy  to try to draw my friend  at greater length and say what he was to me and his intimates  what a good influence in life and what an example is a desire that  grows upon me  it was strange as i wrote the note how his old  tests and criticisms haunted me and it reminded me afresh with  every few words how much i owe to him  i had a note from henley very brief and very sad  we none of us  yet feel the loss but we know what he would have said and wished  do you know that dew smith has two photographs of him neither very  bad and one giving a lively though not flattering air of him in  conversation  if you have not got them would you like me to write  to dew and ask him to give you proofs  i was so pleased that he and my wife made friends that is a great  pleasure  we found and have preserved one fragment the head of  the drawing he made and tore up when he was last here  he had  promised to come and stay with us this summer  may we not hope at  least some time soon to have one from you  believe me my dear  mrs jenkin with the most real sympathy your sincere friend  robert louis stevenson  dear me what happiness i owe to both of you    letter  to w h low    skerryvore bournemouth october 22 1885  my dear low  i trust you are not annoyed with me beyond  forgiveness for indeed my silence has been devilish prolonged  i  can only tell you that i have been nearly six months more than  six in a strange condition of collapse when it was impossible to  do any work and difficult more difficult than you would suppose  to write the merest note  i am now better but not yet my own man  in the way of brains and in health only soso  i suppose i shall  learn i begin to think i am learning to fight this vast vague  featherbed of an obsession that now overlies and smothers me but  in the beginnings of these conflicts the inexperienced wrestler is  always worsted and i own i have been quite extinct  i wish you to  know though it can be no excuse that you are not the only one of  my friends by many whom i have thus neglected and even now having  come so very late into the possession of myself with a substantial  capital of debts and my work still moving with a desperate  slowness  as a child might fill a sandbag with its little handfuls   and my future deeply pledged there is almost a touch of virtue  in my borrowing these hours to write to you  why i said hours i  know not it would look blue for both of us if i made good the  word  i was writing your address the other day ordering a copy of my  next prince otto to go your way  i hope you have not seen it in  parts it was not meant to be so read and only my poverty  dishonourably consented to the serial evolution  i will send you with this a copy of the english edition of the  childs garden  i have heard there is some vile rule of the post office in the states against inscriptions so i send herewith a  piece of doggerel which mr bunner may if he thinks fit copy off  the fly leaf  sargent was down again and painted a portrait of me walking about  in my own diningroom in my own velveteen jacket and twisting as  i go my own moustache at one corner a glimpse of my wife in an  indian dress and seated in a chair that was once my grandfathers  but since some months goes by the name of henry jamess for it was  there the novelist loved to sit  adds a touch of poesy and  comicality  it is i think excellent but is too eccentric to be  exhibited  i am at one extreme corner my wife in this wild  dress and looking like a ghost is at the extreme other end  between us an open door exhibits my palatial entrance hall and a  part of my respected staircase  all this is touched in lovely  with that witty touch of sargents but of course it looks dam  queer as a whole  pray let me hear from you and give me good news of yourself and  your wife to whom please remember me   yours most sincerely my dear low  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w e henley    skerryvore bournemouth autumn 1885  dear lad  if there was any more praise in what you wrote i think  the editor has done us both a service some of it stops my  throat  what it would not have been the same if dumas or musset  had done it would it not  well no i do not think it would do  you know now i am really of opinion it would not and a dam good  job too  why think what musset would have made of otto  think  how gallantly dumas would have carried his crowd through  and  whatever you do dont quarrel with   it gives me much pleasure  to see your work there i think you do yourself great justice in  that field and i would let no annoyance petty or justifiable  debar me from such a market  i think you do good there  whether  considering our intimate relations you would not do better to  refrain from reviewing me i will leave to yourself  were it all  on my side you could foresee my answer but there is your side  also where you must be the judge  as for the saturday  otto is no fool the reader is left in no  doubt as to whether or not seraphina was a messalina though much  it would matter if you come to that and therefore on both these  points the reviewer has been unjust  secondly the romance lies  precisely in the freeing of two spirits from these court intrigues  and here i think the reviewer showed himself dull  lastly if  ottos speech is offensive to him he is one of the large class of  unmanly and ungenerous dogs who arrogate and defile the name of  manly  as for the passages quoted i do confess that some of them  reek gongorically they are excessive but they are not inelegant  after all  however had he attacked me only there he would have  scored  your criticism on gondremark is i fancy right  i thought all  your criticisms were indeed only your praise  chokes me  yours  ever  r l s    letter  to william archer    skerryvore bournemouth october 28 1885  dear mr archer  i have read your paper with my customary  admiration it is very witty very adroit it contains a great deal  that is excellently true particularly the parts about my stories  and the description of me as an artist in life but you will not  be surprised if i do not think it altogether just  it seems to me  in particular that you have wilfully read all my works in terms of  my earliest my aim even in style has quite changed in the last  six or seven years and this i should have thought you would have  noticed  again your first remark upon the affectation of the  italic names a practice only followed in my two affected little  books of travel where a typographical minauderie of the sort  appeared to me in character and what you say of it then is quite  just  but why should you forget yourself and use these same  italics as an index to my theology some pages further on  this is  lightness of touch indeed may i say it is almost sharpness of  practice  excuse these remarks  i have been on the whole much interested  and sometimes amused  are you aware that the praiser of this  brave gymnasium has not seen a canoe nor taken a long walk since  79 that he is rarely out of the house nowadays and carries his  arm in a sling  can you imagine that he is a backslidden  communist and is sure he will go to hell if there be such an  excellent institution for the luxury in which he lives  and can  you believe that though it is gaily expressed the thought is hag  and skeleton in every moment of vacuity or depression  can you  conceive how profoundly i am irritated by the opposite affectation  to my own when i see strong men and rich men bleating about their  sorrows and the burthen of life in a world full of cancerous  paupers and poor sick children and the fatally bereaved ay and  down even to such happy creatures as myself who has yet been  obliged to strip himself one after another of all the pleasures  that he had chosen except smoking and the days of that i know in  my heart ought to be over i forgot eating which i still enjoy  and who sees the circle of impotence closing very slowly but quite  steadily around him  in my view one dank dispirited word is  harmful a crime of lese humanite a piece of acquired evil every  gay every bright word or picture like every pleasant air of  music is a piece of pleasure set afloat the reader catches it  and if he be healthy goes on his way rejoicing and it is the  business of art so to send him as often as possible  for what you say so kindly so prettily so precisely of my  style i must in particular thank you though even here i am vexed  you should not have remarked on my attempted change of manner   seemingly this attempt is still quite unsuccessful  well we shall  fight it out on this line if it takes all summer  and now for my last word  mrs stevenson is very anxious that you  should see me and that she should see you in the flesh  if you  at all share in these views i am a fixture  write or telegraph  giving us time however to telegraph in reply lest the day be  impossible and come down here to a bed and a dinner  what do you  say my dear critic  i shall be truly pleased to see you and to  explain at greater length what i meant by saying narrative was the  most characteristic mood of literature on which point i have great  hopes i shall persuade you  yours truly  robert louis stevenson  ps  my opinion about thoreau and the passage in the week is  perhaps a fad but it is sincere and stable  i am still of the  same mind five years later did you observe that i had said  modern authors and will you observe again that this passage  touches the very joint of our division  it is one that appeals to  me deals with that part of life that i think the most important  and you if i gather rightly so much less so  you believe in the  extreme moment of the facts that humanity has acquired and is  acquiring i think them of moment but still or much less than  those inherent or inherited brute principles and laws that sit upon  us in the character of conscience as heavy as a shirt of mail  and that in the character of the affections and the airy spirit of  pleasure make all the light of our lives  the house is indeed a  great thing and should be rearranged on sanitary principles but  my heart and all my interest are with the dweller that ancient of  days and dayold infant man  r l s  an excellent touch is p 584  by instinct or design he eschews  what demands constructive patience  i believe it is both my  theory is that literature must always be most at home in treating  movement and change hence i look for them    letter  to thomas stevenson    skerryvore bournemouth october 28 1885  my dearest father  get the november number of time and you will  see a review of me by a very clever fellow who is quite furious at  bottom because i am too orthodox just as purcell was savage  because i am not orthodox enough  i fall between two stools  it  is odd too to see how this man thinks me a fullblooded fox hunter and tells me my philosophy would fail if i lost my health  or had to give up exercise  an illustrated treasure island will be out next month  i have had  an early copy and the french pictures are admirable  the artist  has got his types up in hogarth he is full of fire and spirit can  draw and can compose and has understood the book as i meant it  all but one or two little accidents such as making the hispaniola  a brig  i would send you my copy but i cannot it is my new toy  and i cannot divorce myself from this enjoyment  i am keeping really better and have been out about every second  day though the weather is cold and very wild  i was delighted to hear you were keeping better you and archer  would agree more shame to you  archer is my pessimist critic   goodbye to all of you with my best love  we had a dreadful  overhauling of my conduct as a son the other night and my wife  stripped me of my illusions and made me admit i had been a  detestable bad one  of one thing in particular she convicted me in  my own eyes  i mean a most unkind reticence which hung on me  then and i confess still hangs on me now when i try to assure you  that i do love you  ever your bad son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    skerryvore bournemouth october 28 1885  my dear henry james  at last my wife being at a concert and a  story being done i am at some liberty to write and give you of my  views  and first many thanks for the works that came to my  sickbed  and second and more important as to the princess   well i think you are going to do it this time i cannot of  course foresee but these two first numbers seem to me picturesque  and sound and full of lineament and very much a new departure  as  for your young lady she is all there yes sir you can do low  life i believe  the prison was excellent it was of that nature  of touch that i sometimes achingly miss from your former work with  some of the grime that is and some of the emphasis of skeleton  there is in nature  i pray you to take grime in a good sense it  need not be ignoble  dirt may have dignity in nature it usually  has and your prison was imposing  and now to the main point  why do we not see you  do not fail us   make an alarming sacrifice and let us see henry jamess chair  properly occupied  i never sit in it myself though it was my  grandfathers it has been consecrated to guests by your approval  and now stands at my elbow gaping  we have a new room too to  introduce to you  our last baby the drawingroom it never cries  and has cut its teeth  likewise there is a cat now  it promises  to be a monster of laziness and selfsufficiency  pray see in the november time a dread name for a magazine of  light reading a very clever fellow w archer stating his views  of me the rosygilled athleticoaesthete and warning me in a  fatherly manner that a rheumatic fever would try my philosophy as  indeed it would and that my gospel would not do for those who  are shut out from the exercise of any manly virtue save  renunciation  to those who know that rickety and cloistered  spectre the real r l s the paper besides being clever in  itself presents rare elements of sport  the critical parts are in  particular very bright and neat and often excellently true  get  it by all manner of means  i hear on all sides i am to be attacked as an immoral writer this  is painful  have i at last got like you to the pitch of being  attacked  tis the consecration i lack  and could do without   not that archers paper is an attack or what either he or i i  believe would call one tis the attacks on my morality which i  had thought a gem of the first water i referred to  now my dear james come  come  come  the spirit that is me  says come and the bride and that is my wife says come and the  best thing you can do for us and yourself and your work is to get  up and do so right away  yours affectionately  robert louis stevenson    letter  to william archer    skerryvore bournemouth october 30 1885  dear mr archer  it is possible my father may be soon down with  me he is an old man and in bad health and spirits and i could  neither leave him alone nor could we talk freely before him  if  he should be here when you offer your visit you will understand if  i have to say no and put you off  i quite understand your not caring to refer to things of private  knowledge  what still puzzles me is how you in the witness box   ha  i like the phrase should have made your argument actually  hinge on a contention which the facts answered  i am pleased to hear of the correctness of my guess  it is then as  i supposed you are of the school of the generous and not the  sullen pessimists and i can feel with you  i used myself to rage  when i saw sick folk going by in their bathchairs since i have  been sick myself and always when i was sick myself i found life  even in its rough places to have a property of easiness  that  which we suffer ourselves has no longer the same air of monstrous  injustice and wanton cruelty that suffering wears when we see it in  the case of others  so we begin gradually to see that things are  not black but have their strange compensations and when they draw  towards their worst the idea of death is like a bed to lie on  i  should bear false witness if i did not declare life happy  and  your wonderful statement that happiness tends to die out and misery  to continue which was what put me on the track of your frame of  mind is diagnostic of the happy man raging over the misery of  others it could never be written by the man who had tried what  unhappiness was like  and at any rate it was a slip of the pen   the ugliest word that science has to declare is a reserved  indifference to happiness and misery in the individual it declares  no leaning toward the black no iniquity on the large scale in  fates doings rather a marble equality dread not cruel giving  and taking away and reconciling  why have i not written my timon  well here is my worst quarrel  with you  you take my young books as my last word  the tendency  to try to say more has passed unperceived my fault that  and  you make no allowance for the slowness with which a man finds and  tries to learn his tools  i began with a neat brisk little style  and a sharp little knack of partial observation i have tried to  expand my means but still i can only utter a part of what i wish  to say and am bound to feel and much of it will die unspoken   but if i had the pen of shakespeare i have no timon to give forth   i feel kindly to the powers that be i marvel they should use me so  well and when i think of the case of others i wonder too but in  another vein whether they may not whether they must not be like  me still with some compensation some delight  to have suffered  nay to suffer sets a keen edge on what remains of the agreeable   this is a great truth and has to be learned in the fire  yours  very truly  robert louis stevenson  we expect you remember that    letter  to william archer    skerryvore bournemouth november 1 1885  dear mr archer  you will see that i had already had a sight of  your article and what were my thoughts  one thing in your letter puzzles me  are you too not in the  witnessbox  and if you are why take a wilfully false hypothesis   if you knew i was a chronic invalid why say that my philosophy was  unsuitable to such a case  my call for facts is not so general as  yours but an essential fact should not be put the other way about  the fact is consciously or not you doubt my honesty you think i  am making faces and at heart disbelieve my utterances  and this i  am disposed to think must spring from your not having had enough of  pain sorrow and trouble in your existence  it is easy to have  too much easy also or possible to have too little enough is  required that a man may appreciate what elements of consolation and  joy there are in everything but absolutely overpowering physical  pain or disgrace and how in almost all circumstances the human  soul can play a fair part  you fear life i fancy on the  principle of the hand of little employment  but perhaps my  hypothesis is as unlike the truth as the one you chose  well if  it be so if you have had trials sickness the approach of death  the alienation of friends poverty at the heels and have not felt  your soul turn round upon these things and spurn them under  you  must be very differently made from me and i earnestly believe from  the majority of men  but at least you are in the right to wonder  and complain  to say all  stay here  all at once  that would require a word  from the pen of gargantua  we say each particular thing as it  comes up and with that sort of emphasis that for the time there  seems to be no other  words will not otherwise serve us no nor  even shakespeare who could not have put as you like it and timon  into one without ruinous loss both of emphasis and substance  is  it quite fair then to keep your face so steadily on my most light hearted works and then say i recognise no evil  yet in the paper  on burns for instance i show myself alive to some sorts of evil   but then perhaps they are not your sorts  and again  to say all  all  yes  everything  no  the task  were endless the effect nil  but my all in such a vast field as  this of life is what interests me what stands out what takes on  itself a presence for my imagination or makes a figure in that  little tricky abbreviation which is the best that my reason can  conceive  that i must treat or i shall be fooling with my  readers  that and not the all of some one else  and here we come to the division  not only do i believe that  literature should give joy but i see a universe i suppose  eternally different from yours a solemn a terrible but a very  joyous and noble universe where suffering is not at least wantonly  inflicted though it falls with dispassionate partiality but where  it may be and generally is nobly borne where above all this i  believe probably you dont  i think he may with cancer any  brave man may make out a life which shall be happy for himself  and by so being beneficent to those about him  and if he fails  why should i hear him weeping  i mean if i fail why should i  weep  why should you hear me  then to me morals the conscience  the affections and the passions are i will own frankly and  sweepingly so infinitely more important than the other parts of  life that i conceive men rather triflers who become immersed in  the latter and i will always think the man who keeps his lip  stiff and makes a happy fireside clime and carries a pleasant  face about to friends and neighbours infinitely greater in the  abstract than an atrabilious shakespeare or a backbiting kant or  darwin  no offence to any of these gentlemen two of whom probably  one for certain came up to my standard  and now enough said it were hard if a poor man could not criticise  another without having so much ink shed against him  but i shall  still regret you should have written on an hypothesis you knew to  be untenable and that you should thus have made your paper for  those who do not know me essentially unfair  the rich fox hunting squire speaks with one voice the sick man of letters with  another  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson  prometheusheine in minimis  ps  here i go again  to me the medicine bottles on my chimney  and the blood on my handkerchief are accidents they do not colour  my view of life as you would know i think if you had experience  of sickness they do not exist in my prospect i would as soon drag  them under the eyes of my readers as i would mention a pimple i  might chance to have saving your presence on my posteriors  what  does it prove what does it change it has not hurt it has not  changed me in any essential part and i should think myself a  trifler and in bad taste if i introduced the world to these  unimportant privacies  but again there is this mountainrange between us  that you do  not believe me  it is not flattering but the fault is probably in  my literary art    letter  to w h low    skerryvore bournemouth december 26 1885  my dear low  lamia has not yet turned up but your letter came to  me this evening with a scent of the boulevard montparnasse that was  irresistible  the sand of lavenues crumbled under my heel and  the bouquet of the old fleury came back to me and i remembered the  day when i found a twenty franc piece under my fetish  have you  that fetish still and has it brought you luck  i remembered too  my first sight of you in a frock coat and a smokingcap when we  passed the evening at the cafe de medicis and my last when we sat  and talked in the parc monceau and all these things made me feel a  little young again which to one who has been mostly in bed for a  month was a vivifying change  yes you are lucky to have a bag that holds you comfortably  mine  is a strange contrivance i dont die damme and i cant get along  on both feet to save my soul i am a chronic sickist and my work  cripples along between bed and the parlour between the medicine  bottle and the cupping glass  well i like my life all the same  and should like it none the worse if i could have another talk with  you though even my talks now are measured out to me by the minute  hand like poisons in a minim glass  a photograph will be taken of my ugly mug and sent to you for  ulterior purposes  i have another thing coming out which i did  not put in the way of the scribners i can scarce tell how but i  was sick and penniless and rather back on the world and mismanaged  it  i trust they will forgive me  i am sorry to hear of mrs lows illness and glad to hear of her  recovery  i will announce the coming lamia to bob  he steams away  at literature like smoke  i have a beautiful bob on my walls and  a good sargent and a delightful lemon and your etching now hangs  framed in the diningroom  so the arts surround me  yours  r l s
