63697548	the faith of men   contents  a relic of the pliocene a hyperborean brew the faith of men too much gold the one thousand dozen the marriage of litlit batard the story of jees uck     a relic of the pliocene   i wash my hands of him at the start  i cannot father his tales nor will i be responsible for them  i make these preliminary reservations observe as a guard upon my own integrity  i possess a certain definite position in a small way also a wife and for the good name of the community that honours my existence with its approval and for the sake of her posterity and mine i cannot take the chances i once did nor foster probabilities with the careless improvidence of youth  so i repeat i wash my hands of him this nimrod this mighty hunter this homely blueeyed frecklefaced thomas stevens  having been honest to myself and to whatever prospective olive branches my wife may be pleased to tender me i can now afford to be generous  i shall not criticize the tales told me by thomas stevens and further i shall withhold my judgment  if it be asked why i can only add that judgment i have none  long have i pondered weighed and balanced but never have my conclusions been twice the sameforsooth because thomas stevens is a greater man than i  if he have told truths well and good if untruths still well and good  for who can prove or who disprove  i eliminate myself from the proposition while those of little faith may do as i have donego find the same thomas stevens and discuss to his face the various matters which if fortune serve i shall relate  as to where he may be found  the directions are simple anywhere between 53 north latitude and the pole on the one hand and on the other the likeliest hunting grounds that lie between the east coast of siberia and farthermost labrador  that he is there somewhere within that clearly defined territory i pledge the word of an honourable man whose expectations entail straight speaking and right living  thomas stevens may have toyed prodigiously with truth but when we first met it were well to mark this point he wandered into my camp when i thought myself a thousand miles beyond the outermost post of civilization  at the sight of his human face the first in weary months i could have sprung forward and folded him in my arms and i am not by any means a demonstrative man but to him his visit seemed the most casual thing under the sun  he just strolled into the light of my camp passed the time of day after the custom of men on beaten trails threw my snowshoes the one way and a couple of dogs the other and so made room for himself by the fire  said hed just dropped in to borrow a pinch of soda and to see if i had any decent tobacco  he plucked forth an ancient pipe loaded it with painstaking care and without as much as by your leave whacked half the tobacco of my pouch into his  yes the stuff was fairly good  he sighed with the contentment of the just and literally absorbed the smoke from the crisping yellow flakes and it did my smokers heart good to behold him  hunter  trapper  prospector  he shrugged his shoulders no just sort of knocking round a bit  had come up from the great slave some time since and was thinking of trapsing over into the yukon country  the factor of koshim had spoken about the discoveries on the klondike and he was of a mind to run over for a peep  i noticed that he spoke of the klondike in the archaic vernacular calling it the reindeer rivera conceited custom that the old timers employ against the chechaquas and all tenderfeet in general  but he did it so naively and as such a matter of course that there was no sting and i forgave him  he also had it in view he said before he crossed the divide into the yukon to make a little run up fort o good hope way  now fort o good hope is a far journey to the north over and beyond the circle in a place where the feet of few men have trod and when a nondescript ragamuffin comes in out of the night from nowhere in particular to sit by ones fire and discourse on such in terms of trapsing and a little run it is fair time to rouse up and shake off the dream  wherefore i looked about me saw the fly and underneath the pine boughs spread for the sleeping furs saw the grub sacks the camera the frosty breaths of the dogs circling on the edge of the light and above a great streamer of the aurora bridging the zenith from south east to northwest  i shivered  there is a magic in the northland night that steals in on one like fevers from malarial marshes  you are clutched and downed before you are aware  then i looked to the snowshoes lying prone and crossed where he had flung them  also i had an eye to my tobacco pouch  half at least of its goodly store had vamosed  that settled it  fancy had not tricked me after all  crazed with suffering i thought looking steadfastly at the manone of those wild stampeders strayed far from his bearings and wandering like a lost soul through great vastnesses and unknown deeps  oh well let his moods slip on until mayhap he gathers his tangled wits together  who knowsthe mere sound of a fellowcreatures voice may bring all straight again  so i led him on in talk and soon i marvelled for he talked of game and the ways thereof  he had killed the siberian wolf of westernmost alaska and the chamois in the secret rockies  he averred he knew the haunts where the last buffalo still roamed that he had hung on the flanks of the caribou when they ran by the hundred thousand and slept in the great barrens on the muskoxs winter trail  and i shifted my judgment accordingly the first revision but by no account the last and deemed him a monumental effigy of truth  why it was i know not but the spirit moved me to repeat a tale told to me by a man who had dwelt in the land too long to know better  it was of the great bear that hugs the steep slopes of st elias never descending to the levels of the gentler inclines  now god so constituted this creature for its hillside habitat that the legs of one side are all of a foot longer than those of the other  this is mighty convenient as will be reality admitted  so i hunted this rare beast in my own name told it in the first person present tense painted the requisite locale gave it the necessary garnishings and touches of verisimilitude and looked to see the man stunned by the recital  not he  had he doubted i could have forgiven him  had he objected denying the dangers of such a hunt by virtue of the animals inability to turn about and go the other wayhad he done this i say i could have taken him by the hand for the true sportsman that he was  not he  he sniffed looked on me and sniffed again then gave my tobacco due praise thrust one foot into my lap and bade me examine the gear  it was a mucluc of the innuit pattern sewed together with sinew threads and devoid of beads or furbelows  but it was the skin itself that was remarkable  in that it was all of half an inch thick it reminded me of walrushide but there the resemblance ceased for no walrus ever bore so marvellous a growth of hair  on the side and ankles this hair was well nigh worn away what of friction with underbrush and snow but around the top and down the more sheltered back it was coarse dirty black and very thick  i parted it with difficulty and looked beneath for the fine fur that is common with northern animals but found it in this case to be absent  this however was compensated for by the length  indeed the tufts that had survived wear and tear measured all of seven or eight inches  i looked up into the mans face and he pulled his foot down and asked find hide like that on your st elias bear  i shook my head  nor on any other creature of land or sea i answered candidly  the thickness of it and the length of the hair puzzled me  that he said and said without the slightest hint of impressiveness that came from a mammoth  nonsense i exclaimed for i could not forbear the protest of my unbelief  the mammoth my dear sir long ago vanished from the earth we know it once existed by the fossil remains that we have unearthed and by a frozen carcase that the siberian sun saw fit to melt from out the bosom of a glacier but we also know that no living specimen exists  our explorers  at this word he broke in impatiently  your explorers  pish  a weakly breed  let us hear no more of them  but tell me o man what you may know of the mammoth and his ways  beyond contradiction this was leading to a yarn so i baited my hook by ransacking my memory for whatever data i possessed on the subject in hand  to begin with i emphasized that the animal was prehistoric and marshalled all my facts in support of this  i mentioned the siberian sandbars that abounded with ancient mammoth bones spoke of the large quantities of fossil ivory purchased from the innuits by the alaska commercial company and acknowledged having myself mined six and eight foot tusks from the pay gravel of the klondike creeks  all fossils i concluded found in the midst of debris deposited through countless ages  i remember when i was a kid thomas stevens sniffed he had a most confounded way of sniffing that i saw a petrified watermelon  hence though mistaken persons sometimes delude themselves into thinking that they are really raising or eating them there are no such things as extant watermelons  but the question of food i objected ignoring his point which was puerile and without bearing  the soil must bring forth vegetable life in lavish abundance to support so monstrous creations  nowhere in the north is the soil so prolific  ergo the mammoth cannot exist  i pardon your ignorance concerning many matters of this northland for you are a young man and have travelled little but at the same time i am inclined to agree with you on one thing  the mammoth no longer exists  how do i know  i killed the last one with my own right arm  thus spake nimrod the mighty hunter  i threw a stick of firewood at the dogs and bade them quit their unholy howling and waited  undoubtedly this liar of singular felicity would open his mouth and requite me for my st elias bear  it was this way he at last began after the appropriate silence had intervened  i was in camp one day  where i interrupted  he waved his hand vaguely in the direction of the northeast where stretched a terra incognita into which vastness few men have strayed and fewer emerged  i was in camp one day with klooch  klooch was as handsome a little kamooks as ever whined betwixt the traces or shoved nose into a camp kettle  her father was a fullblood malemute from russian pastilik on bering sea and i bred her and with understanding out of a cleanlegged bitch of the hudson bay stock  i tell you o man she was a corker combination  and now on this day i have in mind she was brought to pup through a pure wild wolf of the woodsgrey and long of limb with big lungs and no end of staying powers  say  was there ever the like  it was a new breed of dog i had started and i could look forward to big things  as i have said she was brought neatly to pup and safely delivered  i was squatting on my hams over the litterseven sturdy blind little beggarswhen from behind came a bray of trumpets and crash of brass there was a rush like the windsquall that kicks the heels of the rain and i was midway to my feet when knocked flat on my face  at the same instant i heard klooch sigh very much as a man does when youve planted your fist in his belly  you can stake your sack i lay quiet but i twisted my head around and saw a huge bulk swaying above me  then the blue sky flashed into view and i got to my feet  a hairy mountain of flesh was just disappearing in the underbrush on the edge of the open  i caught a rearend glimpse with a stiff tail as big in girth as my body standing out straight behind  the next second only a tremendous hole remained in the thicket though i could still hear the sounds as of a tornado dying quickly away underbrush ripping and tearing and trees snapping and crashing  i cast about for my rifle  it had been lying on the ground with the muzzle against a log but now the stock was smashed the barrel out of line and the workinggear in a thousand bits  then i looked for the slut andand what do you suppose  i shook my head  may my soul burn in a thousand hells if there was anything left of her klooch the seven sturdy blind little beggarsgone all gone  where she had stretched was a slimy bloody depression in the soft earth all of a yard in diameter and around the edges a few scattered hairs  i measured three feet on the snow threw about it a circle and glanced at nimrod  the beast was thirty long and twenty high he answered and its tusks scaled over six times three feet  i couldnt believe myself at the time for all that it had just happened  but if my senses had played me there was the broken gun and the hole in the brush  and there wasor rather there was notklooch and the pups  o man it makes me hot all over now when i think of it klooch  another eve  the mother of a new race  and a rampaging ranting old bull mammoth like a second flood wiping them root and branch off the face of the earth  do you wonder that the bloodsoaked earth cried out to high god  or that i grabbed the handaxe and took the trail  the handaxe i exclaimed startled out of myself by the picture  the handaxe and a big bull mammoth thirty feet long twenty feet  nimrod joined me in my merriment chuckling gleefully  wouldnt it kill you he cried  wasnt it a beavers dream  manys the time ive laughed about it since but at the time it was no laughing matter i was that danged mad what of the gun and klooch  think of it o man  a brandnew unclassified uncopyrighted breed and wiped out before ever it opened its eyes or took out its intention papers  well so be it lifes full of disappointments and rightly so  meat is best after a famine and a bed soft after a hard trail  as i was saying i took out after the beast with the handaxe and hung to its heels down the valley but when he circled back toward the head i was left winded at the lower end  speaking of grub i might as well stop long enough to explain a couple of points  up thereabouts in the midst of the mountains is an almighty curious formation  there is no end of little valleys each like the other much as peas in a pod and all neatly tucked away with straight rocky walls rising on all sides  and at the lower ends are always small openings where the drainage or glaciers must have broken out  the only way in is through these mouths and they are all small and some smaller than others  as to grubyouve slushed around on the rainsoaked islands of the alaskan coast down sitka way most likely seeing as youre a traveller  and you know how stuff grows therebig and juicy and jungly  well thats the way it was with those valleys  thick rich soil with ferns and grasses and such things in patches higher than your head  rain three days out of four during the summer months and food in them for a thousand mammoths to say nothing of small game for man  but to get back  down at the lower end of the valley i got winded and gave over  i began to speculate for when my wind left me my dander got hotter and hotter and i knew id never know peace of mind till i dined on roasted mammothfoot  and i knew also that that stood for skookum mamook pukapukexcuse chinook i mean there was a big fight coming now the mouth of my valley was very narrow and the walls steep  high up on one side was one of those big pivot rocks or balancing rocks as some call them weighing all of a couple of hundred tons  just the thing  i hit back for camp keeping an eye open so the bull couldnt slip past and got my ammunition  it wasnt worth anything with the rifle smashed so i opened the shells planted the powder under the rock and touched it off with slow fuse  wasnt much of a charge but the old boulder tilted up lazily and dropped down into place with just space enough to let the creek drain nicely  now i had him  but how did you have him i queried  who ever heard of a man killing a mammoth with a handaxe  and for that matter with anything else  o man have i not told you i was mad nimrod replied with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness  mad clean through what of klooch and the gun  also was i not a hunter  and was this not new and most unusual game  a handaxe  pish  i did not need it  listen and you shall hear of a hunt such as might have happened in the youth of the world when cavemen rounded up the kill with handaxe of stone  such would have served me as well  now is it not a fact that man can outwalk the dog or horse  that he can wear them out with the intelligence of his endurance  i nodded  well  the light broke in on me and i bade him continue  my valley was perhaps five miles around  the mouth was closed  there was no way to get out  a timid beast was that bull mammoth and i had him at my mercy  i got on his heels again hollered like a fiend pelted him with cobbles and raced him around the valley three times before i knocked off for supper  dont you see  a racecourse  a man and a mammoth  a hippodrome with sun moon and stars to referee  it took me two months to do it but i did it  and thats no beaver dream  round and round i ran him me travelling on the inner circle eating jerked meat and salmon berries on the run and snatching winks of sleep between  of course hed get desperate at times and turn  then id head for soft ground where the creek spread out and lay anathema upon him and his ancestry and dare him to come on  but he was too wise to bog in a mud puddle  once he pinned me in against the walls and i crawled back into a deep crevice and waited  whenever he felt for me with his trunk id belt him with the handaxe till he pulled out shrieking fit to split my ear drums he was that mad  he knew he had me and didnt have me and it near drove him wild  but he was no mans fool  he knew he was safe as long as i stayed in the crevice and he made up his mind to keep me there  and he was dead right only he hadnt figured on the commissary  there was neither grub nor water around that spot so on the face of it he couldnt keep up the siege  hed stand before the opening for hours keeping an eye on me and flapping mosquitoes away with his big blanket ears  then the thirst would come on him and hed ramp round and roar till the earth shook calling me every name he could lay tongue to  this was to frighten me of course and when he thought i was sufficiently impressed hed back away softly and try to make a sneak for the creek  sometimes id let him get almost thereonly a couple of hundred yards away it waswhen out id pop and back hed come lumbering along like the old landslide he was  after id done this a few times and hed figured it out he changed his tactics grasped the time element you see  without a word of warning away hed go tearing for the water like mad scheming to get there and back before i ran away  finally after cursing me most horribly he raised the siege and deliberately stalked off to the waterhole  that was the only time he penned methree days of itbut after that the hippodrome never stopped  round and round and round like a six days goasiplease for he never pleased  my clothes went to rags and tatters but i never stopped to mend till at last i ran naked as a son of earth with nothing but the old handaxe in one hand and a cobble in the other  in fact i never stopped save for peeps of sleep in the crannies and ledges of the cliffs  as for the bull he got perceptibly thinner and thinnermust have lost several tons at leastand as nervous as a schoolmarm on the wrong side of matrimony  when id come up with him and yell or lain him with a rock at long range hed jump like a skittish colt and tremble all over  then hed pull out on the run tail and trunk waving stiff head over one shoulder and wicked eyes blazing and the way hed swear at me was something dreadful  a most immoral beast he was a murderer and a blasphemer  but towards the end he quit all this and fell to whimpering and crying like a baby  his spirit broke and he became a quivering jellymountain of misery  hed get attacks of palpitation of the heart and stagger around like a drunken man and fall down and bark his shins  and then hed cry but always on the run  o man the gods themselves would have wept with him and you yourself or any other man  it was pitiful and there was so i much of it but i only hardened my heart and hit up the pace  at last i wore him clean out and he lay down brokenwinded brokenhearted hungry and thirsty  when i found he wouldnt budge i hamstrung him and spent the better part of the day wading into him with the handaxe he asniffing and sobbing till i worked in far enough to shut him off  thirty feet long he was and twenty high and a man could sling a hammock between his tusks and sleep comfortably  barring the fact that i had run most of the juices out of him he was fair eating and his four feet alone roasted whole would have lasted a man a twelvemonth  i spent the winter there myself  and where is this valley i asked  he waved his hand in the direction of the northeast and said your tobacco is very good  i carry a fair share of it in my pouch but i shall carry the recollection of it until i die  in token of my appreciation and in return for the moccasins on your own feet i will present to you these muclucs  they commemorate klooch and the seven blind little beggars  they are also souvenirs of an unparalleled event in history namely the destruction of the oldest breed of animal on earth and the youngest  and their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out  having effected the exchange he knocked the ashes from his pipe gripped my hand goodnight and wandered off through the snow  concerning this tale for which i have already disclaimed responsibility i would recommend those of little faith to make a visit to the smithsonian institute  if they bring the requisite credentials and do not come in vacation time they will undoubtedly gain an audience with professor dolvidson  the muclucs are in his possession and he will verify not the manner in which they were obtained but the material of which they are composed  when he states that they are made from the skin of the mammoth the scientific world accepts his verdict  what more would you have     a hyperborean brew   the story of a scheming white man among the strange people who live on the rim of the arctic sea  thomas stevenss veracity may have been indeterminate as x and his imagination the imagination of ordinary men increased to the nth power but this at least must be said never did he deliver himself of word nor deed that could be branded as a lie outright   he may have played with probability and verged on the extremest edge of possibility but in his tales the machinery never creaked  that he knew the northland like a book not a soul can deny  that he was a great traveller and had set foot on countless unknown trails many evidences affirm  outside of my own personal knowledge i knew men that had met him everywhere but principally on the confines of nowhere  there was johnson the exhudson bay company factor who had housed him in a labrador factory until his dogs rested up a bit and he was able to strike out again  there was mcmahon agent for the alaska commercial company who had run across him in dutch harbour and later on among the outlying islands of the aleutian group  it was indisputable that he had guided one of the earlier united states surveys and history states positively that in a similar capacity he served the western union when it attempted to put through its transalaskan and siberian telegraph to europe  further there was joe lamson the whaling captain who when icebound off the mouth of the mackenzie had had him come aboard after tobacco  this last touch proves thomas stevenss identity conclusively  his quest for tobacco was perennial and untiring  ere we became fairly acquainted i learned to greet him with one hand and pass the pouch with the other but the night i met him in john obriens dawson saloon his head was wreathed in a nimbus of fiftycent cigar smoke and instead of my pouch he demanded my sack  we were standing by a faro table and forthwith he tossed it upon the high card  fifty he said and the gamekeeper nodded  the high card turned and he handed back my sack called for a tab and drew me over to the scales where the weigher nonchalantly cashed him out fifty dollars in dust  and now well drink he said and later at the bar when he lowered his glass reminds me of a little brew i had up tattarat way  no you have no knowledge of the place nor is it down on the charts  but its up by the rim of the arctic sea not so many hundred miles from the american line and all of half a thousand godforsaken souls live there giving and taking in marriage and starving and dying inbetweenwhiles explorers have overlooked them and you will not find them in the census of 1890  a whaleship was pinched there once but the men who had made shore over the ice pulled out for the south and were never heard of  but it was a great brew we had moosu and i he added a moment later with just the slightest suspicion of a sigh  i knew there were big deeds and wild doings behind that sigh so i haled him into a corner between a roulette outfit and a poker layout and waited for his tongue to thaw  had one objection to moosu he began cocking his head meditativelyone objection and only one  he was an indian from over on the edge of the chippewyan country but the trouble was hed picked up a smattering of the scriptures  been campmate a season with a renegade french canadian whod studied for the church  moosud never seen applied christianity and his head was crammed with miracles battles and dispensations and what not he didnt understand  otherwise he was a good sort and a handy man on trail or over a fire  wed had a hard time together and were badly knocked out when we plumped upon tattarat  lost outfits and dogs crossing a divide in a fall blizzard and our bellies clove to our backs and our clothes were in rags when we crawled into the village  they werent much surprised at seeing usbecause of the whalemenand gave us the meanest shack in the village to live in and the worst of their leavings to live on  what struck me at the time as strange was that they left us strictly alone  but moosu explained it  shaman sick tumtum he said meaning the shaman or medicine man was jealous and had advised the people to have nothing to do with us from the little hed seen of the whalemen hed learned that mine was a stronger race and a wiser so hed only behaved as shamans have always behaved the world over  and before i get done youll see how near right he was  these people have a law said mosu whoso eats of meat must hunt  we be awkward you and i o master in the weapons of this country nor can we string bows nor fling spears after the manner approved  wherefore the shaman and tummasook who is chief have put their heads together and it has been decreed that we work with the women and children in dragging in the meat and tending the wants of the hunters  and this is very wrong i made to answer for we be better men moosu than these people who walk in darkness  further we should rest and grow strong for the way south is long and on that trail the weak cannot prosper  but we have nothing he objected looking about him at the rotten timbers of the igloo the stench of the ancient walrus meat that had been our supper disgusting his nostrils  and on this fare we cannot thrive we have nothing save the bottle of painkiller which will not fill emptiness so we must bend to the yoke of the unbeliever and become hewers of wood and drawers of water  and there be good things in this place the which we may not have  ah master never has my nose lied to me and i have followed it to secret caches and among the furbales of the igloos  good provender did these people extort from the poor whalemen and this provender has wandered into few hands  the woman ipsukuk who dwelleth in the far end of the village next she igloo of the chief possesseth much flour and sugar and even have my eyes told me of molasses smeared on her face  and in the igloo of tummasook the chief there be teahave i not seen the old pig guzzling  and the shaman owneth a caddy of star and two buckets of prime smoking  and what have we  nothing  nothing  but i was stunned by the word he brought of the tobacco and made no answer  and moosu what of his own desire broke silence and there be tukeliketa daughter of a big hunter and wealthy man  a likely girl indeed a very nice girl  i figured hard during the night while moosu snored for i could not bear the thought of the tobacco so near which i could not smoke  true as he had said we had nothing  but the way became clear to me and in the morning i said to him go thou cunningly abroad after thy fashion and procure me some sort of bone crooked like a gooseneck and hollow  also walk humbly but have eyes awake to the lay of pots and pans and cooking contrivances  and remember mine is the white mans wisdom and do what i have bid you with sureness and despatch  while he was away i placed the whaleoil cooking lamp in the middle of the igloo and moved the mangy sleeping furs back that i might have room then i took apart his gun and put the barrel by handy and afterwards braided many wicks from the cotton that the women gather wild in the summer  when he came back it was with the bone i had commanded and with news that in the igloo of tummasook there was a fivegallon kerosene can and a big copper kettle  so i said he had done well and we would tarry through the day  and when midnight was near i made harangue to him  this chief this tummasook hath a copper kettle likewise a kerosene can  i put a rock smooth and wavewashed in moosus hand  the camp is hushed and the stars are winking  go thou creep into the chiefs igloo softly and smite him thus upon the belly and hard  and let the meat and good grub of the days to come put strength into thine arm  there will be uproar and outcry and the village will come hot afoot  but be thou unafraid  veil thy movements and lose thy form in the obscurity of the night and the confusion of men  and when the woman ipsukuk is anigh theeshe who smeareth her face with molassesdo thou smite her likewise and whosoever else that possesseth flour and cometh to thy hand  then do thou lift thy voice in pain and double up with clasped hands and make outcry in token that thou too hast felt the visitation of the night  and in this way shall we achieve honour and great possessions and the caddy of star and the prime smoking and thy tukeliketa who is a likely maiden  when he had departed on this errand i bided patiently in the shack and the tobacco seemed very near  then there was a cry of affright in the night that became an uproar and assailed the sky  i seized the pain killer and ran forth  there was much noise and a wailing among the women and fear sat heavily on all  tummasook and the woman ipsukuk rolled on the ground in pain and with them there were divers others also moosu  i thrust aside those that cluttered the way of my feet and put the mouth of the bottle to moosus lips  and straightway he became well and ceased his howling  whereat there was a great clamour for the bottle from the others so stricken  but i made harangue and ere they tasted and were made well i had mulcted tummasook of his copper kettle and kerosene can and the woman ipsukuk of her sugar and molasses and the other sick ones of goodly measures of flour  the shaman glowered wickedly at the people around my knees though he poorly concealed the wonder that lay beneath  but i held my head high and moosu groaned beneath the loot as he followed my heels to the shack  there i set to work  in tummasooks copper kettle i mixed three quarts of wheat flour with five of molasses and to this i added of water twenty quarts  then i placed the kettle near the lamp that it might sour in the warmth and grow strong  moosu understood and said my wisdom passed understanding and was greater than solomons who he had heard was a wise man of old time  the kerosene can i set over the lamp and to its nose i affixed a snout and into the snout the bone that was like a gooseneck  i sent moosu without to pound ice while i connected the barrel of his gun with the gooseneck and midway on the barrel i piled the ice he had pounded  and at the far end of the gunbarrel beyond the pan of ice i placed a small iron pot  when the brew was strong enough and it was two days ere it could stand on its own legs i filled the kerosene can with it and lighted the wicks i had braided  now that all was ready i spoke to moosu  go forth i said to the chief men of the village and give them greeting and bid them come into my igloo and sleep the night away with me and the gods  the brew was singing merrily when they began shoving aside the skin flap and crawling in and i was heaping cracked ice on the gunbarrel  out of the priming hole at the far end drip drip drip into the iron pot fell the liquorhooch you know  but theyd never seen the like and giggled nervously when i made harangue about its virtues  as i talked i noted the jealousy in the shamans eye so when i had done i placed him side by side with tummasook and the woman ipsukuk  then i gave them to drink and their eyes watered and their stomachs warmed till from being afraid they reached greedily for more and when i had them well started i turned to the others  tummasook made a brag about how he had once killed a polar bear and in the vigour of his pantomime nearly slew his mothers brother  but nobody heeded  the woman ipsukuk fell to weeping for a son lost long years agone in the ice and the shaman made incantation and prophecy  so it went and before morning they were all on the floor sleeping soundly with the gods  the story tells itself does it not  the news of the magic potion spread  it was too marvellous for utterance  tongues could tell but a tithe of the miracles it performed  it eased pain gave surcease to sorrow brought back old memories dead faces and forgotten dreams  it was a fire that ate through all the blood and burning burned not  it stoutened the heart stiffened the back and made men more than men  it revealed the future and gave visions and prophecy  it brimmed with wisdom and unfolded secrets  there was no end of the things it could do and soon there was a clamouring on all hands to sleep with the gods  they brought their warmest furs their strongest dogs their best meats but i sold the hooch with discretion and only those were favoured that brought flour and molasses and sugar  and such stores poured in that i set moosu to build a cache to hold them for there was soon no space in the igloo  ere three days had passed tummasook had gone bankrupt  the shaman who was never more than half drunk after the first night watched me closely and hung on for the better part of the week  but before ten days were gone even the woman ipsukuk exhausted her provisions and went home weak and tottery  but moosu complained  o master he said we have laid by great wealth in molasses and sugar and flour but our shack is yet mean our clothes thin and our sleeping furs mangy  there is a call of the belly for meat the stench of which offends not the stars and for tea such as tummasook guzzles and there is a great yearning for the tobacco of neewak who is shaman and who plans to destroy us  i have flour until i am sick and sugar and molasses without stint yet is the heart of moosu sore and his bed empty  peace i answered thou art weak of understanding and a fool  walk softly and wait and we will grasp it all  but grasp now and we grasp little and in the end it will be nothing  thou art a child in the way of the white mans wisdom  hold thy tongue and watch and i will show you the way my brothers do overseas and so doing gather to themselves the riches of the earth  it is what is called business and what dost thou know about business  but the next day he came in breathless  o master a strange thing happeneth in the igloo of neewak the shaman wherefore we are lost and we have neither worn the warm furs nor tasted the good tobacco what of your madness for the molasses and flour  go thou and witness whilst i watch by the brew  so i went to the igloo of neewak  and behold he had made his own still fashioned cunningly after mine  and as he beheld me he could ill conceal his triumph  for he was a man of parts and his sleep with the gods when in my igloo had not been sound  but i was not disturbed for i knew what i knew and when i returned to my own igloo i descanted to moosu and said happily the property right obtains amongst this people who otherwise have been blessed with but few of the institutions of men  and because of this respect for property shall you and i wax fat and further we shall introduce amongst them new institutions that other peoples have worked out through great travail and suffering  but moosu understood dimly till the shaman came forth with eyes flashing and a threatening note in his voice and demanded to trade with me  for look you he cried there be of flour and molasses none in all the village  the like have you gathered with a shrewd hand from my people who have slept with your gods and who now have nothing save large heads and weak knees and a thirst for cold water that they cannot quench  this is not good and my voice has power among them so it were well that we trade you and i even as you have traded with them for molasses and flour  and i made answer this be good talk and wisdom abideth in thy mouth we will trade  for this much of flour and molasses givest thou me the caddy of star and the two buckets of smoking  and moosu groaned and when the trade was made and the shaman departed he upbraided me now because of thy madness are we indeed lost neewak maketh hooch on his own account and when the time is ripe he will command the people to drink of no hooch but his hooch  and in this way are we undone and our goods worthless and our igloo mean and the bed of moosu cold and empty  and i answered by the body of the wolf say i thou art a fool and thy father before thee and thy children after thee down to the last generation  thy wisdom is worse than no wisdom and thine eyes blinded to business of which i have spoken and whereof thou knowest nothing  go thou son of a thousand fools and drink of the hooch that neewak brews in his igloo and thank thy gods that thou hast a white mans wisdom to make soft the bed thou liest in  go and when thou hast drunken return with the taste still on thy lips that i may know  and two days after neewak sent greeting and invitation to his igloo moosu went but i sat alone with the song of the still in my ears and the air thick with the shamans tobacco for trade was slack that night and no one dropped in but angeit a young hunter that had faith in me later moosu came back his speech thick with chuckling and his eyes wrinkling with laughter  thou art a great man he said  thou art a great man o master and because of thy greatness thou wilt not condemn moosu thy servant who ofttimes doubts and cannot be made to understand  and wherefore now i demanded  hast thou drunk overmuch  and are they sleeping sound in the igloo of neewak the shaman  nay they are angered and sore of body and chief tummasook has thrust his thumbs in the throat of neewak and sworn by the bones of his ancestors to look upon his face no more  for behold i went to the igloo and the brew simmered and bubbled and the steam journeyed through the gooseneck even as thy steam and even as thine it became water where it met the ice and dropped into the pot at the far end  and neewak gave us to drink and lo it was not like thine for there was no bite to the tongue nor tingling to the eyeballs and of a truth it was water  so we drank and we drank overmuch yet did we sit with cold hearts and solemn and neewak was perplexed and a cloud came on his brow  and he took tummasook and ipsukuk alone of all the company and set them apart and bade them drink and drink and drink  and they drank and drank and drank and yet sat solemn and cold till tummasook arose in wrath and demanded back the furs and the tea he had paid  and ipsukuk raised her voice thin and angry  and the company demanded back what they had given and there was a great commotion  does the son of a dog deem me a whale demanded tummasook shoving back the skin flap and standing erect his face black and his brows angry  wherefore i am filled like a fishbladder to bursting till i can scarce walk what of the weight within me  lalah  i have drunken as never before yet are my eyes clear my knees strong my hand steady  the shaman cannot send us to sleep with the gods the people complained stringing in and joining us and only in thy igloo may the thing be done  so i laughed to myself as i passed the hooch around and the guests made merry  for in the flour i had traded to neewak i had mixed much soda that i had got from the woman ipsukuk  so how could his brew ferment when the soda kept it sweet  or his hooch be hooch when it would not sour  after that our wealth flowed in without let or hindrance  furs we had without number and the fancywork of the women all of the chiefs tea and no end of meat  one day moosu retold for my benefit and sadly mangled the story of joseph in egypt but from it i got an idea and soon i had half the tribe at work building me great meat caches  and of all they hunted i got the lions share and stored it away  nor was moosu idle  he made himself a pack of cards from birch bark and taught neewak the way to play sevenup  he also inveigled the father of tukeliketa into the game  and one day he married the maiden and the next day he moved into the shamans house which was the finest in the village  the fall of neewak was complete for he lost all his possessions his walrus hide drums his incantation toolseverything  and in the end he became a hewer of wood and drawer of water at the beck and call of moosu  and moosuhe set himself up as shaman or high priest and out of his garbled scripture created new gods and made incantation before strange altars  and i was well pleased for i thought it good that church and state go hand in hand and i had certain plans of my own concerning the state events were shaping as i had foreseen  good temper and smiling faces had vanished from the village  the people were morose and sullen  there were quarrels and fighting and things were in an uproar night and day moosus cards were duplicated and the hunters fell to gambling among themselves  tummasook beat his wife horribly and his mothers brother objected and smote him with a tusk of walrus till he cried aloud in the night and was shamed before the people  also amid such diversions no hunting was done and famine fell upon the land  the nights were long and dark and without meat no hooch could be bought so they murmured against the chief  this i had played for and when they were well and hungry i summoned the whole village made a great harangue posed as patriarch and fed the famishing  moosu made harangue likewise and because of this and the thing i had done i was made chief  moosu who had the ear of god and decreed his judgments anointed me with whale blubber and right blubberly he did it not understanding the ceremony and between us we interpreted to the people the new theory of the divine right of kings  there was hooch galore and meat and feastings and they took kindly to the new order  so you see o man i have sat in the high places and worn the purple and ruled populations  and i might yet be a king had the tobacco held out or had moosu been more fool and less knave  for he cast eyes upon esanetuk eldest daughter to tummasook and i objected  o brother he explained thou hast seen fit to speak of introducing new institutions amongst this people and i have listened to thy words and gained wisdom thereby  thou rulest by the godgiven right and by the godgiven right i marry  i noted that he brothered me and was angry and put my foot down  but he fell back upon the people and made incantations for three days in which all hands joined and then speaking with the voice of god he decreed polygamy by divine fiat  but he was shrewd for he limited the number of wives by a property qualification and because of which he above all men was favoured by his wealth  nor could i fail to admire though it was plain that power had turned his head and he would not be satisfied till all the power and all the wealth rested in his own hands so he became swollen with pride forgot it was i that had placed him there and made preparations to destroy me  but it was interesting for the beggar was working out in his own way an evolution of primitive society  now i by virtue of the hooch monopoly drew a revenue in which i no longer permitted him to share  so he meditated for a while and evolved a system of ecclesiastical taxation he laid tithes upon the people harangued about fat firstlings and such things and twisted whatever twisted texts he had ever heard to serve his purpose  even this i bore in silence but when he instituted what may be likened to a graduated incometax i rebelled and blindly for this was what he worked for  thereat he appealed to the people and they envious of my great wealth and well taxed themselves upheld him  why should we pay they asked and not you  does not the voice of god speak through the lips of moosu the shaman  so i yielded  but at the same time i raised the price of hooch and lo he was not a whit behind me in raising my taxes  then there was open war  i made a play for neewak and tummasook because of the traditionary rights they possessed but moosu won out by creating a priesthood and giving them both high office  the problem of authority presented itself to him and he worked it out as it has often been worked before  there was my mistake  i should have been made shaman and he chief but i saw it too late and in the clash of spiritual and temporal power i was bound to be worsted  a great controversy waged but it quickly became onesided  the people remembered that he had anointed me and it was clear to them that the source of my authority lay not in me but in moosu  only a few faithful ones clung to me chief among whom angeit was while he headed the popular party and set whispers afloat that i had it in mind to overthrow him and set up my own gods which were most unrighteous gods  and in this the clever rascal had anticipated me for it was just what i had intendedforsake my kingship you see and fight spiritual with spiritual  so he frightened the people with the iniquities of my peculiar godsespecially the one he named bizenassand nipped the scheme in the bud  now it happened that kluktu youngest daughter to tummasook had caught my fancy and i likewise hers  so i made overtures but the exchief refused bluntlyafter i had paid the purchase priceand informed me that she was set aside for moosu  this was too much and i was half of a mind to go to his igloo and slay him with my naked hands but i recollected that the tobacco was near gone and went home laughing  the next day he made incantation and distorted the miracle of the loaves and fishes till it became prophecy and i reading between the lines saw that it was aimed at the wealth of meat stored in my caches  the people also read between the lines and as he did not urge them to go on the hunt they remained at home and few caribou or bear were brought in  but i had plans of my own seeing that not only the tobacco but the flour and molasses were near gone  and further i felt it my duty to prove the white mans wisdom and bring sore distress to moosu who had waxed highstomached what of the power i had given him  so that night i went to my meat caches and toiled mightily and it was noted next day that all the dogs of the village were lazy  no one suspected and i toiled thus every night and the dogs grew fat and fatter and the people lean and leaner  they grumbled and demanded the fulfilment of prophecy but moosu restrained them waiting for their hunger to grow yet greater nor did he dream to the very last of the trick i had been playing on the empty caches  when all was ready i sent angeit and the faithful ones whom i had fed privily through the village to call assembly  and the tribe gathered on a great space of beaten snow before my door with the meat caches towering stiltlegged in the rear  moosu came also standing on the inner edge of the circle opposite me confident that i had some scheme afoot and prepared at the first break to down me  but i arose giving him salutation before all men  o moosu thou blessed of god i began doubtless thou hast wondered in that i have called this convocation together and doubtless because of my many foolishnesses art thou prepared for rash sayings and rash doings  not so  it has been said that those the gods would destroy they first make mad  and i have been indeed mad  i have crossed thy will and scoffed at thy authority and done divers evil and wanton things  wherefore last night a vision was vouchsafed me and i have seen the wickedness of my ways  and thou stoodst forth like a shining star with brows aflame and i knew in mine own heart thy greatness  i saw all things clearly  i knew that thou didst command the ear of god and that when you spoke he listened  and i remembered that whatever of the good deeds that i had done i had done through the grace of god and the grace of moosu  yes my children i cried turning to the people whatever right i have done and whatever good i have done have been because of the counsel of moosu  when i listened to him affairs prospered when i closed my ears and acted according to my folly things came to folly  by his advice it was that i laid my store of meat and in time of darkness fed the famishing  by his grace it was that i was made chief  and what have i done with my chiefship  let me tell you  i have done nothing  my head was turned with power and i deemed myself greater than moosu and behold i have come to grief  my rule has been unwise and the gods are angered  lo ye are pinched with famine and the mothers are drybreasted and the little babies cry through the long nights  nor do i who have hardened my heart against moosu know what shall be done nor in what manner of way grub shall be had  at this there was nodding and laughing and the people put their heads together and i knew they whispered of the loaves and fishes  i went on hastily  so i was made aware of my foolishness and of moosus wisdom of my own unfitness and of moosus fitness  and because of this being no longer mad i make acknowledgment and rectify evil  i did cast unrighteous eyes upon kluktu and lo she was sealed to moosu  yet is she mine for did i not pay to tummasook the goods of purchase  but i am well unworthy of her and she shall go from the igloo of her father to the igloo of moosu  can the moon shine in the sunshine  and further tummasook shall keep the goods of purchase and she be a free gift to moosu whom god hath ordained her rightful lord  and further yet because i have used my wealth unwisely and to oppress ye o my children do i make gifts of the kerosene can to moosu and the gooseneck and the gunbarrel and the copper kettle  therefore i can gather to me no more possessions and when ye are athirst for hooch he will quench ye and without robbery  for he is a great man and god speaketh through his lips  and yet further my heart is softened and i have repented me of my madness  i who am a fool and a son of fools i who am the slave of the bad god bizenass i who see thy empty bellies and knew not wherewith to fill themwhy shall i be chief and sit above thee and rule to thine own destruction  why should i do this which is not good  but moosu who is shaman and who is wise above men is so made that he can rule with a soft hand and justly  and because of the things i have related do i make abdication and give my chiefship to moosu who alone knoweth how ye may be fed in this day when there be no meat in the land  at this there was a great clapping of hands and the people cried kloshe  kloshe which means good  i had seen the wonderworry in moosus eyes for he could not understand and was fearful of my white mans wisdom  i had met his wishes all along the line and even anticipated some and standing there selfshorn of all my power he knew the time did not favour to stir the people against me  before they could disperse i made announcement that while the still went to moosu whatever hooch i possessed went to the people  moosu tried to protest at this for never had we permitted more than a handful to be drunk at a time but they cried kloshe kloshe and made festival before my door  and while they waxed uproarious without as the liquor went to their heads i held council within with angeit and the faithful ones  i set them the tasks they were to do and put into their mouths the words they were to say  then i slipped away to a place back in the woods where i had two sleds well loaded with teams of dogs that were not overfed  spring was at hand you see and there was a crust to the snow so it was the best time to take the way south  moreover the tobacco was gone  there i waited for i had nothing to fear  did they bestir themselves on my trail their dogs were too fat and themselves too lean to overtake me also i deemed their bestirring would be of an order for which i had made due preparation  first came a faithful one running and after him another  o master the first cried breathless there be great confusion in the village and no man knoweth his own mind and they be of many minds  everybody hath drunken overmuch and some be stringing bows and some be quarrelling one with another  never was there such a trouble  and the second one and i did as thou biddest o master whispering shrewd words in thirsty ears and raising memories of the things that were of old time  the woman ipsukuk waileth her poverty and the wealth that no longer is hers  and tummasook thinketh himself once again chief and the people are hungry and rage up and down  and a third one and neewak hath overthrown the altars of moosu and maketh incantation before the timehonoured and ancient gods  and all the people remember the wealth that ran down their throats and which they possess no more  and first esanetuk who be sick tumtum fought with kluktu and there was much noise  and next being daughters of the one mother did they fight with tukeliketa  and after that did they three fall upon moosu like windsqualls from every hand till he ran forth from the igloo and the people mocked him  for a man who cannot command his womankind is a fool  then came angeit great trouble hath befallen moosu o master for i have whispered to advantage till the people came to moosu saying they were hungry and demanding the fulfilment of prophecy  and there was a loud shout of itlwillie itlwillie  meat  so he cried peace to his womenfolk who were overwrought with anger and with hooch and led the tribe even to thy meat caches  and he bade the men open them and be fed and lo the caches were empty  there was no meat  they stood without sound the people being frightened and in the silence i lifted my voice o moosu where is the meat  that there was meat we know  did we not hunt it and drag it in from the hunt  and it were a lie to say one man hath eaten it yet have we seen nor hide nor hair  where is the meat o moosu  thou hast the ear of god  where is the meat  and the people cried thou hast the ear of god  where is the meat and they put their heads together and were afraid  then i went among them speaking fearsomely of the unknown things of the dead that come and go like shadows and do evil deeds till they cried aloud in terror and gathered all together like little children afraid of the dark neewak made harangue laying this evil that had come upon them at the door of moosu  when he had done there was a furious commotion and they took spears in their hands and tusks of walrus and clubs and stones from the beach  but moosu ran away home and because he had not drunken of hooch they could not catch him and fell one over another and made haste slowly  even now they do howl without his igloo and his woman folk within and what of the noise he cannot make himself heard  o angeit thou hast done well i commanded  go now taking this empty sled and the lean dogs and ride fast to the igloo of moosu and before the people who are drunken are aware throw him quick upon the sled and bring him to me  i waited and gave good advice to the faithful ones till angeit returned moosu was on the sled and i saw by the fingermarks on his face that his womankind had done well by him  but he tumbled off and fell in the snow at my feet crying o master thou wilt forgive moosu thy servant for the wrong things he has done  thou art a great man  surely wilt thou forgive  call me brother moosucall me brother i chided lifting him to his feet with the toe of my moccasin  wilt thou evermore obey  yea master he whimpered evermore  then dispose thy body so across the sled i shifted the dogwhip to my right hand  and direct thy face downwards toward the snow  and make haste for we journey south this day  and when he was well fixed i laid the lash upon him reciting at every stroke the wrongs he had done me this for thy disobedience in generalwhack  and this for thy disobedience in particularwhack whack  and this for esanetuk  and this for thy souls welfare  and this for the grace of thy authority and this for kluktu  and this for thy rights godgiven  and this for thy fat firstlings  and this and this for thy incometax and thy loaves and fishes  and this for all thy disobedience  and this finally that thou mayest henceforth walk softly and with understanding  now cease thy sniffling and get up  gird on thy snowshoes and go to the fore and break trail for the dogs  chook  mushon  git  thomas stevens smiled quietly to himself as he lighted his fifth cigar and sent curling smokerings ceilingward  but how about the people of tattarat i asked  kind of rough wasnt it to leave them flat with famine  and he answered laughing between two smokerings were there not the fat dogs     the faith of men   tell you what well do well shake for it  that suits me said the second man turning as he spoke to the indian that was mending snowshoes in a corner of the cabin  here you billebedam take a run down to olesons cabin like a good fellow and tell him we want to borrow his dice box  this sudden request in the midst of a council on wages of men wood and grub surprised billebedam  besides it was early in the day and he had never known white men of the calibre of pentfield and hutchinson to dice and play till the days work was done  but his face was impassive as a yukon indians should be as he pulled on his mittens and went out the door  though eight oclock it was still dark outside and the cabin was lighted by a tallow candle thrust into an empty whisky bottle  it stood on the pineboard table in the middle of a disarray of dirty tin dishes tallow from innumerable candles had dripped down the long neck of the bottle and hardened into a miniature glacier  the small room which composed the entire cabin was as badly littered as the table while at one end against the wall were two bunks one above the other with the blankets turned down just as the two men had crawled out in the morning  lawrence pentfield and corry hutchinson were millionaires though they did not look it  there seemed nothing unusual about them while they would have passed muster as fair specimens of lumbermen in any michigan camp  but outside in the darkness where holes yawned in the ground were many men engaged in windlassing muck and gravel and gold from the bottoms of the holes where other men received fifteen dollars per day for scraping it from off the bedrock  each day thousands of dollars worth of gold were scraped from bedrock and windlassed to the surface and it all belonged to pentfield and hutchinson who took their rank among the richest kings of bonanza  pentfield broke the silence that followed on billebedams departure by heaping the dirty plates higher on the table and drumming a tattoo on the cleared space with his knuckles  hutchinson snuffed the smoky candle and reflectively rubbed the soot from the wick between thumb and forefinger  by jove i wish we could both go out he abruptly exclaimed  that would settle it all  pentfield looked at him darkly  if it werent for your cursed obstinacy itd be settled anyway  all you have to do is get up and go  ill look after things and next year i can go out  why should i go  ive no one waiting for me  your people pentfield broke in roughly  like you have hutchinson went on  a girl i mean and you know it  pentfield shrugged his shoulders gloomily  she can wait i guess  but shes been waiting two years now  and another wont age her beyond recognition  thatd be three years  think of it old man three years in this end of the earth this fallingoff place for the damned  hutchinson threw up his arm in an almost articulate groan  he was several years younger than his partner not more than twentysix and there was a certain wistfulness in his face that comes into the faces of men when they yearn vainly for the things they have been long denied this same wistfulness was in pentfields face and the groan of it was articulate in the heave of his shoulders  i dreamed last night i was in zinkands he said  the music playing glasses clinking voices humming women laughing and i was ordering eggsyes sir eggs fried and boiled and poached and scrambled and in all sorts of ways and downing them as fast as they arrived  id have ordered salads and green things hutchinson criticized hungrily with a big rare porterhouse and young onions and radishesthe kind your teeth sink into with a crunch  id have followed the eggs with them i guess if i hadnt awakened pentfield replied  he picked up a trailscarred banjo from the floor and began to strum a few wandering notes  hutchinson winced and breathed heavily  quit it he burst out with sudden fury as the other struck into a gaily lifting swing  it drives me mad  i cant stand it  pentfield tossed the banjo into a bunk and quoted     hear me babble what the weakest wont confess    i am memory and tormenti am town    i am all that ever went with evening dress  the other man winced where he sat and dropped his head forward on the table  pentfield resumed the monotonous drumming with his knuckles  a loud snap from the door attracted his attention  the frost was creeping up the inside in a white sheet and he began to hum     the flocks are folded boughs are bare    the salmon takes the sea    and oh my fair would i somewhere    might house my heart with thee  silence fell and was not again broken till billebedam arrived and threw the dice box on the table  um much cold he said  oleson um speak to me um say um yukon freeze last night  hear that old man pentfield cried slapping hutchinson on the shoulder  whoever wins can be hitting the trail for gods country this time tomorrow morning  he picked up the box briskly rattling the dice  whatll it be  straight poker dice hutchinson answered  go on and roll them out  pentfield swept the dishes from the table with a crash and rolled out the five dice  both looked tragedy  the shake was without a pair and five spot high  a stiff pentfield groaned  after much deliberating pentfield picked up all the five dice and put them in the box  id shake to the five if i were you hutchinson suggested  no you wouldnt not when you see this pentfield replied shaking out the dice  again they were without a pair running this time in unbroken sequence from two to six  a second stiff he groaned  no use your shaking corry  you cant lose  the other man gathered up the dice without a word rattled them rolled them out on the table with a flourish and saw that he had likewise shaken a sixhigh stiff  tied you anyway but ill have to do better than that he said gathering in four of them and shaking to the six  and heres what beats you  but they rolled out deuce tray four and fivea stiff still and no better nor worse than pentfields throw  hutchinson sighed  couldnt happen once in a million times said  nor in a million lives pentfield added catching up the dice and quickly throwing them out  three fives appeared and after much delay he was rewarded by a fourth five on the second shake  hutchinson seemed to have lost his last hope  but three sixes turned up on his first shake  a great doubt rose in the others eyes and hope returned into his  he had one more shake  another six and he would go over the ice to salt water and the states  he rattled the dice in the box made as though to cast them hesitated and continued rattle them  go on  go on  dont take all night about it pentfield cried sharply bending his nails on the table so tight was the clutch with which he strove to control himself  the dice rolled forth an upturned six meeting their eyes  both men sat staring at it  there was a long silence  hutchinson shot a covert glance at his partner who still more covertly caught it and pursed up his lips in an attempt to advertise his unconcern  hutchinson laughed as he got up on his feet  it was a nervous apprehensive laugh  it was a case where it was more awkward to win than lose  he walked over to his partner who whirled upon him fiercely  now you just shut up corry  i know all youre going to saythat youd rather stay in and let me go and all that so dont say it  youve your own people in detroit to see and thats enough  besides you can do for me the very thing i expected to do if i went out  and that is  pentfield read the full question in his partners eyes and answered  yes that very thing  you can bring her in to me  the only difference will be a dawson wedding instead of a san franciscan one  but man alike corry hutchinson objected how under the sun can i bring her in  were not exactly brother and sister seeing that i have not even met her and it wouldnt be just the proper thing you know for us to travel together  of course it would be all rightyou and i know that but think of the looks of it man  pentfield swore under his breath consigning the looks of it to a less frigid region than alaska  now if youll just listen and not get astride that high horse of yours so blamed quick his partner went on youll see that the only fair thing under the circumstances is for me to let you go out this year  next year is only a year away and then i can take my fling  pentfield shook his head though visibly swayed by the temptation  it wont do corry old man  i appreciate your kindness and all that but it wont do  id be ashamed every time i thought of you slaving away in here in my place  a thought seemed suddenly to strike him  burrowing into his bunk and disrupting it in his eagerness he secured a writingpad and pencil and sitting down at the table began to write with swiftness and certitude  here he said thrusting the scrawled letter into his partners hand you just deliver that and everythingll be all right  hutchinson ran his eye over it and laid it down  how do you know the brother will be willing to make that beastly trip in here he demanded  oh hell do it for meand for his sister pentfield replied  you see hes tenderfoot and i wouldnt trust her with him alone  but with you along it will be an easy trip and a safe one  as soon as you get out youll go to her and prepare her  then you can take your run east to your own people and in the spring she and her brotherll be ready to start with you  youll like her i know right from the jump and from that youll know her as soon as you lay eyes on her  so saying he opened the back of his watch and exposed a girls photograph pasted on the inside of the case  corry hutchinson gazed at it with admiration welling up in his eyes  mabel is her name pentfield went on  and its just as well you should know how to find the house  soon as you strike frisco take a cab and just say holmess place myrdon avenuei doubt if the myrdon avenue is necessary  the cabbyll know where judge holmes lives  and say pentfield continued after a pause it wont be a bad idea for you to get me a few little things which aer  a married man should have in his business hutchinson blurted out with a grin  pentfield grinned back  sure napkins and tablecloths and sheets and pillowslips and such things  and you might get a good set of china  you know itll come hard for her to settle down to this sort of thing  you can freight them in by steamer around by bering sea  and i say whats the matter with a piano  hutchinson seconded the idea heartily  his reluctance had vanished and he was warming up to his mission  by jove  lawrence he said at the conclusion of the council as they both rose to their feet ill bring back that girl of yours in style ill do the cooking and take care of the dogs and all that brotherll have to do will be to see to her comfort and do for her whatever ive forgotten  and ill forget damn little i can tell you  the next day lawrence pentfield shook hands with him for the last time and watched him running with his dogs disappear up the frozen yukon on his way to salt water and the world  pentfield went back to his bonanza mine which was many times more dreary than before and faced resolutely into the long winter  there was work to be done men to superintend and operations to direct in burrowing after the erratic pay streak but his heart was not in the work  nor was his heart in any work till the tiered logs of a new cabin began to rise on the hill behind the mine  it was a grand cabin warmly built and divided into three comfortable rooms  each log was handhewed and squaredan expensive whim when the axemen received a daily wage of fifteen dollars but to him nothing could be too costly for the home in which mabel holmes was to live  so he went about with the building of the cabin singing and oh my fair would i somewhere might house my heart with thee  also he had a calendar pinned on the wall above the table and his first act each morning was to check off the day and to count the days that were left ere his partner would come booming down the yukon ice in the spring  another whim of his was to permit no one to sleep in the new cabin on the hill it must be as fresh for her occupancy as the squarehewed wood was fresh and when it stood complete he put a padlock on the door  no one entered save himself and he was wont to spend long hours there and to come forth with his face strangely radiant and in his eyes a glad warm light  in december he received a letter from corry hutchinson  he had just seen mabel holmes  she was all she ought to be to be lawrence pentfields wife he wrote  he was enthusiastic and his letter sent the blood tingling through pentfields veins  other letters followed one on the heels of another and sometimes two or three together when the mail lumped up  and they were all in the same tenor  corry had just come from myrdon avenue corry was just going to myrdon avenue or corry was at myrdon avenue  and he lingered on and on in san francisco nor even mentioned his trip to detroit  lawrence pentfield began to think that his partner was a great deal in the company of mabel holmes for a fellow who was going east to see his people  he even caught himself worrying about it at times though he would have worried more had he not known mabel and corry so well  mabels letters on the other hand had a great deal to say about corry  also a thread of timidity that was near to disinclination ran through them concerning the trip in over the ice and the dawson marriage  pentfield wrote back heartily laughing at her fears which he took to be the mere physical ones of danger and hardship rather than those bred of maidenly reserve  but the long winter and tedious wait following upon the two previous long winters were telling upon him  the superintendence of the men and the pursuit of the pay streak could not break the irk of the daily round and the end of january found him making occasional trips to dawson where he could forget his identity for a space at the gambling tables  because he could afford to lose he won and pentfields luck became a stock phrase among the faro players  his luck ran with him till the second week in february  how much farther it might have run is conjectural for after one big game he never played again  it was in the opera house that it occurred and for an hour it had seemed that he could not place his money on a card without making the card a winner  in the lull at the end of a deal while the gamekeeper was shuffling the deck nick inwood the owner of the game remarked apropos of nothing  i say pentfield i see that partner of yours has been cutting up monkey shines on the outside  trust corry to have a good time pentfield had answered especially when he has earned it  every man to his taste nick inwood laughed but i should scarcely call getting married a good time  corry married pentfield cried incredulous and yet surprised out of himself for the moment  sure inwood said  i saw it in the frisco paper that came in over the ice this morning  well and whos the girl pentfield demanded somewhat with the air of patient fortitude with which one takes the bait of a catch and is aware at the time of the large laugh bound to follow at his expense  nick inwood pulled the newspaper from his pocket and began looking it over saying  i havent a remarkable memory for names but it seems to me its something like mabelmabeloh yes here itmabel holmes daughter of judge holmeswhoever he is  lawrence pentfield never turned a hair though he wondered how any man in the north could know her name  he glanced coolly from face to face to note any vagrant signs of the game that was being played upon him but beyond a healthy curiosity the faces betrayed nothing  then he turned to the gambler and said in cold even tones  inwood ive got an even five hundred here that says the print of what you have just said is not in that paper  the gambler looked at him in quizzical surprise  go way child  i dont want your money  i thought so pentfield sneered returning to the game and laying a couple of bets  nick inwoods face flushed and as though doubting his senses he ran careful eyes over the print of a quarter of a column  then be turned on lawrence pentfield  look here pentfield he said in a quiet nervous manner i cant allow that you know  allow what pentfield demanded brutally  you implied that i lied  nothing of the sort came the reply  i merely implied that you were trying to be clumsily witty  make your bets gentlemen the dealer protested  but i tell you its true nick inwood insisted  and i have told you ive five hundred that says its not in that paper pentfield answered at the same time throwing a heavy sack of dust on the table  i am sorry to take your money was the retort as inwood thrust the newspaper into pentfields hand  pentfield saw though he could not quite bring himself to believe glancing through the headline young lochinvar came out of the north and skimming the article until the names of mabel holmes and corry hutchinson coupled together leaped squarely before his eyes he turned to the top of the page  it was a san francisco paper  the moneys yours inwood he remarked with a short laugh  theres no telling what that partner of mine will do when he gets started  then he returned to the article and read it word for word very slowly and very carefully  he could no longer doubt  beyond dispute corry hutchinson had married mabel holmes  one of the bonanza kings it described him a partner with lawrence pentfield whom san francisco society has not yet forgotten and interested with that gentleman in other rich klondike properties  further and at the end he read it is whispered that mr and mrs hutchinson will after a brief trip east to detroit make their real honeymoon journey into the fascinating klondike country  ill be back again keep my place for me pentfield said rising to his feet and taking his sack which meantime had hit the blower and came back lighter by five hundred dollars  he went down the street and bought a seattle paper  it contained the same facts though somewhat condensed  corry and mabel were indubitably married  pentfield returned to the opera house and resumed his seat in the game  he asked to have the limit removed  trying to get action nick inwood laughed as he nodded assent to the dealer  i was going down to the a c store but now i guess ill stay and watch you do your worst  this lawrence pentfield did at the end of two hours plunging when the dealer bit the end off a fresh cigar and struck a match as he announced that the bank was broken  pentfield cashed in for forty thousand shook hands with nick inwood and stated that it was the last time he would ever play at his game or at anybodys elses  no one knew nor guessed that he had been hit much less hit hard  there was no apparent change in his manner  for a week he went about his work much as he had always done when he read an account of the marriage in a portland paper  then he called in a friend to take charge of his mine and departed up the yukon behind his dogs  he held to the salt water trail till white river was reached into which he turned  five days later he came upon a hunting camp of the white river indians  in the evening there was a feast and he sat in honour beside the chief and next morning he headed his dogs back toward the yukon  but he no longer travelled alone  a young squaw fed his dogs for him that night and helped to pitch camp  she had been mauled by a bear in her childhood and suffered from a slight limp  her name was lashka and she was diffident at first with the strange white man that had come out of the unknown married her with scarcely a look or word and now was carrying her back with him into the unknown  but lashkas was better fortune than falls to most indian girls that mate with white men in the northland  no sooner was dawson reached than the barbaric marriage that had joined them was resolemnized in the white mans fashion before a priest  from dawson which to her was all a marvel and a dream she was taken directly to the bonanza claim and installed in the squarehewed cabin on the hill  the nine days wonder that followed arose not so much out of the fact of the squaw whom lawrence pentfield had taken to bed and board as out of the ceremony that had legalized the tie  the properly sanctioned marriage was the one thing that passed the communitys comprehension  but no one bothered pentfield about it  so long as a mans vagaries did no special hurt to the community the community let the man alone nor was pentfield barred from the cabins of men who possessed white wives  the marriage ceremony removed him from the status of squawman and placed him beyond moral reproach though there were men that challenged his taste where women were concerned  no more letters arrived from the outside  six sledloads of mails had been lost at the big salmon  besides pentfield knew that corry and his bride must by that time have started in over the trail  they were even then on their honeymoon tripthe honeymoon trip he had dreamed of for himself through two dreary years  his lip curled with bitterness at the thought but beyond being kinder to lashka he gave no sign  march had passed and april was nearing its end when one spring morning lashka asked permission to go down the creek several miles to siwash petes cabin  petes wife a stewart river woman had sent up word that something was wrong with her baby and lashka who was preeminently a motherwoman and who held herself to be truly wise in the matter of infantile troubles missed no opportunity of nursing the children of other women as yet more fortunate than she  pentfield harnessed his dogs and with lashka behind took the trail down the creek bed of bonanza  spring was in the air  the sharpness had gone out of the bite of the frost and though snow still covered the land the murmur and trickling of water told that the iron grip of winter was relaxing  the bottom was dropping out of the trail and here and there a new trail had been broken around open holes  at such a place where there was not room for two sleds to pass pentfield heard the jingle of approaching bells and stopped his dogs  a team of tiredlooking dogs appeared around the narrow bend followed by a heavilyloaded sled  at the geepole was a man who steered in a manner familiar to pentfield and behind the sled walked two women  his glance returned to the man at the geepole  it was corry  pentfield got on his feet and waited  he was glad that lashka was with him  the meeting could not have come about better had it been planned he thought  and as he waited he wondered what they would say what they would be able to say  as for himself there was no need to say anything  the explaining was all on their side and he was ready to listen to them  as they drew in abreast corry recognized him and halted the dogs  with a hello old man he held out his hand  pentfield shook it but without warmth or speech  by this time the two women had come up and he noticed that the second one was dora holmes  he doffed his fur cap the flaps of which were flying shook hands with her and turned toward mabel  she swayed forward splendid and radiant but faltered before his outstretched hand  he had intended to say how do you do mrs hutchinsonbut somehow the mrs hutchinson had choked him and all he had managed to articulate was the how do you do  there was all the constraint and awkwardness in the situation he could have wished  mabel betrayed the agitation appropriate to her position while dora evidently brought along as some sort of peacemaker was saying  why what is the matter lawrence  before he could answer corry plucked him by the sleeve and drew him aside  see here old man whats this mean corry demanded in a low tone indicating lashka with his eyes  i can hardly see corry where you can have any concern in the matter pentfield answered mockingly  but corry drove straight to the point  what is that squaw doing on your sled  a nasty job youve given me to explain all this away  i only hope it can be explained away  who is she  whose squaw is she  then lawrence pentfield delivered his stroke and he delivered it with a certain calm elation of spirit that seemed somewhat to compensate for the wrong that had been done him  she is my squaw he said mrs pentfield if you please  corry hutchinson gasped and pentfield left him and returned to the two women  mabel with a worried expression on her face seemed holding herself aloof  he turned to dora and asked quite genially as though all the world was sunshine how did you stand the trip anyway  have any trouble to sleep warm  and how did mrs hutchinson stand it he asked next his eyes on mabel  oh you dear ninny dora cried throwing her arms around him and hugging him  then you saw it too  i thought something was the matter you were acting so strangely  ii hardly understand he stammered  it was corrected in next days paper dora chattered on  we did not dream you would see it  all the other papers had it correctly and of course that one miserable paper was the very one you saw  wait a moment  what do you mean pentfield demanded a sudden fear at his heart for he felt himself on the verge of a great gulf  but dora swept volubly on  why when it became known that mabel and i were going to klondike every other week said that when we were gone it would be lovely on myrdon avenue meaning of course lonely  then  i am mrs hutchinson dora answered  and you thought it was mabel all the time  precisely the way of it pentfield replied slowly  but i can see now the reporter got the names mixed  the seattle and portland paper copied  he stood silently for a minute  mabels face was turned toward him again and he could see the glow of expectancy in it  corry was deeply interested in the ragged toe of one of his moccasins while dora was stealing sidelong glances at the immobile face of lashka sitting on the sled  lawrence pentfield stared straight out before him into a dreary future through the grey vistas of which he saw himself riding on a sled behind running dogs with lame lashka by his side  then he spoke quite simply looking mabel in the eyes  i am very sorry  i did not dream it  i thought you had married corry that is mrs pentfield sitting on the sled over there  mabel holmes turned weakly toward her sister as though all the fatigue of her great journey had suddenly descended on her  dora caught her around the waist  corry hutchinson was still occupied with his moccasins  pentfield glanced quickly from face to face then turned to his sled  cant stop here all day with petes baby waiting he said to lashka  the long whiplash hissed out the dogs sprang against the breast bands and the sled lurched and jerked ahead  oh i say corry pentfield called back youd better occupy the old cabin  its not been used for some time  ive built a new one on the hill     too much gold   this being a storyand a truer one than it may appearof a mining country it is quite to be expected that it will be a hardluck story but that depends on the point of view  hard luck is a mild way of terming it so far as kink mitchell and hootchinoo bill are concerned and that they have a decided opinion on the subject is a matter of common knowledge in the yukon country  it was in the fall of 1896 that the two partners came down to the east bank of the yukon and drew a peterborough canoe from a mosscovered cache  they were not particularly pleasantlooking objects  a summers prospecting filled to repletion with hardship and rather empty of grub had left their clothes in tatters and themselves worn and cadaverous  a nimbus of mosquitoes buzzed about each mans head  their faces were coated with blue clay  each carried a lump of this damp clay and whenever it dried and fell from their faces more was daubed on in its place  there was a querulous plaint in their voices an irritability of movement and gesture that told of broken sleep and a losing struggle with the little winged pests  them skeetersll be the death of me yet kink mitchell whimpered as the canoe felt the current on her nose and leaped out from the bank  cheer up cheer up  were about done hootchinoo bill answered with an attempted heartiness in his funereal tones that was ghastly  well be in forty mile in forty minutes and thencursed little devil  one hand left his paddle and landed on the back of his neck with a sharp slap  he put a fresh daub of clay on the injured part swearing sulphurously the while  kink mitchell was not in the least amused  he merely improved the opportunity by putting a thicker coating of clay on his own neck  they crossed the yukon to its west bank shot downstream with easy stroke and at the end of forty minutes swung in close to the left around the tail of an island  forty mile spread itself suddenly before them both men straightened their backs and gazed at the sight  they gazed long and carefully drifting with the current in their faces an expression of mingled surprise and consternation slowly gathering  not a thread of smoke was rising from the hundreds of logcabins  there was no sound of axes biting sharply into wood of hammering and sawing  neither dogs nor men loitered before the big store  no steamboats lay at the bank no canoes nor scows nor polingboats  the river was as bare of craft as the town was of life  kind of looks like gabriels tooted his little horn and you an me has turned up missing remarked hootchinoo bill  his remark was casual as though there was nothing unusual about the occurrence  kink mitchells reply was just as casual as though he too were unaware of any strange perturbation of spirit  looks as they was all baptists then and took the boats to go by water was his contribution  my ol dad was a baptist hootchinoo bill supplemented  an he always did hold it was forty thousand miles nearer that way  this was the end of their levity  they ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank  a feeling of awe descended upon them as they walked the deserted streets  the sunlight streamed placidly over the town  a gentle wind tapped the halyards against the flagpole before the closed doors of the caledonia dance hall  mosquitoes buzzed robins sang and moose birds tripped hungrily among the cabins but there was no human life nor sign of human life  im just dyin for a drink hootchinoo bill said and unconsciously his voice sank to a hoarse whisper  his partner nodded his head loth to hear his own voice break the stillness  they trudged on in uneasy silence till surprised by an open door  above this door and stretching the width of the building a rude sign announced the same as the monte carlo  but beside the door hat over eyes chair tilted back a man sat sunning himself  he was an old man  beard and hair were long and white and patriarchal  if it aint ol jim cummings turned up like us too late for resurrection said kink mitchell  most like he didnt hear gabriel tootin was hootchinoo bills suggestion  hello jim  wake up he shouted  the old man unlimbered lamely blinking his eyes and murmuring automatically whatll ye have gents  whatll ye have  they followed him inside and ranged up against the long bar where of yore a halfdozen nimble barkeepers found little time to loaf  the great room ordinarily aroar with life was still and gloomy as a tomb  there was no rattling of chips no whirring of ivory balls  roulette and faro tables were like gravestones under their canvas covers  no womens voices drifted merrily from the danceroom behind  ol jim cummings wiped a glass with palsied hands and kink mitchell scrawled his initials on the dustcovered bar  wheres the girls hootchinoo bill shouted with affected geniality  gone was the ancient barkeepers reply in a voice thin and aged as himself and as unsteady as his hand  wheres bidwell and barlow  gone  and sweetwater charley  gone  and his sister  gone too  your daughter sally then and her little kid  gone all gone  the old man shook his head sadly rummaging in an absent way among the dusty bottles  great sardanapolis  where kink mitchell exploded unable longer to restrain himself  you dont say youve had the plague  why aint you heerd  the old man chuckled quietly  theyalls gone to dawson  whatlike is that bill demanded  a creek or a bar or a place  aint never heered of dawson eh  the old man chuckled exasperatingly why dawsons a town a city biggern forty mile  yes sir biggern forty mile  ive ben

has  now just whereabouts is this dawsonplace you was amentionin  on the big flat jest below the mouth of klondike ol jim answered but where has youall ben this summer  never you mind where wealls ben

said bill  but speakin of this dawsonplace how like did it happen to be jim  ounce to the pan on a creek called bonanza an they aint got to bedrock yet  who struck it  carmack  at mention of the discoverers name the partners stared at each other disgustedly  then they winked with great solemnity  siwash george sniffed hootchinoo bill  that squawman sneered kink mitchell  i wouldnt put on my moccasins to stampede after anything hed ever find said bill  same here announced his partner  a cuss thats too plumb lazy to fish his own salmon  thats why he took up with the indians  spose that black brotherinlaw of hislemme see skookum jim ehspose hes in on it  the old barkeeper nodded  sure an whats more all forty mile exceptin me an a few cripples  and drunks added kink mitchell  nosiree the old man shouted emphatically  i bet you the drinks honkins aint in on it hootchinoo bill cried with certitude  ol jims face lighted up  i takes you bill an you loses  however did that ol soak budge out of forty mile mitchell demanded  the ties him down an throws him in the bottom of a polinboat ol jim explained  come right in here they did an takes him out of that there chair there in the corner an three more drunks they finds under the pianny  i tell youalls the whole camp hits up the yukon for dawson jes like sam scratch was after themwimmen children babes in arms the whole shebang  bidwell comes to me an sez sez he jim i wants you to keep tab on the monte carlo  im goin  wheres barlow sez i  gone sez he an im afollowin with a load of whisky  an with that never waitin for me to decline he makes a run for his boat an away he goes polin up river like mad  so here i be an these is the first drinks ive passed out in three days  the partners looked at each other  gosh darn my buttoms said hootchinoo bill  seems likes you and me kink is the kind of folks always caught out with forks when it rains soup  wouldnt it take the saleratus out your dough now said kink mitchell a stampede of tinhorns drunks an loafers  an squawmen added bill  not a genooine miner in the whole caboodle  genooine miners like you an me kink he went on academically is all out an sweatin hard over birch creek way  not a genooine miner in this whole crazy dawson outfit and i say right here not a step do i budge for any carmack strike  ive got to see the colour of the dust first  same here mitchell agreed  lets have another drink  having wet this resolution they beached the canoe transferred its contents to their cabin and cooked dinner  but as the afternoon wore along they grew restive  they were men used to the silence of the great wilderness but this gravelike silence of a town worried them  they caught themselves listening for familiar soundswaitin for something to make a noise which aint goin to make a noise as bill put it  they strolled through the deserted streets to the monte carlo for more drinks and wandered along the river bank to the steamer landing where only water gurgled as the eddy filled and emptied and an occasional salmon leapt flashing into the sun  they sat down in the shade in front of the store and talked with the consumptive storekeeper whose liability to hemorrhage accounted for his presence  bill and kink told him how they intended loafing in their cabin and resting up after the hard summers work  they told him with a certain insistence that was half appeal for belief half challenge for contradiction how much they were going to enjoy their idleness  but the storekeeper was uninterested  he switched the conversation back to the strike on klondike and they could not keep him away from it  he could think of nothing else talk of nothing else till hootchinoo bill rose up in anger and disgust  gosh darn dawson say i he cried  same here said kink mitchell with a brightening face  oned think something was doin up there stead of bein a mere stampede of greenhorns an tinhorns  but a boat came into view from downstream  it was long and slim  it hugged the bank closely and its three occupants standing upright propelled it against the stiff current by means of long poles  circle city outfit said the storekeeper  i was lookin for em along by afternoon  forty mile had the start of them by a hundred and seventy miles  but gee they aint losin any time  well just sit here quietlike and watch em string by bill said complacently  as he spoke another boat appeared in sight followed after a brief interval by two others  by this time the first boat was abreast of the men on the bank  its occupants did not cease poling while greetings were exchanged and though its progress was slow a halfhour saw it out of sight up river  still they came from below boat after boat in endless procession  the uneasiness of bill and kink increased  they stole speculative tentative glances at each other and when their eyes met looked away in embarrassment  finally however their eyes met and neither looked away  kink opened his mouth to speak but words failed him and his mouth remained open while he continued to gaze at his partner  just what i was thinken kink said bill  they grinned sheepishly at each other and by tacit consent started to walk away  their pace quickened and by the time they arrived at their cabin they were on the run  cant lose no time with all that multitude arushin by kink spluttered as he jabbed the sourdough can into the beanpot with one hand and with the other gathered in the fryingpan and coffeepot  should say not gasped bill his head and shoulders buried in a clothes sack wherein were stored winter socks and underwear  i say kink dont forget the saleratus on the corner shelf back of the stove  halfanhour later they were launching the canoe and loading up while the storekeeper made jocular remarks about poor weak mortals and the contagiousness of stampedin fever  but when bill and kink thrust their long poles to bottom and started the canoe against the current he called after them  well solong and good luck  and dont forget to blaze a stake or two for me  they nodded their heads vigorously and felt sorry for the poor wretch who remained perforce behind        kink and bill were sweating hard  according to the revised northland scripture the stampede is to the swift the blazing of stakes to the strong and the crown in royalties gathers to itself the fulness thereof  kink and bill were both swift and strong  they took the soggy trail at a long swinging gait that broke the hearts of a couple of tenderfeet who tried to keep up with them  behind strung out between them and dawson where the boats were discarded and land travel began was the vanguard of the circle city outfit  in the race from forty mile the partners had passed every boat winning from the leading boat by a length in the dawson eddy and leaving its occupants sadly behind the moment their feet struck the trail  huh couldnt see us for smoke hootchinoo bill chuckled flirting the stinging sweat from his brow and glancing swiftly back along the way they had come  three men emerged from where the trail broke through the trees  two followed close at their heels and then a man and a woman shot into view  come on you kink  hit her up  hit her up  bill quickened his pace  mitchell glanced back in more leisurely fashion  i declare if they aint lopin  and heres one thats loped himself out said bill pointing to the side of the trail  a man was lying on his back panting in the culminating stages of violent exhaustion  his face was ghastly his eyes bloodshot and glazed for all the world like a dying man  chechaquo kink mitchell grunted and it was the grunt of the old sour dough for the greenhorn for the man who outfitted with self risin flour and used bakingpowder in his biscuits  the partners true to the oldtimer custom had intended to stake down stream from the strike but when they saw claim 81 below blazed on a treewhich meant fully eight miles below discoverythey changed their minds  the eight miles were covered in less than two hours  it was a killing pace over so rough trail and they passed scores of exhausted men that had fallen by the wayside  at discovery little was to be learned of the upper creek  cormacks indian brotherinlaw skookum jim had a hazy notion that the creek was staked as high as the 30s but when kink and bill looked at the corner stakes of 79 above they threw their stampeding packs off their backs and sat down to smoke  all their efforts had been vain  bonanza was staked from mouth to sourceout of sight and across the next divide  bill complained that night as they fried their bacon and boiled their coffee over cormacks fire at discovery  try that pup carmack suggested next morning  that pup was a broad creek that flowed into bonanza at 7 above  the partners received his advice with the magnificent contempt of the sour dough for a squawman and instead spent the day on adams creek another and more likelylooking tributary of bonanza  but it was the old story over againstaked to the skyline  for threes days carmack repeated his advice and for three days they received it contemptuously  but on the fourth day there being nowhere else to go they went up that pup  they knew that it was practically unstaked but they had no intention of staking  the trip was made more for the purpose of giving vent to their illhumour than for anything else  they had become quite cynical sceptical  they jeered and scoffed at everything and insulted every chechaquo they met along the way  at no 23 the stakes ceased  the remainder of the creek was open for location  moose pasture sneered kink mitchell  but bill gravely paced off five hundred feet up the creek and blazed the cornerstakes  he had picked up the bottom of a candlebox and on the smooth side he wrote the notice for his centrestake     this moose pasture is reserved for the    swedes and chechaquos    bill rader  kink read it over with approval saying  as thems my sentiments i reckon i might as well subscribe  so the name of charles mitchell was added to the notice and many an old sour doughs face relaxed that day at sight of the handiwork of a kindred spirit  hows the pup carmack inquired when they strolled back into camp  to hell with pups was hootchinoo bills reply  me and kinks goin a lookin for too much gold when we get rested up  too much gold was the fabled creek of which all sour doughs dreamed whereof it was said the gold was so thick that in order to wash it gravel must first be shovelled into the sluiceboxes  but the several days rest preliminary to the quest for too much gold brought a slight change in their plan inasmuch as it brought one ans handerson a swede  ans handerson had been working for wages all summer at miller creek over on the sixty mile and the summer done had strayed up bonanza like many another waif helplessly adrift on the gold tides that swept willynilly across the land  he was tall and lanky  his arms were long like prehistoric mans and his hands were like soupplates twisted and gnarled and bigknuckled from toil  he was slow of utterance and movement and his eyes pale blue as his hair was pale yellow seemed filled with an immortal dreaming the stuff of which no man knew and himself least of all  perhaps this appearance of immortal dreaming was due to a supreme and vacuous innocence  at any rate this was the valuation men of ordinary clay put upon him and there was nothing extraordinary about the composition of hootchinoo bill and kink mitchell  the partners had spent a day of visiting and gossip and in the evening met in the temporary quarters of the monte carloa large tent were stampeders rested their weary bones and bad whisky sold at a dollar a drink  since the only money in circulation was dust and since the house took the downweight on the scales a drink cost something more than a dollar  bill and kink were not drinking principally for the reason that their one and common sack was not strong enough to stand many excursions to the scales  say bill ive got a chechaquo on the string for a sack of flour mitchell announced jubilantly  bill looked interested and pleased  grub as scarce and they were not overplentifully supplied for the quest after too much gold  flours worth a dollar a pound he answered  how like do you calculate to get your finger on it  trade m a halfinterest in that claim of ourn kink answered  what claim bill was surprised  then he remembered the reservation he had staked off for the swedes and said oh  i wouldnt be so clost about it though he added  give m the whole thing while youre about it in a right freehanded way  bill shook his head  if i did hed get clean scairt and prance off im lettin on as how the ground is believed to be valuable an that were lettin go half just because were monstrous short on grub  after the dicker we can make him a present of the whole shebang  if somebody aint disregarded our notice bill objected though he was plainly pleased at the prospect of exchanging the claim for a sack of flour  she aint jumped kink assured him  its no 24 and it stands  the chechaquos took it serious and they begun stakin where you left off staked clean over the divide too  i was gassin with one of them which has just got in with cramps in his legs  it was then and for the first time that they heard the slow and groping utterance of ans handerson  ay like the looks he was saying to the barkeeper  ay tank ay gat a claim  the partners winked at each other and a few minutes later a surprised and grateful swede was drinking bad whisky with two hardhearted strangers  but he was as hardheaded as they were hardhearted  the sack made frequent journeys to the scales followed solicitously each time by kink mitchells eyes and still ans handerson did not loosen up in his pale blue eyes as in summer seas immortal dreams swam up and burned but the swimming and the burning were due to the tales of gold and prospect pans he heard rather than to the whisky he slid so easily down his throat  the partners were in despair though they appeared boisterous and jovial of speech and action  dont mind me my friend hootchinoo bill hiccoughed his hand upon ans handersons shoulder  have another drink  were just celebratin kinks birthday here  this is my pardner kink kink mitchell  an what might your name be  this learned his hand descended resoundingly on kinks back and kink simulated clumsy selfconsciousness in that he was for the time being the centre of the rejoicing while ans handerson looked pleased and asked them to have a drink with him  it was the first and last time he treated until the play changed and his canny soul was roused to unwonted prodigality  but he paid for the liquor from a fairly healthylooking sack  not less n eight hundred in it calculated the lynxeyed kink and on the strength of it he took the first opportunity of a privy conversation with bidwell proprietor of the bad whisky and the tent  heres my sack bidwell kink said with the intimacy and surety of one oldtimer to another  just weigh fifty dollars into it for a day or so more or less and well be yours truly bill an me  thereafter the journeys of the sack to the scales were more frequent and the celebration of kinks natal day waxed hilarious  he even essayed to sing the oldtimers classic the juice of the forbidden fruit but broke down and drowned his embarrassment in another round of drinks  even bidwell honoured him with a round or two on the house and he and bill were decently drunk by the time ans handersons eyelids began to droop and his tongue gave promise of loosening  bill grew affectionate then confidential  he told his troubles and hard luck to the barkeeper and the world in general and to ans handerson in particular  he required no histrionic powers to act the part  the bad whisky attended to that  he worked himself into a great sorrow for himself and bill and his tears were sincere when he told how he and his partner were thinking of selling a halfinterest in good ground just because they were short of grub  even kink listened and believed  ans handersons eyes were shining unholily as he asked how much you tank you take  bill and kink did not hear him and he was compelled to repeat his query they appeared reluctant  he grew keener  and he swayed back and forward holding on to the bar and listened with all his ears while they conferred together on one side and wrangled as to whether they should or not and disagreed in stage whispers over the price they should set  two hundred andhicfifty bill finally announced but we reckon as we wont sell  which is monstrous wise if i might chip in my little say seconded bidwell  yes indeedy added kink  we aint in no charity business adisgorgin free an generous to swedes an white men  ay tank we haf another drink hiccoughed ans handerson craftily changing the subject against a more propitious time  and thereafter to bring about that propitious time his own sack began to seesaw between his hip pocket and the scales  bill and kink were coy but they finally yielded to his blandishments  whereupon he grew shy and drew bidwell to one side  he staggered exceedingly and held on to bidwell for support as he asked  they ban all right them men you tank so  sure bidwell answered heartily  known em for years  old sour doughs  when they sell a claim they sell a claim  they aint no air dealers  ay tank ay buy ans handerson announced tottering back to the two men  but by now he was dreaming deeply and he proclaimed he would have the whole claim or nothing  this was the cause of great pain to hootchinoo bill  he orated grandly against the hawgishness of chechaquos and swedes albeit he dozed between periods his voice dying away to a gurgle and his head sinking forward on his breast  but whenever roused by a nudge from kink or bidwell he never failed to explode another volley of abuse and insult  ans handerson was calm under it all  each insult added to the value of the claim  such unamiable reluctance to sell advertised but one thing to him and he was aware of a great relief when hootchinoo bill sank snoring to the floor and he was free to turn his attention to his less intractable partner  kink mitchell was persuadable though a poor mathematician  he wept dolefully but was willing to sell a halfinterest for two hundred and fifty dollars or the whole claim for seven hundred and fifty  ans handerson and bidwell laboured to clear away his erroneous ideas concerning fractions but their labour was vain  he spilled tears and regrets all over the bar and on their shoulders which tears however did not wash away his opinion that if one half was worth two hundred and fifty two halves were worth three times as much  in the endand even bidwell retained no more than hazy recollections of how the night terminateda bill of sale was drawn up wherein bill rader and charles mitchell yielded up all right and title to the claim known as 24 eldorado the same being the name the creek had received from some optimistic chechaquo  when kink had signed it took the united efforts of the three to arouse bill  pen in hand he swayed long over the document and each time he rocked back and forth in ans handersons eyes flashed and faded a wondrous golden vision  when the precious signature was at last appended and the dust paid over he breathed a great sigh and sank to sleep under a table where he dreamed immortally until morning  but the day was chill and grey  he felt bad  his first act unconscious and automatic was to feel for his sack  its lightness startled him then slowly memories of the night thronged into his brain  rough voices disturbed him  he opened his eyes and peered out from under the table  a couple of early risers or rather men who had been out on trail all night were vociferating their opinions concerning the utter and loathsome worthlessness of eldorado creek  he grew frightened felt in his pocket and found the deed to 24 eldorado  ten minutes later hootchinoo bill and kink mitchell were roused from their blankets by a wildeyed swede that strove to force upon them an ink scrawled and very blotty piece of paper  ay tank ay take my money back he gibbered  ay tank ay take my money back  tears were in his eyes and throat  they ran down his cheeks as he knelt before them and pleaded and implored  but bill and kink did not laugh they might have been harder hearted  first time i ever hear a man squeal over a minin deal bill said  an i make free to say tis too onusual for me to savvy  same here kink mitchell remarked  minin deals is like horsetradin  they were honest in their wonderment  they could not conceive of themselves raising a wail over a business transaction so they could not understand it in another man  the poor ornery chechaquo murmured hootchinoo bill as they watched the sorrowing swede disappear up the trail  but this aint too much gold kink mitchell said cheerfully  and ere the day was out they purchased flour and bacon at exorbitant prices with ans handersons dust and crossed over the divide in the direction of the creeks that lie between klondike and indian river  three months later they came back over the divide in the midst of a snow storm and dropped down the trail to 24 eldorado  it merely chanced that the trail led them that way  they were not looking for the claim  nor could they see much through the driving white till they set foot upon the claim itself  and then the air lightened and they beheld a dump capped by a windlass that a man was turning  they saw him draw a bucket of gravel from the hole and tilt it on the edge of the dump  likewise they saw another man strangely familiar filling a pan with the fresh gravel  his hands were large his hair wets pale yellow  but before they reached him he turned with the pan and fled toward a cabin  he wore no hat and the snow falling down his neck accounted for his haste bill and kink ran after him and came upon him in the cabin kneeling by the stove and washing the pan of gravel in a tub of water  he was too deeply engaged to notice more than that somebody had entered the cabin  they stood at his shoulder and looked on  he imparted to the pan a deft circular motion pausing once or twice to rake out the larger particles of gravel with his fingers  the water was muddy and with the pan buried in it they could see nothing of its contents  suddenly he lifted the pan clear and sent the water out of it with a flirt  a mass of yellow like butter in a churn showed across the bottom  hootchinoo bill swallowed  never in his life had he dreamed of so rich a testpan  kind of thick my friend he said huskily  how much might you reckon thatall to be  ans handerson did not look up as he replied ay tank fafty ounces  you must be scrumptious rich then eh  still ans handerson kept his head down absorbed in putting in the fine touches which wash out the last particles of dross though he answered ay tank ay ban wort five hundred tousand dollar  gosh said hootchinoo bill and he said it reverently  yes bill gosh said kink mitchell and they went out softly and closed the door     the one thousand dozen   david rasmunsen was a hustler and like many a greater man a man of the one idea  wherefore when the clarion call of the north rang on his ear he conceived an adventure in eggs and bent all his energy to its achievement  he figured briefly and to the point and the adventure became iridescenthued splendid  that eggs would sell at dawson for five dollars a dozen was a safe working premise  whence it was incontrovertible that one thousand dozen would bring in the golden metropolis five thousand dollars  on the other hand expense was to be considered and he considered it well for he was a careful man keenly practical with a hard head and a heart that imagination never warmed  at fifteen cents a dozen the initial cost of his thousand dozen would be one hundred and fifty dollars a mere bagatelle in face of the enormous profit  and suppose just suppose to be wildly extravagant for once that transportation for himself and eggs should run up eight hundred and fifty more he would still have four thousand clear cash and clean when the last egg was disposed of and the last dust had rippled into his sack  you see almahe figured it over with his wife the cosy diningroom submerged in a sea of maps government surveys guidebooks and alaskan itinerariesyou see expenses dont really begin till you make dyeafifty dollarsll cover it with a firstclass passage thrown in  now from dyea to lake linderman indian packers take your goods over for twelve cents a pound twelve dollars a hundred or one hundred and twenty dollars a thousand  say i have fifteen hundred pounds itll cost one hundred and eighty dollarscall it two hundred and be safe  i am creditably informed by a klondiker just come out that i can buy a boat for three hundred  but the same man says im sure to get a couple of passengers for one hundred and fifty each which will give me the boat for nothing and further they can help me manage it  and    thats all i put my eggs ashore from the boat at dawson  now let me see how much is that  fifty dollars from san francisco to dyea two hundred from dyea to linderman passengers pay for the boattwo hundred and fifty all told she summed up swiftly  and a hundred for my clothes and personal outfit he went on happily that leaves a margin of five hundred for emergencies  and what possible emergencies can arise  alma shrugged her shoulders and elevated her brows  if that vast northland was capable of swallowing up a man and a thousand dozen eggs surely there was room and to spare for whatever else he might happen to possess  so she thought but she said nothing  she knew david rasmunsen too well to say anything  doubling the time because of chance delays i should make the trip in two months  think of it alma  four thousand in two months  beats the paltry hundred a month im getting now  why well build further out where well have more space gas in every room and a view and the rent of the cottagell pay taxes insurance and water and leave something over  and then theres always the chance of my striking it and coming out a millionaire  now tell me alma dont you think im very moderate  and alma could hardly think otherwise  besides had not her own cousinthough a remote and distant one to be sure the black sheep the harumscarum the neerdowellhad not he come down out of that weird north country with a hundred thousand in yellow dust to say nothing of a halfownership in the hole from which it came  david rasmunsens grocer was surprised when he found him weighing eggs in the scales at the end of the counter and rasmunsen himself was more surprised when he found that a dozen eggs weighed a pound and a halffifteen hundred pounds for his thousand dozen  there would be no weight left for his clothes blankets and cooking utensils to say nothing of the grub he must necessarily consume by the way  his calculations were all thrown out and he was just proceeding to recast them when he hit upon the idea of weighing small eggs  for whether they be large or small a dozen eggs is a dozen eggs he observed sagely to himself and a dozen small ones he found to weigh but a pound and a quarter  thereat the city of san francisco was overrun by anxiouseyed emissaries and commission houses and dairy associations were startled by a sudden demand for eggs running not more than twenty ounces to the dozen  rasmunsen mortgaged the little cottage for a thousand dollars arranged for his wife to make a prolonged stay among her own people threw up his job and started north  to keep within his schedule he compromised on a secondclass passage which because of the rush was worse than steerage and in the late summer a pale and wabbly man he disembarked with his eggs on the dyea beach  but it did not take him long to recover his land legs and appetite  his first interview with the chilkoot packers straightened him up and stiffened his backbone  forty cents a pound they demanded for the twentyeightmile portage and while he caught his breath and swallowed the price went up to fortythree fifteen husky indians put the straps on his packs at fortyfive but took them off at an offer of fortyseven from a skaguay croesus in dirty shirt and ragged overalls who had lost his horses on the white pass trail and was now making a last desperate drive at the country by way of chilkoot  but rasmunsen was clean grit and at fifty cents found takers who two days later set his eggs down intact at linderman  but fifty cents a pound is a thousand dollars a ton and his fifteen hundred pounds had exhausted his emergency fund and left him stranded at the tantalus point where each day he saw the freshwhipsawed boats departing for dawson further a great anxiety brooded over the camp where the boats were built  men worked frantically early and late at the height of their endurance caulking nailing and pitching in a frenzy of haste for which adequate explanation was not far to seek  each day the snowline crept farther down the bleak rockshouldered peaks and gale followed gale with sleet and slush and snow and in the eddies and quiet places young ice formed and thickened through the fleeting hours  and each morn toil stiffened men turned wan faces across the lake to see if the freezeup had come  for the freezeup heralded the death of their hopethe hope that they would be floating down the swift river ere navigation closed on the chain of lakes  to harrow rasmunsens soul further he discovered three competitors in the egg business  it was true that one a little german had gone broke and was himself forlornly backtripping the last pack of the portage but the other two had boats nearly completed and were daily supplicating the god of merchants and traders to stay the iron hand of winter for just another day  but the iron hand closed down over the land  men were being frozen in the blizzard which swept chilkoot and rasmunsen frosted his toes ere he was aware  he found a chance to go passenger with his freight in a boat just shoving off through the rubble but two hundred hard cash was required and he had no money  ay tank you yust wait one leedle wile said the swedish boatbuilder who had struck his klondike right there and was wise enough to know itone leedle wile und i make you a tam fine skiff boat sure pete  with this unpledged word to go on rasmunsen hit the back trail to crater lake where he fell in with two press correspondents whose tangled baggage was strewn from stone house over across the pass and as far as happy camp  yes he said with consequence  ive a thousand dozen eggs at linderman and my boats just about got the last seam caulked  consider myself in luck to get it  boats are at a premium you know and none to be had  whereupon and almost with bodily violence the correspondents clamoured to go with him fluttered greenbacks before his eyes and spilled yellow twenties from hand to hand  he could not hear of it but they overpersuaded him and he reluctantly consented to take them at three hundred apiece  also they pressed upon him the passage money in advance and while they wrote to their respective journals concerning the good samaritan with the thousand dozen eggs the good samaritan was hurrying back to the swede at linderman  here you  gimme that boat was his salutation his hand jingling the correspondents gold pieces and his eyes hungrily bent upon the finished craft  the swede regarded him stolidly and shook his head  how much is the other fellow paying  three hundred  well heres four take it  he tried to press it upon him but the man backed away  ay tank not  ay say him get der skiff boat  you yust wait  heres six hundred  last call  take it or leave it  tell m its a mistake  the swede wavered  ay tank yes he finally said and the last rasmunsen saw of him his vocabulary was going to wreck in a vain effort to explain the mistake to the other fellows  the german slipped and broke his ankle on the steep hogback above deep lake sold out his stock for a dollar a dozen and with the proceeds hired indian packers to carry him back to dyea  but on the morning rasmunsen shoved off with his correspondents his two rivals followed suit  how many you got one of them a lean little new englander called out  one thousand dozen rasmunsen answered proudly  huh  ill go you even stakes i beat you in with my eight hundred  the correspondents offered to lend him the money but rasmunsen declined and the yankee closed with the remaining rival a brawny son of the sea and sailor of ships and things who promised to show them all a wrinkle or two when it came to cracking on  and crack on he did with a large tarpaulin squaresail which pressed the bow half under at every jump  he was the first to run out of linderman but disdaining the portage piled his loaded boat on the rocks in the boiling rapids  rasmunsen and the yankee who likewise had two passengers portaged across on their backs and then lined their empty boats down through the bad water to bennett  bennett was a twentyfivemile lake narrow and deep a funnel between the mountains through which storms ever romped  rasmunsen camped on the sandpit at its head where were many men and boats bound north in the teeth of the arctic winter  he awoke in the morning to find a piping gale from the south which caught the chill from the whited peaks and glacial valleys and blew as cold as north wind ever blew  but it was fair and he also found the yankee staggering past the first bold headland with all sail set  boat after boat was getting under way and the correspondents fell to with enthusiasm  well catch him before cariboo crossing they assured rasmunsen as they ran up the sail and the alma took the first icy spray over her bow  now rasmunsen all his life had been prone to cowardice on water but he clung to the kicking steeringoar with set face and determined jaw  his thousand dozen were there in the boat before his eyes safely secured beneath the correspondents baggage and somehow before his eyes were the little cottage and the mortgage for a thousand dollars  it was bitter cold  now and again he hauled in the steeringsweep and put out a fresh one while his passengers chopped the ice from the blade wherever the spray struck it turned instantly to frost and the dipping boom of the spritsail was quickly fringed with icicles  the alma strained and hammered through the big seas till the seams and butts began to spread but in lieu of bailing the correspondents chopped ice and flung it overboard  there was no letup  the mad race with winter was on and the boats tore along in a desperate string  wwwe cant stop to save our souls one of the correspondents chattered from cold not fright  thats right  keep her down the middle old man the other encouraged  rasmunsen replied with an idiotic grin  the ironbound shores were in a lather of foam and even down the middle the only hope was to keep running away from the big seas  to lower sail was to be overtaken and swamped  time and again they passed boats pounding among the rocks and once they saw one on the edge of the breakers about to strike  a little craft behind them with two men jibed over and turned bottom up  wwwatch out old man cried he of the chattering teeth  rasmunsen grinned and tightened his aching grip on the sweep  scores of times had the send of the sea caught the big square stern of the alma and thrown her off from dead before it till the after leach of the spritsail fluttered hollowly and each time and only with all his strength had he forced her back  his grin by then had become fixed and it disturbed the correspondents to look at him  they roared down past an isolated rock a hundred yards from shore  from its wavedrenched top a man shrieked wildly for the instant cutting the storm with his voice  but the next instant the alma was by and the rock growing a black speck in the troubled froth  that settles the yankee  wheres the sailor shouted one of his passengers  rasmunsen shot a glance over his shoulder at a black squaresail  he had seen it leap up out of the grey to windward and for an hour off and on had been watching it grow  the sailor had evidently repaired damages and was making up for lost time  look at him come  both passengers stopped chopping ice to watch  twenty miles of bennett were behind themroom and to spare for the sea to toss up its mountains toward the sky  sinking and soaring like a stormgod the sailor drove by them  the huge sail seemed to grip the boat from the crests of the waves to tear it bodily out of the water and fling it crashing and smothering down into the yawning troughs  the seall never catch him  but hell rrrun her nose under  even as they spoke the black tarpaulin swooped from sight behind a big comber  the next wave rolled over the spot and the next but the boat did not reappear  the alma rushed by the place  a little riffraff of oats and boxes was seen  an arm thrust up and a shaggy head broke surface a score of yards away  for a time there was silence  as the end of the lake came in sight the waves began to leap aboard with such steady recurrence that the correspondents no longer chopped ice but flung the water out with buckets  even this would not do and after a shouted conference with rasmunsen they attacked the baggage  flour bacon beans blankets cookingstove ropes odds and ends everything they could get hands on flew overboard  the boat acknowledged it at once taking less water and rising more buoyantly  thatll do rasmunsen called sternly as they applied themselves to the top layer of eggs  the hhell it will answered the shivering one savagely  with the exception of their notes films and cameras they had sacrificed their outfit  he bent over laid hold of an eggbox and began to worry it out from under the lashing  drop it  drop it i say  rasmunsen had managed to draw his revolver and with the crook of his arm over the sweep head was taking aim  the correspondent stood up on the thwart balancing back and forth his face twisted with menace and speechless anger  my god  so cried his brother correspondent hurling himself face downward into the bottom of the boat  the alma under the divided attention of rasmunsen had been caught by a great mass of water and whirled around the after leach hollowed the sail emptied and jibed and the boom sweeping with terrific force across the boat carried the angry correspondent overboard with a broken back  mast and sail had gone over the side as well  a drenching sea followed as the boat lost headway and rasmunsen sprang to the bailing bucket  several boats hurtled past them in the next halfhoursmall boats boats of their own size boats afraid unable to do aught but run madly on  then a tenton barge at imminent risk of destruction lowered sail to windward and lumbered down upon them  keep off  keep off rasmunsen screamed  but his low gunwale ground against the heavy craft and the remaining correspondent clambered aboard  rasmunsen was over the eggs like a cat and in the bow of the alma striving with numb fingers to bend the haulinglines together  come on a redwhiskered man yelled at him  ive a thousand dozen eggs here he shouted back  gimme a tow  ill pay you  come on they howled in chorus  a big whitecap broke just beyond washing over the barge and leaving the alma half swamped  the men cast off cursing him as they ran up their sail  rasmunsen cursed back and fell to bailing  the mast and sail like a sea anchor still fast by the halyards held the boat head on to wind and sea and gave him a chance to fight the water out  three hours later numbed exhausted blathering like a lunatic but still bailing he went ashore on an icestrewn beach near cariboo crossing  two men a government courier and a halfbreed voyageur dragged him out of the surf saved his cargo and beached the alma  they were paddling out of the country in a peterborough and gave him shelter for the night in their stormbound camp  next morning they departed but he elected to stay by his eggs  and thereafter the name and fame of the man with the thousand dozen eggs began to spread through the land  gold seekers who made in before the freezeup carried the news of his coming grizzled oldtimers of forty mile and circle city sour doughs with leathern jaws and beancalloused stomachs called up dream memories of chickens and green things at mention of his name  dyea and skaguay took an interest in his being and questioned his progress from every man who came over the passes while dawsongolden omeletless dawsonfretted and worried and waylaid every chance arrival for word of him  but of this rasmunsen knew nothing  the day after the wreck he patched up the alma and pulled out  a cruel east wind blew in his teeth from tagish but he got the oars over the side and bucked manfully into it though half the time he was drifting backward and chopping ice from the blades  according to the custom of the country he was driven ashore at windy arm three times on tagish saw him swamped and beached and lake marsh held him at the freezeup  the alma was crushed in the jamming of the floes but the eggs were intact  these he backtripped two miles across the ice to the shore where he built a cache which stood for years after and was pointed out by men who knew  half a thousand frozen miles stretched between him and dawson and the waterway was closed  but rasmunsen with a peculiar tense look in his face struck back up the lakes on foot  what he suffered on that lone trip with nought but a single blanket an axe and a handful of beans is not given to ordinary mortals to know  only the arctic adventurer may understand  suffice that he was caught in a blizzard on chilkoot and left two of his toes with the surgeon at sheep camp  yet he stood on his feet and washed dishes in the scullery of the pawona to the puget sound and from there passed coal on a p s boat to san francisco  it was a haggard unkempt man who limped across the shining office floor to raise a second mortgage from the bank people  his hollow cheeks betrayed themselves through the scraggy beard and his eyes seemed to have retired into deep caverns where they burned with cold fires  his hands were grained from exposure and hard work and the nails were rimmed with tightpacked dirt and coaldust  he spoke vaguely of eggs and ice packs winds and tides but when they declined to let him have more than a second thousand his talk became incoherent concerning itself chiefly with the price of dogs and dogfood and such things as snowshoes and moccasins and winter trails  they let him have fifteen hundred which was more than the cottage warranted and breathed easier when he scrawled his signature and passed out the door  two weeks later he went over chilkoot with three dog sleds of five dogs each  one team he drove the two indians with him driving the others  at lake marsh they broke out the cache and loaded up  but there was no trail  he was the first in over the ice and to him fell the task of packing the snow and hammering away through the rough river jams  behind him he often observed a campfire smoke trickling thinly up through the quiet air and he wondered why the people did not overtake him  for he was a stranger to the land and did not understand  nor could he understand his indians when they tried to explain  this they conceived to be a hardship but when they balked and refused to break camp of mornings he drove them to their work at pistol point  when he slipped through an ice bridge near the white horse and froze his foot tender yet and oversensitive from the previous freezing the indians looked for him to lie up  but he sacrificed a blanket and with his foot incased in an enormous moccasin big as a waterbucket continued to take his regular turn with the front sled  here was the cruellest work and they respected him though on the side they rapped their foreheads with their knuckles and significantly shook their heads one night they tried to run away but the zipzip of his bullets in the snow brought them back snarling but convinced  whereupon being only savage chilkat men they put their heads together to kill him but he slept like a cat and waking or sleeping the chance never came  often they tried to tell him the import of the smoke wreath in the rear but he could not comprehend and grew suspicious of them  and when they sulked or shirked he was quick to let drive at them between the eyes and quick to cool their heated souls with sight of his ready revolver  and so it wentwith mutinous men wild dogs and a trail that broke the heart  he fought the men to stay with him fought the dogs to keep them away from the eggs fought the ice the cold and the pain of his foot which would not heal  as fast as the young tissue renewed it was bitten and scared by the frost so that a running sore developed into which he could almost shove his fist  in the mornings when he first put his weight upon it his head went dizzy and he was near to fainting from the pain but later on in the day it usually grew numb to recommence when he crawled into his blankets and tried to sleep  yet he who had been a clerk and sat at a desk all his days toiled till the indians were exhausted and even outworked the dogs  how hard he worked how much he suffered he did not know  being a man of the one idea now that the idea had come it mastered him  in the foreground of his consciousness was dawson in the background his thousand dozen eggs and midway between the two his ego fluttered striving always to draw them together to a glittering golden point  this golden point was the five thousand dollars the consummation of the idea and the point of departure for whatever new idea might present itself  for the rest he was a mere automaton  he was unaware of other things seeing them as through a glass darkly and giving them no thought  the work of his hands he did with machinelike wisdom likewise the work of his head  so the look on his face grew very tense till even the indians were afraid of it and marvelled at the strange white man who had made them slaves and forced them to toil with such foolishness  then came a snap on lake le barge when the cold of outer space smote the tip of the planet and the force ranged sixty and odd degrees below zero here labouring with open mouth that he might breathe more freely he chilled his lungs and for the rest of the trip he was troubled with a dry hacking cough especially irritable in smoke of camp or under stress of undue exertion  on the thirty mile river he found much open water spanned by precarious ice bridges and fringed with narrow rim ice tricky and uncertain  the rim ice was impossible to reckon on and he dared it without reckoning falling back on his revolver when his drivers demurred  but on the ice bridges covered with snow though they were precautions could be taken  these they crossed on their snowshoes with long poles held crosswise in their hands to which to cling in case of accident  once over the dogs were called to follow  and on such a bridge where the absence of the centre ice was masked by the snow one of the indians met his end  he went through as quickly and neatly as a knife through thin cream and the current swept him from view down under the stream ice  that night his mate fled away through the pale moonlight rasmunsen futilely puncturing the silence with his revolvera thing that he handled with more celerity than cleverness  thirtysix hours later the indian made a police camp on the big salmon  umumum funny manswhat you calltop um head all loose the interpreter explained to the puzzled captain  eh  yep clazy much clazy mans  eggs eggs all a time eggssavvy  come bimeby  it was several days before rasmunsen arrived the three sleds lashed together and all the dogs in a single team  it was awkward and where the going was bad he was compelled to backtrip it sled by sled though he managed most of the time through herculean efforts to bring all along on the one haul  he did not seem moved when the captain of police told him his man was hitting the high places for dawson and was by that time probably halfway between selkirk and stewart  nor did he appear interested when informed that the police had broken the trail as far as pelly for he had attained to a fatalistic acceptance of all natural dispensations good or ill  but when they told him that dawson was in the bitter clutch of famine he smiled threw the harness on his dogs and pulled out  but it was at his next halt that the mystery of the smoke was explained with the word at big salmon that the trail was broken to pelly there was no longer any need for the smoke wreath to linger in his wake and rasmunsen crouching over lonely fire saw a motley string of sleds go by  first came the courier and the halfbreed who had hauled him out from bennett then mailcarriers for circle city two sleds of them and a mixed following of ingoing klondikers  dogs and men were fresh and fat while rasmunsen and his brutes were jaded and worn down to the skin and bone  they of the smoke wreath had travelled one day in three resting and reserving their strength for the dash to come when broken trail was met with while each day he had plunged and floundered forward breaking the spirit of his dogs and robbing them of their mettle  as for himself he was unbreakable  they thanked him kindly for his efforts in their behalf those fat fresh menthanked him kindly with broad grins and ribald laughter and now when he understood he made no answer  nor did he cherish silent bitterness  it was immaterial  the ideathe fact behind the ideawas not changed  here he was and his thousand dozen there was dawson the problem was unaltered  at the little salmon being short of dog food the dogs got into his grub and from there to selkirk he lived on beanscoarse brown beans big beans grossly nutritive which griped his stomach and doubled him up at twohour intervals  but the factor at selkirk had a notice on the door of the post to the effect that no steamer had been up the yukon for two years and in consequence grub was beyond price  he offered to swap flour however at the rate of a cupful of each egg but rasmunsen shook his head and hit the trail  below the post he managed to buy frozen horse hide for the dogs the horses having been slain by the chilkat cattle men and the scraps and offal preserved by the indians  he tackled the hide himself but the hair worked into the bean sores of his mouth and was beyond endurance  here at selkirk he met the forerunners of the hungry exodus of dawson and from there on they crept over the trail a dismal throng  no grub was the song they sang  no grub and had to go  everybody holding candles for a rise in the spring  flour dollar n a half a pound and no sellers  eggs one of them answered  dollar apiece but there aint none  rasmunsen made a rapid calculation  twelve thousand dollars he said aloud  hey the man asked  nothing he answered and mushed the dogs along  when he arrived at stewart river seventy from dawson five of his dogs were gone and the remainder were falling in the traces  he also was in the traces hauling with what little strength was left in him  even then he was barely crawling along ten miles a day  his cheekbones and nose frostbitten again and again were turned bloodyblack and hideous the thumb which was separated from the fingers by the geepole had likewise been nipped and gave him great pain  the monstrous moccasin still incased his foot and strange pains were beginning to rack the leg at sixty mile the last beans which he had been rationing for some time were finished yet he steadfastly refused to touch the eggs  he could not reconcile his mind to the legitimacy of it and staggered and fell along the way to indian river  here a freshkilled moose and an open handed oldtimer gave him and his dogs new strength and at ainslies he felt repaid for it all when a stampede ripe from dawson in five hours was sure he could get a dollar and a quarter for every egg he possessed  he came up the steep bank by the dawson barracks with fluttering heart and shaking knees  the dogs were so weak that he was forced to rest them and waiting he leaned limply against the geepole  a man an eminently decorouslooking man came sauntering by in a great bearskin coat  he glanced at rasmunsen curiously then stopped and ran a speculative eye over the dogs and the three lashed sleds  what you got he asked  eggs rasmunsen answered huskily hardly able to pitch his voice above a whisper  eggs  whoopee  whoopee  he sprang up into the air gyrated madly and finished with halfadozen war steps  you dont sayall of em  all of em  say you must be the egg man  he walked around and viewed rasmunsen from the other side  come now aint you the egg man  rasmunsen didnt know but supposed he was and the man sobered down a bit  what dye expect to get for em he asked cautiously  rasmunsen became audacious dollar n a half he said  done the man came back promptly  gimme a dozen  ii mean a dollar n a half apiece rasmunsen hesitatingly explained  sure  i heard you  make it two dozen  heres the dust  the man pulled out a healthy gold sack the size of a small sausage and knocked it negligently against the geepole  rasmunsen felt a strange trembling in the pit of his stomach a tickling of the nostrils and an almost overwhelming desire to sit down and cry  but a curious wideeyed crowd was beginning to collect and man after man was calling out for eggs  he was without scales but the man with the bearskin coat fetched a pair and obligingly weighed in the dust while rasmunsen passed out the goods  soon there was a pushing and shoving and shouldering and a great clamour  everybody wanted to buy and to be served first  and as the excitement grew rasmunsen cooled down  this would never do  there must be something behind the fact of their buying so eagerly  it would be wiser if he rested first and sized up the market  perhaps eggs were worth two dollars apiece  anyway whenever he wished to sell he was sure of a dollar and a half  stop he cried when a couple of hundred had been sold  no more now  im played out  ive got to get a cabin and then you can come and see me  a groan went up at this but the man with the bearskin coat approved twentyfour of the frozen eggs went rattling in his capacious pockets and he didnt care whether the rest of the town ate or not  besides he could see rasmunsen was on his last legs  theres a cabin right around the second corner from the monte carlo he told himthe one with the sodybottle window  it aint mine but ive got charge of it  rents for ten a day and cheap for the money  you move right in and ill see you later  dont forget the sodybottle window  tralaloo he called back a moment later  im goin up the hill to eat eggs and dream of home  on his way to the cabin rasmunsen recollected he was hungry and bought a small supply of provisions at the n a t  t storealso a beefsteak at the butcher shop and dried salmon for the dogs  he found the cabin without difficulty and left the dogs in the harness while he started the fire and got the coffee under way  a dollar n a half apieceone thousand dozeneighteen thousand dollars he kept muttering it to himself over and over as he went about his work  as he flopped the steak into the fryingpan the door opened  he turned it was the man with the bearskin coat  he seemed to come in with determination as though bound on some explicit errand but as he looked at rasmunsen an expression of perplexity came into his face  i saynow i say he began then halted  rasmunsen wondered if he wanted the rent  i say damn it you know them eggs is bad  rasmunsen staggered  he felt as though some one had struck him an astounding blow between the eyes  the walls of the cabin reeled and tilted up  he put out his hand to steady himself and rested it on the stove  the sharp pain and the smell of the burning flesh brought him back to himself  i see he said slowly fumbling in his pocket for the sack  you want your money back  it aint the money the man said but haint you got any eggsgood  rasmunsen shook his head  youd better take the money  but the man refused and backed away  ill come back he said when youve taken stock and get whats comin  rasmunsen rolled the choppingblock into the cabin and carried in the eggs  he went about it quite calmly  he took up the handaxe and one by one chopped the eggs in half  these halves he examined carefully and let fall to the floor  at first he sampled from the different cases then deliberately emptied one case at a time  the heap on the floor grew larger  the coffee boiled over and the smoke of the burning beefsteak filled the cabin  he chopped steadfastly and monotonously till the last case was finished  somebody knocked at the door knocked again and let himself in  what a mess he remarked as he paused and surveyed the scene  the severed eggs were beginning to thaw in the heat of the stove and a miserable odour was growing stronger  must ahappened on the steamer he suggested  rasmunsen looked at him long and blankly  im murray big jim murray everybody knows me the man volunteered im just hearin your eggs is rotten and im offerin you two hundred for the batch  they aint good as salmon but still theyre fair scoffins for dogs  rasmunsen seemed turned to stone  he did not move  you go to hell he said passionlessly  now just consider  i pride myself its a decent price for a mess like that and its better n nothin  two hundred  what you say  you go to hell rasmunsen repeated softly and get out of here  murray gaped with a great awe then went out carefully backward with his eyes fixed an the others face  rasmunsen followed him out and turned the dogs loose  he threw them all the salmon he had bought and coiled a sledlashing up in his hand  then he reentered the cabin and drew the latch in after him  the smoke from the cindered steak made his eyes smart  he stood on the bunk passed the lashing over the ridgepole and measured the swingoff with his eye  it did not seem to satisfy for he put the stool on the bunk and climbed upon the stool  he drove a noose in the end of the lashing and slipped his head through  the other end he made fast  then he kicked the stool out from under     the marriage of litlit   when john fox came into a country where whisky freezes solid and may be used as a paperweight for a large part of the year he came without the ideals and illusions that usually hamper the progress of more delicately nurtured adventurers  born and reared on the frontier fringe of the united states he took with him into canada a primitive cast of mind an elemental simplicity and grip on things as it were that insured him immediate success in his new career  from a mere servant of the hudson bay company driving a paddle with the voyageurs and carrying goods on his back across the portages he swiftly rose to a factorship and took charge of a trading post at fort angelus  here because of his elemental simplicity he took to himself a native wife and by reason of the connubial bliss that followed he escaped the unrest and vain longings that curse the days of more fastidious men spoil their work and conquer them in the end  he lived contentedly was at single purposes with the business he was set there to do and achieved a brilliant record in the service of the company  about this time his wife died was claimed by her people and buried with savage circumstance in a tin trunk in the top of a tree  two sons she had borne him and when the company promoted him he journeyed with them still deeper into the vastness of the northwest territory to a place called sin rock where he took charge of a new post in a more important fur field  here he spent several lonely and depressing months eminently disgusted with the unprepossessing appearance of the indian maidens and greatly worried by his growing sons who stood in need of a mothers care  then his eyes chanced upon lit lit  litlitwell she is litlit was the fashion in which he despairingly described her to his chief clerk alexander mclean  mclean was too fresh from his scottish upbringingnot dry behind the ears yet john fox put itto take to the marriage customs of the country  nevertheless he was not averse to the factors imperilling his own immortal soul and especially feeling an ominous attraction himself for litlit he was sombrely content to clinch his own souls safety by seeing her married to the factor  nor is it to be wondered that mcleans austere scotch soul stood in danger of being thawed in the sunshine of litlits eyes  she was pretty and slender and willowy without the massive face and temperamental stolidity of the average squaw  litlit so called from her fashion even as a child of being fluttery of darting about from place to place like a butterfly of being inconsequent and merry and of laughing as lightly as she darted and danced about  litlit was the daughter of snettishane a prominent chief in the tribe by a halfbreed mother and to him the factor fared casually one summer day to open negotiations of marriage  he sat with the chief in the smoke of a mosquito smudge before his lodge and together they talked about everything under the sun or at least everything that in the northland is under the sun with the sole exception of marriage  john fox had come particularly to talk of marriage snettishane knew it and john fox knew he knew it wherefore the subject was religiously avoided  this is alleged to be indian subtlety  in reality it is transparent simplicity  the hours slipped by and fox and snettishane smoked interminable pipes looking each other in the eyes with a guilelessness superbly histrionic in the midafternoon mclean and his brother clerk mctavish strolled past innocently uninterested on their way to the river  when they strolled back again an hour later fox and snettishane had attained to a ceremonious discussion of the condition and quality of the gunpowder and bacon which the company was offering in trade  meanwhile litlit divining the factors errand had crept in under the rear wall of the lodge and through the front flap was peeping out at the two logomachists by the mosquito smudge  she was flushed and happyeyed proud that no less a man than the factor who stood next to god in the northland hierarchy had singled her out femininely curious to see at close range what manner of man he was  sunglare on the ice camp smoke and weather beat had burned his face to a copperbrown so that her father was as fair as he while she was fairer  she was remotely glad of this and more immediately glad that he was large and strong though his great black beard half frightened her it was so strange  being very young she was unversed in the ways of men  seventeen times she had seen the sun travel south and lose itself beyond the skyline and seventeen times she had seen it travel back again and ride the sky day and night till there was no night at all  and through these years she had been cherished jealously by snettishane who stood between her and all suitors listening disdainfully to the young hunters as they bid for her hand and turning them away as though she were beyond price snettishane was mercenary  litlit was to him an investment  she represented so much capital from which he expected to receive not a certain definite interest but an incalculable interest  and having thus been reared in a manner as near to that of the nunnery as tribal conditions would permit it was with a great and maidenly anxiety that she peeped out at the man who had surely come for her at the husband who was to teach her all that was yet unlearned of life at the masterful being whose word was to be her law and who was to mete and bound her actions and comportment for the rest of her days  but peeping through the front flap of the lodge flushed and thrilling at the strange destiny reaching out for her she grew disappointed as the day wore along and the factor and her father still talked pompously of matters concerning other things and not pertaining to marriage things at all  as the sun sank lower and lower toward the north and midnight approached the factor began making unmistakable preparations for departure  as he turned to stride away litlits heart sank but it rose again as he halted half turning on one heel  oh by the way snettishane he said i want a squaw to wash for me and mend my clothes  snettishane grunted and suggested wanidani who was an old woman and toothless  no no interposed the factor  what i want is a wife  ive been kind of thinking about it and the thought just struck me that you might know of some one that would suit  snettishane looked interested whereupon the factor retraced his steps casually and carelessly to linger and discuss this new and incidental topic  kattou suggested snettishane  she has but one eye objected the factor  laska  her knees be wide apart when she stands upright  kips your biggest dog can leap between her knees when she stands upright  senatee went on the imperturbable snettishane  but john fox feigned anger crying what foolishness is this  am i old that thou shouldst mate me with old women  am i toothless lame of leg blind of eye  or am i poor that no brighteyed maiden may look with favour upon me  behold  i am the factor both rich and great a power in the land whose speech makes men tremble and is obeyed  snettishane was inwardly pleased though his sphinxlike visage never relaxed  he was drawing the factor and making him break ground  being a creature so elemental as to have room for but one idea at a time snettishane could pursue that one idea a greater distance than could john fox  for john fox elemental as he was was still complex enough to entertain several glimmering ideas at a time which debarred him from pursuing the one as singleheartedly or as far as did the chief  snettishane calmly continued calling the roster of eligible maidens which name by name as fast as uttered were stamped ineligible by john fox with specified objections appended  again he gave it up and started to return to the fort  snettishane watched him go making no effort to stop him but seeing him in the end stop himself  come to think of it the factor remarked we both of us forgot lit lit  now i wonder if shell suit me  snettishane met the suggestion with a mirthless face behind the mask of which his soul grinned wide  it was a distinct victory  had the factor gone but one step farther perforce snettishane would himself have mentioned the name of litlit butthe factor had not gone that one step farther  the chief was noncommittal concerning litlits suitability till he drove the white man into taking the next step in order of procedure  well the factor meditated aloud the only way to find out is to make a try of it  he raised his voice  so i will give for litlit ten blankets and three pounds of tobacco which is good tobacco  snettishane replied with a gesture which seemed to say that all the blankets and tobacco in all the world could not compensate him for the loss of litlit and her manifold virtues  when pressed by the factor to set a price he coolly placed it at five hundred blankets ten guns fifty pounds of tobacco twenty scarlet cloths ten bottles of rum a musicbox and lastly the goodwill and best offices of the factor with a place by his fire  the factor apparently suffered a stroke of apoplexy which stroke was successful in reducing the blankets to two hundred and in cutting out the place by the firean unheardof condition in the marriages of white men with the daughters of the soil  in the end after three hours more of chaffering they came to an agreement  for litlit snettishane was to receive one hundred blankets five pounds of tobacco three guns and a bottle of rum goodwill and best offices included which according to john fox was ten blankets and a gun more than she was worth  and as he went home through the wee sma hours the threeoclock sun blazing in the due northeast he was unpleasantly aware that snettishane had bested him over the bargain  snettishane tired and victorious sought his bed and discovered litlit before she could escape from the lodge  he grunted knowingly thou hast seen  thou has heard  wherefore it be plain to thee thy fathers very great wisdom and understanding  i have made for thee a great match  heed my words and walk in the way of my words go when i say go come when i bid thee come and we shall grow fat with the wealth of this big white man who is a fool according to his bigness  the next day no trading was done at the store  the factor opened whisky before breakfast to the delight of mclean and mctavish gave his dogs double rations and wore his best moccasins  outside the fort preparations were under way for a potlatch  potlatch means a giving and john foxs intention was to signalize his marriage with litlit by a potlatch as generous as she was goodlooking  in the afternoon the whole tribe gathered to the feast  men women children and dogs gorged to repletion nor was there one person even among the chance visitors and stray hunters from other tribes who failed to receive some token of the bridegrooms largess  litlit tearfully shy and frightened was bedecked by her bearded husband with a new calico dress splendidly beaded moccasins a gorgeous silk handkerchief over her raven hair a purple scarf about her throat brass earrings and fingerrings and a whole pint of pinchbeck jewellery including a waterbury watch  snettishane could scarce contain himself at the spectacle but watching his chance drew her aside from the feast  not this night nor the next night he began ponderously but in the nights to come when i shall call like a raven by the river bank it is for thee to rise up from thy big husband who is a fool and come to me  nay nay he went on hastily at sight of the dismay in her face at turning her back upon her wonderful new life  for no sooner shall this happen than thy big husband who is a fool will come wailing to my lodge  then it is for thee to wail likewise claiming that this thing is not well and that the other thing thou dost not like and that to be the wife of the factor is more than thou didst bargain for only wilt thou be content with more blankets and more tobacco and more wealth of various sorts for thy poor old father snettishane  remember well when i call in the night like a raven from the river bank  litlit nodded for to disobey her father was a peril she knew well and furthermore it was a little thing he asked a short separation from the factor who would know only greater gladness at having her back  she returned to the feast and midnight being well at hand the factor sought her out and led her away to the fort amid joking and outcry in which the squaws were especially conspicuous  litlit quickly found that married life with the headman of a fort was even better than she had dreamed  no longer did she have to fetch wood and water and wait hand and foot upon cantankerous menfolk  for the first time in her life she could lie abed till breakfast was on the table  and what a bedclean and soft and comfortable as no bed she had ever known  and such food  flour cooked into biscuits hotcakes and bread three times a day and every day and all one wanted  such prodigality was hardly believable  to add to her contentment the factor was cunningly kind  he had buried one wife and he knew how to drive with a slack rein that went firm only on occasion and then went very firm  litlit is boss of this place he announced significantly at the table the morning after the wedding what she says goes  understand  and mclean and mctavish understood also they knew that the factor had a heavy hand  but litlit did not take advantage  taking a leaf from the book of her husband she at once assumed charge of his own growing sons giving them added comforts and a measure of freedom like to that which he gave her the two sons were loud in the praise of their new mother mclean and mctavish lifted their voices and the factor bragged of the joys of matrimony till the story of her good behaviour and her husbands satisfaction became the property of all the dwellers in the sin rock district  whereupon snettishane with visions of his incalculable interest keeping him awake of nights thought it time to bestir himself  on the tenth night of her wedded life litlit was awakened by the croaking of a raven and she knew that snettishane was waiting for her by the river bank  in her great happiness she had forgotten her pact and now it came back to her with behind it all the childish terror of her father  for a time she lay in fear and trembling loath to go afraid to stay  but in the end the factor won the silent victory and his kindness plus his great muscles and square jaw nerved her to disregard snettishanes call  but in the morning she arose very much afraid and went about her duties in momentary fear of her fathers coming  as the day wore along however she began to recover her spirits  john fox soundly berating mclean and mctavish for some petty dereliction of duty helped her to pluck up courage  she tried not to let him go out of her sight and when she followed him into the huge cache and saw him twirling and tossing great bales around as though they were feather pillows she felt strengthened in her disobedience to her father  also it was her first visit to the warehouse and sin rock was the chief distributing point to several chains of lesser posts she was astounded at the endlessness of the wealth there stored away  this sight and the picture in her minds eye of the bare lodge of snettishane put all doubts at rest  yet she capped her conviction by a brief word with one of her stepsons  white daddy good was what she asked and the boy answered that his father was the best man he had ever known  that night the raven croaked again  on the night following the croaking was more persistent  it awoke the factor who tossed restlessly for a while  then he said aloud damn that raven and litlit laughed quietly under the blankets  in the morning bright and early snettishane put in an ominous appearance and was set to breakfast in the kitchen with wanidani  he refused squaw food and a little later bearded his soninlaw in the store where the trading was done  having learned he said that his daughter was such a jewel he had come for more blankets more tobacco and more gunsespecially more guns  he had certainly been cheated in her price he held and he had come for justice  but the factor had neither blankets nor justice to spare  whereupon he was informed that snettishane had seen the missionary at three forks who had notified him that such marriages were not made in heaven and that it was his fathers duty to demand his daughter back  i am good christian man now snettishane concluded  i want my litlit to go to heaven  the factors reply was short and to the point for he directed his father inlaw to go to the heavenly antipodes and by the scruff of the neck and the slack of the blanket propelled him on that trail as far as the door  but snettishane sneaked around and in by the kitchen cornering litlit in the great livingroom of the fort  mayhap thou didst sleep oversound last night when i called by the river bank he began glowering darkly  nay i was awake and heard  her heart was beating as though it would choke her but she went on steadily and the night before i was awake and heard and yet again the night before  and thereat out of her great happiness and out of the fear that it might be taken from her she launched into an original and glowing address upon the status and rights of womanthe first newwoman lecture delivered north of fiftythree  but it fell on unheeding ears  snettishane was still in the dark ages as she paused for breath he said threateningly tonight i shall call again like the raven  at this moment the factor entered the room and again helped snettishane on his way to the heavenly antipodes  that night the raven croaked more persistently than ever  litlit who was a light sleeper heard and smiled  john fox tossed restlessly  then he awoke and tossed about with greater restlessness  he grumbled and snorted swore under his breath and over his breath and finally flung out of bed  he groped his way to the great livingroom and from the rack took down a loaded shotgunloaded with birdshot left therein by the careless mctavish  the factor crept carefully out of the fort and down to the river  the croaking had ceased but he stretched out in the long grass and waited the air seemed a chilly balm and the earth after the heat of the day now and again breathed soothingly against him  the factor gathered into the rhythm of it all dozed off with his head upon his arm and slept  fifty yards away head resting on knees and with his back to john fox snettishane likewise slept gently conquered by the quietude of the night  an hour slipped by and then he awoke and without lifting his head set the night vibrating with the hoarse gutturals of the raven call  the factor roused not with the abrupt start of civilized man but with the swift and comprehensive glide from sleep to waking of the savage  in the nightlight he made out a dark object in the midst of the grass and brought his gun to bear upon it  a second croak began to rise and he pulled the trigger  the crickets ceased from their singsong chant the wildfowl from their squabbling and the raven croak broke midmost and died away in gasping silence  john fox ran to the spot and reached for the thing he had killed but his fingers closed on a coarse mop of hair and he turned snettishanes face upward to the starlight  he knew how a shotgun scattered at fifty yards and he knew that he had peppered snettishane across the shoulders and in the small of the back  and snettishane knew that he knew but neither referred to it  what dost thou here the factor demanded  it were time old bones should be in bed  but snettishane was stately in spite of the birdshot burning under his skin  old bones will not sleep he said solemnly  i weep for my daughter for my daughter litlit who liveth and who yet is dead and who goeth without doubt to the white mans hell  weep henceforth on the far bank beyond earshot of the fort said john fox turning on his heel for the noise of thy weeping is exceeding great and will not let one sleep of nights  my heart is sore snettishane answered and my days and nights be black with sorrow  as the raven is black said john fox  as the raven is black snettishane said  never again was the voice of the raven heard by the river bank  litlit grows matronly day by day and is very happy  also there are sisters to the sons of john foxs first wife who lies buried in a tree  old snettishane is no longer a visitor at the fort and spends long hours raising a thin aged voice against the filial ingratitude of children in general and of his daughter litlit in particular  his declining years are embittered by the knowledge that he was cheated and even john fox has withdrawn the assertion that the price for litlit was too much by ten blankets and a gun     batard   batard was a devil  this was recognized throughout the northland hells spawn he was called by many men but his master black leclere chose for him the shameful name batard  now black leclere was also a devil and the twain were well matched  there is a saying that when two devils come together hell is to pay  this is to be expected and this certainly was to be expected when batard and black leclere came together the first time they met batard was a partgrown puppy lean and hungry with bitter eyes and they met with snap and snarl and wicked looks for lecleres upper lip had a wolfish way of lifting and showing the white cruel teeth  and it lifted then and his eyes glinted viciously as he reached for batard and dragged him out from the squirming litter  it was certain that they divined each other for on the instant batard had buried his puppy fangs in lecleres hand and leclere thumb and finger was coolly choking his young life out of him  sacredam the frenchman said softly flirting the quick blood from his bitten hand and gazing down on the little puppy choking and gasping in the snow  leclere turned to john hamlin storekeeper of the sixty mile post  dat fo wat ah lak heem  ow moch eh you msieu  ow moch  ah buy heem now ah buy heem queek  and because he hated him with an exceeding bitter hate leclere bought batard and gave him his shameful name  and for five years the twain adventured across the northland from st michaels and the yukon delta to the headreaches of the pelly and even so far as the peace river athabasca and the great slave  and they acquired a reputation for uncompromising wickedness the like of which never before attached itself to man and dog  batard did not know his fatherhence his namebut as john hamlin knew his father was a great grey timber wolf  but the mother of batard as he dimly remembered her was snarling bickering obscene husky fullfronted and heavychested with a malign eye a catlike grip on life and a genius for trickery and evil  there was neither faith nor trust in her  her treachery alone could be relied upon and her wild wood amours attested her general depravity  much of evil and much of strength were there in these batards progenitors and bone and flesh of their bone and flesh he had inherited it all  and then came black leclere to lay his heavy hand on the bit of pulsating puppy life to press and prod and mould till it became a big bristling beast acute in knavery overspilling with hate sinister malignant diabolical  with a proper master batard might have made an ordinary fairly efficient sled dog  he never got the chance leclere but confirmed him in his congenital iniquity  the history of batard and leclere is a history of warof five cruel relentless years of which their first meeting is fit summary  to begin with it was lecleres fault for he hated with understanding and intelligence while the longlegged ungainly puppy hated only blindly instinctively without reason or method  at first there were no refinements of cruelty these were to come later but simple beatings and crude brutalities  in one of these batard had an ear injured  he never regained control of the riven muscles and ever after the ear drooped limply down to keep keen the memory of his tormentor  and he never forgot  his puppyhood was a period of foolish rebellion  he was always worsted but he fought back because it was his nature to fight back  and he was unconquerable  yelping shrilly from the pain of lash and club he none the less contrived always to throw in the defiant snarl the bitter vindictive menace of his soul which fetched without fail more blows and beatings  but his was his mothers tenacious grip on life  nothing could kill him  he flourished under misfortune grew fat with famine and out of his terrible struggle for life developed a preternatural intelligence  his were the stealth and cunning of the husky his mother and the fierceness and valour of the wolf his father  possibly it was because of his father that he never wailed  his puppy yelps passed with his lanky legs so that he became grim and taciturn quick to strike slow to warn  he answered curse with snarl and blow with snap grinning the while his implacable hatred but never again under the extremest agony did leclere bring from him the cry of fear nor of pain  this unconquerableness but fanned lecleres wrath and stirred him to greater deviltries  did leclere give batard half a fish and to his mates whole ones batard went forth to rob other dogs of their fish  also he robbed caches and expressed himself in a thousand rogueries till he became a terror to all dogs and masters of dogs  did leclere beat batard and fondle babettebabette who was not half the worker he waswhy batard threw her down in the snow and broke her hind leg in his heavy jaws so that leclere was forced to shoot her  likewise in bloody battles batard mastered all his teammates set them the law of trail and forage and made them live to the law he set  in five years he heard but one kind word received but one soft stroke of a hand and then he did not know what manner of things they were  he leaped like the untamed thing he was and his jaws were together in a flash  it was the missionary at sunrise a newcomer in the country who spoke the kind word and gave the soft stroke of the hand  and for six months after he wrote no letters home to the states and the surgeon at mcquestion travelled two hundred miles on the ice to save him from blood poisoning  men and dogs looked askance at batard when he drifted into their camps and posts  the men greeted him with feet threateningly lifted for the kick the dogs with bristling manes and bared fangs  once a man did kick batard and batard with quick wolf snap closed his jaws like a steel trap on the mans calf and crunched down to the bone  whereat the man was determined to have his life only black leclere with ominous eyes and naked huntingknife stepped in between  the killing of batardah sacredam that was a pleasure leclere reserved for himself  some day it would happen or elsebah who was to know  anyway the problem would be solved  for they had become problems to each other  the very breath each drew was a challenge and a menace to the other  their hate bound them together as love could never bind  leclere was bent on the coming of the day when batard should wilt in spirit and cringe and whimper at his feet and batardleclere knew what was in batards mind and more than once had read it in batards eyes  and so clearly had he read that when batard was at his back he made it a point to glance often over his shoulder  men marvelled when leclere refused large money for the dog  some day youll kill him and be out his price said john hamlin once when batard lay panting in the snow where leclere had kicked him and no one knew whether his ribs were broken and no one dared look to see  dat said leclere dryly dat is my bizness msieu  and the men marvelled that batard did not run away  they did not understand  but leclere understood  he was a man who lived much in the open beyond the sound of human tongue and he had learned the voices of wind and storm the sigh of night the whisper of dawn the clash of day in a dim way he could hear the green things growing the running of the sap the bursting of the bud  and he knew the subtle speech of the things that moved of the rabbit in the snare the moody raven beating the air with hollow wing the baldface shuffling under the moon the wolf like a grey shadow gliding betwixt the twilight and the dark  and to him batard spoke clear and direct  full well he understood why batard did not run away and he looked more often over his shoulder  when in anger batard was not nice to look upon and more than once had he leapt for lecleres throat to be stretched quivering and senseless in the snow by the butt of the ever ready dogwhip  and so batard learned to bide his time  when he reached his full strength and prime of youth he thought the time had come  he was broadchested powerfully muscled of far more than ordinary size and his neck from head to shoulders was a mass of bristling hairto all appearances a fullblooded wolf  leclere was lying asleep in his furs when batard deemed the time to be ripe  he crept upon him stealthily head low to earth and lone ear laid back with a feline softness of tread  batard breathed gently very gently and not till he was close at hand did he raise his head  he paused for a moment and looked at the bronzed bull throat naked and knotty and swelling to a deep steady pulse  the slaver dripped down his fangs and slid off his tongue at the sight and in that moment he remembered his drooping ear his uncounted blows and prodigious wrongs and without a sound sprang on the sleeping man  leclere awoke to the pang of the fangs in his throat and perfect animal that he was he awoke clearheaded and with full comprehension  he closed on batards windpipe with both his hands and rolled out of his furs to get his weight uppermost  but the thousands of batards ancestors had clung at the throats of unnumbered moose and caribou and dragged them down and the wisdom of those ancestors was his  when lecleres weight came on top of him he drove his hind legs upwards and in and clawed down chest and abdomen ripping and tearing through skin and muscle  and when he felt the mans body wince above him and lift he worried and shook at the mans throat  his teammates closed around in a snarling circle and batard with failing breath and fading sense knew that their jaws were hungry for him  but that did not matterit was the man the man above him and he ripped and clawed and shook and worried to the last ounce of his strength  but leclere choked him with both his hands till batards chest heaved and writhed for the air denied and his eyes glazed and set and his jaws slowly loosened and his tongue protruded black and swollen  eh  bon you devil leclere gurgled mouth and throat clogged with his own blood as he shoved the dizzy dog from him  and then leclere cursed the other dogs off as they fell upon batard  they drew back into a wider circle squatting alertly on their haunches and licking their chops the hair on every neck bristling and erect  batard recovered quickly and at sound of lecleres voice tottered to his feet and swayed weakly back and forth  ahah  you beeg devil leclere spluttered  ah fix you ah fix you plentee by gar  batard the air biting into his exhausted lungs like wine flashed full into the mans face his jaws missing and coming together with a metallic clip  they rolled over and over on the snow leclere striking madly with his fists  then they separated face to face and circled back and forth before each other  leclere could have drawn his knife  his rifle was at his feet  but the beast in him was up and raging  he would do the thing with his handsand his teeth  batard sprang in but leclere knocked him over with a blow of the fist fell upon him and buried his teeth to the bone in the dogs shoulder  it was a primordial setting and a primordial scene such as might have been in the savage youth of the world  an open space in a dark forest a ring of grinning wolfdogs and in the centre two beasts locked in combat snapping and snarling raging madly about panting sobbing cursing straining wild with passion in a fury of murder ripping and tearing and clawing in elemental brutishness  but leclere caught batard behind the ear with a blow from his fist knocking him over and for the instant stunning him  then leclere leaped upon him with his feet and sprang up and down striving to grind him into the earth  both batards hind legs were broken ere leclere ceased that he might catch breath  aaah  aaah he screamed incapable of speech shaking his fist through sheer impotence of throat and larynx  but batard was indomitable  he lay there in a helpless welter his lip feebly lifting and writhing to the snarl he had not the strength to utter  leclere kicked him and the tired jaws closed on the ankle but could not break the skin  then leclere picked up the whip and proceeded almost to cut him to pieces at each stroke of the lash crying dis taim ah break you  eh by gar  ah break you  in the end exhausted fainting from loss of blood he crumpled up and fell by his victim and when the wolfdogs closed in to take their vengeance with his last consciousness dragged his body on top of batard to shield him from their fangs  this occurred not far from sunrise and the missionary opening the door to leclere a few hours later was surprised to note the absence of batard from the team  nor did his surprise lessen when leclere threw back the robes from the sled gathered batard into his arms and staggered across the threshold  it happened that the surgeon of mcquestion who was something of a gadabout was up on a gossip and between them they proceeded to repair leclere  merci non said he  do you fix firs de dog  to die  non eet is not good  becos heem ah mus yet break  dat fo wat he mus not die  the surgeon called it a marvel the missionary a miracle that leclere pulled through at all and so weakened was he that in the spring the fever got him and he went on his back again  batard had been in even worse plight but his grip on life prevailed and the bones of his hind legs knit and his organs righted themselves during the several weeks he lay strapped to the floor  and by the time leclere finally convalescent sallow and shaky took the sun by the cabin door batard had reasserted his supremacy among his kind and brought not only his own teammates but the missionarys dogs into subjection  he moved never a muscle nor twitched a hair when for the first time leclere tottered out on the missionarys arm and sank down slowly and with infinite caution on the threelegged stool  bon he said  bon  de good sun  and he stretched out his wasted hands and washed them in the warmth  then his gaze fell on the dog and the old light blazed back in his eyes he touched the missionary lightly on the arm  mon pere dat is one beeg devil dat batard  you will bring me one pistol so dat ah drink de sun in peace  and thenceforth for many days he sat in the sun before the cabin door  he never dozed and the pistol lay always across his knees  batard had a way the first thing each day of looking for the weapon in its wonted place  at sight of it he would lift his lip faintly in token that he understood and leclere would lift his own lip in an answering grin  one day the missionary took note of the trick  bless me he said  i really believe the brute comprehends  leclere laughed softly  look you mon pere  dat wat ah now spik to dat does he lissen  as if in confirmation batard just perceptibly wriggled his lone ear up to catch the sound  ah say keel  batard growled deep down in his throat the hair bristled along his neck and every muscle went tense and expectant  ah lift de gun so like dat  and suiting action to word he sighted the pistol at batard  batard with a single leap sideways landed around the corner of the cabin out of sight  bless me he repeated at intervals  leclere grinned proudly  but why does he not run away  the frenchmans shoulders went up in the racial shrug that means all things from total ignorance to infinite understanding  then why do you not kill him  again the shoulders went up  mon pere he said after a pause de taim is not yet  he is one beeg devil  some taim ah break heem so an so all to leetle bits  hey some taim  bon  a day came when leclere gathered his dogs together and floated down in a bateau to forty mile and on to the porcupine where he took a commission from the p c company and went exploring for the better part of a year after that he poled up the koyokuk to deserted arctic city and later came drifting back from camp to camp along the yukon  and during the long months batard was well lessoned  he learned many tortures and notably the torture of hunger the torture of thirst the torture of fire and worst of all the torture of music  like the rest of his kind he did not enjoy music  it gave him exquisite anguish racking him nerve by nerve and ripping apart every fibre of his being  it made him howl long and wolflife as when the wolves bay the stars on frosty nights  he could not help howling  it was his one weakness in the contest with leclere and it was his shame  leclere on the other hand passionately loved musicas passionately as he loved strong drink  and when his soul clamoured for expression it usually uttered itself in one or the other of the two ways and more usually in both ways  and when he had drunk his brain alilt with unsung song and the devil in him aroused and rampant his soul found its supreme utterance in torturing batard  now we will haf a leetle museek he would say  eh  wat you tink batard  it was only an old and battered harmonica tenderly treasured and patiently repaired but it was the best that money could buy and out of its silver reeds he drew weird vagrant airs that men had never heard before  then batard dumb of throat with teeth tight clenched would back away inch by inch to the farthest cabin corner  and leclere playing playing a stout club tucked under his arm followed the animal up inch by inch step by step till there was no further retreat  at first batard would crowd himself into the smallest possible space grovelling close to the floor but as the music came nearer and nearer he was forced to uprear his back jammed into the logs his fore legs fanning the air as though to beat off the rippling waves of sound  he still kept his teeth together but severe muscular contractions attacked his body strange twitchings and jerkings till he was all aquiver and writhing in silent torment  as he lost control his jaws spasmodically wrenched apart and deep throaty vibrations issued forth too low in the register of sound for human ear to catch  and then nostrils distended eyes dilated hair bristling in helpless rage arose the long wolf howl it came with a slurring rush upwards swelling to a great heartbreaking burst of sound and dying away in sadly cadenced woethen the next rush upward octave upon octave the bursting heart and the infinite sorrow and misery fainting fading falling and dying slowly away  it was fit for hell  and leclere with fiendish ken seemed to divine each particular nerve and heartstring and with long wails and tremblings and sobbing minors to make it yield up its last shred of grief  it was frightful and for twentyfour hours after batard was nervous and unstrung starting at common sounds tripping over his own shadow but withal vicious and masterful with his teammates  nor did he show signs of a breaking spirit  rather did he grow more grim and taciturn biding his time with an inscrutable patience that began to puzzle and weigh upon leclere  the dog would lie in the firelight motionless for hours gazing straight before him at leclere and hating him with his bitter eyes  often the man felt that he had bucked against the very essence of lifethe unconquerable essence that swept the hawk down out of the sky like a feathered thunderbolt that drove the great grey goose across the zones that hurled the spawning salmon through two thousand miles of boiling yukon flood  at such times he felt impelled toexpress his own unconquerable essence and with strong drink wild music and batard he indulged in vast orgies wherein he pitted his puny strength in the face of things and challenged all that was and had been and was yet to be  dere is someting dere he affirmed when the rhythmed vagaries of his mind touched the secret chords of batards being and brought forth the long lugubrious howl  ah pool eet out wid bot my hans so an so ha ha  eet is fonee  eet is ver fonee  de priest chant de womans pray de mans swear de leetle bird go peeppeep batard heem go yowyowan eet is all de ver same ting  ha ha  father gautier a worthy priest one reproved him with instances of concrete perdition  he never reproved him again  eet may be so mon pere he made answer  an ah tink ah go troo hell asnappin lak de hemlock troo de fire  eh mon pere  but all bad things come to an end as well as good and so with black leclere  on the summer low water in a poling boat he left mcdougall for sunrise  he left mcdougall in company with timothy brown and arrived at sunrise by himself  further it was known that they had quarrelled just previous to pulling out for the lizzie a wheezy ten ton sternwheeler twentyfour hours behind beat leclere in by three days  and when he did get in it was with a cleandrilled bullethole through his shoulder muscle and a tale of ambush and murder  a strike had been made at sunrise and things had changed considerably with the infusion of several hundred goldseekers a deal of whisky and halfadozen equipped gamblers the missionary had seen the page of his years of labour with the indians wiped clean  when the squaws became preoccupied with cooking beans and keeping the fire going for the wifeless miners and the bucks with swapping their warm furs for black bottles and broken timepieces he took to his bed said bless me several times and departed to his final accounting in a roughhewn oblong box  whereupon the gamblers moved their roulette and faro tables into the mission house and the click of chips and clink of glasses went up from dawn till dark and to dawn again  now timothy brown was well beloved among these adventurers of the north the one thing against him was his quick temper and ready fista little thing for which his kind heart and forgiving hand more than atoned  on the other hand there was nothing to atone for black leclere  he was black as more than one remembered deed bore witness while he was as well hated as the other was beloved  so the men of sunrise put an antiseptic dressing on his shoulder and haled him before judge lynch  it was a simple affair  he had quarrelled with timothy brown at mcdougall  with timothy brown he had left mcdougall  without timothy brown he had arrived at sunrise  considered in the light of his evilness the unanimous conclusion was that he had killed timothy brown on the other hand leclere acknowledged their facts but challenged their conclusion and gave his own explanation  twenty miles out of sunrise he and timothy brown were poling the boat along the rocky shore  from that shore two rifleshots rang out  timothy brown pitched out of the boat and went down bubbling red and that was the last of timothy brown  he leclere pitched into the bottom of the boat with a stinging shoulder  he lay very quiet peeping at the shore  after a time two indians stuck up their heads and came out to the waters edge carrying between them a birchbark canoe  as they launched it leclere let fly  he potted one who went over the side after the manner of timothy brown  the other dropped into the bottom of the canoe and then canoe and poling boat went down the stream in a drifting battle  after that they hung up on a split current and the canoe passed on one side of an island the poling boat on the other  that was the last of the canoe and he came on into sunrise  yes from the way the indian in the canoe jumped he was sure he had potted him  that was all  this explanation was not deemed adequate  they gave him ten hours grace while the lizzie steamed down to investigate  ten hours later she came wheezing back to sunrise  there had been nothing to investigate  no evidence had been found to back up his statements  they told him to make his will for he possessed a fifty thousand dollar sunrise claim and they were a lawabiding as well as a lawgiving breed  leclere shrugged his shoulders  bot one ting he said a leetle wat you call favoura leetle favour dat is eet  i gif my feefty tousan dollair to de church  i gif my husky dog batard to de devil de leetle favour  firs you hang heem an den you hang me  eet is good eh  good it was they agreed that hells spawn should break trail for his master across the last divide and the court was adjourned down to the river bank where a big spruce tree stood by itself  slackwater charley put a hangmans knot in the end of a haulingline and the noose was slipped over lecleres head and pulled tight around his neck  his hands were tied behind his back and he was assisted to the top of a cracker box  then the running end of the line was passed over an overhanging branch drawn taut and made fast  to kick the box out from under would leave him dancing on the air  now for the dog said webster shaw sometime mining engineer  youll have to rope him slackwater  leclere grinned  slackwater took a chew of tobacco rove a running noose and proceeded leisurely to coil a few turns in his hand  he paused once or twice to brush particularly offensive mosquitoes from off his face  everybody was brushing mosquitoes except leclere about whose head a small cloud was visible  even batard lying fullstretched on the ground with his fore paws rubbed the pests away from eyes and mouth  but while slackwater waited for batard to lift his head a faint call came from the quiet air and a man was seen waving his arms and running across the flat from sunrise  it was the storekeeper  ccall er off boys he panted as he came in among them  little sandy and bernadottes jes got in he explained with returning breath  landed down below an come up by the short cut  got the beaver with m  picked m up in his canoe stuck in a back channel with a couple of bulletholes in m  other buck was klok kutz the one that knocked spots out of his squaw and dusted  eh  wat ah say  eh leclere cried exultantly  dat de one fo sure ah know  ah spik true  the thing to do is to teach these damned siwashes a little manners spoke webster shaw  theyre getting fat and sassy and well have to bring them down a peg  round in all the bucks and string up the beaver for an object lesson  thats the programme  come on and lets see what hes got to say for himself  heh msieu leclere called as the crowd began to melt away through the twilight in the direction of sunrise  ah lak ver moch to see de fon  oh well turn you loose when we come back webster shaw shouted over his shoulder  in the meantime meditate on your sins and the ways of providence  it will do you good so be grateful  as is the way with men who are accustomed to great hazards whose nerves are healthy and trained in patience so it was with leclere who settled himself to the long waitwhich is to say that he reconciled his mind to it  there was no settling of the body for the taut rope forced him to stand rigidly erect  the least relaxation of the leg muscles pressed the roughfibred noose into his neck while the upright position caused him much pain in his wounded shoulder  he projected his under lip and expelled his breath upwards along his face to blow the mosquitoes away from his eyes  but the situation had its compensation  to be snatched from the maw of death was well worth a little bodily suffering only it was unfortunate that he should miss the hanging of the beaver  and so he mused till his eyes chanced to fall upon batard head between fore paws and stretched on the ground asleep  and their leclere ceased to muse  he studied the animal closely striving to sense if the sleep were real or feigned  batards sides were heaving regularly but leclere felt that the breath came and went a shade too quickly also he felt that there was a vigilance or alertness to every hair that belied unshackling sleep  he would have given his sunrise claim to be assured that the dog was not awake and once when one of his joints cracked he looked quickly and guiltily at batard to see if he roused  he did not rouse then but a few minutes later he got up slowly and lazily stretched and looked carefully about him  sacredam said leclere under his breath  assured that no one was in sight or hearing batard sat down curled his upper lip almost into a smile looked up at leclere and licked his chops  ah see my feenish the man said and laughed sardonically aloud  batard came nearer the useless ear wabbling the good ear cocked forward with devilish comprehension  he thrust his head on one side quizzically and advanced with mincing playful steps  he rubbed his body gently against the box till it shook and shook again  leclere teetered carefully to maintain his equilibrium  batard he said calmly look out  ah keel you  batard snarled at the word and shook the box with greater force  then he upreared and with his fore paws threw his weight against it higher up leclere kicked out with one foot but the rope bit into his neck and checked so abruptly as nearly to overbalance him  hi ya  chook  mushon he screamed  batard retreated for twenty feet or so with a fiendish levity in his bearing that leclere could not mistake  he remembered the dog often breaking the scum of ice on the water hole by lifting up and throwing his weight upon it and remembering he understood what he now had in mind batard faced about and paused  he showed his white teeth in a grin which leclere answered and then hurled his body through the air in full charge straight for the box  fifteen minutes later slackwater charley and webster shaw returning caught a glimpse of a ghostly pendulum swinging back and forth in the dim light  as they hurriedly drew in closer they made out the mans inert body and a live thing that clung to it and shook and worried and gave to it the swaying motion  hi ya  chook you spawn of hell yelled webster shaw  but batard glared at him and snarled threateningly without loosing his jaws  slackwater charley got out his revolver but his hand was shaking as with a chill and he fumbled  here you take it he said passing the weapon over  webster shaw laughed shortly drew a sight between the gleaming eyes and pressed the trigger  batards body twitched with the shock threshed the ground spasmodically for a moment and went suddenly limp  but his teeth still held fast locked     the story of jees uck   there have been renunciations and renunciations  but in its essence renunciation is ever the same  and the paradox of it is that men and women forego the dearest thing in the world for something dearer  it was never otherwise  thus it was when abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof  the firstlings and the fat thereof were to him the dearest things in the world yet he gave them over that he might be on good terms with god  so it was with abraham when he prepared to offer up his son isaac on a stone  isaac was very dear to him but god in incomprehensible ways was yet dearer  it may be that abraham feared the lord  but whether that be true or not it has since been determined by a few billion people that he loved the lord and desired to serve him  and since it has been determined that love is service and since to renounce is to serve then jees uck who was merely a woman of a swart skinned breed loved with a great love  she was unversed in history having learned to read only the signs of weather and of game so she had never heard of abel nor of abraham nor having escaped the good sisters at holy cross had she been told the story of ruth the moabitess who renounced her very god for the sake of a stranger woman from a strange land  jees uck had learned only one way of renouncing and that was with a club as the dynamic factor in much the same manner as a dog is made to renounce a stolen marrowbone  yet when the time came she proved herself capable of rising to the height of the fairfaced royal races and of renouncing in right regal fashion  so this is the story of jees uck which is also the story of neil bonner and kitty bonner and a couple of neil bonners progeny  jees uck was of a swartskinned breed it is true but she was not an indian nor was she an eskimo nor even an innuit  going backward into mouth tradition there appears the figure of one skolkz a toyaat indian of the yukon who journeyed down in his youth to the great delta where dwell the innuits and where he foregathered with a woman remembered as olillie  now the woman olillie had been bred from an eskimo mother by an innuit man  and from skolkz and olillie came halie who was onehalf toyaat indian one quarter innuit and onequarter eskimo  and halie was the grandmother of jees uck  now halie in whom three stocks had been bastardized who cherished no prejudice against further admixture mated with a russian fur trader called shpack also known in his time as the big fat  shpack is herein classed russian for lack of a more adequate term for shpacks father a slavonic convict from the lower provinces had escaped from the quicksilver mines into northern siberia where he knew zimba who was a woman of the deer people and who became the mother of shpack who became the grandfather of jees uck  now had not shpack been captured in his boyhood by the sea people who fringe the rim of the arctic sea with their misery he would not have become the grandfather of jees uck and there would be no story at all but he was captured by the sea people from whom he escaped to kamchatka and thence on a norwegian whaleship to the baltic  not long after that he turned up in st petersburg and the years were not many till he went drifting east over the same weary road his father had measured with blood and groans a halfcentury before  but shpack was a free man in the employ of the great russian fur company  and in that employ he fared farther and farther east until he crossed bering sea into russian america and at pastolik which is hard by the great delta of the yukon became the husband of halie who was the grandmother of jees uck  out of this union came the womanchild tukesan  shpack under the orders of the company made a canoe voyage of a few hundred miles up the yukon to the post of nulato  with him he took halie and the babe tukesan  this was in 1850 and in 1850 it was that the river indians fell upon nulato and wiped it from the face of the earth and that was the end of shpack and halie  on that terrible night tukesan disappeared  to this day the toyaats aver they had no hand in the trouble but be that as it may the fact remains that the babe tukesan grew up among them  tukesan was married successively to two toyaat brothers to both of whom she was barren  because of this other women shook their heads and no third toyaat man could be found to dare matrimony with the childless widow  but at this time many hundred miles above at fort yukon was a man spike obrien  fort yukon was a hudson bay company post and spike obrien one of the companys servants  he was a good servant but he achieved an opinion that the service was bad and in the course of time vindicated that opinion by deserting  it was a years journey by the chain of posts back to york factory on hudsons bay  further being company posts he knew he could not evade the companys clutches  nothing retained but to go down the yukon  it was true no white man had ever gone down the yukon and no white man knew whether the yukon emptied into the arctic ocean or bering sea but spike obrien was a celt and the promise of danger was a lure he had ever followed  a few weeks later somewhat battered rather famished and about dead with riverfever he drove the nose of his canoe into the earth bank by the village of the toyaats and promptly fainted away  while getting his strength back in the weeks that followed he looked upon tukesan and found her good  like the father of shpack who lived to a ripe old age among the siberian deer people spike obrien might have left his aged bones with the toyaats  but romance gripped his heartstrings and would not let him stay  as he had journeyed from york factory to fort yukon so first among men might he journey from fort yukon to the sea and win the honour of being the first man to make the northwest passage by land so he departed down the river won the honour and was unannaled and unsung  in after years he ran a sailors boardinghouse in san francisco where he became esteemed a most remarkable liar by virtue of the gospel truths he told  but a child was born to tukesan who had been childless  and this child was jees uck  her lineage has been traced at length to show that she was neither indian nor eskimo nor innuit nor much of anything else also to show what waifs of the generations we are all of us and the strange meanderings of the seed from which we spring  what with the vagrant blood in her and the heritage compounded of many races jees uck developed a wonderful young beauty  bizarre perhaps it was and oriental enough to puzzle any passing ethnologist  a lithe and slender grace characterized her  beyond a quickened lilt to the imagination the contribution of the celt was in no wise apparent  it might possibly have put the warm blood under her skin which made her face less swart and her body fairer but that in turn might have come from shpack the big fat who inherited the colour of his slavonic father  and finally she had great blazing black eyesthe halfcaste eye round fullorbed and sensuous which marks the collision of the dark races with the light  also the white blood in her combined with her knowledge that it was in her made her in a way ambitious otherwise by upbringing and in outlook on life she was wholly and utterly a toyaat indian  one winter when she was a young woman neil bonner came into her life but he came into her life as he had come into the country somewhat reluctantly  in fact it was very much against his will coming into the country  between a father who clipped coupons and cultivated roses and a mother who loved the social round neil bonner had gone rather wild  he was not vicious but a man with meat in his belly and without work in the world has to expend his energy somehow and neil bonner was such a man and he expended his energy in such a fashion and to such extent that when the inevitable climax came his father neil bonner senior crawled out of his roses in a panic and looked on his son with a wondering eye  then he hied himself away to a crony of kindred pursuits with whom he was wont to confer over coupons and roses and between the two the destiny of young neil bonner was made manifest  he must go away on probation to live down his harmless follies in order that he might live up to their own excellent standard  this determined upon and young neil a little repentant and a great deal ashamed the rest was easy  the cronies were heavy stockholders in the p c company  the p c company owned fleets of riversteamers and oceangoing craft and in addition to farming the sea exploited a hundred thousand square miles or so of the land that on the maps of geographers usually occupies the white spaces  so the p c company sent young neil bonner north where the white spaces are to do its work and to learn to be good like his father  five years of simplicity close to the soil and far from temptation will make a man of him said old neil bonner and forthwith crawled back among his roses  young neil set his jaw pitched his chin at the proper angle and went to work  as an underling he did his work well and gained the commendation of his superiors  not that he delighted in the work but that it was the one thing that prevented him from going mad  the first year he wished he was dead  the second year he cursed god  the third year he was divided between the two emotions and in the confusion quarrelled with a man in authority  he had the best of the quarrel though the man in authority had the last worda word that sent neil bonner into an exile that made his old billet appear as paradise  but he went without a whimper for the north had succeeded in making him into a man  here and there on the white spaces on the map little circlets like the letter o are to be found and appended to these circlets on one side or the other are names such as fort hamilton yanana station twenty mile thus leading one to imagine that the white spaces are plentifully besprinkled with towns and villages  but it is a vain imagining  twenty mile which is very like the rest of the posts is a log building the size of a corner grocery with rooms to let upstairs  a longlegged cache on stilts may be found in the back yard also a couple of outhouses  the back yard is unfenced and extends to the skyline and an unascertainable bit beyond  there are no other houses in sight though the toyaats sometimes pitch a winter camp a mile or two down the yukon  and this is twenty mile one tentacle of the manytentacled p c company  here the agent with an assistant barters with the indians for their furs and does an erratic trade on a golddust basis with the wandering miners  here also the agent and his assistant yearn all winter for the spring and when the spring comes camp blasphemously on the roof while the yukon washes out the establishment  and here also in the fourth year of his sojourn in the land came neil bonner to take charge  he had displaced no agent for the man that previously ran the post had made away with himself because of the rigours of the place said the assistant who still remained though the toyaats by their fires had another version  the assistant was a shrunkenshouldered hollowchested man with a cadaverous face and cavernous cheeks that his sparse black beard could not hide  he coughed much as though consumption gripped his lungs while his eyes had that mad fevered light common to consumptives in the last stage  pentley was his nameamos pentleyand bonner did not like him though he felt a pity for the forlorn and hopeless devil they did not get along together these two men who of all men should have been on good terms in the face of the cold and silence and darkness of the long winter  in the end bonner concluded that amos was partly demented and left him alone doing all the work himself except the cooking  even then amos had nothing but bitter looks and an undisguised hatred for him  this was a great loss to bonner for the smiling face of one of his own kind the cheery word the sympathy of comradeship shared with misfortunethese things meant much and the winter was yet young when he began to realize the added reasons with such an assistant that the previous agent had found to impel his own hand against his life  it was very lonely at twenty mile  the bleak vastness stretched away on every side to the horizon  the snow which was really frost flung its mantle over the land and buried everything in the silence of death  for days it was clear and cold the thermometer steadily recording forty to fifty degrees below zero  then a change came over the face of things what little moisture had oozed into the atmosphere gathered into dull grey formless clouds it became quite warm the thermometer rising to twenty below and the moisture fell out of the sky in hard frostgranules that hissed like dry sugar or driving sand when kicked underfoot  after that it became clear and cold again until enough moisture had gathered to blanket the earth from the cold of outer space  that was all  nothing happened  no storms no churning waters and threshing forests nothing but the machinelike precipitation of accumulated moisture  possibly the most notable thing that occurred through the weary weeks was the gliding of the temperature up to the unprecedented height of fifteen below  to atone for this outer space smote the earth with its cold till the mercury froze and the spirit thermometer remained more than seventy below for a fortnight when it burst  there was no telling how much colder it was after that  another occurrence monotonous in its regularity was the lengthening of the nights till day became a mere blink of light between the darkness  neil bonner was a social animal  the very follies for which he was doing penance had been bred of his excessive sociability  and here in the fourth year of his exile he found himself in companywhich were to travesty the wordwith a morose and speechless creature in whose sombre eyes smouldered a hatred as bitter as it was unwarranted  and bonner to whom speech and fellowship were as the breath of life went about as a ghost might go tantalized by the gregarious revelries of some former life  in the day his lips were compressed his face stern but in the night he clenched his hands rolled about in his blankets and cried aloud like a little child  and he would remember a certain man in authority and curse him through the long hours  also he cursed god  but god understands  he cannot find it in his heart to blame weak mortals who blaspheme in alaska  and here to the post of twenty mile came jees uck to trade for flour and bacon and beads and bright scarlet cloths for her fancy work  and further and unwittingly she came to the post of twenty mile to make a lonely man more lonely make him reach out empty arms in his sleep  for neil bonner was only a man  when she first came into the store he looked at her long as a thirsty man may look at a flowing well  and she with the heritage bequeathed her by spike obrien imagined daringly and smiled up into his eyes not as the swartskinned peoples should smile at the royal races but as a woman smiles at a man  the thing was inevitable only he did not see it and fought against her as fiercely and passionately as he was drawn towards her  and she  she was jees uck by upbringing wholly and utterly a toyaat indian woman  she came often to the post to trade  and often she sat by the big wood stove and chatted in broken english with neil bonner  and he came to look for her coming and on the days she did not come he was worried and restless  sometimes he stopped to think and then she was met coldly with a resolve that perplexed and piqued her and which she was convinced was not sincere  but more often he did not dare to think and then all went well and there were smiles and laughter  and amos pentley gasping like a stranded catfish his hollow cough areek with the grave looked upon it all and grinned  he who loved life could not live and it rankled his soul that others should be able to live  wherefore he hated bonner who was so very much alive and into whose eyes sprang joy at the sight of jees uck  as for amos the very thought of the girl was sufficient to send his blood pounding up into a hemorrhage  jees uck whose mind was simple who thought elementally and was unused to weighing life in its subtler quantities read amos pentley like a book  she warned bonner openly and bluntly in few words but the complexities of higher existence confused the situation to him and he laughed at her evident anxiety  to him amos was a poor miserable devil tottering desperately into the grave  and bonner who had suffered much found it easy to forgive greatly  but one morning during a bitter snap he got up from the breakfasttable and went into the store  jees uck was already there rosy from the trail to buy a sack of flour  a few minutes later he was out in the snow lashing the flour on her sled  as he bent over he noticed a stiffness in his neck and felt a premonition of impending physical misfortune  and as he put the last halfhitch into the lashing and attempted to straighten up a quick spasm seized him and he sank into the snow  tense and quivering head jerked back limbs extended back arched and mouth twisted and distorted he appeared as though being racked limb from limb  without cry or sound jees uck was in the snow beside him but he clutched both her wrists spasmodically and as long as the convulsion endured she was helpless  in a few moments the spasm relaxed and he was left weak and fainting his forehead beaded with sweat and his lips flecked with foam  quick he muttered in a strange hoarse voice  quick  inside  he started to crawl on hands and knees but she raised him up and supported by her young arm he made faster progress  as he entered the store the spasm seized him again and his body writhed irresistibly away from her and rolled and curled on the floor  amos pentley came and looked on with curious eyes  oh amos she cried in an agony of apprehension and helplessness him die you think  but amos shrugged his shoulders and continued to look on  bonners body went slack the tense muscles easing down and an expression of relief coming into his face  quick he gritted between his teeth his mouth twisting with the oncoming of the next spasm and with his effort to control it  quick jees uck  the medicine  never mind  drag me  she knew where the medicinechest stood at the rear of the room beyond the stove and thither by the legs she dragged the struggling man  as the spasm passed he began very faint and very sick to overhaul the chest  he had seen dogs die exhibiting symptoms similar to his own and he knew what should be done  he held up a vial of chloral hydrate but his fingers were too weak and nerveless to draw the cork  this jees uck did for him while he was plunged into another convulsion  as he came out of it he found the open bottle proffered him and looked into the great black eyes of the woman and read what men have always read in the matewomans eyes  taking a full dose of the stuff he sank back until another spasm had passed  then he raised himself limply on his elbow  listen jees uck he said very slowly as though aware of the necessity for haste and yet afraid to hasten  do what i say  stay by my side but do not touch me  i must be very quiet but you must not go away his jaw began to set and his face to quiver and distort with the fore running pangs but he gulped and struggled to master them  do not got away  and do not let amos go away  understand  amos must stay right here  she nodded her head and he passed off into the first of many convulsions which gradually diminished in force and frequency  jees uck hung over him remembering his injunction and not daring to touch him once amos grew restless and made as though to go into the kitchen but a quick blaze from her eyes quelled him and after that save for his laboured breathing and charnel cough he was very quiet  bonner slept  the blink of light that marked the day disappeared  amos followed about by the womans eyes lighted the kerosene lamps  evening came on  through the north window the heavens were emblazoned with an auroral display which flamed and flared and died down into blackness some time after that neil bonner roused  first he looked to see that amos was still there then smiled at jees uck and pulled himself up every muscle was stiff and sore and he smiled ruefully pressing and prodding himself as if to ascertain the extent of the ravage  then his face went stern and businesslike  jees uck he said take a candle  go into the kitchen  there is food on the tablebiscuits and beans and bacon also coffee in the pot on the stove  bring it here on the counter  also bring tumblers and water and whisky which you will find on the top shelf of the locker  do not forget the whisky  having swallowed a stiff glass of the whisky he went carefully through the medicine chest now and again putting aside with definite purpose certain bottles and vials  then he set to work on the food attempting a crude analysis  he had not been unused to the laboratory in his college days and was possessed of sufficient imagination to achieve results with his limited materials  the condition of tetanus which had marked his paroxysms simplified matters and he made but one test  the coffee yielded nothing nor did the beans  to the biscuits he devoted the utmost care  amos who knew nothing of chemistry looked on with steady curiosity  but jees uck who had boundless faith in the white mans wisdom and especially in neil bonners wisdom and who not only knew nothing but knew that she knew nothing watched his face rather than his hands  step by step he eliminated possibilities until he came to the final test  he was using a thin medicine vial for a tube and this he held between him and the light watching the slow precipitation of a salt through the solution contained in the tube  he said nothing but he saw what he had expected to see  and jees uck her eyes riveted on his face saw something toosomething that made her spring like a tigress upon amos and with splendid suppleness and strength bend his body back across her knee  her knife was out of its sheaf and uplifted glinting in the lamplight  amos was snarling but bonner intervened ere the blade could fall  thats a good girl jees uck  but never mind  let him go  she dropped the man obediently though with protest writ large on her face and his body thudded to the floor  bonner nudged him with his moccasined foot  get up amos he commanded  youve got to pack an outfit yet tonight and hit the trail  you dont mean to say amos blurted savagely  i mean to say that you tried to kill me neil went on in cold even tones  i mean to say that you killed birdsall for all the company believes he killed himself  you used strychnine in my case  god knows with what you fixed him  now i cant hang you  youre too near dead as it is  but twenty mile is too small for the pair of us and youve got to mush  its two hundred miles to holy cross  you can make it if youre careful not to overexert  ill give you grub a sled and three dogs  youll be as safe as if you were in jail for you cant get out of the country  and ill give you one chance  youre almost dead  very well  i shall send no word to the company until the spring  in the meantime the thing for you to do is to die  now mush  you go to bed jees uck insisted when amos had churned away into the night towards holy cross  you sick man yet neil  and youre a good girl jees uck he answered  and heres my hand on it  but you must go home  you dont like me she said simply  he smiled helped her on with her parka and led her to the door  only too well jees uck he said softly only too well  after that the pall of the arctic night fell deeper and blacker on the land  neil bonner discovered that he had failed to put proper valuation upon even the sullen face of the murderous and deathstricken amos  it became very lonely at twenty mile  for the love of god prentiss send me a man he wrote to the agent at fort hamilton three hundred miles up river  six weeks later the indian messenger brought back a reply  it was characteristic hell  both feet frozen  need him myselfprentiss  to make matters worse most of the toyaats were in the back country on the flanks of a caribou herd and jees uck was with them  removing to a distance seemed to bring her closer than ever and neil bonner found himself picturing her day by day in camp and on trail  it is not good to be alone  often he went out of the quiet store bareheaded and frantic and shook his fist at the blink of day that came over the southern skyline  and on still cold nights he left his bed and stumbled into the frost where he assaulted the silence at the top of his lungs as though it were some tangible sentiment thing that he might arouse or he shouted at the sleeping dogs till they howled and howled again  one shaggy brute he brought into the post playing that it was the new man sent by prentiss  he strove to make it sleep decently under blankets at nights and to sit at table and eat as a man should but the beast mere domesticated wolf that it was rebelled and sought out dark corners and snarled and bit him in the leg and was finally beaten and driven forth  then the trick of personification seized upon neil bonner and mastered him  all the forces of his environment metamorphosed into living breathing entities and came to live with him  he recreated the primitive pantheon reared an altar to the sun and burned candle fat and bacon grease thereon and in the unfenced yard by the longlegged cache made a frost devil which he was wont to make faces at and mock when the mercury oozed down into the bulb  all this in play of course  he said it to himself that it was in play and repeated it over and over to make sure unaware that madness is ever prone to express itself in makebelieve and play  one midwinter day father champreau a jesuit missionary pulled into twenty mile  bonner fell upon him and dragged him into the post and clung to him and wept until the priest wept with him from sheer compassion  then bonner became madly hilarious and made lavish entertainment swearing valiantly that his guest should not depart  but father champreau was pressing to salt water on urgent business for his order and pulled out next morning with bonners blood threatened on his head  and the threat was in a fair way toward realization when the toyaats returned from their long hunt to the winter camp  they had many furs and there was much trading and stir at twenty mile  also jees uck came to buy beads and scarlet cloths and things and bonner began to find himself again  he fought for a week against her  then the end came one night when she rose to leave  she had not forgotten her repulse and the pride that drove spike obrien on to complete the northwest passage by land was her pride  i go now she said goodnight neil  but he came up behind her  nay it is not well he said  and as she turned her face toward his with a sudden joyful flash he bent forward slowly and gravely as it were a sacred thing and kissed her on the lips  the toyaats had never taught her the meaning of a kiss upon the lips but she understood and was glad  with the coming of jees uck at once things brightened up  she was regal in her happiness a source of unending delight  the elemental workings of her mind and her naive little ways made an immense sum of pleasurable surprise to the overcivilized man that had stooped to catch her up  not alone was she solace to his loneliness but her primitiveness rejuvenated his jaded mind  it was as though after long wandering he had returned to pillow his head in the lap of mother earth  in short in jees uck he found the youth of the worldthe youth and the strength and the joy  and to fill the full round of his need and that they might not see overmuch of each other there arrived at twenty mile one sandy macpherson as companionable a man as ever whistled along the trail or raised a ballad by a campfire  a jesuit priest had run into his camp a couple of hundred miles up the yukon in the nick of time to say a last word over the body of sandys partner  and on departing the priest had said my son you will be lonely now  and sandy had bowed his head brokenly  at twenty mile the priest added there is a lonely man you have need of each other my son  so it was that sandy became a welcome third at the post brother to the man and woman that resided there  he took bonner moosehunting and wolf trapping and in return bonner resurrected a battered and wayworn volume and made him friends with shakespeare till sandy declaimed iambic pentameters to his sleddogs whenever they waxed mutinous  and of the long evenings they played cribbage and talked and disagreed about the universe the while jees uck rocked matronly in an easychair and darned their moccasins and socks  spring came  the sun shot up out of the south  the land exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton  everywhere light laughed and life invited  the days stretched out their balmy length and the nights passed from blinks of darkness to no darkness at all  the river bared its bosom and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness  there were stir and bustle new faces and fresh facts  an assistant arrived at twenty mile and sandy macpherson wandered off with a bunch of prospectors to invade the koyokuk country  and there were newspapers and magazines and letters for neil bonner  and jees uck looked on in worriment for she knew his kindred talked with him across the world  without much shock it came to him that his father was dead  there was a sweet letter of forgiveness dictated in his last hours  there were official letters from the company graciously ordering him to turn the post over to the assistant and permitting him to depart at his earliest pleasure  a long legal affair from the lawyers informed him of interminable lists of stocks and bonds real estate rents and chattels that were his by his fathers will  and a dainty bit of stationery sealed and monogramed implored dear neils return to his heartbroken and loving mother  neil bonner did some swift thinking and when the yukon belle coughed in to the bank on her way down to bering sea he departeddeparted with the ancient lie of quick return young and blithe on his lips  ill come back dear jees uck before the first snow flies he promised her between the last kisses at the gangplank  and not only did he promise but like the majority of men under the same circumstances he really meant it  to john thompson the new agent he gave orders for the extension of unlimited credit to his wife jees uck also with his last look from the deck of the yukon belle he saw a dozen men at work rearing the logs that were to make the most comfortable house along a thousand miles of river frontthe house of jees uck and likewise the house of neil bonnerere the first flurry of snow  for he fully and fondly meant to come back  jees uck was dear to him and further a golden future awaited the north  with his fathers money he intended to verify that future  an ambitious dream allured him  with his four years of experience and aided by the friendly cooperation of the p c company he would return to become the rhodes of alaska  and he would return fast as steam could drive as soon as he had put into shape the affairs of his father whom he had never known and comforted his mother whom he had forgotten  there was much ado when neil bonner came back from the arctic  the fires were lighted and the fleshpots slung and he took of it all and called it good  not only was he bronzed and creased but he was a new man under his skin with a grip on things and a seriousness and control  his old companions were amazed when he declined to hit up the pace in the good old way while his fathers crony rubbed hands gleefully and became an authority upon the reclamation of wayward and idle youth  for four years neil bonners mind had lain fallow  little that was new had been added to it but it had undergone a process of selection  it had so to say been purged of the trivial and superfluous  he had lived quick years down in the world and up in the wilds time had been given him to organize the confused mass of his experiences  his superficial standards had been flung to the winds and new standards erected on deeper and broader generalizations  concerning civilization he had gone away with one set of values had returned with another set of values  aided also by the earth smells in his nostrils and the earth sights in his eyes he laid hold of the inner significance of civilization beholding with clear vision its futilities and powers  it was a simple little philosophy he evolved  clean living was the way to grace  duty performed was sanctification  one must live clean and do his duty in order that he might work  work was salvation  and to work toward life abundant and more abundant was to be in line with the scheme of things and the will of god  primarily he was of the city  and his fresh earth grip and virile conception of humanity gave him a finer sense of civilization and endeared civilization to him  day by day the people of the city clung closer to him and the world loomed more colossal  and day by day alaska grew more remote and less real  and then he met kitty sharona woman of his own flesh and blood and kind a woman who put her hand into his hand and drew him to her till he forgot the day and hour and the time of the year the first snow flies on the yukon  jees uck moved into her grand loghouse and dreamed away three golden summer months  then came the autumn posthaste before the down rush of winter  the air grew thin and sharp the days thin and short  the river ran sluggishly and skin ice formed in the quiet eddies  all migratory life departed south and silence fell upon the land  the first snow flurries came and the last homing steamboat bucked desperately into the running mush ice  then came the hard ice solid cakes and sheets till the yukon ran level with its banks  and when all this ceased the river stood still and the blinking days lost themselves in the darkness  john thompson the new agent laughed but jees uck had faith in the mischances of sea and river  neil bonner might be frozen in anywhere between chilkoot pass and st michaels for the last travellers of the year are always caught by the ice when they exchange boat for sled and dash on through the long hours behind the flying dogs  but no flying dogs came up the trail nor down the trail to twenty mile and john thompson told jees uck with a certain gladness ill concealed that bonner would never come back again  also and brutally he suggested his own eligibility  jees uck laughed in his face and went back to her grand loghouse  but when midwinter came when hope dies down and life is at its lowest ebb jees uck found she had no credit at the store  this was thompsons doing and he rubbed his hands and walked up and down and came to his door and looked up at jees ucks house and waited  and he continued to wait  she sold her dogteam to a party of miners and paid cash for her food  and when thompson refused to honour even her coin toyaat indians made her purchases and sledded them up to her house in the dark  in february the first post came in over the ice and john thompson read in the society column of a fivemonthsold paper of the marriage of neil bonner and kitty sharon  jees uck held the door ajar and him outside while he imparted the information and when he had done laughed pridefully and did not believe  in march and all alone she gave birth to a manchild a brave bit of new life at which she marvelled  and at that hour a year later neil bonner sat by another bed marvelling at another bit of new life that had fared into the world  the snow went off the ground and the ice broke out of the yukon  the sun journeyed north and journeyed south again and the money from the being spent jees uck went back to her own people  oche ish a shrewd hunter proposed to kill the meat for her and her babe and catch the salmon if she would marry him  and imego and hah yo and wy nooch husky young hunters all made similar proposals  but she elected to live alone and seek her own meat and fish  she sewed moccasins and parkas and mittenswarm serviceable things and pleasing to the eye withal what of the ornamental hairtufts and beadwork  these she sold to the miners who were drifting faster into the land each year  and not only did she win food that was good and plentiful but she laid money by and one day took passage on the yukon belle down the river  at st michaels she washed dishes in the kitchen of the post  the servants of the company wondered at the remarkable woman with the remarkable child though they asked no questions and she vouchsafed nothing  but just before bering sea closed in for the year she bought a passage south on a strayed sealing schooner  that winter she cooked for captain markheims household at unalaska and in the spring continued south to sitka on a whisky sloop  later on appeared at metlakahtla which is near to st marys on the end of the panhandle where she worked in the cannery through the salmon season  when autumn came and the siwash fishermen prepared to return to puget sound she embarked with a couple of families in a big cedar canoe and with them she threaded the hazardous chaos of the alaskan and canadian coasts till the straits of juan de fuca were passed and she led her boy by the hand up the hard pave of seattle  there she met sandy macpherson on a windy corner very much surprised and when he had heard her story very wrothnot so wroth as he might have been had he known of kitty sharon but of her jees uck breathed not a word for she had never believed  sandy who read commonplace and sordid desertion into the circumstance strove to dissuade her from her trip to san francisco where neil bonner was supposed to live when he was at home  and having striven he made her comfortable bought her tickets and saw her off the while smiling in her face and muttering dam shame into his beard  with roar and rumble through daylight and dark swaying and lurching between the dawns soaring into the winter snows and sinking to summer valleys skirting depths leaping chasms piercing mountains jees uck and her boy were hurled south  but she had no fear of the iron stallion nor was she stunned by this masterful civilization of neil bonners people  it seemed rather that she saw with greater clearness the wonder that a man of such godlike race had held her in his arms  the screaming medley of san francisco with its restless shipping belching factories and thundering traffic did not confuse her instead she comprehended swiftly the pitiful sordidness of twenty mile and the skin lodged toyaat village  and she looked down at the boy that clutched her hand and wondered that she had borne him by such a man  she paid the hackdriver five pieces and went up the stone steps of neil bonners front door  a slanteyed japanese parleyed with her for a fruitless space then led her inside and disappeared  she remained in the hall which to her simply fancy seemed to be the guestroomthe show place wherein were arrayed all the household treasures with the frank purpose of parade and dazzlement  the walls and ceiling were of oiled and panelled redwood  the floor was more glassy than glareice and she sought standing place on one of the great skins that gave a sense of security to the polished surface  a huge fireplacean extravagant fireplace she deemed ityawned in the farther wall  a flood of light mellowed by stained glass fell across the room and from the far end came the white gleam of a marble figure  this much she saw and more when the slanteyed servant led the way past another roomof which she caught a fleeting glanceand into a third both of which dimmed the brave show of the entrance hall  and to her eyes the great house seemed to hold out the promise of endless similar rooms  there was such length and breadth to them and the ceilings were so far away  for the first time since her advent into the white mans civilization a feeling of awe laid hold of her  neil her neil lived in this house breathed the air of it and lay down at night and slept it was beautiful all this that she saw and it pleased her but she felt also the wisdom and mastery behind  it was the concrete expression of power in terms of beauty and it was the power that she unerringly divined  and then came a woman queenly tall crowned with a glory of hair that was like a golden sun  she seemed to come toward jees uck as a ripple of music across still water her sweeping garment itself a song her body playing rhythmically beneath  jees uck herself was a man compeller there were oche ish and imego and hah yo and wy nooch to say nothing of neil bonner and john thompson and other white men that had looked upon her and felt her power  but she gazed upon the wide blue eyes and rose white skin of this woman that advanced to meet her and she measured her with womans eyes looking through mans eyes and as a man compeller she felt herself diminish and grow insignificant before this radiant and flashing creature  you wish to see my husband the woman asked and jees uck gasped at the liquid silver of a voice that had never sounded harsh cries at snarling wolfdogs nor moulded itself to a guttural speech nor toughened in storm and frost and camp smoke  no jees uck answered slowly and gropingly in order that she might do justice to her english  i come to see neil bonner  he is my husband the woman laughed  then it was true  john thompson had not lied that bleak february day when she laughed pridefully and shut the door in his face  as once she had thrown amos pentley across her knee and ripped her knife into the air so now she felt impelled to spring upon this woman and bear her back and down and tear the life out of her fair body  but jees uck was thinking quickly and gave no sign and kitty bonner little dreamed how intimately she had for an instant been related with sudden death  jees uck nodded her head that she understood and kitty bonner explained that neil was expected at any moment  then they sat down on ridiculously comfortable chairs and kitty sought to entertain her strange visitor and jees uck strove to help her  you knew my husband in the north kitty asked once  sure  i wash um clothes jees uck had answered her english abruptly beginning to grow atrocious  and this is your boy  i have a little girl  kitty caused her daughter to be brought and while the children after their manner struck an acquaintance the mothers indulged in the talk of mothers and drank tea from cups so fragile that jees uck feared lest hers should crumble to pieces beneath her fingers  never had she seen such cups so delicate and dainty  in her mind she compared them with the woman who poured the tea and there uprose in contrast the gourds and pannikins of the toyaat village and the clumsy mugs of twenty mile to which she likened herself  and in such fashion and such terms the problem presented itself  she was beaten  there was a woman other than herself better fitted to bear and upbring neil bonners children  just as his people exceeded her people so did his womankind exceed her  they were the man compellers as their men were the world compellers  she looked at the rosewhite tenderness of kitty bonners skin and remembered the sunbeat on her own face  likewise she looked from brown hand to whitethe one workworn and hardened by whiphandle and paddle the other as guiltless of toil and soft as a newborn babes  and for all the obvious softness and apparent weakness jees uck looked into the blue eyes and saw the mastery she had seen in neil bonners eyes and in the eyes of neil bonners people  why its jees uck neil bonner said when he entered  he said it calmly with even a ring of joyful cordiality coming over to her and shaking both her hands but looking into her eyes with a worry in his own that she understood  hello neil she said  you look much good  fine fine jees uck he answered heartily though secretly studying kitty for some sign of what had passed between the two  yet he knew his wife too well to expect even though the worst had passed such a sign  well i cant say how glad i am to see you he went on  whats happened  did you strike a mine  and when did you get in  ooa i get in today she replied her voice instinctively seeking its guttural parts  i no strike it neil  you known capn markheim unalaska  i cook his house long time  no spend money  bimeby plenty  pretty good i think go down and see white mans land  very fine white mans land very fine she added  her english puzzled him for sandy and he had sought constantly to better her speech and she had proved an apt pupil  now it seemed that she had sunk back into her race  her face was guileless stolidly guileless giving no cue  kittys untroubled brow likewise baffled him  what had happened  how much had been said and how much guessed  while he wrestled with these questions and while jees uck wrestled with her problemnever had he looked so wonderful and greata silence fell  to think that you knew my husband in alaska kitty said softly  knew him  jees uck could not forbear a glance at the boy she had borne him and his eyes followed hers mechanically to the window where played the two children  an iron hand seemed to tighten across his forehead his knees went weak and his heart leaped up and pounded like a fist against his breast  his boy  he had never dreamed it  little kitty bonner fairylike in gauzy lawn with pinkest of cheeks and bluest of dancing eyes arms outstretched and lips puckered in invitation was striving to kiss the boy  and the boy lean and lithe sunbeaten and browned skinclad and in hairfringed and hairtufted muclucs that showed the wear of the sea and rough work coolly withstood her advances his body straight and stiff with the peculiar erectness common to children of savage people  a stranger in a strange land unabashed and unafraid he appeared more like an untamed animal silent and watchful his black eyes flashing from face to face quiet so long as quiet endured but prepared to spring and fight and tear and scratch for life at the first sign of danger  the contrast between boy and girl was striking but not pitiful  there was too much strength in the boy for that waif that he was of the generations of shpack spike obrien and bonner  in his features clean cut as a cameo and almost classic in their severity there were the power and achievement of his father and his grandfather and the one known as the big fat who was captured by the sea people and escaped to kamchatka  neil bonner fought his emotion down swallowed it down and choked over it though his face smiled with goodhumour and the joy with which one meets a friend  your boy eh jees uck he said  and then turning to kitty handsome fellow  hell do something with those two hands of his in this our world  kitty nodded concurrence  what is your name she asked  the young savage flashed his quick eyes upon her and dwelt over her for a space seeking out as it were the motive beneath the question  neil he answered deliberately when the scrutiny had satisfied him  injun talk jees uck interposed glibly manufacturing languages on the spur of the moment  him injun talk neeal all the same cracker him baby him like cracker him cry for cracker  him say neeal neeal all time him say neeal  then i say that um name  so um name all time neeal  never did sound more blessed fall upon neil bonners ear than that lie from jees ucks lips  it was the cue and he knew there was reason for kittys untroubled brow  and his father kitty asked  he must be a fine man  ooa yes was the reply  um father fine man  sure  did you know him neil queried kitty  know him  most intimately neil answered and harked back to dreary twenty mile and the man alone in the silence with his thoughts  and here might well end the story of jees uck but for the crown she put upon her renunciation  when she returned to the north to dwell in her grand loghouse john thompson found that the p c company could make a shift somehow to carry on its business without his aid  also the new agent and the succeeding agents received instructions that the woman jees uck should be given whatsoever goods and grub she desired in whatsoever quantities she ordered and that no charge should be placed upon the books  further the company paid yearly to the woman jees uck a pension of five thousand dollars  when he had attained suitable age father champreau laid hands upon the boy and the time was not long when jees uck received letters regularly from the jesuit college in maryland  later on these letters came from italy and still later from france  and in the end there returned to alaska one father neil a man mighty for good in the land who loved his mother and who ultimately went into a wider field and rose to high authority in the order  jees uck was a young woman when she went back into the north and men still looked upon her and yearned  but she lived straight and no breath was ever raised save in commendation  she stayed for a while with the good sisters at holy cross where she learned to read and write and became versed in practical medicine and surgery  after that she returned to her grand loghouse and gathered about her the young girls of the toyaat village to show them the way of their feet in the world  it is neither protestant nor catholic this school in the house built by neil bonner for jees uck his wife but the missionaries of all the sects look upon it with equal favour  the latchstring is always out and tired prospectors and trailweary men turn aside from the flowing river or frozen trail to rest there for a space and be warm by her fire  and down in the states kitty bonner is pleased at the interest her husband takes in alaskan education and the large sums he devotes to that purpose and though she often smiles and chaffs deep down and secretly she is but the prouder of him
