  the poems included in this volume consist of thirteen longer or more important works written at various periods between june 1816 and october 1821 of eight occasional pieces poems of julyseptember 1816 written in 1816 and of another collection of occasional pieces poems 18161823 written at intervals between november 1816 and september 1823 of this second group of minor poems five are now printed and published for the first time  the volume is not coextensive with the work of the period the third and fourth cantos of childe harold 18161817 the first five cantos of don juan 1818 1819 1820 sardanapalus the two foscari cain and heaven and earth 1821 form parts of other volumes but in spite of these notable exceptions the fourth volume contains the work of the poets maturity which is and must ever remain famous byron was not content to write on one kind of subject or to confine himself to one branch or species of poetry he tracked the footsteps now of this master poet now of another far outstripping some of his models soon spent in the pursuit of others even in his own lifetime and in the heyday of his fame his friendliest critics who applauded him to the echo perceived that the manifold motions of his versatile and unsleeping talent were not always sanctioned or blessed by his genius hence the unevenness of his work the different values of this or that poem but even so in width of compass in variety of style and in measure of success his achievement was unparalleled take such poems as manfred or mazeppa which have left their mark on the literature of europe as beppo the avant courrier of don juan or the inimitable vision of judgment which the hungry generations have not trodden down or despoiled of its freshness not one of these poems suggests or resembles the other but each has its crowd of associations a history and almost a literature of its own  the whole of this volume was written on foreign soil in switzerland or italy and putting aside the dream the monody on the death of sheridan the irish avatar and the blues the places the persons and events the matériel of the volume as a whole to say nothing of the style and metre of the poems are derived from the history and the literature of switzerland and southern europe an unwilling at times a vindictive exile he did more than any other poet or writer of his age to familiarize his own countrymen with the scenery the art and letters of the continent and conversely to make the existence of english literature or at least the writings of one englishman known to frenchmen and italians to the teuton and the slav if he taught us little as prophet or moralist as a guide to knowledge as an educator of the general readeryour british blackguard as he was pleased to call himhis teaching and influence were in widest commonalty spread  questions with regard to his personality his morals his theological opinions his qualifications as an artist his grammar his technique and so forth have perhaps inevitably absorbed the attention of friend and foe and the one point on which all might agree has been overlooked namely the fact that he taught us a great deal which it is desirable and agreeable to knowwhich has passed into common knowledge through the medium of his poetry it is true that he wrote his plays and poems at lightning speed and that if he was at pains to correct some obvious blunders he expended but little labour on picking his phrases or polishing his lines but it is also true that he read widely and studied diligently in order to prepare himself for an outpouring of verse and that so far from being a superficial observer or inaccurate recorder his authority is worth quoting in questions of fact and points of detail  the appreciation of poetry is a matter of taste and still more of temperament readers cannot be coerced into admiration or scolded into disapproval and contempt but if they are willing or can be persuaded to read with some particularity and attention the writings of the illustrious dead not entirely as partisans or with the view to dethroning other monarchs of parnassus they will divine the secret of their fame and will understand perhaps recover the first rapture of contemporaries  byron sneered and carped at southey as a scribbler of all works he was himself a reader of all works and without some measure of booklearning and not a little research the force and significance of his various numbers are weakened or obliterated  it is with the hope of supplying this modicum of booklearning that the introductions and notes in this and other volumes have been compiled  i desire to acknowledge with thanks the courteous response of mons j capré commandant of the castle of chillon to a letter of inquiry with regard to the souterrains de chillon  i have to express my gratitude to sir henry irving to mr joseph knight and to mr f e taylor for valuable information concerning the stage

lausanne where byron and shelley were detained two days in a small inn hôtel de lancre now dangleterre by the weather byrons letter to murray dated june 27 but 28 1816 does not precisely tally with shelleys journal contained in a letter to peacock july 12 1816 prose works of p b shelley 1880 ii 171 sq but if shelleys first date june 23 is correct it follows that the two poets visited the castle of chillon on wednesday june 26 reached ouchy on thursday june 27 and began their homeward voyage on saturday june 29 shelley misdates it june 30 on this reckoning the prisoner of chillon was begun and finished between thursday june 27 and saturday june 29 1816 whenever or wherever begun it was completed by july 10 see memoir of john murray 1891 i 364 and was ready for transmission to england by july 25 the ms in claires handwriting was placed in murrays hands on october 11 and the poem with seven others was published december 5 1816  in a final note to the prisoner of chillon first edition 1816 p 59 byron confesses that when the foregoing poem was composed he knew too little of the history of bonnivard to do justice to his courage and virtues and appends as a note to the sonnet on chillon some account of his life  furnished by the kindness of a citizen of that republic ie geneva the note which is now entitled advertisement is taken bodily from the pages of a work published in 1786 by the swiss naturalist jean senebier who died in 1809 it was not byrons way to invent imaginary authorities but rather to give his references with some pride and particularity and it is possible that this unacknowledged and hitherto unverified account was supplied by some literary acquaintance who failed to explain that his information was common property be that as it may senebiers prose is in some respects as unhistorical as byrons verse and stands in need of some corrections and additions  françois bonivard there is no contemporary authority for bonnivard was born in 1493 in early youth 1510 he became by inheritance prior of st victor a monastery outside the walls of geneva and on reaching manhood 1514 he accepted the office and the benefice la dignité ecclésiastique de prieur et de la seigneurie temporelle de st victor a lover of independence a child of the later renaissance in a word a genevese he threw in his lot with a band of ardent reformers and patriots who were conspiring to shake off the yoke of duke charles iii of savoy and convert the city into a republic here is his own testimony dès que jeus commencé de lire lhistoire des nations je me sentis entrainé par un goût prononcé pour les républiques dont jépousai toujours les intérêts hence in a great measure the unrelenting enmity of the duke who not only ousted him from his priory but caused him to be shut up for two years at grolée gex and belley and again after he had been liberated on a second occasion ordered him a safe conduct notwithstanding to be seized and confined in the castle of chillon here he remained from 1530 to february 1 1536 when he was released by the bernese  for the first two years he was lodged in a room near the governors quarters and was fairly comfortable but a day came when the duke paid a visit to chillon and then he writes the captain thrust me into a cell lower than the lake where i lived four years i know not whether he did it by the dukes orders or of his own accord but sure it is that i had so much leisure for walking that i wore in the rock which was the pavement a track or little path as it had been made with a hammer chroniques des ligues de stumpf addition de bonivard  after he had been liberated par la grace de dieu donnee a messrs de berne he returned to geneva and was made a member of the council of the state and awarded a house and a pension of two hundred crowns a year a long life was before him which he proceeded to spend in characteristic fashion finely and honourably as scholar author and reformer but with little selfregard or selfrespect as a private citizen he was married no less than four times and not one of these alliances was altogether satisfactory or creditable determined to warm both hands before the fire of life he was prone to ignore the prejudices and even the decencies of his fellowcitizens now incurring their displeasure and now again as one who had greatly testified for truth and freedom being taken back

               advertisement  when this poema was composed i was not sufficiently aware of the history of bonnivard or i should have endeavoured to dignify the subject by an attempt to celebrate his courage and his virtues with some account of his life i have been furnished by the kindness of a citizen of that republic which is still proud of the memory of a man worthy of the best age of ancient freedom  françois de bonnivard fils de louis de bonnivard originaire de seyssel et seigneur de lunes naquit en 1496 il fit ses études à turin en 1510 jean aimé de bonnivard son oncle lui résigna le prieuré de st victor qui aboutissoit aux murs de genève et qui formait un bénéfice considérable  ce grand hommebonnivard mérite ce litre par la force de son âme la droiture de son coeur la noblesse de ses intentions la sagesse de ses conseils le courage de ses démarches létendue de ses connaissances et la vivacité de son espritce grand homme qui excitera ladmiration de tous ceux quune vertu héroïque peut encore émouvoir inspirera encore la plus vive reconnaissance dans les coeurs des genevois qui aiment genève bonnivard en fut toujours un des plus fermes appuis pour assurer la liberté de notre république il ne craignit pas de perdre souvent la sienne il oublia son repos il méprisa ses richesses il ne négligea rien pour affermir le bonheur dune patrie quil honora de son choix dès ce moment il la chérit comme le plus zélé de ses citoyens il la servit avec lintrépidité dun héros et il écrivit son histoire avec la naïveté dun philosophe et la chaleur dun patriote  il dit dans le commencement de son histoire de genève que dès quil eut commencé de lire lhistoire des nations il se sentit entraîné par son goût pour les républiques dont il épousa toujours les intérêts cest ce goût pour la liberté qui lui fit sans doute adopter genève pour sa patrie  bonnivard encore jeune sannonça hautement comme le défenseur de genève contre le duc de savoye et levêque  en 1519 bonnivard devient le martyr de sa patrie le duc de savoye étant entré dans genève avec cinq cent hommes bonnivard craint le ressentiment du duc il voulut se retirer à fribourg pour en éviter les suites mais il fut trahi par deux hommes qui laccompagnaient et conduit par ordre du prince à grolée où il resta prisonnier pendant deux ans bonnivard était malheureux dans ses voyages comme ses malheurs navaient point ralenti son zèle pour genève il était toujours un ennemi redoutable pour ceux qui la menaçaient et par conséquent il devait être exposé à leurs coups il fut rencontré en 1530 sur le jura par des voleurs qui le dépouillèrent et qui le mirent encore entre les mains du duc de savoye ce prince le fit enfermer dans le château de chillon où il resta sans être interrogé jusques en 1536 il fut alors delivré par les bernois qui semparèrent du paysdevaud  bonnivard en sortant de sa captivité eut le plaisir de trouver genève libre et réformée la république sempressa de lui témoigner sa reconnaissance et de le dédommager des maux quil avoit soufferts elle le reçut bourgeois de la ville au mois de juin 1536 elle lui donna la maison habitée autrefois par le vicairegénéral et elle lui assigna une pension de deux cent écus dor tant quil séjournerait à genève il fut admis dans le conseil des deuxcent en 1537  bonnivard na pas fini dêtre utile après avoir travaillé à rendre genève libre il réussit à la rendre tolérante bonnivard engagea le conseil à accorder aux ecclésiastiques et aux paysans un tems suffisant pour examiner les propositions quon leur faisait il réussit par sa douceur on prêche toujours le christianisme avec succès quand on le prêche avec charité  bonnivard fut savant ses manuscrits qui sont dans la bibliothèque publique prouvent quil avait bien lu les auteurs classiques latins et quil avait approfondi la théologie et lhistoire ce grand homme aimait les sciences et il croyait quelles pouvaient faire la gloire de genève aussi il ne négligea rien pour les fixer dans cette ville naissante en 1551 il donna sa bibliothèque au public elle fut le commencement de notre bibliothèque publique et ces livres sont en partie les rares et belles éditions du quinzième siècle quon voit dans notre collection enfin pendant la même année ce bon patriote institua la république son héritière à condition quelle employerait ses biens à entretenir le collège dont on projettait la fondation  il parait que bonnivard mourut en 1570 mais on ne peut lassurer parcequil y a une lacune dans le nécrologe depuis le mois de juillet 1570 jusques en 1571histoire littéraire

in a single night3     as mens have grown from sudden fears     my limbs are bowed though not with toil       but rusted with a vile reposeb     for they have been a dungeons spoil       and mine has been the fate of those     to whom the goodly earth and air     are banned4 and barredforbidden fare                         10     but this was for my fathers faith     i suffered chains and courted death     that father perished at the stake     for tenets he would not forsake     and for the same his lineal race     in darkness found a dwelling place     we were sevenwho now are one5       six in youth and one in age     finished as they had begun       proud of persecutions ragec                                  20     one in fire and two in field     their belief with blood have sealed     dying as their father died     for the god their foes denied     three were in a dungeon cast     of whom this wreck is left the last                          ii      there are seven pillars of gothic mould6     in chillons dungeons deep and old     there are seven columns massy and grey     dim with a dull imprisoned ray                                    30     a sunbeam which hath lost its way     and through the crevice and the cleft     of the thick wall is fallen and left     creeping oer the floor so damp     like a marshs meteor lamp7     and in each pillar there is a ring8       and in each ring there is a chain     that iron is a cankering thing       for in these limbs its teeth remain     with marks that will not wear away                                40     till i have done with this new day     which now is painful to these eyes     which have not seen the sun so rise     for yearsi cannot count them oer     i lost their long and heavy score     when my last brother drooped and died     and i lay living by his side                          iii      they chained us each to a column stone     and we were threeyet each alone     we could not move a single pace                                   50     we could not see each others face     but with that pale and livid light     that made us strangers in our sight     and thus togetheryet apart     fettered in hand but joined in heartd     twas still some solace in the dearth     of the pure elements of earth     to hearken to each others speech     and each turn comforter to each     with some new hope or legend old                                 60     or song heroically bold     but even these at length grew cold     our voices took a dreary tone     an echo of the dungeon stone         a grating sound not full and free         as they of yore were wont to be         it might be fancybut to me     they never sounded like our own                          iv      i was the eldest of the three       and to uphold and cheer the rest                                 70       i ought to doand did my best     and each did well in his degree       the youngest whom my father loved     because our mothers brow was given     to him with eyes as blue as heaven       for him my soul was sorely moved     and truly might it be distressed     to see such bird in such a nest9     for he was beautiful as day       when day was beautiful to me                                    80       as to young eagles being free       a polar day which will not see10     a sunset till its summers gone       its sleepless summer of long light     the snowclad offspring of the sun       and thus he was as pure and bright     and in his natural spirit gay     with tears for nought but others ills     and then they flowed like mountain rills     unless he could assuage the woe                                    90     which he abhorred to view below                          v      the other was as pure of mind     but formed to combat with his kind     strong in his frame and of a mood     which gainst the world in war had stood     and perished in the foremost rank       with joybut not in chains to pine     his spirit withered with their clank       i saw it silently decline       and so perchance in sooth did mine                             100     but yet i forced it on to cheer     those relics of a home so dear     he was a hunter of the hills       had followed there the deer and wolf       to him this dungeon was a gulf     and fettered feet the worst of ills                          vi        lake leman lies by chillons walls     a thousand feet in depth below     its massy waters meet and flow     thus much the fathomline was sent                                 110     from chillons snowwhite battlement11       which round about the wave inthralls     a double dungeon wall and wave     have madeand like a living grave     below the surface of the lake12     the dark vault lies wherein we lay     we heard it ripple night and day       sounding oer our heads it knocked     and i have felt the winters spray     wash through the bars when winds were high                         120     and wanton in the happy sky       and then the very rock hath rocked       and i have felt it shake unshocked13     because i could have smiled to see     the death that would have set me free                          vii      i said my nearer brother pined     i said his mighty heart declined     he loathed and put away his food     it was not that twas coarse and rude     for we were used to hunters fare                                 130     and for the like had little care     the milk drawn from the mountain goat     was changed for water from the moat     our bread was such as captives tears     have moistened many a thousand years     since man first pent his fellow men     like brutes within an iron den     but what were these to us or him     these wasted not his heart or limb     my brothers soul was of that mould                                140     which in a palace had grown cold     had his free breathing been denied     the range of the steep mountains side14     but why delay the truthhe diede     i saw and could not hold his head     nor reach his dying handnor dead     though hard i strove but strove in vain     to rend and gnash my bonds in twainf     he diedand they unlocked his chain     and scooped for him a shallow grave15                            150     even from the cold earth of our cave     i begged them as a boon to lay     his corse in dust whereon the day     might shineit was a foolish thought     but then within my brain it wrought16     that even in death his freeborn breast     in such a dungeon could not rest     i might have spared my idle prayer     they coldly laughedand laid him there     the flat and turfless earth above                                  160     the being we so much did love     his empty chain above it leant     such murders fitting monument                          viii      but he the favourite and the flower     most cherished since his natal hour     his mothers image in fair face     the infant love of all his race     his martyred fathers dearest thought17     my latest care for whom i sought     to hoard my life that his might be                                170     less wretched now and one day free     he too who yet had held untired     a spirit natural or inspired     he too was struck and day by day     was withered on the stalk away18     oh god it is a fearful thing     to see the human soul take wing     in any shape in any mood19     ive seen it rushing forth in blood     ive seen it on the breaking ocean                                 180     strive with a swoln convulsive motion     ive seen the sick and ghastly bed     of sin delirious with its dread     but these were horrorsthis was woe     unmixed with suchbut sure and slow     he faded and so calm and meek     so softly worn so sweetly weak     so tearless yet so tenderkind     and grieved for those he left behind     with all the while a cheek whose bloom                             190     was as a mockery of the tomb     whose tints as gently sunk away     as a departing rainbows ray     an eye of most transparent light     that almost made the dungeon bright     and not a word of murmurnot     a groan oer his untimely lot     a little talk of better days     a little hope my own to raise     for i was sunk in silencelost                                    200     in this last loss of all the most     and then the sighs he would suppress     of fainting natures feebleness     more slowly drawn grew less and less     i listened but i could not hear     i called for i was wild with fear     i knew twas hopeless but my dread     would not be thus admonished     i called and thought i heard a sound     i burst my chain with one strong bound                            210     and rushed to himi found him not     i only stirred in this black spot     i only lived i only drew     the accursed breath of dungeondew     the last the sole the dearest link     between me and the eternal brink     which bound me to my failing race     was broken in this fatal place     one on the earth and one beneath     my brothersboth had ceased to breathe                           220     i took that hand which lay so still     alas my own was full as chill     i had not strength to stir or strive     but felt that i was still alive     a frantic feeling when we know     that what we love shall neer be so         i know not why         i could not die20     i had no earthly hopebut faith     and that forbade a selfish death                                  230                          ix      what next befell me then and there       i know not welli never knew     first came the loss of light and air       and then of darkness too     i had no thought no feelingnone     among the stones i stood a stone21     and was scarce conscious what i wist     as shrubless crags within the mist     for all was blank and bleak and grey     it was not nightit was not day                                  240     it was not even the dungeonlight     so hateful to my heavy sight     but vacancy absorbing space     and fixednesswithout a place     there were no starsno earthno time     no checkno changeno goodno crime     but silence and a stirless breath     which neither was of life nor death     a sea of stagnant idleness     blind boundless mute and motionless                            250                          x      a light broke in upon my brain       it was the carol of a bird     it ceased and then it came again       the sweetest song ear ever heard     and mine was thankful till my eyes     ran over with the glad surprise     and they that moment could not see     i was the mate of misery     but then by dull degrees came back     my senses to their wonted track                                   260     i saw the dungeon walls and floor     close slowly round me as before     i saw the glimmer of the sun     creeping as it before had done     but through the crevice where it came     that bird was perched as fond and tame       and tamer than upon the tree     a lovely bird with azure wings22     and song that said a thousand things       and seemed to say them all for me                               270     i never saw its like before     i neer shall see its likeness more     it seemed like me to want a mate     but was not half so desolate23     and it was come to love me when     none lived to love me so again     and cheering from my dungeons brink     had brought me back to feel and think     i know not if it late were free       or broke its cage to perch on mine                              280     but knowing well captivity       sweet bird i could not wish for thine     or if it were in wingéd guise     a visitant from paradise     forheaven forgive that thought the while     which made me both to weep and smile     i sometimes deemed that it might be     my brothers soul come down to me24     but then at last away it flew     and then twas mortal well i knew                                 290     for he would never thus have flown     and left me twice so doubly lone     loneas the corse within its shroud     loneas a solitary cloud25       a single cloud on a sunny day     while all the rest of heaven is clear     a frown upon the atmosphere     that hath no business to appear26       when skies are blue and earth is gay                          xi      a kind of change came in my fate                                  300     my keepers grew compassionate     i know not what had made them so     they were inured to sights of woe     but so it wasmy broken chain     with links unfastened did remain     and it was liberty to stride     along my cell from side to side     and up and down and then athwart     and tread it over every part     and round the pillars one by one                                  310     returning where my walk begun     avoiding only as i trod     my brothers graves without a sod     for if i thought with heedless tread     my step profaned their lowly bed     my breath came gaspingly and thick     and my crushed heart felt blind and sick                          xii      i made a footing in the wall       it was not therefrom to escape     for i had buried one and all                                      320       who loved me in a human shape     and the whole earth would henceforth be     a wider prison unto me27     no childno sireno kin had i     no partner in my misery     i thought of this and i was glad     for thought of them had made me mad     but i was curious to ascend     to my barred windows and to bend     once more upon the mountains high                                330     the quiet of a loving eye28                          xiii      i saw themand they were the same     they were not changed like me in frame     i saw their thousand years of snow     on hightheir wide long lake belowg     and the blue rhone in fullest flow29     i heard the torrents leap and gush     oer channelled rock and broken bush     i saw the whitewalled distant town30     and whiter sails go skimming down                                 340     and then there was a little isle31     which in my very face did smile       the only one in view     a small green isle it seemed no more32     scarce broader than my dungeon floor     but in it there were three tall trees     and oer it blew the mountain breeze     and by it there were waters flowing     and on it there were young flowers growing       of gentle breath and hue                                        350     the fish swam by the castle wall     and they seemed joyous each and all33     the eagle rode the rising blast     methought he never flew so fast     as then to me he seemed to fly     and then new tears came in my eye     and i felt troubledand would fain     i had not left my recent chain     and when i did descend again     the darkness of my dim abode                                       360     fell on me as a heavy load     it was as is a newdug grave     closing oer one we sought to save     and yet my glance too much opprest     had almost need of such a rest                          xiv      it might be months or years or days       i kept no count i took no note     i had no hope my eyes to raise       and clear them of their dreary mote     at last men came to set me free                                   370       i asked not why and recked not where     it was at length the same to me     fettered or fetterless to be       i learned to love despair     and thus when they appeared at last     and all my bonds aside were cast     these heavy walls to me had grown     a hermitageand all my own34     and half i felt as they were come     to tear me from a second home                                     380     with spiders i had friendship made     and watched them in their sullen trade     had seen the mice by moonlight play     and

of the month see letters to murray and rogers dated july 22 and july 29 is a retrospect and an apology it consists of an opening stanza or section on the psychology of dreams followed by some episodes or dissolving views which purport to be the successive stages of a dream stanzas ii and iii are descriptive of annesley park and hall and detail two incidents of byrons boyish passion for his neighbour and distant cousin mary anne chaworth the first scene takes place on the top of diadem hill the cape or rounded spur of the long ridge of howatt hill which lies about half a mile to the southeast of the hall the time is the late summer or early autumn of 1803 the sun of love has not yet declined and the one beloved face is still shining on him but he is beginning to realize that her sighs are not for him that she is out of his reach the second scene which belongs to the following year 1804 is laid in the antique oratory not as moore explains another name for the hall but a small room built over the porch or principal entrance of the hall and looking into the courtyard and depicts the final parting his doom has been pronounced and his first impulse is to pen some passionate reproach but his heart fails him at the sight of the lady of his love serene and smiling and he bids her farewell with smiles on his lips but grief unutterable in his heart  stanza iv recalls an incident of his eastern travelsa halt at noonday by a fountain on the route from smyrna to ephesus march 14 1810 the heads of camels were seen peeping above the tall reeds see travels in albania 1858 ii 59  the next episode stanza v depicts an imaginary scene suggested perhaps by some rumour or more definite assurance and often present to his inward eyethe one beloved the mother of a happy family but herself a forsaken and unhappy wife  he passes on stanza vi to his marriage in 1815 his bride gentle and fair but not the one belovedto the wedding day when he stood before an altar like one forlorn confused by the sudden vision of the past fulfilled with love the indestructible  in stanza vii he records and analyzes the sickness of the soul the socalled phrenzy which had overtaken and changed the lady of his love and finally stanza viii he lays bare the desolation of his heart depicting himself as at enmity with mankind but submissive to nature the spirit of the universe if haply there may be reserved a blessing even for him the rejected and the outlaw  moore says life p 321 that the dream cost its author many a tear in writingbeing indeed the most mournful as well as picturesque story of a wandering life that ever came from the pen and heart of man in his real lord byron i 284 mr cordy jeaffreson maintains that the dream has no autobiographical value a dream it was as false as dreams usually are the character of the poet as well as the poem itself suggests another criticism byron suffered or enjoyed vivid dreams and as poets will shaped his dreams consciously and of set purpose to the furtherance of his art but nothing concerning himself interested him or awoke the slumbering chord which was not based on actual fact if the meeting on the cape crowned with a peculiar diadem and the final interview in the antique oratory had never happened or happened otherwise if he had not quivered during the wedding service at seaham if a vision of annesley and mary chaworth had not flashed into his soulhe would have taken no pleasure in devising these incidents and details and weaving them into a fictitious narrative he took himself too seriously to invent and dwell lovingly on the acts and sufferings of an imaginary byron the dream is picturesque because the accidents of the scenes are dealt with not historically but artistically are omitted or supplied according to poetical licence but the record is neither false nor imaginary nor unusual on the other hand the composition and publication of the poem must be set down if not to malice and revenge at least to the preoccupancy of chagrin and remorse which compelled him to take the world into his confidence cost what it might to his own selfrespect or the peace of mind and

scattered at intervals and wreathing smoke     arising from such rustic roofsthe hill     was crowned with a peculiar diadem     of trees in circular array so fixed     not by the sport of nature but of man     these two a maiden and a youth were there     gazingthe one on all that was beneath                             40     fair as herselfbut the boy gazed on her     and both were young and one was beautiful     and both were youngyet not alike in youth     as the sweet moon on the horizons verge     the maid was on the eve of womanhood     the boy had fewer summers but his heart     had far outgrown his years and to his eye     there was but one belovéd face on earth     and that was shining on him he had looked     upon it till it could not pass away                                50     he had no breath no being but in hers     she was his voice he did not speak to her     but trembled on her words she was his sighti39     for his eye followed hers and saw with hers     which coloured all his objectshe had ceased     to live within himself she was his life     the ocean to the river of his thoughts40     which terminated all upon a tone     a touch of hers his blood would ebb and flow41     and his cheek change tempestuouslyhis heart                       60     unknowing of its cause of agony     but she in these fond feelings had no share     her sighs were not for him to her he was     even as a brotherbut no more twas much     for brotherless she was save in the name     her infant friendship had bestowed on him     herself the solitary scion left     of a timehonoured race42it was a name     which pleased him and yet pleased him notand why     time taught him a deep answerwhen she loved                       70     another even now she loved another

and fro anon                               80     he sate him down and seized a pen and traced     words which i could not guess of then he leaned     his bowed head on his hands and shook as twere     with a convulsionthen arose again     and with his teeth and quivering hands did tear     what he had written but he shed no tears     and he did calm himself and fix his brow     into a kind of quiet as he paused     the lady of his love reentered there     she was serene and smiling then and yet                            90     she knew she was by him belovedshe knew     for quickly comes such knowledge45 that his heart     was darkened with her shadow and she saw     that he was wretched but she saw not all     he rose and with a cold and gentle grasp     he took her hand a moment oer his face     a tablet of unutterable thoughts     was traced and then it faded as it came     he dropped the hand he held and with slow steps     retired but not as bidding her adieu                             100     for they did part with mutual smiles he passed     from out the massy gate of that old hall     and mounting on his steed he went his way     and neer repassed that hoary threshold

of many images     crowded like waves upon me but he was     a part of all and in the last he lay     reposing from the noontide sultriness     couched among fallen columns in the shade     of ruined walls that had survived the names     of those who reared them by his sleeping side     stood camels grazing and some goodly steeds     were fastened near a fountain and a man                           120     clad in a flowing garb did watch the while     while many of his tribe slumbered around     and they were canopied by the blue sky     so cloudless clear and purely beautiful     that god alone was to be seen in heaven47                          v      a change came oer the spirit of my dream     the lady of his love was wed with one     who did not love her betterin her home     a

grief     the settled shadow of an inward strife     and an unquiet drooping of the eye     as if its lid were charged with unshed tears48     what could her grief beshe had all she loved     and he

the altar oer his brow there came     the selfsame aspect and the quivering shock50                  150     that in the antique oratory shook     his bosom in its solitude and then     as in that houra moment oer his face     the tablet of unutterable thoughts     was tracedand then it faded as it came     and he stood calm and quiet and he spoke     the fitting vows but heard not his own

dialogues and they did teach     to him the magic of their mysteries     to him the book of night was opened wide     and voices from the deep abyss revealed55                        200     a marvel

imagination of such a poet as lord byron the waste of boundless space into which they lead the poet the neglect of precision which such themes may render habitual make them in respect to poetry what mysticism is to religion poetry of this kind which recalled the wild unbridled and fiery imagination of coleridge was a novel and untoward experiment on the part of an author whose peculiar art it was to show the reader where his purpose tends the resemblance to coleridge is general rather than particular it is improbable that scott had ever read limbo first published in sibylline leaves 1817 an

novel but it is needless to add that any charge of plagiarism falls to the ground thanks to a sensitive and appreciative ear and a retentive memory byrons verse is interfused with manifold strains but so far as darkness is concerned his debt to coleridge or the author of omegarus and syderia is neither more nor less legitimate than the debt to jeremiah ezekiel and joel which a writer in the imperial magazine 1828 x 699 with solemn upbraidings lays to his charge  the duty of acknowledging such debts is indeed a duty of imperfect obligation the wellknown lines in tennysons locksley hall

ostend and to while away the time turned to pilgrim and thought out perhaps began to write the lines which were finished three months later at the campagne diodati  the grave of churchill writes scott quarterly review october 1816 might have called from lord byron a deeper commemoration for though they generally differed in character and genius there was a resemblance between their history and character both these poets held themselves above the opinion of the world and both were followed by the fame and popularity which they seemed to despise the writings of both exhibit an inborn though sometimes illregulated generosity of mind and a spirit of proud independence frequently pushed to extremes both carried their hatred of hypocrisy beyond the verge of prudence and indulged their vein of satire to the borders of licentiousness  save for the affectation of a style which did not belong to him and which in his heart he despised byrons commemoration of churchill does not lack depth or seriousness it was the parallel between their lives and temperaments which awoke reflection and sympathy and prompted this natural homily perhaps too the shadow of impending exile had suggested to his imagination that further parallel which scott deprecated and deprecated in vain death in the flower of his age and in a foreign land  60 46on the sheet containing the original draft of these lines lord byron has written the following poem as most that i have endeavoured to write is founded on a fact and this detail is an attempt at a serious imitation of the style of a great poetits beauties and its defects i say the style for the thoughts i claim as my own in this if there be anything ridiculous let it be attributed to me at least as much as to mr wordsworth of whom there can exist few greater admirers than myself i have blended what i would deem to be the beauties as well as defects of his style and it ought to be remembered that in such things whether there be praise or dispraise there is always what is called a compliment however unintentional there is as scott points out a much closer resemblance to southeys english eclogues in which moral truths are expressed to use the poets own language in an almost colloquial plainness of language and an air of quaint and original expression assumed to render the sentiment at once impressive and piquant  61 47compare      the

for changing her opinion about himshe could not help it through decency letters 1901 v 213 it is difficult to believe that madame de staël was ashamed of her companions or was sincere in disclaiming

the dream in july another change had come over his spirit and that the mild and courteous depreciation of his wife as a gentle bride etc had given place to passionate reproach and bitter reviling the failure of madame de staëls negotiations must have been to some extent anticipated and it is more reasonable to suppose that it was a rumour or report of the one serious calumny of shelleys letter of

past sixty and byron more than thirty years younger but of the closest and pleasantest intimacy to judge from the tone of the letter to moore vide supra and of numerous entries in his diaries during sheridans life and after his death he was at pains not to pass judgment on a man whom he greatly admired and sincerely pitied and whom he felt that he had no right to despise body and soul byron was of different stuff from sheridan and if he had lived to his age he would have passed over the redhot ploughshares of life and conduct not unscathed but stoutly and unconsumed so much easier is it to

tableaux after the poem by byron composed by tschaikowsky 1885 first heard in london autumn 1898                             introduction to manfred   byron passed four months and three weeks in switzerland he arrived at the hôtel dangleterre at sécheron on saturday may 25 and he left the campagne diodati for italy on sunday october 6 1816 within that period he wrote the greater part of the third canto of childe harold he began and finished the prisoner of chillon its seven attendant poems and the monody on the death of sheridan and he began manfred  a note to the incantation manfred act i sc 1 lines 192261 which was begun in july and published together with the prisoner of chillon december 5 1816 records the existence of an unfinished witch drama first edition p 46 but apart from this the first announcement of his new work is contained in a letter to murray dated venice february 15 1817 letters 1900 iv 52 i forgot he writes to mention to you that a kind of poem in dialogue in blank verse or drama  begun last summer in switzerland is finished it is in three acts but of a very wild metaphysical and inexplicable kind the letter is imperfect but some pages of extracts which were forwarded under the same cover have been preserved ten days later february 25 he reverts to these extracts and on february 28 he despatches a fair copy of the first act on march 9 he remits the third and final act of his dramatic poem a definition adopted as a second title but under reserve as to publication and with a strict injunction to murray to submit it to mr gifford and to whomsoever you please besides it is certain that this third act was written at venice letter to murray april 14 and it may be taken for granted that the composition of the first two acts belongs to the tour in the bernese alps september 1729 or to the last days at diodati september 30 to october 5 1816 when the estro see letter to murray january 2 1817 was upon him when his passions slept and in spite of all that had come and gone and could not go his spirit was uplifted by the majesty and the power and the glory of nature  giffords verdict on the first act was that it was wonderfully poetical and merited publication but as byron had foreseen he did not by any means like the third act it was as its author admitted letter to murray april 14 damnably bad and savoured of the dregs of a fever for which the carnival letter to murray february 28 or more probably the climate and insanitary palaces of venice were responsible some weeks went by before there was either leisure or inclination for the task of correction but at rome the estro returned in full force and on may 5 a new third act of manfredthe greater part rewritten was sent by post to england manfred a dramatic poem was published june 16 1817  manfred was criticized by jeffrey in the edinburgh review no lvi august 1817 vol 28 pp 418431 and by john wilson in the edinburgh monthly magazine afterwards blackwoods etc june 1817 i 289295 jeffrey as byron remarked letter to murray october 12 1817 was very kind and wilson whose article had all the air of being a poets was eloquent in its praises but there was a fly in the ointment a suggestion had been thrown out in an ingenious paper in a late number of the edinburgh magazine signed h m john wilson july 1817 that the general conception of this piece and much of what is excellent in the manner of its execution have been borrowed from the tragical history of dr faustus of marlow sic and from this contention jeffrey dissented a note to a second paper on marlowes edward ii blackwoods edinburgh magazine october 1817 offered explanations and echoed jeffreys exaltation of manfred above dr faustus but the mischief had been done byron was evidently perplexed and distressed not by the papers in blackwood which he never saw but by jeffreys remonstrance in his favour and in the letter of october 12 he is at pains to trace the evolution of manfred i never read he writes and do not know that i ever saw the faustus of marlow and again as to the faustus of marlow i never read never saw nor heard of it i heard mr lewis translate verbally some scenes of goethes faust  last summer see too letter to rogers april 4 1817 which is all i know of the history of that magical personage and as to the germs of manfred they may be found in the journal which i sent to mrs leigh  when i went over first the dent etc  shortly before i left switzerland i have the whole scene of manfred before me  again three years later he writes à propos of goethes review of manfred which first appeared in print in his paper kunst und alterthum june 1820 and is republished in goethes sämmtliche werke  stuttgart 1874 xiii 640642 see letters 1901 v appendix ii goethe and byron pp 503521 his faust i never read for i dont know german but matthew monk lewis sic in 1816 at coligny translated most of it to me viva voce and i was naturally much struck with it but it was the staubach sic and the jungfrau and something else much more than faustus that made me write manfred the first scene however and that of faustus are very similar letter to murray june 7 1820 letters 1901 v 36 medwin conversations etc pp 210 211 who of course had not seen the letters to murray of 1817 or 1820 puts much the same story into byrons mouth  now with regard to the originality of manfred it may be taken for granted that byron knew nothing about the faustlegend or the faustcycle he solemnly denies that he had ever read marlowes faustus or the selections from the play in lambs specimens etc see medwins conversations etc pp 208 209 and a hitherto unpublished preface to werner vol v and it is highly improbable that he knew anything of calderons el mágico prodigioso which shelley translated in 1822 or of the beggarly elements of the legend in hroswithas lapsus et conversio theophrasti vicedomini but byrons manfred is in the succession of scholars who have reached the limits of natural and legitimate science and who essay the supernatural in order to penetrate and comprehend the hidden things of darkness a predecessor if not a progenitor he must have had and there can be no doubt whatever that the primary conception of the character though by no means the inspiration of the poem is to be traced to the monks oral rendering of goethes faust which he gave in return for his bread and salt at diodati neither jeffrey nor wilson mentioned faust but the writer of the notice in the critical review june 1817 series v vol 5 pp 622629 avowed that this scene the first is a gross plagiary from a great poet whom lord byron has imitated on former occasions without comprehending goethes faust begins in the same way and goethe himself in a letter to his friend knebel october 1817 and again in his review in kunst und alterthum june 1820 emphasizes whilst he justifies and applauds the use which byron had made of his work this singular intellectual poet has taken my faustus to himself and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac humour he has made use of the impelling principles in his own way for his own purposes so that no one of them remains the same and it is particularly on this account that i cannot enough admire his genius afterwards see record of a conversation with herman fürst von pückler september 14 1826 letters v 511 goethe somewhat modified his views but even then it interested him to trace the unconscious transformation which byron had made of his mephistopheles it is perhaps enough to say that the link between manfred and faust is formal not spiritual the problem which goethe raised but did not solve his counterfeit presentment of the eternal issue between soul and sense between innocence and renunciation on the one side and achievement and satisfaction on the other was not the struggle which byron experienced in himself or desired to depict in his mysterious hierarch of the powers of nature it was the staubach and the jungfrau and something else not the influence of faust on a receptive listener which called up a new theme and struck out a fresh wellspring of the imagination the motif of manfred is remorseeternal suffering for inexpiable crime the sufferer is for ever buoyed up with the hope that there is relief somewhere in nature beyond nature above nature and experience replies with an everlasting no as the sunshine enhances sorrow so nature by the force of contrast reveals and enhances guilt manfred is no echo of anothers questioning no expression of a general worldweariness on the part of the timespirit but a personal outcry de profundis clamavi  no doubt apart from this main purport and essence of his song his sensitive spirit responded to other and fainter influences there are points of resemblance as jeffrey pointed out and byron proudly admitted between manfred and the prometheus of Æschylus plainly here and there the tone and pitch of the composition and the victim in the more solemn parts are Æschylean again with regard to the supernatural there was the stimulus of the conversation of the shelleys and of lewis brimful of magic and ghostlore and lastly there was the glamour of christabel the wild and original poem which had taken byron captive and was often in his thoughts and on his lips it was no wonder that the fuel kindled and burst into a flame  for the

and his scholars were bathing in the hot baths of gadara in syria a dispute arising concerning the baths he smiling ordered his disciples to ask the inhabitants by what names the two lesser springs that were fairer than the rest were called to which the inhabitants replied that the one was called love and the other loves contrary but for what reason they knew not upon which iamblichus who chanced to be sitting on the fountains edge where the stream flowed out put his hand on the water and having uttered a few words called up from the depths of the fountain a fairskinned lad not overtall whose golden locks fell in sunny curls over his breast and back so that he looked like one fresh from the bath and then going to the other spring and doing as he had done before called up another amoretto like the first save that his longflowing locks now seemed black now shot with sunny gleams whereupon both the amoretti nestled and clung round iamblichus as if they had been his own

plutarch it is related that when pausanias was at byzantium he cast his eyes upon a young virgin named cleonice of a noble family there and insisted on having her for a mistress the parents intimidated by his power were under the hard necessity of giving up their daughter the young woman begged that the light might be taken out of his apartment that she might go to his bed in secresy and silence when she entered he was asleep and she unfortunately stumbled upon the candlestick and threw it down the noise waked him suddenly and he in his confusion thinking it was an enemy coming to assassinate him unsheathed a dagger that lay by him and plunged it into the virgins heart after this he could never rest her image appeared to him every night and with a menacing tone repeated this heroic verse      go to the fate which pride and lust prepare  the allies highly incensed at this infamous action joined cimon to besiege him in byzantium but he found means to escape thence and as he was still haunted by the spectre he is said to have applied to a temple at heraclea where the manes of the dead were consulted there he invoked the spirit of cleonice and entreated her pardon she appeared and told him he would soon be delivered from all his troubles after his return to sparta in which it seems his death was enigmatically foretold thus adds the translator in a note we find that

here according to the countess guiccioli was the origin of manfred it is somewhat singular that on the appearance of manfred a paper was published in the june number of the edinburgh monthly magazine 1817 vol i pp 270273 entitled sketch of a tradition related by a monk in switzerland the narrator who signs himself p f professes to have heard the story in the autumn of 1816 from one of the fathers of capuchin friars not far from altorf it is the story of the love of two brothers for a lady with whom they had passed their infancy she becomes the wife of the elder brother and later inspires the younger brother with a passion against which he struggles in vain the fate of the elder brother is shrouded in mystery the lady wastes away and her paramour is found dead in the same pass in which he had met his sister among the mountains the excuse for retelling the story is that there appeared to be a striking coincidence in some characteristic features between lord byrons drama and the swiss

thou wert a princess but that love     had robed thee with a glory and arrayed     thy lineaments in beauty that dismayed     oh not dismayedbut awed like one above     and in that sweet severity184

               140     that sad fatality hath cost me dear     but thou art dearest still and i should be     fit for this cell which wrongs mebut for thee     the very love which locked me to my chain     hath lightened half its weight and for the rest     though heavy lent me vigour to sustain     and look to thee with undivided breast     and foil the ingenuity of pain                          vi      it is no marvelfrom my very birth     my soul was drunk with lovewhich did pervade                    150     and mingle with whateer i saw on earth     of objects all inanimate i made     idols and out of wild and lonely flowers     and rocks whereby they grew a paradise     where i did lay me down within the shade     of waving trees and dreamed uncounted hours     though i was chid for wandering and the wise     shook their white agéd heads oer me and said     of such materials wretched men were made     and such a truant boy would end in woe                            160     and that the only lesson was a blow185     and then they smote me and i did not weep     but cursed them in my heart and to my haunt     returned and wept alone and dreamed again     the visions which arise without a sleep     and with my years my soul began to pant     with feelings of strange tumult and soft pain     and the whole heart exhaled into one want     but undefined and wandering till the day     i found the thing i soughtand that was thee                     170     and then i lost my being all to be     absorbed in thinethe world was past away     thou didst annihilate the earth

subjects the most lofty and most useful to human life i had designed to unite philosophy with eloquence in such a manner that there might remain of me an eternal memory in the world alas i had expected to close my life with glory and renown but now oppressed by the burden of so many calamities i have lost every prospect of reputation and of honour the fear of perpetual imprisonment increases my melancholy the indignities which i suffer augment it and the squalor of my beard my hair and habit the sordidness and filth exceedingly annoy me sure am i that if she who so little has

bitterness of soul made a similar appeal see life of tasso by john black 1810 ii 64 408 black prints the canzone in full solerti vita etc i 316318 gives selections  181 146for nearly the first year of his confinement tasso endured all the horrors of a solitary sordid cell and was under the care of a gaoler whose chief virtue although he was a poet and a man of letters was a cruel obedience to the commands of his prince his name was agostino mosti tasso says of him in a letter to his sister ed usa meco ogni sorte di rigore ed inumanitàhobhouse historical illustrations etc 1818 pp 20 21 note 1  tasso in a letter to angelo grillo dated june 16 1584 letter 288 le lettere etc ii 276 complains that mosti did not interfere to prevent him being molested by the other inmates disturbed in his studies and treated disrespectfully by the governors subordinates in the letter to his sister cornelia from which hobhouse quotes the allusion is not to mosti but according to solerti to the cardinal luigi deste elsewhere letter 133 lettere ii 88 89 tasso describes agostino mosti as a rigorous and zealous churchman but far too cultivated and courteous a gentleman to have exercised any severity towards him proprio motu or otherwise than in obedience to orders  182 147it is highly improbable that tasso openly indulged or secretly nourished a consuming passion for leonora deste and it is certain that the sister of his sovereign had nothing to do with his being shut up in the hospital of sant anna that poet and princess had known each other for over thirteen years that the princess was seven years older than the poet and in march 1579 close upon fortytwo years of age are points to be considered but the fact that she died in february 1581 and that tasso remained in confinement for five years longer is a stronger argument against the truth of the legend she was a beautiful woman his patroness and benefactress and the theme of sonnets and canzoni but it was not for her sweet sake that tasso lost either his wits or his liberty  183 compare      i speak not i trace not i breathe not thy name  184 148compare the following lines from the canzone entitled la prima di tre sorelle scritte a madaroa leonora deste  1567      e certo il primo dì chel bel sereno       delia tua fronte agli occhi miei sofferse       e vidi armato spaziarvi amore       se non che riverenza allor

terz 53 complains that his father chased him not with spurs only but with darts and lances to turn over old texts etc but tasso was a studious and dutiful boy and though he finally deserted the law for poetry and crossed his fathers wishes and intentions he took his own course reluctantly and without any breach of decorum but perhaps the following translations from the rinaldo which black supplies in his footnotes i 41 97 suggested this picture of a poetic child at variance with the authorities      now hasting thence a verdant mead he found     where flowers of fragrant smell adorned

byron was still engaged on the additional stanzas of the fourth canto of childe harold his new poem as he admitted from the first was after the excellent manner of john hookham freres jeu desprit known as whistlecraft prospectus and specimen of an intended national work by william and robert whistlecraft london 1818192 which must have reached him in the summer of 1817 whether he divined the identity of whistlecraft from the first or whether his guess was an afterthought he did not hesitate to take the water and shoot ahead of his unsuspecting rival it was a case of plagiarism in excelsis and the superiority of the imitation to the original must be set down to the genius of the plagiary unaided by any profound study of italian literature or an acquaintance at first hand with the parents and inspirers of whistlecraft  it is possible that he had read and forgotten some specimens of pulcis morgante maggiore which j h merivale had printed in the monthly magazine for 18061807 vol xxi pp 304 510 etc and it is certain that he was familiar with his orlando in roncesvalles published in 1814 he distinctly states that he had not seen w s roses193 translation of castis animali parlanti first edition anonymous 1816 but according to pryse gordon personal memoirs ii 328 he had read the original if we may trust ugo foscolo see narrative and romantic poems of the italians in the quart rev april 1819 vol xxi pp 486526 there is some evidence that byron had read forteguerris ricciardetto translated in 1819 by sylvester douglas lord glenbervie and again by john herman merivale under the title of the two first cantos of richardetto 1820 but the parallel which he adduces vide post p 166 is not very striking or convincing  on the other hand after the poem was completed march 25 1818 he was under the impression that berni was the original of all  the father of that kind ie the mockheroic of writing but there is nothing to show whether he had or had not read the rifacimento of orlandos innamorato or the more distinctively bernesque capitoli two years later see letter to murray february 21 1820 letters 1900 iv 407 and advertisement to morgante maggiore he had discovered that pulci was the parent of whistlecraft and the precursor and model of berni but in 1817 he was only at the commencement of his studies a time came long before the year or two of his promise march 25 1818 when he had learned to simulate the vera imago of the italian muse and was able not only to surpass his immediate model but to rival his models forerunners and inspirers in the meanwhile a tale based on a venetian anecdote perhaps an episode in the history of colonel fitzgerald and the marchesa castiglionesee letter to moore december 26 1816 letters 1900 iv 26 lent itself to the excellent manner of mr whistlecraft and would show the knowing ones that is murrays advisers gifford croker frere etc that he could write cheerfully and would repel the charge of monotony and mannerism  eckermann mindful of goethes hint that byron had too much empeiria an excess of mondanitéa thisworldliness found it hard to read beppo after macbeth i felt he says the predominance of a nefarious empirical world with which the mind which introduced it to us has in a certain measure associated itself conversations of goethe etc 1874 p 175 but beppo must be taken at its own valuation it is a venetian story and the action takes place behind the scenes of a comedy of goldoni a less subtle but a more apposite criticism may be borrowed from lord byrons combolio sic blackwoods edinburgh magazine 1822 xi 162165      the story thats in it     may be told in a minute     but par parenthèse chatting     on this thing and that thing     keeps the shuttlecock flying     and

other notices of a less appreciative kind appeared in the monthly review march 1818 vol 85 pp 285290 and in the eclectic review ns june 1818 vol ix pp 555557                                    beppo194                          i      tis known at least it should be that throughout       all countries of the catholic persuasion195     some weeks before shrove tuesday comes about       the people take their fill of recreation     and buy repentance ere they grow devout       however high their rank or low their station     with fiddling feasting dancing drinking masquing     and other things which may be had for asking                          ii      the moment night with dusky mantle covers       the skies and the more duskily the better     the time less liked by husbands than by lovers       begins and prudery flings aside her fetter     and gaiety on restless tiptoe hovers       giggling with all the gallants who beset her     and there are songs and quavers roaring humming     guitars and every other sort of strumming196                           iii      and there are dresses splendid but fantastical       masks of all times and nations turks and jews     and harlequins and clowns with feats gymnastical       greeks romans yankeedoodles and hindoos     all kinds of dress except the ecclesiastical       all people as their fancies hit may choose     but no one in these parts may quiz the clergy     therefore take heed ye freethinkers i charge ye                          iv      youd better walk about begirt with briars       instead of coat and smallclothes than put on     a single stitch reflecting upon friars       although you swore it only was in fun     theyd haul you oer the coals and stir the fires       of phlegethon with every mothers son     nor say one mass to cool the cauldrons bubble     that boiled your bones unless you paid them double                          v      but saving this you may put on whateer       you like by way of doublet cape or cloak     such as in monmouthstreet or in rag fair       would rig you out in seriousness or joke     and even in italy such places are       with prettier name in softer accents spoke     for bating covent garden i can hit on     no place thats called piazza in great britain197                            vi      this feast is named the carnival which being       interpreted implies farewell to flesh     so called because the name and thing agreeing       through lent they live on fish both salt and fresh     but why they usher lent with so much glee in       is more than i can tell although i guess     tis as we take a glass with friends at parting     in the stagecoach or packet just at starting                          vii      and thus they bid farewell to carnal dishes       and solid meats and highly spiced ragouts     to live for forty days on illdressed fishes       because they have no sauces to their stews     a thing which causes many poohs and pishes       and several oaths which would not suit the muse     from travellers accustomed from a boy     to eat their salmon at the least with soy                          viii      and therefore humbly i would recommend       the curious in fishsauce before they cross     the sea to bid their cook or wife or friend        walk or ride to the strand and buy in gross     or if set out beforehand these may send        by any means least liable to loss     ketchup soy chilivinegar and harvey     or by the lord a lent will well nigh starve ye                          ix      that is to say if your religions roman       and you at rome would do as romans do     according to the proverbalthough no man       if foreign is obliged to fast and you     if protestant or sickly or a woman       would rather dine in sin on a ragout     dine and be dd i dont mean to be coarse     but thats the penalty to say no worse                          x      of all the places where the carnival       was most facetious in the days of yore     for dance and song and serenade and ball       and masque and mime and mystery and more     than i have time to tell now or at all       venice the bell from every city bore     and at the moment when i fix my story     that seaborn city was in all her glory                          xi      theyve pretty faces yet those same venetians       black eyes arched brows and sweet expressions still     such as of old were copied from the grecians       in ancient arts by moderns mimicked ill     and like so many venuses of titians198       the bests at florencesee it if ye will     they look when leaning over the balcony     or stepped from out a picture by giorgione199                          xii      whose tints are truth and beauty at their best       and when you to manfrinis palace go200     that picture howsoever fine the rest       is loveliest to my mind of all the show     it may perhaps be also to your zest       and thats the cause i rhyme upon it so     tis but a portrait of his son and wife     and self but such a woman love in life201                          xiii      love in full life and length not love ideal       no nor ideal beauty that fine name     but something better still so very real       that the sweet model must have been the same     a thing that you would purchase beg or steal       wert not impossible besides a shame     the face recalls some face as twere with pain     you once have seen but neer will see again                          xiv      one of those forms which flit by us when we       are young and fix our eyes on every face     and oh the loveliness at times we see       in momentary gliding the soft grace     the youth the bloom the beauty which agree       in many a nameless being we retrace     whose course and home we knew not nor shall know     like the lost pleiad202 seen no more below                          xv      i said that like a picture by giorgione       venetian women were and so they are     particularly seen from a balcony       for beautys sometimes best set off afar     and there just like a heroine of goldoni202a       they peep from out the blind or oer the bar     and truth to say theyre mostly very pretty     and rather like to show it mores the pity                          xvi      for glances beget ogles ogles sighs       sighs wishes wishes words and words a letter     which flies on wings of lightheeled mercuries       who do such things because they know no better     and then god knows what mischief may arise       when love links two young people in one fetter     vile assignations and adulterous beds     elopements broken vows and hearts and heads                          xvii      shakspeare described the sex in desdemona       as very fair but yet suspect in fame202b     and to this day from venice to verona       such matters may be probably the same     except that since those times was never known a       husband whom mere suspicion could inflame     to suffocate a wife no more than twenty     because she had a cavalier servente203                          xviii      their jealousy if they are ever jealous       is of a fair complexion altogether     not like that sooty devil of othellos       which smothers women in a bed of feather     but worthier of these much more jolly fellows       when weary of the matrimonial tether     his head for such a wife no mortal bothers     but takes at once another or anothers                          xix      didst ever see a gondola for fear       you should not ill describe it you exactly     tis a long covered boat thats common here       carved at the prow built lightly but compactly     rowed by two rowers each calld gondolier       it glides along the water looking blackly     just like a coffin clapt in a canoe     where none can make out what you say or do                          xx      and up and down the long canals they go       and under the rialto204 shoot along     by night and day all paces swift or slow       and round the theatres a sable throng     they wait in their dusk livery of woe       but not to them do woeful things belong     for sometimes they contain a deal of fun     like mourning coaches when the funerals done                          xxi      but to my storytwas some years ago       it may be thirty forty more or less     the carnival was at its height and so       were all kinds of buffoonery and dress     a certain lady went to see the show       her real name i know not nor can guess     and so well call her laura if you please     because it slips into my verse with ease                          xxii      she was not old nor young nor at the years       which certain people call a certain age205     which yet the most uncertain age appears       because i never heard nor could engage     a person yet by prayers or bribes or tears       to name define by speech or write on page     the period meant precisely by that word     which surely is exceedingly absurd                          xxiii      laura was blooming still had made the best       of time and time returned the compliment     and treated her genteelly so that dressed       she looked extremely well whereer she went     a pretty woman is a welcome guest       and lauras brow a frown had rarely bent     indeed she shone all smiles and seemed to flatter     mankind with her black eyes for looking at her                          xxiv      she was a married woman tis convenient       because in christian countries tis a rule     to view their little slips with eyes more lenient       whereas if single ladies play the fool     unless within the period intervenient       a welltimed wedding makes the scandal cool     i dont know how they ever can get over it     except they manage never to discover it                          xxv      her husband sailed upon the adriatic       and made some voyages too in other seas     and when he lay in quarantine for pratique206       a forty days precaution gainst disease     his wife would mount at times her highest attic       for thence she could discern the ship with ease     he was a merchant trading to aleppo     his name giuseppe called more briefly beppo207                          xxvi      he was a man as dusky as a spaniard       sunburnt with travel yet a portly figure     though coloured as it were within a tanyard       he was a person both of sense and vigour     a better seaman never yet did man yard       and she although her manners showed no rigour     was deemed a woman of the strictest principle     so much as to be thought almost invincible208                          xxvii      but several years elapsed since they had met       some people thought the ship was lost and some     that he had somehow blundered into debt       and did not like the thought of steering home     and there were several offered any bet       or that he would or that he would not come     for most men till by losing rendered sager     will back their own opinions with a wager                          xxviii      tis said that their last parting was pathetic       as partings often are or ought to be     and their presentiment was quite prophetic       that they should never more each other see     a sort of morbid feeling half poetic       which i have known occur in two or three     when kneeling on the shore upon her sad knee     he left this adriatic ariadne                          xxix      and laura waited long and wept a little       and thought of wearing weeds as well she might     she almost lost all appetite for victual       and could not sleep with ease alone at night     she deemed the windowframes and shutters brittle       against a daring housebreaker or sprite     and so she thought it prudent to connect her     with a vicehusband chiefly to protect her                          xxx      she chose and what is there they will not choose       if only you will but oppose their choice     till beppo should return from his long cruise       and bid once more her faithful heart rejoice     a man some women like and yet abuse       a coxcomb was he by the public voice     a count of wealth they said as well as quality     and in his pleasures of great liberalitybk                          xxxi      and then he was a count and then he knew       music and dancing fiddling french and tuscan     the last not easy be it known to you       for few italians speak the right etruscan     he was a critic upon operas too       and knew all niceties of sock and buskin     and no venetian audience could endure a     song scene or air when he cried seccatura209                          xxxii      his bravo was decisive for that sound       hushed academie sighed in silent awe     the fiddlers trembled as he looked around       for fear of some false notes detected flaw     the prima donnas tuneful heart would bound       dreading the deep damnation of his bah     soprano basso even the contraalto     wished him five fathom under the rialto                          xxxiii      he patronised the improvisatori       nay could himself extemporise some stanzas     wrote rhymes sang songs could also tell a story       sold pictures and was skilful in the dance as     italians can be though in this their glory       must surely yield the palm to that which france has     in short he was a perfect cavaliero     and to his very valet seemed a hero210                          xxxiv      then he was faithful too as well as amorous       so that no sort of female could complain     although theyre now and then a little clamorous       he never put the pretty souls in pain     his heart was one of those which most enamour us       wax to receive and marble to retain     he was a lover of the good old school     who still become more constant as they cool                          xxxv      no wonder such accomplishments should turn       a female head however sage and steady     with scarce a hope that beppo could return       in law he was almost as good as dead he     nor sent nor wrote nor showed the least concern       and she had waited several years already     and really if a man wont let us know     that hes alive hes deador should be so                          xxxvi      besides within the alps to every woman       although god knows it is a grievous sin     tis i may say permitted to have two men       i cant tell who first brought the custom in     but cavalier serventes are quite common       and no one notices or cares a pin     an we may call this not to say the worst     a second marriage which corrupts the first                          xxxvii      the word was formerly a cicisbeo211       but that is now grown vulgar and indecent     the spaniards call the person a cortejo212       for the same mode subsists in spain though recent     in short it reaches from the po to teio       and may perhaps at last be oer the sea sent     but heaven preserve old england from such courses     or what becomes of damage and divorces                          xxxviii213      however i still think with all due deference       to the fair single part of the creation     that married ladies should preserve the preference       in tête à tête or general conversation     and this i say without peculiar reference       to england france or any other nation     because they know the world and are at ease     and being natural naturally please                          xxxix      tis true your budding miss is very charming       but shy and awkward at first coming out     so much alarmed that she is quite alarming       all giggle blush half pertness and half pout     and glancing at mamma for fear theres harm in       what you she it or they may be about     the nursery still lisps out in all they utter     besides they always smell of bread and butter214                          xl      but cavalier servente is the phrase       used in politest circles to express     this supernumerary slave who stays       close to the lady as a part of dress     her word the only law which he obeys       his is no sinecure as you may guess     coach servants gondola he goes to call     and carries fan and tippet gloves and shawl                          xli      with all its sinful doings i must say       that italys a pleasant place to me     who love to see the sun shine every day       and vines not nailed to walls from tree to tree     festooned much like the back scene of a play       or melodrame which people flock to see     when the first act is ended by a dance     in vineyards copied from the south of france                          xlii      i like on autumn evenings to ride out       without being forced to bid my groom be sure     my cloak is round his middle strapped about       because the skies are not the most secure     i know too that if stopped upon my route       where the green alleys windingly allure     reeling with grapes red wagons choke the way     in england twould be dung dust or a dray                          xliii      i also like to dine on becaficas       to see the sun set sure hell rise tomorrow     not through a misty morning twinkling weak as       a drunken mans dead eye in maudlin sorrow     but with all heaven thimself the day will break as       beauteous as cloudless nor be forced to borrow     that sort of farthing candlelight which glimmers     where reeking londons smoky cauldron simmers                          xliv      i love the language that soft bastard latin215       which melts like kisses from a female mouth     and sounds as if it should be writ on satin216       with syllables which breathe of the sweet south     and gentle liquids gliding all so pat in       that not a single accent seems uncouth     like our harsh northern whistling grunting guttural     which were obliged to hiss and spit and sputter all                          xlv      i like the women too forgive my folly       from the rich peasant cheek of ruddy bronzebl     and large black eyes that flash on you a volley       of rays that say a thousand things at once     to the high damas brow more melancholy       but clear and with a wild and liquid glance     heart on her lips and soul within her eyes     soft as her clime and sunny as her skiesbm                          xlvi      eve of the land which still is paradise       italian beauty didst thou not inspire     raphael217 who died in thy embrace and vies       with all we know of heaven or can desire     in what he hath bequeathed usin what guise       though flashing from the fervour of the lyre     would words describe thy past and present glow     while yet canova218 can create below219                          xlvii      england with all thy faults i love thee still220       i said at calais and have not forgot it     i like to speak and lucubrate my fill       i like the government but that is not it     i like the freedom of the press and quill       i like the habeas corpus when weve got it     i like a parliamentary debate     particularly when tis not too late                          xlviii      i like the taxes when theyre not too many       i like a seacoal fire when not too dear     i like a beefsteak too as well as any       have no objection to a pot of beer     i like the weatherwhen it is not rainy       that is i like two months of every year     and so god save the regent church and king     which means that i like all and every thing                          xlix      our standing army and disbanded seamen       poors rate reform my own the nations debt     our little riots just to show were free men       our trifling bankruptcies in the gazette     our cloudy climate and our chilly women       all these i can forgive and those forget     and greatly venerate our recent glories     and wish they were not owing to the tories                          l      but to my tale of laurafor i find       digression is a sin that by degrees     becomes exceeding tedious to my mind       and therefore may the reader too displease     the gentle reader who may wax unkind       and caring little for the authors ease     insist on knowing what he meansa hard     and hapless situation for a bard                          li      oh that i had the art of easy writing       what should be easy reading could i scale     parnassus where the muses sit inditing       those pretty poems never known to fail     how quickly would i print the world delighting       a grecian syrian221 or assyrian tale     and sell you mixed with western sentimentalism     some samples of the finest orientalism                          lii      but i am but a nameless sort of person       a broken dandy222 lately on my travels     and take for rhyme to hook my rambling verse on       the first that walkers lexicon unravels     and when i cant find that i put a worse on       not caring as i ought for critics cavils     ive half a mind to tumble down to prose     but verse is more in fashionso here goes                          liii      the count and laura made their new arrangement       which lasted as arrangements sometimes do     for half a dozen years without estrangement       they had their little differences too     those jealous whiffs which never any change meant       in such affairs there probably are few     who have not had this pouting sort of squabble     from sinners of high station to the rabble                          liv      but on the whole they were a happy pair       as happy as unlawful love could make them     the gentleman was fond the lady fair       their chains so slight twas not worth while to break them     the world beheld them with indulgent air       the pious only wished the devil take them     he took them not he very often waits     and leaves old sinners to be young ones baits                          lv      but they were young oh what without our youth       would love be what would youth be without love     youth lends its joy and sweetness vigour truth       heart soul and all that seems as from above     but languishing with years it grows uncouth       one of few things experience dont improve     which is perhaps the reason why old fellows     are always so preposterously jealous                          lvi      it was the carnival as i have said       some six and thirty stanzas back and so     laura the usual preparations made       which you do when your minds made up to go     tonight to mrs boehms masquerade223       spectator or partaker in the show     the only difference known between the cases     ishere we have six weeks of varnished faces                           lvii      laura when dressed was as i sang before       a pretty woman as was ever

learned lady centuries old whose name i forget but whose features must always be remembered i never saw greater beauty or sweetness or wisdomit is the kind of face to go mad for because it cannot walk

legend of the russian ukraine or frontier region is based on the passage in voltaires charles xii prefixed as the advertisement to the poem voltaire seems to have known very little about the man or his history and byron though he draws largely on his imagination was content to take his substratum of fact from voltaire the true story of mazeppa is worth retelling for its own sake and lends a fresh interest and vitality to the legend ivan stepanovitch mazeppa or mazepa born about the year 1645 was of cossack origin but appears to have belonged by descent or creation to the lesser nobility of the semipolish volhynia he began life 1660 as a page of honour in the court of king john casimir v of poland where he studied latin and acquired the tongue and pen of eloquent statesmanship banished from the court on account of a quarrel he withdrew to his mothers estate in volhynia and there to beguile the time made love to the wife of a neighbouring magnate the pane or lord falbowski the intrigue was discovered and to avenge his wrongs the outraged husband caused mazeppa to be stripped to the skin and bound to his own steed the horse lashed into madness and terrorstricken by the discharge of a pistol started off at a gallop and rushing thorough bush thorough briar carried his torn and bleeding rider into the courtyard of his own mansion  with regard to the sequel or issue of this episode history is silent but when the curtain rises again ad 1674 mazeppa is discovered in the character of writergeneral or foreign secretary to peter doroshénko hetman or president of the western ukraine on the hither side of the dniéper from the service of doroshénko who came to an untimely end he passed by a series of accidents into the employ of his rival samoïlovitch hetman of the eastern ukraine and as his secretary or envoy continued to attract the notice and to conciliate the good will of the regent tzarina sophia and her eminent boyard prince basil golitsyn a time came 1687 when it served the interests of russia to degrade samoïlovitch and raise mazeppa to the post of hetman and thenceforward for twenty years and more he held something like a regal sway over the whole of the ukraine a fertile nomans land watered by the dniéper and its tributaries openly the loyal and zealous ally of his neighbour and suzerain peter the great  how far this allegiance was genuine or whether a secret preference for poland the land of his adoption or a longconcealed impatience of muscovite suzerainty would in any case have urged him to revolt must remain doubtful but it is certain that the immediate cause of a final reversal of the allegiance and a break with the tsar was a second and still more fateful affaire du coeur the hetman was upwards of sixty years of age but even so he fell in love with his goddaughter matréna who in spite of difference of age and ecclesiastical kinship not only returned his love but to escape the upbraidings and persecution of her mother took refuge under his roof mazeppa sent the girl back to her home but as his loveletters testify continued to woo her with the tenderest and most passionate solicitings and although she finally yielded to force majeure and married another suitor her parents nursed their revenge and endeavoured to embroil the hetman with the tsar for a time their machinations failed and matrénas father kotchúbey together with his friend iskra were executed with the tsars assent and approbation before long however mazeppa who had been for some time past in secret correspondence with the swedes signalized his defection from peter by offering his services first to stanislaus of poland and afterwards to charles xii of sweden who was meditating the invasion of russia  pultowas day july 8 1709 was the last of mazeppas power and influence and in the following year march 31 1710 he died of old age perhaps of a broken heart at várnitza a village near bender on the dniester whither he had accompanied the

stripped his rein     and joyed to see how well he fed     for until now he had the dread     his wearied courser might refuse     to browse beneath the midnight dews     but he was hardy as his lord     and little cared for bed and board     but spirited and docile too     whateer was to be done would do     shaggy and swift and strong of limb                               70     all tartarlike he

my eyes     the hope of present slumber flies      well sire with such a hope ill track     my seventy years of memory back     i think twas in my twentieth spring     aye twaswhen casimir was king254     john casimiri was his page     six summers in my earlier age255                               130     a learnéd monarch faith was he     and most unlike your majesty     he made no wars and did not gain     new realms to lose them back again     and save debates in warsaws diet     he reigned in most unseemly quiet     not that he had no cares to vex     he loved the muses and the sex256     and sometimes these so froward are     they made him wish himself at war                                 140     but soon his wrath being oer he took     another mistressor new book     and then he gave prodigious fetes     all warsaw gathered round his gates     to gaze upon his splendid court     and dames and chiefs of princely port     he was the polish solomon     so sung his poets all but one     who being unpensioned made a satire     and boasted that he could not flatter                             150     it was a court of jousts and mimes     where every courtier tried at rhymes     even i for once produced some verses     and signed my odes despairing thyrsis     there was a certain palatine257       a count of far and high descent     rich as a salt or silver mine258     and he was proud ye may divine       as if from heaven he had been sent     he had such wealth in blood and ore                                160       as few could match beneath the throne     and he would gaze upon his store     and oer his pedigree would pore     until by some confusion led     which almost looked like want of head       he thought their merits were his own     his wife was not of this opinion       his junior she by thirty years     grew daily tired of his dominion       and after wishes hopes and fears                             170       to virtue a few farewell tears     a restless dream or twosome glances     at warsaws youthsome songs and dances     awaited but the usual chances     those happy accidents which render     the coldest dames so very tender     to deck her count with titles given     tis said as passports into heaven     but strange to say they rarely boast     of these who have deserved them most                             180                          v      i was a goodly stripling then       at seventy years i so may say     that there were few or boys or men       who in my dawning time of day     of vassal or of knights degree     could vie in vanities with me     for i had strengthyouthgaiety     a port not like to this ye see     but smooth as all is rugged now       for time and care and war have ploughed                       190     my very soul from out my brow       and thus i should be disavowed     by all my kind and kin could they     compare my day and yesterday     this change was wrought too long ere age     had taen my features for his page     with years ye know have not declined     my strengthmy courageor my mind     or at this hour i should not be     telling old tales beneath a tree                                  200     with starless skies my canopy       but let me on theresas259 form     methinks it glides before me now     between me and yon chestnuts bough       the memory is so quick and warm     and yet i find no words to tell     the shape of her i loved so well     she had the asiatic eye       such as our turkish neighbourhood       hath mingled with our polish blood                              210     dark as above us is the sky     but through it stole a tender light     like the first moonrise of midnight     large dark and swimming in the stream     which seemed to melt to its own beam     all love half languor and half fire     like saints that at the stake expire     and lift their raptured looks on high     as though it were a joy to diebs     a brow like a midsummer lake                                      220       transparent with the sun therein     when waves no murmur dare to make       and heaven beholds her face within     a cheek and lipbut why proceed       i loved her then i love her still     and such as i am love indeed       in fierce extremesin good and ill     but still we love even in our rage     and haunted to our very age     with the vain shadow of the past                                230     as is mazeppa to the last                          vi      we metwe gazedi saw and sighed     she did not speak and yet replied     there are ten thousand tones and signs     we hear and see but none defines     involuntary sparks of thought     which strike from out the heart oerwrought     and form a strange intelligence     alike mysterious and intense     which link the burning chain that binds                           240     without their will young hearts and minds     conveying as the electric260 wire     we know not how the absorbing fire     i saw and sighedin silence wept     and still reluctant distance kept     until i was made known to her     and we might then and there confer     without suspicionthen even then       i longed and was resolved to speak     but on my lips they died again                                    250       the accents tremulous and weak     until one hourthere is a game       a frivolous and foolish play       wherewith we while away the day     it isi have forgot the name     and we to this it seems were set     by some strange chance which i forget     i recked not if i won or lost       it was enough for me to be       so near to hear and oh to see                                  260     the being whom i loved the most     i watched her as a sentinel     may ours this dark night watch as well       until i saw and thus it was     that she was pensive nor perceived     her occupation nor was grieved     nor glad to lose or gain but still     played on for hours as if her will     yet bound her to the place though not     that hers might be the winning lotbt                            270       then through my brain the thought did pass     even as a flash of lightning there     that there was something in her air     which would not doom me to despair     and on the thought my words broke forth       all incoherent as they were     their eloquence was little worth     but yet she listenedtis enough       who listens once will listen twice       her heart be sure is not of ice                              280     and one refusal no rebuff                          vii      i loved and was beloved again       they tell me sire you never knew       those gentle frailties if tis true     i shorten all my joy or pain     to you twould seem absurd as vain     but all men are not born to reign     or oer their passions or as you     thus oer themselves and nations too     i amor rather wasa prince                                   290       a chief of thousands and could lead       them on where each would foremost bleed     but could not oer myself evince     the like controlbut to resume       i loved and was beloved again     in sooth it is a happy doom       but yet where happiest ends in pain     we met in secret and the hour     which led me to that ladys bower     was fiery expectations dower                                     300     my days and nights were nothingall     except that hour which doth recall     in the long lapse from youth to age       no other like itself id give       the ukraine back again to live     it oer once more and be a page     the happy page who was the lord     of one soft heart and his own sword     and had no other gem nor wealth     save natures gift of youth and health                            310     we met in secretdoubly sweet261     some say they find it so to meet     i know not thati would have given       my life but to have called her mine     in the full view of earth and heaven       for

be       but he was most enraged lest such       an accident should chance to touch     upon his future pedigree     nor less amazed that such a blot     his noble scutcheon should have got     while he was highest of his line                                  350       because unto himself he seemed       the first of men nor less he deemed     in others eyes and most in mine     sdeath with a

     wild as the wild deer and untaught     with spur and bridle undefiled       twas but a day he had been caught     and snorting with erected mane     and struggling fiercely but in vain     in the full foam of wrath and dread     to me the desertborn was led     they bound me on that menial throng     upon his back with many a thong                                   370     they loosed him with

 which on the wind came roaring after     a moment from that rabble rout     with sudden wrath i wrenched my head       and snapped the cord which to the mane       had bound my neck in lieu of rein     and writhing half my form about     howled back my curse but midst the tread     the thunder of my coursers speed     perchance they did not hear nor heed                              390     it

        400     nor dream that eer the fortress was     i saw its turrets in a blaze     their crackling battlements all cleft       and the hot lead pour down like rain     from off the scorched and blackening roof     whose thickness was not vengeanceproof       they little thought that day of pain     when launched as on the lightnings flash     they bade me to destruction dash       that one day i should come again                                410     with twice five thousand horse to thank       the count for his uncourteous ride     they played me then a bitter prank       when with

threatened by an incursion of cossacks the immediate cause was or was supposed to be the ill treatment which bogdán khmelnítzky a lithuanian had received at the hands of the polish governor czaplinski the governor it was alleged had carried off ravished and put to death khmelnítzkys wife and not content with this outrage had set fire to the house of the cossack in which perished his infant son in his cradle others affirmed that the cossack had begun the strife by causing the governor to be publicly and ignominiously whipped and that it was the cossacks mill and not his house which he burnt be that as it may casimir on being exhorted to take the field declined on the ground that the poles ought not to have set fire to khmelnítzkys house it is probably to this unpatriotic determination to look at both sides of the question that he earned the character of being an unwarlike prince as a matter of fact he fought and was victorious against the cossacks and tartars at bereteskow and

month of june 1819 to gratify the countess guiccioli before she left venice in april she had received a promise from byron to visit her at ravenna dantes tomb the classical pinewood and so forth had afforded a pretext for the invitation to be given and accepted and at length when she was as she imagined at the point of death he arrived better late than never on the festival of the corpus domini which fell that year on the tenth of june see her communication to moore life p 399 horses and books were left behind at venice but he could occupy his enforced leisure by writing something on the subject of dante ibid p 402 a heightened interest born of fuller knowledge in italian literature and italian politics lent zest to this labour of love and time and place conspiring he composed the best thing he ever wrote letter to murray march 23 1820 letters 1900 iv 422 his vision or prophecy of dante  it would have been strange if byron who had sounded his lament over the sufferings of tasso and who had become de facto if not de jure a naturalized italian had forborne to associate his name and fame with the sacred memory of the gran padre alighier if there had been any truth in friedrich schlegels pronouncement in a lecture delivered at vienna in 1814 that at no time has the greatest and most national of all italian poets ever been much the favourite of his countrymen the reproach had become meaningless as the sumptuous folio edition 4 vols of the divina commedia published at florence 181719 a quarto edition 4 vols published at rome 181517 a folio edition 3 vols published at bologna 181921 to which the conte giovanni marchetti vide the preface post p 245 contributed his famous excursus on the allegory in the first canto of the inferno and numerous other issues remain to testify dantes own countrymen were eager to pay honours almost divine to his memory the last age writes hobhouse in 1817 note 18 to canto iv of childe harolds pilgrimage poetical works 1899 ii 496 seemed inclined to undervalue him the present generation  has returned to the ancient worship and the danteggiare of the northern italians is thought even indiscreet by the more moderate tuscans dante was in the air as byron wrote in his diary january 29 1821 read schlegel probably in a translation published at edinburgh 1818 not a favourite why they talk dante write dante and think and dream dante at this moment 1821 to an excess which would be ridiculous but that he deserves it  there was too another reason why he was minded to write a poem on the subject of dante there was at this time a hope if not a clear prospect of political changeof throwing off the yoke of the bourbon of liberating italy from the tyrant and the stranger dante was the poet of liberty persecution exile the dread of a foreign grave could not shake his principles medwin conversations 1824 p 242 the prophecy was intended for the italians intended to foreshadow as in a vision liberty and the resurrection of italy ibid p 241 as he rode at twilight through the pine forest or along the silent shore which bounds ravennas immemorial wood the undying past inspired him with a vision of the future delayed indeed for a time the flame ending in smoke but fulfilled after many days a vision of a redeemed and united italy  the poem he says in the preface may be considered as a metrical experiment in beppo and the two first cantos of don juan he had proved that the ottava rima of the italians which frere had been one of the first to transplant might grow and flourish in an alien soil and now by way of a second venture he proposed to acclimatize the terza rima he was under the impression that hayley whom he had held up to ridicule as for ever feeble and for ever tame had been the first and last to try the measure in english but of hayleys excellent translation of the three first cantos of the inferno vide post p 244 note 1 praised but somewhat grudgingly praised by southey he had only seen an extract and of earlier experiments he was altogether ignorant as a matter of fact many poets had already essayed but timidly and without perseverance to come to the test in the metrification of the divine comedy

rima there was too one among byrons contemporaries who had already made trial of the metre in his prince athanase 1817 and the woodman and the nightingale 1818 and who shortly in his ode to the west wind october 1819 published 1820 was to prove that it was not impossible to write english poetry if not in genuine terza rima with its interchange of double rhymes at least in what has been happily styled the byronic terza rima it may however be taken for granted that at any rate in june 1819 these fragments of shelleys were unknown to byron long after byrons day but long years before his dream was realized mrs browning in her casa guidi windows 1851 in the same metre reechoed the same aspiration see her preface that the future of italy shall not be disinherited see for some of these

following year marino faliero doge of venice and the prophecy of dante were published in the same volume april 21 1821  the prophecy of dante was briefly but favourably noticed by jeffrey in his review of marino faliero edinb rev july 1821 vol 35 p 285 it is a very grand fervid turbulent and somewhat mystical composition full of the highest sentiment and the highest poetry  but disfigured by many faults of precipitation and overclouded with many obscurities its great fault with common readers will be that it is not sufficiently intelligible it is however beyond all question a work of a man of great genius  other notices of marino faliero and the prophecy of dante appeared in blackwoods edinburgh magazine april 1821 vol 9 pp 93103 in the monthly review may 1821 enlarged series vol 95

     ravenna june 21 1819                                       preface  in the course of a visit to the city of ravenna in the summer of 1819 it was suggested to the author that having composed something on the subject of tassos confinement he should do the same on dantes exilethe tomb of the poet forming one of the principal objects279 of interest in that city both to the native and to the stranger  on this hint i spake and the result has been the following four cantos in terza rima now offered to the reader if they are understood and approved it is my purpose to continue the poem in various other cantos to its natural conclusion in the present age the reader is requested to suppose that dante addresses him in the interval between the conclusion of the divina commedia and his death and shortly before the latter event foretelling the fortunes of italy in general in the ensuing centuries in adopting this plan i have had in my mind the cassandra of lycophron280 and the prophecy of nereus by horace as well as the prophecies of holy writ the measure adopted is the terza rima of dante which i am not aware to have seen hitherto tried in our language except it may be by mr hayley281 of whose translation i never saw but one extract quoted in the notes to caliph vathek so thatif i do not errthis poem may be considered as a metrical experiment the cantos are short and about the same length of those of the poet whose name i have borrowed and most likely taken in vain  amongst the inconveniences of authors in the present day it is difficult for any who have a name good or bad to escape translation i have had the fortune to see the fourth canto of childe harold282 translated into italian versi scioltithat is a poem written in the spenserean stanza into blank verse without regard to the natural divisions of the stanza or the sense if the present poem being on a national topic should chance to undergo the same fate i would request the italian reader to remember that when i have failed in the imitation of his great padre alighier283 i have failed in imitating that which all study and few understand since to this very day it is not yet settled what was the meaning of the allegory284 in the first canto of the inferno unless count marchettis ingenious and probable conjecture may be considered as having decided the question  he may also pardon my failure the more as i am not quite sure that he would be pleased with my success since the italians with a pardonable nationality are particularly jealous of all that is left them as a nationtheir literature and in the present bitterness of the classic and romantic war are but ill disposed to permit a foreigner even to approve or imitate them without finding some fault with his ultramontane presumption i can easily enter into all this knowing what would be thought in england of an italian imitator of milton or if a translation of monti pindemonte or arici285 should be held up to the rising generation as a model for their future poetical essays but i perceive that i am deviating into an address to the italian reader where my business is with the english one and be they few or many i must take my leave of both                               the prophecy of dante                                canto the first      once more in mans frail world which i had left       so long that twas forgotten and i feel       the weight of clay againtoo soon bereft     of the immortal vision which could heal       my earthly sorrows and to gods own skies       lift me from that deep gulf without repeal     where late my ears rung with the damned cries       of souls in hopeless bale and from that place       of lesser torment whence men may arise     pure from the fire to join the

         introduction to the morgante maggiore  it is possible that byron began his translation of the first canto of pulcis morgante maggiore so called to distinguish the entire poem of twentyeight cantos from the lesser morgante or to coin a title morganid which was published separately in the late autumn of 1819 before he had left venice see his letter to bankes february 19 1820 letters 1900 iv 403 it is certain that it was finished at ravenna during the first week of his domestication in the palazzo guiccioli letters to murray february 7 february 21 1820 he took a deal of pains with his selfimposed task servilely translating stanza from stanza and line from line two octaves every night and when the first canto was finished he was naturally and reasonably proud of his achievement more than two years had elapsed since freres whistlecraft had begotten beppo and in the interval he had written four cantos of don juan outstripping his immediate model and equalling if not surpassing his models parents and precursors the masters of narrative romantic poetry among the italians  in attempting this translationsomething as he once said of his armenian studies craggy for his mind to break upon letter to moore december 5 1816 letters 1900 iv 10byron believed that he was working upon virgin soil he had read as he admits in his advertisement john herman merivales poem orlando in roncesvalles which is founded upon the morgante maggiore but he does not seem to have been aware that many years before 1806 1807 the same writer one of the associate bards had published in the monthly magazine may july 1806 etc vide ante introduction to beppo p 156 a series of translations of selected passages of the poem there is no resemblance whatever between byrons laboured and faithful rendering of the text and merivales far more readable paraphrase and it is evident that if these selections ever passed before his eyes they had left no impression on his memory he was drawn to the task partly on account of its difficulty but chiefly because in pulci he recognized a kindred spirit who suggested and compelled a fresh and final dedication of his genius to the humorous epopee the translation was an act of devotion the offering of a disciple to a master  the apparent contradictions of the morgante maggiore  the brusque transition from piety to ribaldry from pathos to satire the paradoxical union of persiflage with gravity a confession of faith alternating with a profession of mockery and profanity have puzzled and confounded more than one student and interpreter an intimate knowledge of the history the literature the art the manners and passions of the times has enabled one of his latest critics and translators john addington symonds to come as near as may be to explaining the contradictions but the essential quality of pulcis humour eludes analysis  we know that the poem itself as pio rajna has shown the rifacimento of two earlier popular poems was written to amuse lucrezia tornabuoni the mother of lorenzo de medici and that it was recited canto by canto in the presence of such guests as poliziano ficino and michelangelo buonarotti but how it struck these contemporaries and whether a subtler instinct permitted them to untwist the strands and to appraise the component parts at their precise ethical and spiritual value are questions for the exercise of the critical imagination that which attracted byron to pulcis writings was no doubt the copresence of faith a certain simplicity of faith with an audacious and even outrageous handling of the objects of faith combined with a facile and wanton alternation of romantic passion with a cynical mockery of whatsoever things are sober and venerable don juan and the vision of judgment owe their existence to the morgante maggiore  the ms of the translation of canto i was despatched to england february 28 1820 it is evident see letters march 29 april 23 may 18 1820 letters 1900 iv 425 1901 v 17 21 that murray looked coldly on byrons masterpiece from the first it was certain that any new work by the author of don juan would be subjected to the severest and most hostile scrutiny and it was doubtful if a translation of part of an obscure and difficult poem vaguely supposed to be coarse and irreligious would meet with even a tolerable measure of success at any rate in spite of many inquiries and much vaunting of its excellence see letters june 29 september 12 1821 letters 1901 v 314 362 the ms remained for more than two years in murrays hands and it was not until other arrangements came into force that the translation of the first canto of the morgante maggiore appeared in the fourth and last number of the liberal which was issued by john hunt july 30 1823  for

advertisement  the morgante maggiore of the first canto of which this translation is offered divides with the orlando innamorato the honour of having formed and suggested the style and story of ariosto332 the great defects of boiardo were his treating too seriously the narratives of chivalry and his harsh style ariosto in his continuation by a judicious mixture of the gaiety of pulci has avoided the one and berni in his reformation of boiardos poem has corrected the other pulci may be considered as the precursor and model of berni altogether as he has partly been to ariosto however inferior to both his copyists he is no less the founder of a new style of poetry very lately sprung up in england i allude to that of the ingenious whistlecraft the serious poems on roncesvalles in the same language and more particularly the excellent one of mr merivale are to be traced to the same source333 it has never yet been decided entirely whether pulcis intention was or was not to deride the religion which is one of his favourite topics it appears to me that such an intention would have been no less hazardous to the poet than to the priest particularly in that age and country and the permission to publish the poem and its reception among the classics of italy prove that it neither was nor is so interpreted that he intended to ridicule the monastic life and suffered his imagination to play with the simple dulness of his converted giant seems evident enough but surely it were as unjust to accuse him of irreligion on this account as to denounce fielding for his parson adams barnabas334 thwackum supple and the ordinary in jonathan wildor scott for the exquisite use of his covenanters in the tales of my landlord  in the following translation i have used the liberty of the original with the proper names as pulci uses gan ganellon or ganellone carlo carlomagno or carlornano rondel or rondello etc as it suits his convenience so has the translator in other respects the version is faithful to the best of the translators ability in combining his interpretation of the one language with the not very easy task of reducing it to the same versification in the other the reader on comparing it with the original is requested to remember that the antiquated language of pulci however pure is not easy to the generality of italians themselves from its great mixture of tuscan proverbs and he may therefore be more indulgent to the present attempt how far the translator has succeeded and whether or no he shall continue the work are questions which the public will decide he was induced to make the experiment partly by his love for and partial intercourse with the italian language of which it is so easy to acquire a slight knowledge and with which it is so nearly impossible for a foreigner to become accurately conversant the italian language is like a capricious beauty who accords her smiles to all her favours to few and sometimes least to those who have courted her longest the translator wished also to present in an english dress a part at least of a poem never yet rendered into a northern language at the same time that it has been the original of some of the most celebrated productions on this side of the alps as well of those recent experiments in poetry in england which have been already mentioned                            the morgante

lose your life                          xxix      that passamont has in his hand three darts       such slings clubs ballaststones that yield you must     you know that giants have much stouter hearts       than us with reason in proportion just     if go you will guard well against their arts       for these are very barbarous and robust     orlando answered this ill see be sure     and walk the wild on foot to be secure                          xxx      the abbot signed the great cross on his front       then go you with gods benison and mine     orlando after he had scaled the mount       as the abbot had directed kept the line     right to the usual haunt of passamont       who seeing him alone in this design     surveyed him fore and aft with eyes observant     then asked him if he wished to stay as servant                          xxxi      and promised him an office of great ease       but said orlando saracen insane     i come to kill you if it shall so please       god not to serve as footboy in your train     you with his monks so oft have broke the peace       vile dog tis past his patience to sustain     the giant ran to fetch his arms quite furious     when he received an answer so injurious                          xxxii      and being returned to where orlando stood       who had not moved him from the spot and swinging     the cord he hurled a stone with strength so rude       as showed a sample of his skill in slinging     it rolled on count orlandos helmet good       and head and set both head and helmet ringing     so that he swooned with pain as if he died     but more than dead he seemed so stupified                          xxxiii      then passamont who thought him slain outright       said i will go and while he lies along     disarm me why such craven did i fight       but christ his servants neer abandons long     especially orlando such a knight       as to desert would almost be a wrong     while the giant goes to put off his defences     orlando has recalled his force and senses                          xxxiv      and loud he shouted giant where dost go       thou thoughtst me doubtless for the bier outlaid     to the right aboutwithout wings thourt too slow       to fly my vengeancecurrish renegade     twas but by treachery thou laidst me low       the giant his astonishment betrayed     and turned about and stopped his journey on     and then he stooped to pick up a great stone                          xxxv      orlando had cortana bare in hand       to split the head in twain was what he schemed     cortana clave the skull like a true brand       and pagan passamont died unredeemed     yet harsh and haughty as he lay he banned       and most devoutly macon still blasphemed343     but while his crude rude blasphemies he heard     orlando thanked the father and the word                          xxxvi      saying what grace to me thoust this day given       and i to thee o lord am ever bound     i know my life was saved by thee from heaven       since by the giant i was fairly downed     all things by thee are measured just and even       our power without thine aid would nought be found     i pray thee take heed of me till i can     at least return once more to carloman                          xxxvii      and having said thus much he went his way       and alabaster he found out below     doing the very best that in him lay       to root from out a bank a rock or two     orlando when he reached him loud gan say       how thinkst thou glutton such a stone to throw     when alabaster heard his deep voice ring     he suddenly betook him to his sling                          xxxviii      and hurled a fragment of a size so large       that if it had in fact fulfilled its mission     and roland not availed him of his targe       there would have been no need of a physician344     orlando set himself in turn to charge       and in his bulky bosom made incision     with all his sword the lout fell but oerthrown he     however by no means forgot macone                          xxxix      morgante had a palace in his mode       composed of branches logs of wood and earth     and stretched himself at ease in this abode       and shut himself at night within his berth     orlando knocked and knocked again to goad       the giant from his sleep and he came forth     the door to open like a crazy thing     for a rough dream had shook him slumbering                          xl      he thought that a fierce serpent had attacked him       and mahomet he called but mahomet     is nothing worth and not an instant backed him       but praying blessed jesu he was set     at liberty from all the fears which racked him       and to the gate he came with great regret     who knocks here grumbling all the while said he     that said orlando you will quickly see                          xli      i come to preach to you as to your brothers       sent by the miserable monksrepentance     for providence divine in you and others       condemns the evil done my new acquaintance     tis writ on highyour wrong must pay anothers       from heaven itself is issued out this sentence     know then that colder now than a pilaster     i left your passamont and alabaster                          xlii      morgante said oh gentle cavalier       now by thy god say me no villany     the favour of your name i fain would hear       and if a christian speak for courtesy     replied orlando so much to your ear       i by my faith disclose contentedly     christ i adore who is the genuine lord     and if you please by you may be adored                          xliii      the saracen rejoined in humble tone       i have had an extraordinary vision     a savage serpent fell on me alone       and macon would not pity my condition     hence to thy god who for ye did atone       upon the cross preferred i my petition     his timely succour set me safe and free     and i a christian am disposed to be                          xliv      orlando answered baron just and pious       if this good wish your heart can really move     to the true god who will not then deny us       eternal honour you will go above     and if you please as friends we will ally us       and i will love you with a perfect love     your idols are vain liars full of fraud     the only true god is the christians god                          xlv      the lord descended to the virgin breast       of mary mother sinless and divine     if you acknowledge the redeemer blest       without whom neither sun nor star can shine     abjure bad macons false and felon test       your renegado god and worship mine     baptize yourself with zeal since you repent     to which morgante answered im content                          xlvi      and then orlando to embrace him flew       and made much of his convert as he cried     to the abbey i will gladly marshal you       to whom morgante let us go replied     i to the friars have for peace to sue       which thing orlando heard with inward pride     saying my brother so devout and good     ask the abbot pardon as i wish you would                          xlvii      since god has granted your illumination       accepting you in mercy for his own     humility should be your first oblation       morgante said for goodness sake make known     since that your god is to be mineyour station       and let your name in verity be shown     then will i everything at your command do     on which the other said he was orlando                          xlviii      then quoth the giant blessed be jesu       a thousand times with gratitude and praise     oft perfect baron have i heard of you       through all the different periods of my days     and as i said to be your vassal too       i wish for your great gallantry always     thus reasoning they continued much to say     and onwards to the abbey went their way                          xlix      and by the way about the giants dead       orlando with morgante reasoned be     for their decease i pray you comforted       and since it is gods pleasure pardon me     a thousand wrongs unto the monks they bred       and our true scripture soundeth openly     good is rewarded and chastised the ill     which the lord never faileth to fulfil                          l      because his love of justice unto all       is such he wills his judgment should devour     all who have sin however great or small       but good he well remembers to restore     nor without justice holy could we call       him whom i now require you to adore     all men must make his will their wishes sway     and quickly and spontaneously obey                          li      and here our doctors are of one accord       coming on this point to the same conclusion     that in their thoughts who praise in heaven the lord       if pity eer was guilty of intrusion     for their unfortunate relations stored       in hell below and damned in great confusion     their happiness would be reduced to nought     and thus unjust the almightys self be thought                          lii      but they in christ have firmest hope and all       which seems to him to them too must appear     well done nor could it otherwise befall       he never can in any purpose err     if sire or mother suffer endless thrall       they dont disturb themselves for him or her     what pleases god to them must joy inspire     such is the observance of the eternal choir                          liii      a word unto the wise morgante said       is wont to be enough and you shall see     how much i grieve about my brethren dead       and if the will of god seem good to me     just as you tell me tis in heaven obeyed       ashes to ashesmerry let us be     i will cut off the hands from both their trunks     and carry them unto the holy monks                          liv      so that all persons may be sure and certain       that they are dead and have no further fear     to wander solitary this desert in       and that they may perceive my spirit clear     by the lords grace who hath withdrawn the curtain       of darkness making his bright realm appear     he cut his brethrens hands off at these words     and left them to the savage beasts and birds                          lv      then to the abbey they went on together       where waited them the abbot in great doubt     the monks who knew not yet the fact ran thither       to their superior all in breathless rout     saying with tremor please to tell us whether       you wish to have this person in or out     the abbot looking through upon the giant     too greatly feared at first to be compliant                          lvi      orlando seeing him thus agitated       said quickly abbot be thou of good cheer     he christ believes as christian must be rated       and hath renounced his macon false which here     morgante with the hands corroborated       a proof of both the giants fate quite clear     thence with due thanks the abbot god adored     saying thou hast contented me o lord                          lvii      he gazed morgantes height he calculated       and more than once contemplated his size     and then he said o giant celebrated       know that no more my wonder will arise     how you could tear and fling the trees you late did       when i behold your form with my own eyes     you now a true and perfect friend will show     yourself to christ as once you were a foe                          lviii      and one of our apostles saul once named       long persecuted sore the faith of christ     till one day by the spirit being inflamed       why dost thou persecute me thus said christ     and then from his offence he was reclaimed       and went for ever after preaching christ     and of the faith became a trump whose sounding     oer the whole earth is echoing and rebounding                          lix      so my morgante you may do likewise       he who repentsthus writes the evangelist     occasions more rejoicing in the skies       than ninetynine of the celestial list     you may be sure should each desire arise       with just zeal for the lord that youll exist     among the happy saints for evermore     but you were lost and damned to hell before                          lx      and thus great honour to morgante paid       the abbot many days they did repose     one day as with orlando they both strayed       and sauntered here and there whereer they chose     the abbot showed a chamber where arrayed       much armour was and hung up certain bows     and one of these morgante for a whim     girt on though useless he believed to him                          lxi      there being a want of water in the place       orlando like a worthy brother said     morgante i could wish you in this case       to go for water you shall be obeyed     in all commands was the reply straight ways       upon his shoulder a great tub he laid     and went out on his way unto a fountain     where he was wont to drink below the mountain                          lxii      arrived there a prodigious noise he hears       which suddenly along the forest spread     whereat from out his quiver he prepares       an arrow for his bow and lifts his head     and lo a monstrous herd of swine appears       and onward rushes with tempestuous tread     and to the fountains brink precisely pours     so that the giants joined by all the boars                          lxiii      morgante at a venture shot an arrow       which pierced a pig precisely in the ear     and passed unto the other side quite through       so that the boar defunct lay tripped up near     another to revenge his fellow farrow       against the giant rushed in fierce career     and reached the passage with so swift a foot     morgante was not now in time to shoot                          lxiv      perceiving that the pig was on him close       he gave him such a punch upon the head345     as floored him so that he no more arose       smashing the very bone and he fell dead     next to the other having seen such blows       the other pigs along the valley fled     morgante on his neck the bucket took     full from the spring which neither swerved nor shook                          lxv      the tub was on one shoulder and there were       the hogs on tother and he brushed apace     on to the abbey though by no means near       nor spilt one drop of water in his race     orlando seeing him so soon appear       with the dead boars and with that brimful vase     marvelled to see his strength so very great     so did the abbot and set wide the gate                          lxvi      the monks who saw the water fresh and good346       rejoiced but much more to perceive the pork     all animals are glad at sight of food       they lay their breviaries to sleep and work     with greedy pleasure and in such a mood       that the flesh needs no salt beneath their fork     of rankness and of rot there is no fear     for all the fasts are now left in arrear                          lxvii      as though they wished to burst at once they ate       and gorged so that as if the bones had been     in water sorely grieved the dog and cat       perceiving that they all were picked too clean     the abbot who to all did honour great       a few days after this convivial scene     gave to morgante a fine horse well trained     which he long time had for himself maintained                          lxviii      the horse morgante to a meadow led       to gallop and to put him to the proof     thinking that he a back of iron had       or to skim eggs unbroke was light enough     but the horse sinking with the pain fell dead       and burst while cold on earth lay head and hoof     morgante said get up thou sulky cur     and still continued pricking with the spur                          lxix      but finally he thought fit to dismount       and said i am as light as any feather     and he has burstto this what say you count       orlando answered like a ships mast rather     you seem to me and with the truck for front       let him go fortune wills that we together     should march but you on foot morgante still     to which the giant answered so i will                          lxx      when there shall be occasion you will see       how i approve my courage in the fight     orlando said i really think youll be       if it should prove gods will a goodly knight     nor will you napping there discover me       but never mind your horse though out of sight     twere best to carry him into some wood     if but the means or way i understood                          lxxi      the giant said then carry him i will       since that to carry me he was so slack     to render as the gods do good for ill       but lend a hand to place him on my back     orlando answered if my counsel still       may weigh morgante do not undertake     to lift or carry this dead courser who     as you have done to him will do to you                          lxxii      take care he dont revenge himself though dead       as nessus did of old beyond all cure     i dont know if the fact youve heard or read       but he will make you burst you may be sure     but help him on my back morgante said       and you shall see what weight i can endure     in place my gentle roland of this palfrey     with all the bells id carry yonder belfry                          lxxiii      the abbot said the steeple may do well       but for the bells youve broken them i wot     morgante answered let them pay in hell       the penalty who lie dead in yon grot     and hoisting up the horse from where he fell       he said now look if i the gout have got     orlando in the legsor if i have force     and then he made two gambols with the horse                          lxxiv      morgante was like any mountain framed       so if he did this tis no prodigy     but secretly himself orlando blamed       because he was one of his family     and fearing that he might be hurt or maimed       once more he bade him lay his burden by     put down nor bear him further the desert in     morgante said ill carry him for certain                          lxxv      he did and stowed him in some nook away       and to the abbey then returned with speed     orlando said why longer do we stay       morgante here is nought to do indeed     the abbot by the hand he took one day       and said with great respect he had agreed     to leave his reverence but for this decision     he wished to have his pardon and permission                          lxxvi      the honours they continued to receive       perhaps exceeded what his merits claimed     he said i mean and quickly to retrieve       the lost days of time past which may be blamed     some days ago i should have asked your leave       kind father but i really was ashamed     and know not how to show my sentiment     so much i see you with our stay content                          lxxvii      but in my heart i bear through every clime       the abbot abbey and this solitude     so much i love you in so short a time       for me from heaven reward you with all good     the god so true the eternal lord sublime       whose kingdom at the last hath open stood     meantime we stand expectant of your blessing     and recommend us to your prayers with pressing                          lxxviii      now when the abbot count orlando heard       his heart grew soft with inner tenderness     such fervour in his bosom bred each word       and cavalier he said if i have less     courteous and kind to your great worth appeared       than fits me for such gentle blood to express     i know i have done too little in this case     but blame our ignorance and this poor place                          lxxix      we can indeed but honour you with masses       and sermons thanksgivings and paternosters     hot suppers dinners fitting other places       in verity much rather than the cloisters     but such a love for you my heart embraces       for thousand virtues which your bosom fosters     that wheresoeer you go i too shall be     and on the other part you rest with me                          lxxx      this may involve a seeming contradiction       but you i know are sage and feel and taste     and understand my speech with full conviction       for your just pious deeds may you be graced     with the lords great reward and benediction       by whom you were directed to this waste     to his high mercy is our freedom due     for which we render thanks to him and you                          lxxxi      you saved at once our life and soul such fear       the giants caused us that the way was lost     by which we could pursue a fit career       in search of jesus and the saintly host     and your departure breeds such sorrow here       that comfortless we all are to our cost     but months and years you would not stay in sloth     nor are you formed to wear our sober cloth                          lxxxii      but to bear arms and wield the lance indeed       with these as much is done as with this cowl     in proof of which the scripture you may read       this giant up to heaven may bear his soul     by your compassion now in peace proceed       your state and name i seek not to unroll     but if im asked this answer shall be given     that here an angel was sent down from heaven                          lxxxiii      if you want armour or aught else go in       look oer the wardrobe and take what you choose     and cover with it oer this giants skin       orlando answered if there should lie loose     some armour ere our journey we begin       which might be turned to my companions use     the gift would be acceptable to me     the abbot said to him come in and see                          lxxxiv      and in a certain closet where the wall       was covered with old armour like a crust     the abbot said to them i give you all       morgante rummaged piecemeal from the dust     the whole which save one cuirass347 was too small       and that too had the mail inlaid with rust     they wondered how it fitted him exactly     which neer had suited others so compactly                          lxxxv      twas an immeasurable giants who       by the great milo of agrante fell     before the abbey many years ago       the story on the wall was figured well     in the last moment of the abbeys foe       who long had waged a war implacable     precisely as the war occurred they drew him     and there was milo as he overthrew him                          lxxxvi      seeing this history count orlando said       in his own heart o god who in the sky     knowst all things how was milo hither led       who caused the giant in this place to die     and certain letters

1817 to lay the foundation of another tragedy venice was new to him and on visiting the doges palace the veiled space intended for the portrait of marin falier and the giants staircase where as he believed he was once crowned and afterwards decapitated had laid hold of his imagination while the legend of the congiura an old man jealous and conspiring against the state of which he was  chief promised a subject which the devil himself might have dramatized con amore  but other interests and ideas claimed his attention and for more than three years the project slept at length he slips into the postscript of a letter to murray dated ravenna april 9 1820 letters 1901 v 7 an intimation that he had begun a tragedy on the subject of marino faliero the doge of venice the imitation of dante the translation of pulci the danticles etc were worked off and in prospecting for a new vein a fresh lode of literary ore he passed by a natural transition from italian literature to italian history from the romantic and humorous epopee of pulci and berni to the pseudoclassic drama of alfieri and monti  jealousy as monk lewis had advised him august 1817 was an exhausted passion in the drama and to lay the scene in venice was to provoke comparison with shakespeare and otway but the man himself the fiery doge passionate but not jealous a noble turned democrat pro hac vice an old man greatly finding quarrel in a straw afforded a theme historically timehonoured and yet unappropriated by tragic art  there was too a living interest in the story for history was repeating itself and politics were savage and uncertain mischief was afoot and the tradition of a conspiracy which failed might find an historic parallel in a conspiracy which would succeed there was that brewing in italy which might perhaps inspire a people to redress itself and with a cry of up with the republic down with the nobility send the barbarians of all nations back to their own dens letters 1901 v 10 12 19  in taking the field as a dramatist byron sought to win distinction for himselfin the first place by historical accuracy and secondly by artistic regularityby a stricter attention to the dramatic unities history is closely followed he tells murray in a letter dated july 17 1820 and again in the preface vide post pp 332337 which is an expansion of the letter he gives a list of the authorities which he had consulted and claims to have transferred into our language an historical fact worthy of commemoration more than once in his letters to murray he reverts to this profession of accuracy and encloses some additional note in which he points out and rectifies an occasional deviation from the historical record in this respect at any rate he could contend on more than equal terms with established writers that is with shakespeare and otway and could present to his countrymen an exacter and so more lifelike picture of the venetian republic it is plain too that he was bitten with the love of study for its own sake with a premature passion for erudition and that he sought and found relief from physical and intellectual excitement in the intricacies of research if his history is at fault it was not from any lack of diligence on his part but because the materials at his disposal or within his cognizance were inaccurate and misleading he makes no mention of the huge collection of venetian archives which had recently been deposited in the convent of the frari or of dorias transcript of sanudos diaries bequeathed in 1816 to the library of st mark but he quotes as his authorities the vitæ ducum venetorum of marin sanudo 14661535 the storia etc of andrea navagero 14831529 and the principj di storia etc of vettor sandi which belongs to the latter half of the eighteenth century byrons chroniclers were ancient but not ancient enough and though they handed down the story see medwin conversations p 173 they depart in numerous particulars from the facts recorded in contemporary documents unquestionably the legend as it appears in sanudos perplexing and uncritical narrative see for the translation of an original version of the italian appendix pp 462467 is more dramatic than the low beginnings of the myth which may be traced to the annalists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries but like other legends it is insusceptible of proof byrons doge is almost if not quite as

compositions by preserving a nearer approach to unity by substituting the regularity of french and italian models for the barbarities of the elizabethan dramatists and their successors goethe conversations 1874 p 114 is said to have laughed to think that byron who in practical life could never adapt himself and never even asked about a law finally subjected himself to the stupidest of lawsthat of the three unities it was perhaps in part with this object in view to make his readers smile to provoke their astonishment that he affected a severity foreign to his genius and at variance with his record it was an agreeable thought that he could so easily pass from one extreme to another from manfred to marino faliero and at the same time indulge in a little sally of gratuitous sauciness quarterly review july 1822 vol xxvii p 480 at the expense of his own countrymen but there were other influences at work he had been powerfully impressed by the energy and directness of alfieris work and he was eager to emulate the gravity and simplicity if not the terseness and conciseness of his style and language the drama was a new world to conquer and so far as his own literature was concerned it appeared that success might be attainable by a severer approach to the rules letter to murray february 16 1821that by taking alfieri as his model he might step into the first rank of english dramatists  goethe thought that byron failed to understand the purpose of the three unities that he regarded the law as an end in itself and did not perceive that if a play was comprehensible the unities might be neglected and disregarded it is possible that his blind obedience to the law may have been dictated by the fervour of a convert but it is equally possible that he looked beyond the law or its fulfilment to an ulterior object the discomfiture of the romantic school with its contempt for regularity its passionate appeal from art to nature if he was minded to raise a grecian temple of the purest architecture letters 1901 v appendix iii p 559 it was not without some thought and hope of shaming by force of contrast the mosque the grotesque edifice of barbarian contemporaries and rivals byron was ever a fighter and his claim to regularity to a closer preservation of the unities was of the nature of a challenge  marino faliero was dedicated to baron goethe but the letter which should have contained the dedication was delayed in transit goethe never saw the dedication till it was placed in his hands by john murray the third in 1831 but he read the play and after byrons death bore testimony to its peculiar characteristics and essential worth lord byron notwithstanding his predominant personality has sometimes had the power of renouncing himself altogether as may be seen in some of his dramatic pieces particularly in his marino faliero in this piece one quite forgets that lord byron or even an englishman wrote it we live entirely in venice and entirely in the time in which the action takes place the personages speak quite from themselves and their own condition without having any of the subjective feelings thoughts and opinions of the

days after the publication of the first edition april 21 1821 an injunction was obtained from lord chancellor eldon prohibiting a performance announced for that evening elliston pursued the chancellor to the steps of his own house and at the last moment persuaded him to allow the play to be acted on that night only legal proceeedings were taken but in the end the injunction was withdrawn with the consent of byrons solicitors and the play was represented again on april 30 and on five nights in the following may as byron had foreseen marino faliero was coldly received by the playgoing public and

marino faliero is one of the most remarkable events in the annals of the most singular government city and people of modern history it occurred in the year 1355 every thing about venice is or was extraordinaryher aspect is like a dream and her history is like a romance the story of this doge is to be found in all her chronicles and particularly detailed in the lives of the doges by marin sanuto which is given in the appendix it is simply and clearly related and is perhaps more dramatic in itself than any scenes which can be founded upon the subject  marino faliero appears to have been a man of talents and of courage i find him commanderinchief of the land forces at the siege of zara359 where he beat the king of hungary and his army of eighty thousand men killing eight thousand men and keeping the besieged at the same time in check an exploit to which i know none similar in history except that of cæsar at alesia360 and of prince eugene at belgrade he was afterwards commander of the fleet in the same war he took capo distria he was ambassador at genoa and romeat which last he received the news of his election to the dukedom his absence being a proof that he sought it by no intrigue since he was apprised of his predecessors death and his own succession at the same moment but he appears to have been of an ungovernable temper a story is told by sanuto of his having many years before when podesta and captain at treviso boxed the ears of the bishop who was somewhat tardy in bringing the host361 for this honest sanuto saddles him with a judgment as thwackum did square362 but he does not tell us whether he was punished or rebuked by the senate for this outrage at the time of its commission he seems indeed to have been afterwards at peace with the church for we find him ambassador at rome and invested with the fief of val di marino in the march of treviso and with the title of count by lorenzo countbishop of ceneda for these facts my authorities are sanuto vettor sandi363 andrea navagero364 and the account of the siege of zara first published by the indefatigable abate morelli in his monumenti veneziani di varia letteratura printed in 1796365 all of which i have looked over in the original language the moderns darù sismondi and laugier nearly agree with the ancient chroniclers sismondi attributes the conspiracy to his jealousy but i find this nowhere asserted by the national historians vettor sandi indeed says that altri scrissero chedalla gelosa suspizion di esso doge siasi fatto michel steno staccar con violenza etc etc but this appears to have been by no means the general opinion nor is it alluded to by sanuto or by navagero and sandi himself adds a moment after that per altre veneziane memorie traspiri che non il solo desiderio di vendetta lo dispose alla congiura ma anche la innata abituale ambizion sua per cui aneleva a farsi principe independente the first motive appears to have been excited by the gross affront of the words written by michel steno on the ducal chair and by the light and inadequate sentence of the forty on the offender who was one of their tre capi366 the attentions of steno himself appear to have been directed towards one of her damsels and not to the dogaressa367 herself against whose fame not the slightest insinuation appears while she is praised for her beauty and remarked for her youth neither do i find it asserted unless the hint of sandi be an assertion that the doge was actuated by jealousy of his wife but rather by respect for her and for his own honour warranted by his past services and present dignity  i know not that the historical facts are alluded to in english unless by dr moore in his view of italy368 his account is false and flippant full of stale jests about old men and young wives and wondering at so great an effect from so slight a cause how so acute and severe an observer of mankind as the author of zeluco could wonder at this is inconceivable he knew that a basin of water spilt on mrs mashams gown deprived the duke of marlborough of his command and led to the inglorious peace of utrechtthat louis xiv was plunged into the most desolating wars because his minister was nettled at his finding fault with a window and wished to give him another occupationthat helen lost troythat lucretia expelled the tarquins from romeand that cava brought the moors to spainthat an insulted husband led the gauls to clusium and thence to romethat a single verse of frederick ii369 of prussia on the abbé de bernis and a jest on madame de pompadour led to the battle of rosbachthat the elopement of dearbhorgil370 with mac murchad conducted the english to the slavery of ireland that a personal pique between maria antoinette and the duke of orleans precipitated the first expulsion of the bourbonsand not to multiply instances of the teterrima causa that commodus domitian and caligula fell victims not to their public tyranny but to private vengeanceand that an order to make cromwell disembark from the ship in which he would have sailed to america destroyed both king and commonwealth after these instances on the least reflection it is indeed extraordinary in dr moore to seem surprised that a man used to command who had served and swayed in the most important offices should fiercely resent in a fierce age an unpunished affront the grossest that can be offered to a man be he prince or peasant the age of faliero is little to the purpose unless to favour it      the young mans wrath is like light straw on fire     but like red hot steel is the old mans ire                          davie gellatleys song in waverley chap xiv      young men soon give and soon forget affronts     old age is slow at both  laugiers reflections are more philosophicaltale fù il fine ignominioso di un uomo che la sua nascità la sua età il suo carattere dovevano tener lontano dalle passioni produttrici di grandi delitti i suoi talenti per lungo tempo esercitati ne maggiori impieghi la sua capacità sperimentata ne governi e nelle ambasciate gli avevano acquistato la stima e la fiducia de cittadini ed avevano uniti i suffragj per collocarlo alla testa della repubblica innalzato ad un grado che terminava gloriosamente la sua vita il risentimento di un ingiuria leggiera insinuò nel suo cuore tal veleno che bastò a corrompere le antiche sue qualità e a condurlo al termine dei scellerati serio esempio che prova non esservi età in cui la prudenza umana sia sicura e che nell uomo restano sempre passioni capaci a disonorarlo quando non invigili sopra se stesso371  where did dr moore find that marino faliero begged his life i have searched the chroniclers and find nothing of the kind it is true that he avowed all he was conducted to the place of torture but there is no mention made of any application for mercy on his part and the very circumstance of their having taken him to the rack seems to argue any thing but his having shown a want of firmness which would doubtless have been also mentioned by those minute historians who by no means favour him such indeed would be contrary to his character as a soldier to the age in which he lived and at which he died as it is to the truth of history i know no justification at any distance of time for calumniating an historical character surely truth belongs to the dead and to the unfortunate and they who have died upon a scaffold have generally had faults enough of their own without attributing to them that which the very incurring of the perils which conducted them to their violent death renders of all others the most improbable the black veil which is painted over the place of marino faliero amongst the doges and the giants staircase372 where he was crowned and discrowned and decapitated struck forcibly upon my imagination as did his fiery character and strange story i went in 1819 in search of his tomb more than once to the church san giovanni e san paolo and as i was standing before the monument of another family a priest came up to me and said i can show you finer monuments than that i told him that i was in search of that of the faliero family and particularly of the doge marinos oh said he i will show it you and conducting me to the outside pointed out a sarcophagus in the wall with an illegible inscription373 he said that it had been in a convent adjoining but was removed after the french came and placed in its present situation that he had seen the tomb opened at its removal there were still some bones remaining but no positive vestige of the decapitation the equestrian statue374 of which i have made mention in the third act as before that church is not however of a faliero but of some other now obsolete warrior although of a later date there were two other doges of this family prior to marino ordelafo who fell in battle at zara in 1117 where his descendant afterwards conquered the huns and vital faliero who reigned in 1082 the family originally from fano was of the most illustrious in blood and wealth in the city of once the most wealthy and still the most ancient families in europe the length i have gone into on this subject will show the interest i have taken in it whether i have succeeded or not in the tragedy i have at least transferred into our language an historical fact worthy of commemoration  it is now four years that i have meditated this work and before i had sufficiently examined the records i was rather disposed to have made it turn on a jealousy in faliero but perceiving no foundation for this in historical truth and aware that jealousy is an exhausted passion in the drama i have given it a more historical form i was besides well advised by the late matthew lewis375 on that point in talking with him of my intention at venice in 1817 if you make him jealous said he recollect that you have to contend with established writers to say nothing of shakespeare and an exhausted subjectstick to the old fiery doges natural character which will bear you out if properly drawn and make your plot as regular as you can sir william drummond376 gave me nearly the same counsel how far i have followed these instructions or whether they have availed me is not for me to decide i have had no view to the stage in its present state it is perhaps not a very exalted object of ambition besides i have been too much behind the scenes to have thought it so at any timect and i cannot conceive any man of irritable feelingcu putting himself at the mercies of an audience the sneering reader and the loud critic and the tart review are scattered and distant calamities but the trampling of an intelligent or of an ignorant audience on a production which be it good or bad has been a mental labour to the writer is a palpable and immediate grievance heightened by a mans doubt of their competency to judge and his certainty of his own imprudence in electing them his judges were i capable of writing a play which could be deemed stageworthy success would give me no pleasure and failure great pain it is for this reason that even during the time of being one of the committee of one of the theatres i never made the attempt and never will377 but i wish that others would for surely there is dramatic power somewhere where joanna baillie and milman and john wilson exist the city of the plague1816 and the fall of jerusalem 1820 are full of the best matériel for tragedy that has been seen since horace walpole except passages of ethwald1802 and de montfort1798 it is the fashion to underrate horace walpole firstly because he was a nobleman and secondly because he was a gentleman but to say nothing of the composition of his incomparable letters and of the castle of otranto1765 he is the ultimus romanorum the author of the mysterious mother1768 a tragedy of the highest order and not a puling loveplay he is the father of the first romance and of the last tragedy in our language and surely worthy of a higher place than any living writer be he who he may378  in speaking of the drama of marino faliero i forgot to mention that the desire of preserving though still too remote a nearer approach to unity than the irregularity which is the reproach of the english theatrical compositions permits has induced me to represent the conspiracy as already formed and the doge acceding to it whereas in fact it was of his own preparation and that of israel bertuccio the other characters except that of the duchess incidents and almost the time which was wonderfully short for such a design in real life are strictly historical except that all the consultations took place in the palace had i followed this the unity would have been better preserved but i wished to produce the doge in the full assembly of the conspirators instead of monotonously placing him always in dialogue with the same individuals for the real facts i refer to the appendix379

question which i asked                        270     before bertuccio added to our cause     this great ally who renders it more sure     and therefore safer and as such admits     some dawn of mercy to a portion of     our victimsmust all perish in this slaughter      cal all who encounter me and minebe sure     the mercy they have shown i show      consp                            all all     is

  280     injustice to thy comrades and thy cause     dost thou not see that if we single out     some for escape they live but to avenge     the fallen and how distinguish now the innocent     from out the guilty all their acts are one     a single emanation from one body     together knit for our oppression tis     much that we let their children live i doubt     if all of these even should be set apart     the hunter may reserve some single cub                             290     from out the tigers litter but who eer     would seek to save the spotted sire or dam     unless to perish by

leaves drop from the oerblown flower     and left me a lone blighted thorny stalk                          310     which in its solitude can shelter nothing     so as they let me wither let them perish      cal they cannot coexist with venice freedom      doge ye though you know and feel our mutual mass     of many wrongs even ye are ignorantdv     what fatal poison to the springs of life

when the survivors of long years and actions     which now belong to history soothe the days                       330     which yet remain by treasuring each other     and never meet but each beholds the mirror     of half a century on his brothers brow     and sees a hundred beings now in earth     flit round them whispering of the days gone by     and seeming not all dead as long as two     of the brave joyous reckless glorious band     which once were one and many still retain     a breath to sigh for them a tongue to speak     of deeds that else were silent save on marble

dreading he should snatch the tyranny                         380     from out their grasp and he abhorring tyrants     to me then these men have no private life     nor claim to ties they have cut

ebullition of the vice     the general corruption generated     by the foul aristocracy he could not     he dared not in more honourable days     have risked it i have merged all private wrath     against him in the thought of our great purpose     a slave insults mei require his punishment     from his proud masters hands if he refuse it                    410     the offence grows his and let

more pallid gleam along the tapestried walls                       30     spread over the reluctant gloom which haunts     those vast and dimlylatticed galleries     a dazzling mass of artificial

attained by study in all not supernatural parts he is perfect even his very defects belong or seem to belong to the parts themselves and appear truer to nature but of kemble we may say with reference

  tenderness and force are to be found but that altogether these      do not constitute poets etc etc       i regret to see a great man falling into a great mistake this      opinion of yours only proves that the dictionary of ten thousand      living english authorsa has not been translated into german      you will have read in your friend schlegels version the dialogue      in macbeth

eightyseven poets all alive at this moment whatever      their works may be as their booksellers well know and amongst      these there are several who possess a far greater reputation than      mine though considerably less than yours it is owing to this      neglect on the part of your german translators that you are not      aware of the works of william wordsworth who has a baronet in      londonc who draws him frontispieces and leads him about to      dinners and to the play and a lord in the countryd who gave him      a place in the exciseand a cover at his table you do not know

by way of sample to enlighten you they form      but two bricks of our babel windsor bricks by the way but may      serve for a specimen of the building       it is moreover asserted that the predominant character of the      whole body of the present english poetry is a disgust and      contempt for life but i rather suspect that by one single work      of prose you yourself have excited a greater contempt for life      than all the english volumes of poesy that ever were written      madame de stäel says that werther has occasioned more suicides      than the most beautiful woman and i really believe that he has      put more individuals out of this world than napoleon      himselfexcept in the way of his profession perhaps illustrious      sir the acrimonious judgment passed by a celebrated northern      journalf upon you in particular and the germans in general has      rather indisposed you towards english poetry as well as criticism      but you must not regard our critics who are at bottom goodnatured      fellows considering their two professionstaking up the law in      court and laying it down out of it no one can more lament their      hasty and unfair judgment in your particular than i do and i so      expressed myself to your friend schlegel in 1816 at coppet       in behalf of my ten thousand living brethren and of myself i      have thus far taken notice of an opinion expressed with regard to      english poetry in general and which merited notice because it      was yours       my principal object in addressing you was to testify my sincere      respect and admiration of a man who for half a century has led      the literature of a great nation and will go down to posterity as      the first literary character of his age       you have been fortunate sir not only in the writings which have      illustrated your name but in the name itself as being      sufficiently musical for the articulation of posterity in this you      have the advantage of some of your countrymen whose names would      perhaps be immortal alsoif anybody could pronounce them       it may perhaps be supposed by this apparent tone of levity      that i am wanting in intentional respect towards you but this will      be a mistake i am always flippant in prose considering you as i      really and warmly do in common with all your own and with most      other nations to be by far the first literary character which has      existed in europe since the death of voltaire i felt and feel      desirous to inscribe to you the following worknot as being      either a tragedy or a poem for i cannot pronounce upon its      pretensions to be either one or the other or both or neither      but as a mark of esteem and admiration from a foreigner to the man      who has been hailed in germany the great goethe       i have the honour to be       with the truest respect       your most obedient and       very humble servant       byron       ravenna 8bre 14º

england at least when i left it four or five years ago some of      the english scribblers it is true abused pope and swift but the      reason was that they themselves did not know how to write either      prose or verse but nobody thought them worth making a sect of      perhaps there may be something of the kind sprung up lately but i      have not heard much about it and it would be such

fresh candidates for the great council on the  approval of the doge but strict as these provisions were they did not suffice to restrict the government to the aristocracy it was soon decreed that only

for tragedy you will not find me a popular writer unless it is love furious criminal and hapless as in the mysterious mother or in alfieris mirra or shelleys cenci it ought not to make a tragic subject when it is melting and maudlin it does but it ought not to do it is then for the gallery and secondprice boxes it is probable that he owed these sentiments to the theory and practice of vittorio alfieri it is extraordinary writes m de fallette barrol monthly magazine april 1805 reprinted in preface to tragedie di alfieri a montucci edinburgh 1805 i xvi sq that a man whose soul possessed an uncommon share of ardour and sensibility and had experienced all the violence of the passions should scarcely have condescended to introduce love into his tragedies or when he does that he should only employ it with a kind of reserve and severity he probably regarded it as a hackneyed agent for in  myrrha it appears in such a strange character that all the art of the writer is not capable of divesting it of an air at once ludicrous and disgusting  but apart from the example of alfieri there was another motive at worka determination to prove to the world that he was the master of his own temperament and that if he chose he could cast away frivolity and cynicism and clothe himself with austerity as with a garment he had been taken to task for treating wellnigh with equal

c  477 459if the doges prophecy seem remarkable look to the following made by alamanni two hundred and seventy years agothere is one very singular prophecy concerning venice if thou dost not change it says to that proud republic thy liberty which is already on the wing will not reckon a century more than the thousandth year if we carry back the epocha of venetian freedom to the establishment of the government under which the republic flourished we shall find that the date of the election of the first doge is 697 and if we add one century to a thousand that is eleven hundred years we shall find the sense of the prediction to be literally this thy liberty will not last till 1797 recollect that venice ceased to be free in the year 1796 the fifth year of the french republic and you will perceive that there never was prediction more pointed or more exactly followed by the event you will therefore note as very remarkable the three lines of alamanni addressed to venice which however no

cohen483 to whom the reader will find himself indebted for a version that i could not myselfthough after many years intercourse with italianhave given by any means so purely and so faithfully   story of marino faliero doge xliv mcccliv483a   on the eleventh day of september in the year of our lord 1354 marino faliero was elected and chosen to be the duke of the commonwealth of venice he was count of valdemarino in the marches of treviso and a knight and a wealthy man to boot as soon as the election was completed it was resolved in the great council that a deputation of twelve should be despatched to marino faliero the duke who was then on his way from rome for when he was chosen he was ambassador at the court of the holy father at romethe holy father himself held his court at avignon when messer marino faliero the duke was about to land in this city on the 5th day of october 1354 a thick haze came on and darkened the air and he was enforced to land on the place of saint mark between the two columns on the spot where evil doers are put to death and all thought that this was the worst of tokensnor must i forget to write that which i have read in a chroniclewhen messer marino faliero was podesta and captain of treviso the bishop delayed coming in with the holy sacrament on a day when a procession was to take place now the said marino faliero was so very proud and wrathful that he buffeted the bishop and almost struck him to the ground and therefore heaven allowed marino faliero to go out of his right senses in order that he might bring himself to an evil death  when this duke had held the dukedom during nine months and six days he being wicked and ambitious sought to make himself lord of venice in the manner which i have read in an ancient chronicle when the thursday arrived upon which they were wont to hunt the bull the bull hunt took place as usual and according to the usage of those times after the bull hunt had ended they all proceeded unto the palace of the duke and assembled together in one of his halls and they disported themselves with the women and until the first bell tolled they danced and then a banquet was served up my lord the duke paid the expenses thereof provided he had a duchess and after the banquet they all returned to their homes  now to this feast there came a certain ser michele steno a gentleman of poor estate and very young but crafty and daring and who loved one of the damsels of the duchess ser michele stood amongst the women upon the solajo and he behaved indiscreetly so that my lord the duke ordered that he should be kicked off the solajo ie platform and the esquires of the duke flung him down from the solajo accordingly ser michele thought that such an affront was beyond all bearing and when the feast was over and all other persons had left the palace he continuing heated with anger went to the hall of audience and wrote certain unseemly words relating to the duke and the duchess upon the chair in which the duke was used to sit for in those days the duke did not cover his chair with cloth of sendal but he sat in a chair of wood ser michele wrote thereonmarin falier the husband of the fair wife others kiss her but he keeps her484 in the morning the words were seen and the matter was considered to be very scandalous and the senate commanded the avogadori of the commonwealth to proceed therein with the greatest diligence a largess of great amount was immediately proffered by the avogadori in order to discover who had written these words and at length it was known that michele steno had written them it was resolved in the council of forty that he should be arrested and he then confessed that in the fit of vexation and spite occasioned by his being thrust off the solajo in the presence of his mistress he had written the words therefore the council debated thereon and the council took his youth into consideration and that he was a lover and therefore they adjudged that he should be kept in close confinement during two months and that afterwards he should be banished from venice and the state during one year in consequence of this merciful sentence the duke became exceedingly wroth it appearing to him that the council had not acted in such a manner as was required by the respect due to his ducal dignity and he said that they ought to have condemned ser michele to be hanged by the neck or at least to be banished for life  now it was fated that my lord duke marino was to have his head cut off and as it is necessary when any effect is to be brought about that the cause of such effect must happen it therefore came to pass that on the very day after sentence had been pronounced on ser michele steno being the first day of lent a gentleman of the house of barbara a choleric gentleman went to the arsenal and required certain things of the masters of the galleys this he did in the presence of the admiral of the arsenal and he bearing the request answered no it cannot be done high words arose between the gentleman and the admiral and the gentleman struck him with his fist just above the eye and as he happened to have a ring on his finger the ring cut the admiral and drew blood the admiral all bruised and bloody ran straight to the duke to complain and with the intent of praying him to inflict some heavy punishment upon the gentleman of cà barbarowhat wouldst thou have me do for thee answered the duke think upon the shameful gibe which hath been written concerning me and think on the manner in which they have punished that ribald michele steno who wrote it and see how the council of forty respect our personupon this the admiral answered my lord duke if you would wish to make yourself a prince and to cut all those cuckoldy gentlemen to pieces i have the heart if you do but help me to make you prince of all this state and then you may punish them all hearing this the duke said how can such a matter be brought aboutand so they discoursed thereon  the duke called for his nephew ser bertuccio faliero who lived with him in the palace and they communed about this plot and without leaving the place they sent for philip calendaro a seaman of great repute and for bertuccio israello who was exceedingly wily and cunning then taking counsel among themselves they agreed to call in some others and so for several nights successively they met with the duke at home in his palace and the following men were called in singly to witniccolo fagiuolo giovanni da corfu stefano fagiono niccolo dalle bende niccolo biondo and stefano trivisanoit was concerted that sixteen or seventeen leaders should be stationed in various parts of the city each being at the head of forty men armed and prepared but the followers were not to know their destination on the appointed day they were to make affrays amongst themselves here and there in order that the duke might have a pretence for tolling the bells of san marco these bells are never rung but by the order of the duke and at the sound of the bells these sixteen or seventeen with their followers were to come to san marco through the streets which open upon the piazza and when the noble and leading citizens should come into the piazza to know the cause of the riot then the conspirators were to cut them in pieces and this work being finished my lord marino faliero the duke was to be proclaimed the lord of venice things having been thus settled they agreed to fulfil their intent on wednesday the 15th day of april in the year 1355 so covertly did they plot that no one ever dreamt of their machinations  but the lord who hath always helped this most glorious city and who loving its righteousness and holiness hath never forsaken it inspired one beltramo bergamasco to be the cause of bringing the plot to light in the following manner this beltramo who belonged to ser niccolo lioni of santo stefano had heard a word or two of what was to take place and so in the abovementioned month of april he went to the house of the aforesaid ser niccolo lioni and told him all the particulars of the plot ser niccolo when he heard all these things was struck dead as it were with affright he heard all the particulars and beltramo prayed him to keep it all secret and if he told ser niccolo it was in order that ser niccolo might stop at home on the 15th of april and thus save his life beltramo was going but ser niccolo ordered his servants to lay hands upon him and lock him up ser niccolo then went to the house of messer giovanni gradenigo nasoni who afterwards became duke and who also lived at santo stefano and told him all the matter seemed to him to be of the very greatest importance as indeed it was and they two went to the house of ser marco cornaro who lived at san felice and having spoken with him they all three then determined to go back to the house of ser niccolo lioni to examine the said beltramo and having questioned him and heard all that he had to say they left him in confinement and then they all three went into the sacristy of san salvatore and sent their men to summon the councillors the avogadori the capi de dieci and those of the great council  when all were assembled the whole story was told to them they were struck dead as it were with affright they determined to send for beltramo he was brought in before them they examined him and ascertained that the matter was true and although they were exceedingly troubled yet they determined upon their measures and they sent for the capi de quarante the signori di notte the capi de sestieri and the cinque della pace and they were ordered to associate to their men other good men and true who were to proceed to the houses of the ringleaders of the conspiracy and secure them and they secured the foreman of the arsenal in order that the conspirators might not do mischief towards nightfall they assembled in the palace when they were assembled in the palace they caused the gates of the quadrangle of the palace to be shut and they sent to the keeper of the belltower and forbade the tolling of the bells all this was carried into effect the beforementioned conspirators were secured and they were brought to the palace and as the council of ten saw that the duke was in the plot they resolved that twenty of the leading men of the state should be associated to them for the purpose of consultation and deliberation but that they should not be allowed to ballot  the counsellors were the followingser giovanni mocenigo of the sestiero of san marco ser almoro veniero da santa marina of the sestiero of castello ser tomaso viadro of the sestiero of canaregio ser giovanni sanudo of the sestiero of santa croce ser pietro trivisano of the sestiero of san paolo ser pantalione barbo il grando of the sestiero of ossoduro the avogadori of the commonwealth were zufredo morosini and ser orio pasqualigo and these did not ballot those of the council of ten were ser giovanni marcello ser tomaso sanudo and ser micheletto dolfino the heads of the aforesaid council of ten ser luca da legge and ser pietro da mosto inquisitors of the aforesaid council and ser marco polani ser marino veniero ser lando lombardo and ser nicoletto trivisano of sant angelo  late in the night just before the dawning they chose a junta of twenty noblemen of venice from amongst the wisest and the worthiest and the oldest they were to give counsel but not to ballot and they would not admit any one of cà faliero and niccolo faliero and another niccolo faliero of san tomaso were expelled from the council because they belonged to the family of the doge and this resolution of creating the junta of twenty was much praised throughout the state the following were the members of the junta of twentyser marco giustiniani procuratore ser andrea erizzo procuratore ser lionardo giustiniani procuratore ser andrea contarini ser simone dandolo ser niccolo volpe ser giovanni loredano ser marco diedo ser giovanni gradenigo ser andrea cornaro cavaliere ser marco soranzo ser rinieri du mosto ser gazano marcello ser marino morosini ser stefano belegno ser niccolo lioni ser filippo orio ser marco trivisano ser jacopo bragadino ser giovanni foscarini  these twenty were accordingly called in to the council of ten and they sent for my lord marino faliero the duke and my lord marino was then consorting in the palace with people of great estate gentlemen and other good men none of whom knew yet how the fact stood  at the same time bertuccio israello who as one of the ringleaders was to head the conspirators in santa croce was arrested and bound and brought before the council zanello del brin nicoletto di rosa nicoletto alberto and the guardiaga were also taken together with several seamen and people of various ranks these were examined and the truth of the plot was ascertained  on the 16th of april judgment was given in the council of ten that filippo calendaro and bertuccio israello should be hanged upon the red pillars of the balcony of the palace from which the duke is wont to look at the bull hunt and they were hanged with gags in their mouths  the next day the following were condemnedniccolo zuccuolo nicoletto blondo nicoletto doro marco giuda jacomello dagolino nicoletto fidele the son of filippo calendaro marco torello called israello stefano trivisano the moneychanger of santa margherita and antonio dalle bende these were all taken at chiozza for they were endeavouring to escape afterwards by virtue of the sentence which was passed upon them in the council of ten they were hanged on successive days some singly and some in couples upon the columns of the palace beginning from the red columns and so going onwards towards the canal and other prisoners were discharged because although they had been involved in the conspiracy yet they had not assisted in it for they were given to understand by some of the heads of the plot that they were to come armed and prepared for the service of the state and in order to secure certain criminals and they knew nothing else nicoletto alberto the guardiaga and bartolommeo ciricolo and his son and several others who were not guilty were discharged  on friday the 16th day of april judgment was also given in the aforesaid council of ten that my lord marino faliero the duke should have his head cut off and that the execution should be done on the landingplace of the stone staircase where the dukes take their oath when they first enter the palace on the following day the 17th of april the doors of the palace being shut the duke had his head cut off about the hour of noon and the cap of estate was taken from the dukes head before he came down stairs when the execution was over it is said that one of the council of ten went to the columns of the palace over against the place of st mark and that he showed the bloody sword unto the people crying out with a loud voicethe terrible doom hath fallen upon the traitorand the doors were opened and the people all rushed in to see the corpse of the duke who had been beheaded  it must be known that ser giovanni sanudo the councillor was not present when the aforesaid sentence was pronounced because he was unwell and remained at home so that only fourteen balloted that is to say five councillors and nine of the council of ten and it was adjudged that all the lands and chattels of the duke as well as of the other traitors should be forfeited to the state and as a grace to the duke it was resolved in the council of ten that he should be allowed to dispose of two thousand ducats out of his own property and it was resolved that all the councillors and all the avogadori of the commonwealth those of the council of ten and the members of the junta who had assisted in passing sentence on the duke and the other traitors should have the privilege of carrying arms both by day and by night in venice and from grado to cavazere and they were also to be allowed two footmen carrying arms the aforesaid footmen living and boarding with them in their own houses and he who did not keep two footmen might transfer the privilege to his sons or his brothers but only to two permission of carrying arms was also granted to the four notaries of the chancery that is to say of the supreme court who took the depositions and they were amedio nicoletto di lorino steffanello and pietro de compostelli the secretaries of the signori di notte  after the traitors had been hanged and the duke had had his head cut off the state remained in great tranquillity and peace and as i have read in a chronicle the corpse of the duke was removed in a barge with eight torches to his tomb in the church of san giovanni e paolo where it was buried the tomb is now in that aisle in the middle of the little church of santa maria della pace which was built by bishop gabriel of bergamo it is a coffin of stone with these words engraven thereon heic jacet dominus marinus faletro duxand they did not paint his portrait in the hall of the great councilbut in the place where it ought to have been you see these wordshic est locus marini faletro decapitati pro criminibusand it is thought that his house was granted to the church of sant apostolo it was that great one near the bridge yet this could not be the case or else the family bought it back from the church for it still belongs to cà faliero i must not refrain from noting that some wished to write the following words in the place where his portrait ought to have been as

io son d avviso che egli abbia ottenuto ciò che non si concedette a nessun altro mentre adempiva gli uffici di legato presso il pontefice e sulle rive del rodano trattava la pace che io prima di lui avevo indarno tentato di conchiudere gli fu conferito l onore del ducato che nè chiedeva nè s aspettava tornato in patria pensò a quello cui nessuno non pose mente giammai e soffrì quello che a niuno accadde mai di soffrire giacchè in quel luogo celeberrimo e chiarissimo e bellissimo infra tutti quelli che io vidi ove i suoi antenati avevano ricevuti grandissimi onori in mezzo alle pompe trionfali ivi egli fu trascinato in modo servile e spogliato delle insegne ducali perdette la testa e macchiò col proprio sangue le soglie del tempio l atrio del palazzo e le scale marmoree endute spesse volte

a personal friend of petrarchs antica dimestichezza old intimacy is the phrase of the poet 2dly that petrarch thought that he had more courage than conduct più di coraggio che di senno 3dly that there was some jealousy on the part of petrarch for he says that marino faliero was treating of the peace which he himself had vainly attempted to conclude 4thly that the honour of the dukedom was conferred upon him which he neither sought nor expected che nè chiedeva nè aspettava and which had never been granted to any other in like circumstances ciò che non si concedette a nessun altro a proof of the high esteem in which he must have been held 5thly that he had a reputation for wisdom only forfeited by the last enterprise of his life si usurpò per tanti anni una falsa fama di sapienzahe had usurped for so many years a false fame of wisdom rather a difficult task i should think people are generally found out before eighty years of age at least in a republicfrom these and the other historical notes which i have collected it may be inferred that marino faliero possessed many of the qualities but not the success of a hero and that his passions were too violent the paltry and ignorant account of dr moore falls to the ground petrarch says that there had been no greater event in his times our times literally nostri tempi in italy he also differs from the historian in saying that faliero was on the banks of the rhone instead of at rome when elected the other accounts say that the deputation of the venetian senate met him at ravenna how this may have been it is not for me to decide and is of no great importance had the man succeeded he would have changed the face of venice and perhaps of italy as it is what are they both                                     note c  venetian society and manners      vice without splendour sin without relief     even from the gloss of love to smooth it oer     but in its stead coarse lusts of habitude etc  to these attacks so frequently pointed by the government against the clergyto the continual struggles between the different constituted bodiesto these enterprises carried on by the mass of the nobles against the depositaries of powerto all those projects of innovation which always ended by a stroke of state policy we must add a cause not less fitted to spread contempt for ancient doctrines this was the excess of corruption  that freedom of manners which had been long boasted of as the principal charm of venetian society had degenerated into scandalous licentiousness the tie of marriage was less sacred in that catholic country than among those nations where the laws and religion admit of its being dissolved because they could not break the contract they feigned that it had not existed and the ground of nullity immodestly alleged by the married pair was admitted with equal facility by priests and magistrates alike corrupt these divorces veiled under another name became so frequent that the most important act of civil society was discovered to be amenable to a tribunal of exceptions and to restrain the open scandal of such proceedings became the office of the police in 1782 the council of ten decreed that every woman who should sue for a dissolution of her marriage should be compelled to await the decision of the judges in some convent to be named by the court486 soon afterwards the same council summoned all causes of that nature before itself487 this infringement on ecclesiastical jurisdiction having occasioned some remonstrance from rome the council retained only the right of rejecting the petition of the married persons and consented to refer such causes to the holy office as it should not previously have rejected488  there was a moment in which doubtless the destruction of private fortunes the ruin of youth the domestic discord occasioned by these abuses determined the government to depart from its established maxims concerning the freedom of manners allowed the subject all the courtesans were banished from venice but their absence was not enough to reclaim and bring back good morals to a whole people brought up in the most scandalous licentiousness depravity reached the very bosoms of private families and even into the cloister and they found themselves obliged to recall and even to indemnify489 women who sometimes gained possession of important secrets and who might be usefully employed in the ruin of men whose fortunes might have rendered them dangerous since that time licentiousness has gone on increasing and we have seen mothers not only selling the innocence of their daughters but selling it by a contract authenticated by the signature of a public officer and the performance of which was secured by the protection of the laws490  the parlours of the convents of noble ladies and the houses of the courtesans though the police carefully kept up a number of spies about them were the only assemblies for society in venice and in these two places so different from each other there was equal freedom music collations gallantry were not more forbidden in the parlours than at the casinos there were a number of casinos for the purpose of public assemblies where gaming was the principal pursuit of the company it was a strange sight to see persons of either sex masked or grave in their magisterial robes round a table invoking chance and giving way at one instant to the agonies of despair at the next to the illusions of hope and that without uttering a single word  the rich had private casinos but they lived incognito in them and the wives whom they abandoned found compensation in the liberty they enjoyed the corruption of morals had deprived them of their empire we have just reviewed the whole history of venice and we have not once seen them exercise the slightest influencedaru hist de la répub de vénise paris 1821 v 328332                                       the author of sketches descriptive of italy 1820 etc one of the

my conversation as he had repeatedly declined an introduction to me while in italy  who this person may be i know not491 but he must have been deceived by all or any of those who repeatedly offered to introduce him as i invariably refused to receive any english with whom i was not previously acquainted even when they had letters from england if the whole assertion is not an invention i request this person not to sit down with the notion that he could have been introduced since there has been nothing i have so carefully avoided as any kind of intercourse with his countrymenexcepting the very few who were for a considerable time resident in venice or had been of my previous acquaintance whoever made him any such offer was possessed of impudence equal to that of making such an assertion without having had it the fact is that i hold in utter abhorrence any contact with the travelling english as my friend the consul general hoppner and the countess benzoni in whose house the conversazione mostly frequented by them is held could amply testify were it worth while i was persecuted by these tourists even to my riding ground at lido and reduced to the most disagreeable circuits to avoid

to be for what could it import to the reader to be told that the author had repeatedly declined an introduction even if it had been true which for the reasons i have above given is scarcely possible

judgment is a parody of southeys vision of judgement  the acts or fyttes of the quarrel between byron and southey occur in the following order in the summer of 1817 southey accompanied by his friends humphrey senhouse and the artist edward nash passed some weeks july in switzerland they visited chamouni and at montanvert in the travellers album they found in shelleys handwriting a greek hexameter verse in which he affirmed that he was an atheist together with an indignant comment fool also in greek superadded in an unknown hand see life of shelley by e dowden 1886 ii 30 note southey copied this entry into his notebook and spoke of the circumstance on his return circ august 12 1817 in the course of the next year some one told byron that a rumour had reached england that he and shelley had formed a league of incest with two sisters and that southey and coleridge were the authors of the scandal there is nothing to show through what channel the report of the rumour reached byrons ears but it may be inferred that it was in his mind see letter to murray november 24 1818 letters 1900 iv 272 when he assailed southey in the dedication in good simple savage verse to the first canto of don juan which was begun september 6 1818 shelley who was already embittered against southey see the account of a dinner at godwins november 6 1817 diary of h c robinson 1869 ii 67 heard byron read this dedication and in a letter to peacock october 8 1818 describes it as being more like a mixture of wormwood and verdigrease than satire  when don juan appeared july 15 1819 the dedication was not forthcoming but of its existence and character southey had been informed have you heard he asks letter to the rev h hill selections from the letters etc 1856 iii 142 that don juan came over with a dedication to me in which lord castlereagh and i  were coupled together for abuse as the two roberts a fear of persecution sic from the one robert is supposed to be the reason why it has been suppressed lord byron might have done well to remember that the other can write dedications also and make his own cause good if it were needful in prose or rhyme against a villain as well as against a slanderer  when george iii died january 29 1820 it became the duty of the laurelhonouring laureate to write a funeral ode and in composing a preface in vindication of the english hexameter he took occasion incidentally to repay some of his obligations to lord byron by a few comments on don juan letter to the rev h hill january 8 1821 selections etc iii 225 he was no doubt impelled by other and higher motives to constitute himself a censor morum and take up his parable against the spirit of the age as displayed and fostered in don juan see a letter to wynne march 23 1821 selections etc iii 238 but the suppressed dedication and certain gibes which had been suffered to appear may be reckoned as the immediate causes of his anathema  southeys vision of judgement was published april 11 1821an undivine comedy in which the apotheosis of george iii the beatification of the virtuous and the bale and damnation of such egregious spirits as robespierre wilkes and junius are thrown upon the screen of the showman or lecturer southey said that the vision ought to be read aloud and if the subject could be forgotten and ignored the hexameters might not sound amiss but the subject and its treatment are impossible and intolerable the vision would have made sport for byron in any case but in the preface southey went out of his way to attack and denounce the anonymous author of don juan  what then he asks ed 1838 x 204 should be said of those for whom the thoughtlessness and inebriety of wanton youth can no longer be pleaded but who have written in sober manhood and with deliberate purpose men of diseased hearts and depraved imaginations who forming a system of opinions to suit their own unhappy course of conduct have rebelled against the holiest ordinances of human society and hating that revealed religion which with all their efforts and bravadoes they are unable entirely to disbelieve labour to make others as miserable as themselves by infecting them with a moral virus that eats into the soul the school which they have set up may properly be called the satanic school for though their productions breathe the spirit of belial in their lascivious parts and the spirit of moloch in those loathsome images of atrocities and horrors which they delight to represent they are more especially characterized by a satanic pride and audacious impiety which still betrays the wretched feeling of hopelessness wherewith it is allied  byron was not slow to take up the challenge in the appendix to the two foscari first ed pp 325329 which was written at ravenna junejuly but not published till december 11 1821 he retaliates on mr southey and his pious preface in many words but when it comes to the point ignores the charge of having published a lascivious book and endeavours by countercharges to divert the odium and to cover his adversary with shame and confusion mr s he says with a cowardly ferocity exults over the anticipated deathbed repentance of the objects of his dislike and indulges himself in a pleasant vision of judgment in prose as well as verse full of impious impudence i am not ignorant he adds of mr southeys calumnies on a different occasion knowing them to be such which he scattered abroad on his return from switzerland against me and others what his deathbed may be it is not my province to predicate let him settle it with his maker as i must do with mine there is something at once ludicrous and blasphemous in this arrogant scribbler of all works sitting down to deal damnation and destruction upon his fellowcreatures with wat tyler the apotheosis of george the third and the elegy on martin the regicide all shuffled together in his writingdesk  southey must have received his copy of the two foscari in the last week of december 1821 and with the appendix to say nothing of the third canto of don juan before him he gave tongue in the pages of the courier january 6 1822 his task was an easy one he was able to deny in toto the charge of uttering calumnies on his return from switzerland and he was pleased to word his denial in a very disagreeable way he had come home with a stock of travellers tales but not one of them was about lord byron he had sought for no staler subject than st ursula his charges of impiety lewdness profanation and pollution had not been answered and were unanswerable and as to his being a scribbler of all work there were exceptionsworks which he had not scribbled the nefanda which disfigured the writings of lord byron satanic school would stick  so far the battle went in southeys favour the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel and byron was reduced to silence a challenge sent through kinnaird but not delivered was but a confession of impotence there was however in southeys letter to the courier just one sentence too many before he concluded he had given one word of advice to lord byronwhen he attacks me again let it be in rhyme for one who has so little command of himself it will be a great advantage that his temper should be obliged to keep tune  byron had anticipated this advice and had already attacked the laureate in rhyme scornfully and satirically but with a gay and genial mockery which dispensed with wormwood and verdigrease or yet bitterer and more venomous ingredients  there was a truth in lambs jest that it was southeys vision of judgement which was worthy of prosecution that lord byrons poem was of a most goodnatured descriptionno malevolence diary of h c robinson 1869 ii 240 goodnatured or otherwise it awoke inextinguishable laughter and left byron in possession of the field  the vision of judgment begun may 7 but probably laid aside till september 11 was forwarded to murray october 4 1821 by this post he wrote to moore october 6 1821 letters 1901 v 387 i have sent my nightmare to balance the incubus of southeys impudent anticipation of the apotheosis of george the third a chance perusal of southeys letter in the courier see medwins conversations 1824 p 222 and letters to douglas kinnaird february 6 25 1822 quickened his desire for publication but in spite of many appeals and suggestions to murray who had sent byrons copy to his printer the decisive step of passing the proofs for press was never taken at length byron lost patience and desired murray to hand over the corrected copy of the proof with the preface of the vision of judgment to john hunt see letters to murray july 3 6 1822 letters 1901 vi 92 93 finally a year after the ms had been sent to england the vision of judgment by quevedo redivivus appeared in the first number pp 139 of the liberal which was issued october 15 1822 the preface to byrons astonishment and annoyance was not forthcoming see letter to murray october 22 1822 letters 1901 vi 126 and examiner sunday november 3 1822 p 697 and is not prefixed to the first issue of the vision of judgment in the first number of the liberal  the liberal was severely handled by the press see for example the literary gazette for october 19 26 november 2 1822 see too an anonymous pamphlet entitled a critique on the liberal london 1822 8vo 16 pages which devotes ten pages to an attack on the vision of judgment the daily press was even more violent the courier for october 26 begins thus this scoundrellike publication has at length made its appearance  there was even a threat of prosecution byron offered to employ counsel for hunt to come over to england to stand his trial in his stead and blamed murray for not having handed over the corrected proof in which some of the more offensive passages had been omitted or mitigated see letter to murray december 25 1822 and letter to john hunt january 8 1823 letters 1901 vi 155 159 it is to be noted that in the list of errata affixed to the table of contents at the end of the first volume of the liberal the words a weaker king neer are substituted for a worse king never stanza viii line 6 and an unhandsome woman for a bad ugly woman stanza xii line 8 it would seem that these emendations which do not appear in the ms were slipped into the errata as precautions not as afterthoughts  nevertheless it was held that a publication calumniating the late king and wounding the feelings of his present majesty was a danger to the public peace and on january 15 1824 the case of the king v john hunt was tried in the court of kings bench the jury brought in a verdict of guilty but judgment was deferred and it was not till july 19 1824 three days after the author of the vision of judgment had been laid to rest at hucknall torkard that the publisher was sentenced to pay to the king a fine of one hundred pounds and to enter into securities for five years for a larger amount  for the complete text of

rushed in where he had no business and where he never was before and never will be again the following poem would not have been written it is not impossible that it may be as good as his own seeing that it cannot by any species of stupidity natural or acquired be worse the gross flattery the dull impudence the renegade intolerance and impious cant of the poem by the author of wat tyler are something so stupendous as to form the sublime of himselfcontaining the quintessence of his own attributes  so much for his poema word on his preface in this preface it has pleased the magnanimous laureate to draw the picture of a supposed satanic school the which he doth recommend to the notice of the legislature thereby adding to his other laurels the ambition of those of an informer if there exists anywhere except in his imagination such a school is he not sufficiently armed against it by his own intense vanity the truth is that there are certain writers whom mr s imagines like scrub to have talked of him for they laughed consumedly492  i think i know enough of most of the writers to whom he is supposed to allude to assert that they in their individual capacities have done more good in the charities of life to their fellowcreatures in any one year than mr southey has done harm to himself by his absurdities in his whole life and this is saying a great deal but i have a few questions to ask  1stly is mr southey the author of wat tyler  2ndly was he not refused a remedy at law by the highest judge of his beloved england because it was a blasphemous and seditious publication493  3rdly was he not entitled by william smith in full parliament a rancorous renegado494  4thly is he not poet laureate with his own lines on martin the regicide staring him in the face495  and 5thly putting the four preceding items together with what conscience dare he call the attention of the laws to the publications of others be they what they may  i say nothing of the cowardice of such a proceeding its meanness speaks for itself but i wish to touch upon the motive which is neither more nor less than that mr s has been laughed at a little in some recent publications as he was of yore in the antijacobin by his present patrons hence all this skimble scamble stuff about satanic and so forth however it is worthy of himqualis ab incepto  if there is anything obnoxious to the political opinions of a portion of the public in the following poem they may thank mr southey he might have written hexameters as he has written everything else for aught that the writer caredhad they been upon another subject but to attempt to canonise a monarch who whatever were his household virtues was neither a successful nor a patriot kinginasmuch as several years of his reign passed in war with america and ireland to say nothing of the aggression upon francelike all other exaggeration necessarily begets opposition in whatever manner he may be spoken of in this new vision his public career will not be more favourably transmitted by history of his private virtues although a little expensive to the nation there can be no doubt  with regard to the supernatural personages treated of i can only say that i know as much about them and as an honest man have a better right to talk of them than robert southey i have also treated them more tolerantly the way in which that poor insane creature the laureate deals about his judgments in the next world is like his own judgment in this if it was not completely ludicrous it would be something worse i dont think that there is much more to say at present                                                          quevedo redivivus  psit is possible that some readers may object in these objectionable times to the freedom with which saints angels and spiritual persons discourse in this vision but for precedents upon such points i must refer him to fieldings journey from this world to the next and to the visions of myself the said quevedo in spanish or translated496 the reader is also requested to observe that no doctrinal tenets are insisted upon or discussed that the person of the deity is carefully withheld from sight which is more than can be said for the laureate who hath thought proper to make him talk not like a schooldivine497 but like the unscholarlike mr southey the whole action passes on the outside of heaven and chaucers wife of bath pulcis morgante maggiore swifts tale of a tub and the other works above referred to are cases in point of the freedom with which saints etc may be permitted to converse in works not intended to be serious                                                                        qr     mr southey being as he says a good christian and vindictive threatens i understand a reply to this our answer it is to be hoped that his visionary faculties will in the meantime have acquired a little more judgment properly so called otherwise he will get himself into new dilemmas these apostate jacobins furnish rich rejoinders let him take a specimen mr southey laudeth grievously one mr landor498 who cultivates much private renown in the shape of latin verses and not long ago the poet laureate dedicated to him it appeareth one of his fugitive lyrics upon the strength of a poem called gebir who could suppose that in this same gebir the aforesaid savage landor for such is his grim cognomen putteth into the infernal regions no less a person than the hero of his friend mr southeys heavenyea even george the third see also how personal savage becometh when he hath a mind the following is his portrait of our late gracious sovereign       prince gebir having descended into the infernal regions the      shades of his royal ancestors are at his request called up to his      view and he exclaims to his ghostly  guide      aroar what wretch that nearest us what wretch     is that with eyebrows white and slanting brow     listen him yonder who bound down supine

rushing sound of wind and stream and flame     in short a roar of things extremely great       which would have made aught save a saint exclaim     but he with first a start and then a wink     said theres another star gone out i thinkgm                          xvii      but ere he could return to his repose       a cherub flapped his right wing oer his eyes     at which saint peter yawned and rubbed his nose       saint porter said the angel prithee rise     waving a goodly wing which glowed as glows       an earthly peacocks tail with heavenly dyes     to which the saint replied well whats the matter     is lucifer come back with all this clatter                          xviii      no quoth the cherub george the third is dead       and who is george the third replied the apostle     what george what third the king of england said       the angel well he wont find kings to jostle     him on his way but does he wear his head       because the last we saw here had a tustle     and neer would have got into heavens good graces     had he not flung his head in all our faces                          xix      he wasif i rememberking of france510       that head of his which could not keep a crown     on earth yet ventured in my face to advance       a claim to those of martyrslike my own     if i had had my sword as i had once       when i cut ears off i had cut him down     but having but my keys and not my brand     i only knocked his head from out his hand                          xx      and then he set up such a headless howl       that all the saints came out and took him in     and there he sits by saint paul cheek by jowlgn       that fellow paulthe parvenù the skin511     of saint bartholomew which makes his cowl       in heaven and upon earth redeemed his sin     so as to make a martyr never sped     better than did this weak and wooden head                          xxi      but had it come up here upon its shoulders       there would have been a different tale to tell     the fellowfeeling in the saints beholders       seems to have acted on them like a spell     and so this very foolish head heaven solders       back on its trunk it may be very well     and seems the custom here to overthrow     whatever has been wisely done below                          xxii      the angel answered peter do not pout       the king who comes has head and all entire     and never knew much what it was about       he did as doth the puppetby its wire     and will be judged like all the rest no doubt       my business and your own is not to inquire     into such matters but to mind our cue     which is to act as we are bid to do                          xxiii      while thus they spake the angelic caravan       arriving like a rush of mighty wind     cleaving the fields of space as doth the swan       some silver stream say ganges nile or inde     or thames or tweed and midst them an old man       with an old soul and both extremely blind     halted before the gate and in his shroud     seated their fellowtraveller on a cloud512                          xxiv      but bringing up the rear of this bright host       a spirit of a different aspect waved     his wings like thunderclouds above some coast       whose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved     his brow was like the deep when tempesttossed       fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved     eternal wrath on his immortal face     and where he gazed a gloom pervaded space                          xxv      as he drew near he gazed upon the gate       neer to be entered more by him or sin     with such a glance of supernatural hate       as made saint peter wish himself within     he pottered513 with his keys at a great rate       and sweated through his apostolic skingo     of course his perspiration was but ichor     or some such other spiritual liquorgp                          xxvi      the very cherubs huddled all together       like birds when soars the falcon and they felt     a tingling to the tip of every feather       and formed a circle like orions belt     around their poor old charge who scarce knew whither       his guards had led him though they gently dealt     with royal manes for by many stories     and true we learn the angels all are tories                          xxvii      as things were in this posture the gate flew       asunder and the flashing of its hinges     flung over space an universal hue       of manycoloured flame until its tinges     reached even our speck of earth and made a new       aurora borealis spread its fringes     oer the north pole the same seen when icebound     by captain parrys crew in melvilles soundgq514                          xxviii      and from the gate thrown open issued beaming       a beautiful and mighty thing of light515     radiant with glory like a banner streaming       victorious from some worldoerthrowing fight     my poor comparisons must needs be teeming       with earthly likenesses for here the night     of clay obscures our best conceptions saving     johanna southcote516 or bob southey raving517                          xxix      twas the archangel michael all men know       the make of angels and archangels since     theres scarce a scribbler has not one to show       from the fiends leader to the angels prince     there also are some altarpieces though       i really cant say that they much evince     ones inner notions of immortal spirits     but let the connoisseurs explain their merits                          xxx      michael flew forth in glory and in good       a goodly work of him from whom all glory     and good arise the portal pasthe stood       before him the young cherubs and saints hoary     i say young begging to be understood       by looks not years and should be very sorry     to state they were not older than st peter     but merely that they seemed a little sweeter                          xxxi      the cherubs and the saints bowed down before       that archangelic hierarch the first     of essences angelical who wore       the aspect of a god but this neer nursed     pride in his heavenly bosom in whose core       no thought save for his makers service durst     intrude however glorified and high     he knew him but the viceroy of the sky                          xxxii      he and the sombre silent spirit met       they knew each other both for good and ill     such was their power that neither could forget       his former friend and future foe but still     there was a high immortal proud regret       in eithers eye as if twere less their will     than destiny to make the eternal years     their date of war and their champ clos the spheres                          xxxiii      but here they were in neutral space we know       from job that satan hath the power to pay     a heavenly visit thrice ayear or so       and that the sons of god like those of clay     must keep him company and we might show       from the same book in how polite a way     the dialogue is held between the powers     of good and evilbut twould take up hours                          xxxiv      and this is not a theologic tract518       to prove with hebrew and with arabic     if job be allegory or a fact       but a true narrative and thus i pick     from out the whole but such and such an act       as sets aside the slightest thought of trick     tis every tittle true beyond suspicion     and accurate as any other vision                           xxxv      the spirits were in neutral space before       the gate of heaven like eastern thresholds is519     the place where deaths grand cause is argued oer       and souls despatched to that world or to this     and therefore michael and the other wore       a civil aspect though they did not kiss     yet still between his darkness and his brightness     there passed a mutual glance of great politeness                          xxxvi      the archangel bowed not like a modern beau       but with a graceful oriental bend     pressing one radiant arm just where belowgr       the heart in good men is supposed to tend     he turned as to an equal not too low       but kindly satan met his ancient friendgs     with more hauteur as might an old castilian     poor noble meet a mushroom rich civilian                          xxxvii      he merely bent his diabolic brow       an instant and then raising it he stood     in act to assert his right or wrong and show       cause why king george by no means could or should     make out a case to be exempt from woe       eternal more than other kings endued     with better sense and hearts whom history mentions     who long have paved hell with their good intentions520

dust     so shall he be in spirit although dear       to thee and thine because nor wine nor lust     were of his weaknesses yet on the throne     he reigned oer millions to serve me alone

sturdy oath of stout john bull       who damned away his eyes as heretofore     there paddy brogued by jasuswhats your wull       the temperate scot exclaimed the french ghost swore     in certain terms i shant translate in full       as the first coachman will and midst the warhc     the voice of jonathan was heard to express     our president is going to war i guess                          lx      besides there were the spaniard dutch and dane       in short an universal shoal of shades     from otaheites isle to salisbury plain       of all climes and professions years and trades     ready to swear against the good kings reignhd       bitter as clubs in cards are against spades530     all summoned by this grand subpoena to     try if kings maynt be damned like me or you                          lxi      when michael saw this host he first grew pale       as angels can next like italian twilight     he turned all coloursas a peacocks tail       or sunset streaming through a gothic skylight     in some old abbey or a trout not stale       or distant lightning on the horizon by night     or a fresh rainbow or a grand review     of thirty regiments in red green and blue                          lxii      then he addressed himself to satan why       my good old friend for such i deem you though     our different parties make us fight so shy       i neer mistake you for a personal foe     our difference political and i       trust that whatever may occur below     you know my great respect for you and this     makes me regret whateer you do amiss                          lxiii      why my dear lucifer would you abuse       my call for witnesses i did not mean     that you should half of earth and hell produce       tis even superfluous since two honest clean     true testimonies are enough we lose       our time nay our eternity between     the accusation and defence if we     hear both twill stretch our immortality                          lxiv      satan replied to me the matter is       indifferent in a personal point of view     i can have fifty better souls than this       with far less trouble than we have gone through     already and i merely argued his       late majesty of britains case with you     upon a point of form you may dispose     of him ive kings enough below god knows                          lxv      thus spoke the demon late called multifaced531       by multoscribbling southey then well call     one or two persons of the myriads placed       around our congress and dispense with all     the rest quoth michael who may be so graced       as to speak first theres choice enoughwho shall     it be then satan answered there are many     but you may choose jack wilkes as well as any                          lxvi      a merry cockeyed curiouslooking sprite532       upon the instant started from the throng     dressed in a fashion now forgotten quite       for all the fashions of the flesh stick long     by people in the next world where unite       all the costumes since adams right or wrong     from eves figleaf down to the petticoat     almost as scanty of days less remote533                          lxvii      the spirit looked around upon the crowds       assembled and exclaimed my friends of all     the spheres we shall catch cold amongst these clouds       so lets to business why this general call     if those are freeholders i see in shrouds       and tis for an election that they bawl     behold a candidate with unturned coathe     saint peter may i count upon your vote                          lxviii      sir replied michael you mistake these things       are of a former life and what we do     above is more august to judge of kings       is the tribunal met so now you know     then i presume those gentlemen with wingshf       said wilkes are cherubs and that soul below     looks much like george the third but to my mind     a good deal olderbless me is he blind                          lxix      he is what you behold him and his doom       depends upon his deeds the angel said     if you have aught to arraign in him the tomb       gives license to the humblest beggars head     to lift itself against the loftiestsome       said wilkes dont wait to see them laid in lead     for such a libertyand i for one     have told them what i thought beneath the sun                          lxx      above the sun repeat then what thou hast       to urge against him said the archangel why     replied the spirit since old scores are past       must i turn evidence in faith not i     besides i beat him hollow at the last534       with all his lords and commons in the sky     i dont like ripping up old stories since     his conduct was but natural in a prince                          lxxi      foolish no doubt and wicked to oppress       a poor unlucky devil without a shilling     but then i blame the man himself much less       than bute and grafton535 and shall be unwilling     to see him punished here for their excess       since they were both damned long ago and still in     their place below for me i have forgiven     and vote his habeas corpus into heaven                          lxxii      wilkes said the devil i understand all this       you turned to half a courtier536 ere you died     and seem to think it would not be amiss       to grow a whole one on the other side     of charons ferry you forget that his       reign is concluded whatsoeer betide     he wont be sovereign more youve lost your labour     for at the best he will but be your neighbour                          lxxiii      however i knew what to think of it       when i beheld you in your jesting way     flitting and whispering round about the spit       where belial upon duty for the dayhg     with foxs lard was basting william pitt       his pupil i knew what to think i say     that fellow even in hell breeds farther ills     ill have him gaggedtwas one of his own bills537                          lxxiv      call junius from the crowd a shadow stalked538       and at the name there was a general squeeze     so that the very ghosts no longer walked       in comfort at their own aërial ease     but were all rammed and jammed but to be balked       as we shall see and jostled hands and knees     like wind compressed and pent within a bladder     or like a human colic which is sadderhh                          lxxv      the shadow camea tall thin greyhaired figure       that looked as it had been a shade on earthhi     quick in its motions with an air of vigour       but nought to mark its breeding or its birth     now it waxed little then again grew biggerhj       with now an air of gloom or savage mirth     but as you gazed upon its features they     changed every instantto what none could say                          lxxvi      the more intently the ghosts gazed the less       could they distinguish whose the features were     the devil himself seemed puzzled even to guess       they varied like a dreamnow here now there     and several people swore from out the press       they knew him perfectly and one could swear     he was his father upon which another     was sure he was his mothers cousins brother                          lxxvii      another that he was a duke or knight       an orator a lawyer or a priest     a nabob a manmidwife539 but the wighthk       mysterious changed his countenance at least     as oft as they their minds though in full sight       he stood the puzzle only was increased     the man was a phantasmagoria in     himselfhe was so volatile and thin                          lxxviii      the moment that you had pronounced him one       presto his face changed and he was another     and when that change was hardly well put on       it varied till i dont think his own mother     if that he had a mother would her son       have known he shifted so from one to tother     till guessing from a pleasure grew a taskhl     at this epistolary iron mask540                          lxxix      for sometimes he like cerberus would seem       three gentlemen at once541 as sagely says     good mrs malaprop then you might deem       that he was not even one now many rays     were flashing round him and now a thick steam       hid him from sightlike fogs on london days     now burke now tooke he grew to peoples fancies     and certes often like sir philip francis                          lxxx      ive an hypothesistis quite my own       i never let it out till now for fear     of doing people harm about the throne       and injuring some minister or peer     on whom the stigma might perhaps be blown       it ismy gentle public lend thine ear     tis that what junius we are wont to callhm     was reallytrulynobody at all                           lxxxi      i dont see wherefore letters should not be       written without hands since we daily view     them written without heads and books we see       are filled as well without the latter too     and really till we fix on somebody       for certain sure to claim them as his due     their author like the nigers mouth542 will bother     the world to say if there be mouth or author                          lxxxii      and who and what art thou the archangel said       for that you may consult my titlepage543     replied this mighty shadow of a shade       if i have kept my secret half an age     i scarce shall tell it nowcanst thou upbraid       continued michael george rex or allege     aught further junius answered you had better     first ask him for his answer to my letter                          lxxxiii      my charges upon record will outlasthn       the brass of both his epitaph and tomb     repentst thou not said michael of some past       exaggeration something which may doom     thyself if false as him if true thou wast       too bitteris it not soin thy gloom     of passionpassion cried the phantom dim     i loved my country and i hated him                           lxxxiv      what i have written i have written let       the rest be on his head or mine so spoke     old nominis umbra and while speaking yet       away he melted in celestial smoke     then satan said to michael dont forget       to call george washington and john horne tooke     and franklin544but at this time there was heard     a cry for room though not a phantom stirred                          lxxxv      at length with jostling elbowing and the aid       of cherubim appointed to that post     the devil asmodeus545 to the circle made       his way and looked as if his journey cost     some trouble when his burden down he laid       whats this cried michael why tis not a ghost     i know it quoth the incubus but he     shall be one if you leave the affair to me                          lxxxvi      confound the renegado546 i have sprained       my left wing hes so heavy547 one would think     some of his works about his neck were chained       but to the point while hovering oer the brink     of skiddaw where as usual it still rained       i saw a taper far below me wink     and stooping caught this fellow at a libelho     no less on historythan the holy bible                          lxxxvii      the former is the devils scripture and       the latter yours good michael so the affair     belongs to all of us you understand       i snatched him up just as you see him there     and brought him off for sentence out of hand       ive scarcely been ten minutes in the air     at least a quarter it can hardly be     i dare say that his wife is still at tea548                          lxxxviii      here satan said i know this man of old       and have expected him for some time here     a sillier fellow you will scarce behold       or more conceited in his petty sphere     but surely it was not worth while to fold       such trash below your wing asmodeus dear     we had the poor wretch safe without being bored     with carriage coming of his own accord                          lxxxix      but since hes here lets see what he has done       done cried asmodeus he anticipates     the very business you are now upon       and scribbles as if head clerk to the fateshp     who knows to what his ribaldry may run       when such an ass549 as this like balaams prates     lets hear quoth michael what he has to say     you know were bound to that in every way                          xc      now the bard glad to get an audience which       by no means often was his case below     began to cough and hawk and hem and pitch       his voice into that awful note of woe     to all unhappy hearers within reach       of poets when the tide of rhymes in flow550     but stuck fast with his first hexameter     not one of all whose gouty feet would stir                          xci      but ere the spavined dactyls could be spurred       into recitative in great dismay     both cherubim and seraphim were heard       to murmur loudly through their long array     and michael rose ere he could get a word       of all his foundered verses under way     and cried for gods sake stop my friend twere best551     non di non hominesyou know the rest552                          xcii      a general bustle spread throughout the throng       which seemed to hold all verse in detestation     the angels had of course enough of song       when upon service and the generation     of ghosts had heard too much in life not long       before to profit by a new occasion     the monarch mute till then exclaimed what what553     pye554 come again no moreno more of that                          xciii      the tumult grew an universal cough       convulsed the skies as during a debate     when castlereagh has been up long enough       before he was first minister of state     i meanthe slaves hear now some cried off off       as at a farce till grown quite desperate     the bard saint peter prayed to interpose     himself an author only for his prose                          xciv      the varlet was not an illfavoured knavehq555       a good deal like a vulture in the face     with a hook nose and a hawks eye which gave       a smart and sharperlooking sort of grace     to his whole aspect which though rather grave       was by no means so ugly as his case     but that indeed was hopeless as can be     quite a poetic felony de se                          xcv      then michael blew his trump and stilled the noise       with one still greater as is yet the mode     on earth besides except some grumbling voice       which now and then will make a slight inroad     upon decorous silence few will twice       lift up their lungs when fairly overcrowed     and now the bard could plead his own bad cause     with all the attitudes of selfapplause                          xcvi      he saidi only give the headshe said       he meant no harm in scribbling twas his way     upon all topics twas besides his bread       of which he buttered both sides twould delay     too long the assembly he was pleased to dread       and take up rather more time than a day     to name his workshe would but cite a fewhr     wat tylerrhymes on blenheimwaterloo556                          xcvii      he had written praises of a regicide557       he had written praises of all kings whatever     he had written for republics far and wide       and then against them bitterer than ever     for pantisocracy he once had cried558       aloud a scheme less moral than twas clever     then grew a hearty antijacobin     had turned his coatand would have turned his skin                          xcviii      he had sung against all battles and again       in their high praise and glory he had called     reviewing the ungentle craft and then559       became as base a critic as eer crawled     fed paid and pampered by the very men       by whom his muse and morals had been mauled     he had written much blank verse and blanker prose     and more of both than any body knows                          xcix      he had written wesleys560 lifehere turning round       to satan sir im ready to write yours     in two octavo volumes nicely bound       with notes and preface all that most allures     the pious purchaser and theres no ground       for fear for i can choose my own reviewers     so let me have the proper documents     that i may add you to my other saints                          c      satan bowed and was silent well if you       with amiable modesty decline     my offer what says michael there are few       whose memoirs could be rendered more divine     mine is a pen of all work561 not so new       as it was once but i would make you shine     like your own trumpet by the way my own     has more of brass in it and is as well blownhs                          ci      but talking about trumpets heres my vision       now you shall judge all peopleyesyou shall     judge with my

thus see double     i save the deity some worlds of trouble                          cii      he ceased and drew forth an ms and no       persuasion on the part of devils saints     or angels now could stop the torrent so       he read the first three lines of the contents     but at the fourth the whole spiritual show     had vanished with variety of scents     ambrosial and sulphureous as they sprang     like lightning off from his melodious twang563                          ciii      those grand heroics acted as a spell       the angels stopped their ears and plied their pinions     the devils ran howling deafened down to hell       the ghosts fled gibbering for their own dominions     for tis not yet decided where they dwell       and i leave every man to his opinions     michael took refuge in his trumpbut lo     his teeth were set on edge he could not blow                          civ      saint peter who has hitherto been known       for an impetuous saint upraised his keys     and at the fifth line knocked the poet down564       who fell like phaeton but more at ease     into his lake for there he did not drown       a different web being by the destinies     woven for the laureates final wreath wheneer     reform shall happen either here or there                          cv      he first sank to the bottomlike his works       but soon rose to the

man will be remembered among the honours of my life now apart from the essay and its evident application byron had probably observed that among the phaleucia or hendecasyllables were included some exquisite lines ad sutheium on the death of herbert southey followed by some extremely unpleasant ones on taunto and his tongue and would naturally conclude that savagius was ready to do battle for

publication of the question and answer would kill rogers the ms is dated 1818 and it is probable that the lines were written in the early spring of that year moore or murray had told byron that rogers was in doubt whether to praise or blame him in his poem on human life now approaching completion and he had heard from other sources that it was rogers who was the author or retailer of certain scandalous stories which were current in the whisperinggallery of the world he had reason to believe that everybody was talking about him and it was a relief to be able to catch and punish so eminent a scandalmonger it was in this spirit that he wrote to murray february 20 1818 what you tell me of rogers  is like him he cannot say that i have not been a sincere and warm friend to him till the black drop of his liver oozed through too palpably to be overlooked now if i once catch him at any of his jugglery with me or mine let him look to it etc etc and in all probability the poem on rogers was then in existence or was working in his brain the lines once written byron swallowed his venom and when rogers visited italy in the autumn of 1821 he met him at bologna travelled with him across the apennines to florence and invited him to stay as long as he liked at pisa thither rogers came presumably in november 1821 and if we may trust the table talk 1856 p 238 remained at the palazzo lanfranchi for several days  byron seems to have been more than usually provocative and crossgrained and on one occasion see medwin angler in wales 1834 i 26 sq and records of shelley etc by e t trelawney 1878 i 53 when he was playing billiards and rogers was in the lobby outside secretly incited his bulldog faithful moretto to bark and show his teeth and when medwin had convoyed the terrorstricken bard into his presence greeted him with effusion but contrived that he should sit down on the very sofa which hid from view the ms of question and answer longa est injuria longæ ambages but the story rests on the evidence of independent witnesses  by far the best comment on satire and satirist is to be found in the noble lines in italy in which rogers commemorates his last meeting

been written in june not april 1819 possibly at ferrara and the river must be the po di primaro even so the first line of the first stanza and the third and fourth lines of the ninth stanza require explanation the po does not roll by the ancient walls of ravenna and how could byron be at one and the same time by the source stanza 9 line 4 and sailing on the river or on some canalized tributary

ravenna or perhaps the dialogues in peacocks novels melincourt and nightmare abbey brought to his recollection the halfmodish halfliterary coteries of the earlier years of the regency and that he sketches the scenes and persons of his eclogue not from life but from memory  in the diary of 1813 1814 there is more than one mention of the blues for instance november 27 1813 he writes sotheby is a

was as blue as ether the countess guiccioli could not only read and inwardly digest corinna see letter to moore january 2 1820 but knew the divina commedia by heart and was a critic as well as an

contempt than it deserved in the noctes ambrosiance blackwoods edinburgh magazine may 1823 vol xiii p 607 the third number of the liberal is dismissed with the remark the last number contains not one line of byrons thank god he has seen his error and kicked them out brief but contemptuous notices appeared in the literary chronicle april 26 and the literary gazette may 3 1823 while a shortlived periodical named the literary register may 3 quoted at length in john bull may 4 1823 implies that the author ie leigh hunt would be better qualified to catch the manners of lisson grove than of may
