prose     the rise of historical criticism     chapter i    historical criticism nowhere occurs as an isolated fact in the civilisation or literature of any people  it is part of that complex working towards freedom which may be described as the revolt against authority  it is merely one facet of that speculative spirit of an innovation which in the sphere of action produces democracy and revolution and in that of thought is the parent of philosophy and physical science and its importance as a factor of progress is based not so much on the results it attains as on the tone of thought which it represents and the method by which it works  being thus the resultant of forces essentially revolutionary it is not to be found in the ancient world among the material despotisms of asia or the stationary civilisation of egypt  the clay cylinders of assyria and babylon the hieroglyphics of the pyramids form not history but the material for history  the chinese annals ascending as they do to the barbarous forest life of the nation are marked with a soberness of judgment a freedom from invention which is almost unparalleled in the writings of any people but the protective spirit which is the characteristic of that people proved as fatal to their literature as to their commerce  free criticism is as unknown as free trade while as regards the hindus their acute analytical and logical mind is directed rather to grammar criticism and philosophy than to history or chronology  indeed in history their imagination seems to have run wild legend and fact are so indissolubly mingled together that any attempt to separate them seems vain  if we except the identification of the greek sandracottus with the indian chandragupta we have really no clue by which we can test the truth of their writings or examine their method of investigation  it is among the hellenic branch of the indogermanic race that history proper is to be found as well as the spirit of historical criticism among that wonderful offshoot of the primitive aryans whom we call by the name of greeks and to whom as has been well said we owe all that moves in the world except the blind forces of nature  for from the day when they left the chill tablelands of tibet and journeyed a nomad people to aegean shores the characteristic of their nature has been the search for light and the spirit of historical criticism is part of that wonderful aufklarung or illumination of the intellect which seems to have burst on the greek race like a great flood of light about the sixth century bc  lesprit dun siecle ne nait pas et ne meurt pas e jour fixe and the first critic is perhaps as difficult to discover as the first man  it is from democracy that the spirit of criticism borrows its intolerance of dogmatic authority from physical science the alluring analogies of law and order from philosophy the conception of an essential unity underlying the complex manifestations of phenomena  it appears first rather as a changed attitude of mind than as a principle of research and its earliest influences are to be found in the sacred writings  for men begin to doubt in questions of religion first and then in matters of more secular interest and as regards the nature of the spirit of historical criticism itself in its ultimate development it is not confined merely to the empirical method of ascertaining whether an event happened or not but is concerned also with the investigation into the causes of events the general relations which phenomena of life hold to one another and in its ultimate development passes into the wider question of the philosophy of history  now while the workings of historical criticism in these two spheres of sacred and uninspired history are essentially manifestations of the same spirit yet their methods are so different the canons of evidence so entirely separate and the motives in each case so unconnected that it will be necessary for a clear estimation of the progress of greek thought that we should consider these two questions entirely apart from one another  i shall then in both cases take the succession of writers in their chronological order as representing the rational order  not that the succession of time is always the succession of ideas or that dialectics moves ever in the straight line in which hegel conceives its advance  in greek thought as elsewhere there are periods of stagnation and apparent retrogression yet their intellectual development not merely in the question of historical criticism but in their art their poetry and their philosophy seems so essentially normal so free from all disturbing external influences so peculiarly rational that in following in the footsteps of time we shall really be progressing in the order sanctioned by reason    chapter ii    at an early period in their intellectual development the greeks reached that critical point in the history of every civilised nation when speculative invades the domain of revealed truth when the spiritual ideas of the people can no longer be satisfied by the lower material conceptions of their inspired writers and when men find it impossible to pour the new wine of free thought into the old bottles of a narrow and a trammelling creed  from their aryan ancestors they had received the fatal legacy of a mythology stained with immoral and monstrous stories which strove to hide the rational order of nature in a chaos of miracles and to mar by imputed wickedness the perfection of gods nature  a very shirt of nessos in which the heracles of rationalism barely escaped annihilation  now while undoubtedly the speculations of thales and the alluring analogies of law and order afforded by physical science were most important forces in encouraging the rise of the spirit of scepticism yet it was on its ethical side that the greek mythology was chiefly open to attack  it is difficult to shake the popular belief in miracles but no man will admit sin and immorality as attributes of the ideal he worships so the first symptoms of a new order of thought are shown in the passionate outcries of xenophanes and heraclitos against the evil things said by homer of the sons of god and in the story told of pythagoras how that he saw tortured in hell the two founders of greek theology we can recognise the rise of the aufklarung as clearly as we see the reformation foreshadowed in the inferno of dante  any honest belief then in the plain truth of these stories soon succumbed before the destructive effects of the a priori ethical criticism of this school but the orthodox party as is its custom found immediately a convenient shelter under the aegis of the doctrine of metaphors and concealed meanings  to this allegorical school the tale of the fight around the walls of troy was a mystery behind which as behind a veil were hidden certain moral and physical truths  the contest between athena and ares was that eternal contest between rational thought and the brute force of ignorance the arrows which rattled in the quiver of the far darter were no longer the instruments of vengeance shot from the golden bow of the child of god but the common rays of the sun which was itself nothing but a mere inert mass of burning metal  modern investigation with the ruthlessness of philistine analysis has ultimately brought helen of troy down to a symbol of the dawn there were philistines among the greeks also who saw in the greek text which cannot be reproduced a mere metaphor for atmospheric power  now while this tendency to look for metaphors and hidden meanings must be ranked as one of the germs of historical criticism yet it was essentially unscientific  its inherent weakness is clearly pointed out by plato who showed that while this theory will no doubt explain many of the current legends yet if it is to be appealed to at all it must be as a universal principle a position he is by no means prepared to admit  like many other great principles it suffered from its disciples and furnished its own refutation when the web of penelope was analysed into a metaphor of the rules of formal logic the warp representing the premises and the woof the conclusion  rejecting then the allegorical interpretation of the sacred writings as an essentially dangerous method proving either too much or too little plato himself returns to the earlier mode of attack and rewrites history with a didactic purpose laying down certain ethical canons of historical criticism  god is good god is just god is true god is without the common passions of men these are the tests to which we are to bring the stories of the greek religion  god predestines no men to ruin nor sends destruction on innocent cities he never walks the earth in strange disguise nor has to mourn for the death of any wellbeloved son  away with the tears for sarpedon the lying dream sent to agamemnon and the story of the broken covenant  plato republic book ii 380 iii 388 391  similar ethical canons are applied to the accounts of the heroes of the days of old and by the same a priori principles achilles is rescued from the charges of avarice and insolence in a passage which may be recited as the earliest instance of that whitewashing of great men as it has been called which is so popular in our own day when catiline and clodius are represented as honest and farseeing politicians when eine edle und gute natur is claimed for tiberius and nero is rescued from his heritage of infamy as an accomplished dilettante whose moral aberrations are more than excused by his exquisite artistic sense and charming tenor voice  but besides the allegorising principle of interpretation and the ethical reconstruction of history there was a third theory which may be called the semihistorical and which goes by the name of euhemeros though he was by no means the first to propound it  appealing to a fictitious monument which he declared that he had discovered in the island of panchaia and which purported to be a column erected by zeus and detailing the incidents of his reign on earth this shallow thinker attempted to show that the gods and heroes of ancient greece were mere ordinary mortals whose achievements had been a good deal exaggerated and misrepresented and that the proper canon of historical criticism as regards the treatment of myths was to rationalise the incredible and to present the plausible residuum as actual truth  to him and his school the centaurs for instance those mythical sons of the storm strange links between the lives of men and animals were merely some youths from the village of nephele in thessaly distinguished for their sporting tastes the living harvest of panoplied knights which sprang so mystically from the dragons teeth a body of mercenary troops supported by the profits on a successful speculation in ivory and actaeon an ordinary master of hounds who living before the days of subscription was eaten out of house and home by the expenses of his kennel  now that under the glamour of myth and legend some substratum of historical fact may lie is a proposition rendered extremely probable by the modern investigations into the workings of the mythopoeic spirit in postchristian times  charlemagne and roland st francis and william tell are none the less real personages because their histories are filled with much that is fictitious and incredible but in all cases what is essentially necessary is some external corroboration such as is afforded by the mention of roland and roncesvalles in the chronicles of england or in the sphere of greek legend by the excavations of hissarlik  but to rob a mythical narrative of its kernel of supernatural elements and to present the dry husk thus obtained as historical fact is as has been well said to mistake entirely the true method of investigation and to identify plausibility with truth  and as regards the critical point urged by palaiphatos strabo and polybius that pure invention on homers part is inconceivable we may without scruple allow it for myths like constitutions grow gradually and are not formed in a day  but between a poets deliberate creation and historical accuracy there is a wide field of the mythopoeic faculty  this euhemeristic theory was welcomed as an essentially philosophical and critical method by the unscientific romans to whom it was introduced by the poet ennius that pioneer of cosmopolitan hellenicism and it continued to characterise the tone of ancient thought on the question of the treatment of mythology till the rise of christianity when it was turned by such writers as augustine and minucius felix into a formidable weapon of attack on paganism  it was then abandoned by all those who still bent the knee to athena or to zeus and a general return aided by the philosophic mystics of alexandria to the allegorising principle of interpretation took place as the only means of saving the deities of olympus from the titan assaults of the new galilean god  in what vain defence the statue of mary set in the heart of the pantheon can best tell us  religions however may be absorbed but they never are disproved and the stories of the greek mythology spiritualised by the purifying influence of christianity reappear in many of the southern parts of europe in our own day  the old fable that the greek gods took service with the new religion under assumed names has more truth in it than the many care to discover  having now traced the progress of historical criticism in the special treatment of myth and legend i shall proceed to investigate the form in which the same spirit manifested itself as regards what one may term secular history and secular historians the field traversed will be found to be in some respects the same but the mental attitude the spirit the motive of investigation are all changed  there were heroes before the son of atreus and historians before herodotus yet the latter is rightly hailed as the father of history for in him we discover not merely the empirical connection of cause and effect but that constant reference to laws which is the characteristic of the historian proper  for all history must be essentially universal not in the sense of comprising all the synchronous events of the past time but through the universality of the principles employed  and the great conceptions which unify the work of herodotus are such as even modern thought has not yet rejected  the immediate government of the world by god the nemesis and punishment which sin and pride invariably bring with them the revealing of gods purpose to his people by signs and omens by miracles and by prophecy these are to herodotus the laws which govern the phenomena of history  he is essentially the type of supernatural historian his eyes are ever strained to discern the spirit of god moving over the face of the waters of life he is more concerned with final than with efficient causes  yet we can discern in him the rise of that historic sense which is the rational antecedent of the science of historical criticism the greek text which cannot be reproduced to use the words of a greek writer as opposed to that which comes either greek text which cannot be reproduced  he has passed through the valley of faith and has caught a glimpse of the sunlit heights of reason but like all those who while accepting the supernatural yet attempt to apply the canons of rationalism he is essentially inconsistent  for the better apprehension of the character of this historic sense in herodotus it will be necessary to examine at some length the various forms of criticism in which it manifests itself  such fabulous stories as that of the phoenix of the goatfooted men of the headless beings with eyes in their breasts of the men who slept six months in the year greek text which cannot be reproduced of the werwolf of the neuri and the like are entirely rejected by him as being opposed to the ordinary experience of life and to those natural laws whose universal influence the early greek physical philosophers had already made known to the world of thought  other legends such as the suckling of cyrus by a bitch or the featherrain of northern europe are rationalised and explained into a womans name and a fall of snow the supernatural origin of the scythian nation from the union of hercules and the monstrous echidna is set aside by him for the more probable account that they were a nomad tribe driven by the massagetae from asia and he appeals to the local names of their country as proof of the fact that the kimmerians were the original possessors  but in the case of herodotus it will be more instructive to pass on from points like these to those questions of general probability the true apprehension of which depends rather on a certain quality of mind than on any possibility of formulated rules questions which form no unimportant part of scientific history for it must be remembered always that the canons of historical criticism are essentially different from those of judicial evidence for they cannot like the latter be made plain to every ordinary mind but appeal to a certain historical faculty founded on the experience of life  besides the rules for the reception of evidence in courts of law are purely stationary while the science of historical probability is essentially progressive and changes with the advancing spirit of each age  now of all the speculative canons of historical criticism none is more important than that which rests on psychological probability  arguing from his knowledge of human nature herodotus rejects the presence of helen within the walls of troy  had she been there he says priam and his kinsmen would never have been so mad greek text which cannot be reproduced as not to give her up when they and their children and their city were in such peril ii 118 and as regards the authority of homer some incidental passages in his poem show that he knew of helens sojourn in egypt during the siege but selected the other story as being a more suitable motive for an epic  similarly he does not believe that the alcmaeonidae family a family who had always been the haters of tyranny greek text which cannot be reproduced and to whom even more than to harmodios and aristogeiton athens owed its liberty would ever have been so treacherous as to hold up a shield after the battle of marathon as a signal for the persian host to fall on the city  a shield he acknowledges was held up but it could not possibly have been done by such friends of liberty as the house of alcmaeon nor will he believe that a great king like rhampsinitus would have sent his daughter greek text which cannot be reproduced  elsewhere he argues from more general considerations of probability a greek courtesan like rhodopis would hardly have been rich enough to build a pyramid and besides on chronological grounds the story is impossible ii 134  in another passage ii 63 after giving an account of the forcible entry of the priests of ares into the chapel of the gods mother which seems to have been a sort of religious faction fight where sticks were freely used greek text which cannot be reproduced i feel sure he says that many of them died from getting their heads broken notwithstanding the assertions of the egyptian priests to the contrary  there is also something charmingly naive in the account he gives of the celebrated greek swimmer who dived a distance of eighty stadia to give his countrymen warning of the persian advance  if however he says i may offer an opinion on the subject i would say that he came in a boat  there is of course something a little trivial in some of the instances i have quoted but in a writer like herodotus who stands on the borderland between faith and rationalism one likes to note even the most minute instances of the rise of the critical and sceptical spirit of inquiry  how really strange at base it was with him may i think be shown by a reference to those passages where he applies rationalistic tests to matters connected with religion  he nowhere indeed grapples with the moral and scientific difficulties of the greek bible and where he rejects as incredible the marvellous achievements of hercules in egypt he does so on the express grounds that he had not yet been received among the gods and so was still subject to the ordinary conditions of mortal life greek text which cannot be reproduced  even within these limits however his religious conscience seems to have been troubled at such daring rationalism and the passage ii 45 concludes with a pious hope that god will pardon him for having gone so far the great rationalistic passage being of course that in which he rejects the mythical account of the foundation of dodona  how can a dove speak with a human voice he asks and rationalises the bird into a foreign princess  similarly he seems more inclined to believe that the great storm at the beginning of the persian war ceased from ordinary atmospheric causes and not in consequence of the incantations of the magians he calls melampos whom the majority of the greeks looked on as an inspired prophet a clever man who had acquired for himself the art of prophecy and as regards the miracle told of the aeginetan statues of the primeval deities of damia and auxesia that they fell on their knees when the sacrilegious athenians strove to carry them off any one may believe it he says who likes but as for myself i place no credence in the tale  so much then for the rationalistic spirit of historical criticism as far as it appears explicitly in the works of this great and philosophic writer but for an adequate appreciation of his position we must also note how conscious he was of the value of documentary evidence of the use of inscriptions of the importance of the poets as throwing light on manners and customs as well as on historical incidents  no writer of any age has more vividly recognised the fact that history is a matter of evidence and that it is as necessary for the historian to state his authority as it is to produce ones witnesses in a court of law  while however we can discern in herodotus the rise of an historic sense we must not blind ourselves to the large amount of instances where he receives supernatural influences as part of the ordinary forces of life  compared to thucydides who succeeded him in the development of history he appears almost like a mediaeval writer matched with a modern rationalist  for contemporary though they were between these two authors there is an infinite chasm of thought  the essential difference of their methods may be best illustrated from those passages where they treat of the same subject  the execution of the spartan heralds nicolaos and aneristos during the peloponnesian war is regarded by herodotus as one of the most supernatural instances of the workings of nemesis and the wrath of an outraged hero while the lengthened siege and ultimate fall of troy was brought about by the avenging hand of god desiring to manifest unto men the mighty penalties which always follow upon mighty sins  but thucydides either sees not or desires not to see in either of these events the finger of providence or the punishment of wicked doers  the death of the heralds is merely an athenian retaliation for similar outrages committed by the opposite side the long agony of the ten years siege is due merely to the want of a good commissariat in the greek army while the fall of the city is the result of a united military attack consequent on a good supply of provisions  now it is to be observed that in this latter passage as well as elsewhere thucydides is in no sense of the word a sceptic as regards his attitude towards the truth of these ancient legends  agamemnon and atreus theseus and eurystheus even minos about whom herodotus has some doubts are to him as real personages as alcibiades or gylippus  the points in his historical criticism of the past are first his rejection of all extranatural interference and secondly the attributing to these ancient heroes the motives and modes of thought of his own day  the present was to him the key to the explanation of the past as it was to the prediction of the future  now as regards his attitude towards the supernatural he is at one with modern science  we too know that just as the primeval coal beds reveal to us the traces of raindrops and other atmospheric phenomena similar to those of our own day so in estimating the history of the past the introduction of no force must be allowed whose workings we cannot observe among the phenomena around us  to lay down canons of ultrahistorical credibility for the explanation of events which happen to have preceded us by a few thousand years is as thoroughly unscientific as it is to intermingle preternatural in geological theories  whatever the canons of art may be no difficulty in history is so great as to warrant the introduction of a spirit of spirit greek text which cannot be reproduced in the sense of a violation of the laws of nature  upon the other point however thucydides falls into an anachronism  to refuse to allow the workings of chivalrous and selfdenying motives among the knights of the trojan crusade because he saw none in the factionloving athenian of his own day is to show an entire ignorance of the various characteristics of human nature developing under different circumstances and to deny to a primitive chieftain like agamemnon that authority founded on opinion to which we give the name of divine right is to fall into an historical error quite as gross as attributing to atreus the courting of the populace greek text which cannot be reproduced with a view to the mycenean throne  the general method of historical criticism pursued by thucydides having been thus indicated it remains to proceed more into detail as regards those particular points where he claims for himself a more rational method of estimating evidence than either the public or his predecessors possessed  so little pains he remarks do the vulgar take in the investigation of truth satisfied with their preconceived opinions that the majority of the greeks believe in a pitanate cohort of the spartan army and in a double vote being the prerogative of the spartan kings neither of which opinions has any foundation in fact  but the chief point on which he lays stress as evincing the uncritical way with which men receive legends even the legends of their own country is the entire baselessness of the common athenian tradition in which harmodios and aristogeiton were represented as the patriotic liberators of athens from the peisistratid tyranny  so far he points out from the love of freedom being their motive both of them were influenced by merely personal considerations aristogeiton being jealous of hipparchos attention to harmodios then a beautiful boy in the flower of greek loveliness while the latters indignation was aroused by an insult offered to his sister by the prince  their motives then were personal revenge while the result of their conspiracy served only to rivet more tightly the chains of servitude which bound athens to the peisistratid house for hipparchos whom they killed was only the tyrants younger brother and not the tyrant himself  to prove his theory that hippias was the elder he appeals to the evidence afforded by a public inscription in which his name occurs immediately after that of his father a point which he thinks shows that he was the eldest and so the heir  this view he further corroborates by another inscription on the altar of apollo which mentions the children of hippias and not those of his brothers for it was natural for the eldest to be married first and besides this on the score of general probability he points out that had hippias been the younger he would not have so easily obtained the tyranny on the death of hipparchos  now what is important in thucydides as evinced in the treatment of legend generally is not the results he arrived at but the method by which he works  the first great rationalistic historian he may be said to have paved the way for all those who followed after him though it must always be remembered that while the total absence in his pages of all the mystical paraphernalia of the supernatural theory of life is an advance in the progress of rationalism and an era in scientific history whose importance could never be overestimated yet we find along with it a total absence of any mention of those various social and economical forces which form such important factors in the evolution of the world and to which herodotus rightly gave great prominence in his immortal work  the history of thucydides is essentially onesided and incomplete  the intricate details of sieges and battles subjects with which the historian proper has really nothing to do except so far as they may throw light on the spirit of the age we would readily exchange for some notice of the condition of private society in athens or the influence and position of women  there is an advance in the method of historical criticism there is an advance in the conception and motive of history itself for in thucydides we may discern that natural reaction against the intrusion of didactic and theological considerations into the sphere of the pure intellect the spirit of which may be found in the euripidean treatment of tragedy and the later schools of art as well as in the platonic conception of science  history no doubt has splendid lessons for our instruction just as all good art comes to us as the herald of the noblest truth but to set before either the painter or the historian the inculcation of moral lessons as an aim to be consciously pursued is to miss entirely the true motive and characteristic both of art and history which is in the one case the creation of beauty in the other the discovery of the laws of the evolution of progress il ne faut demander de lart que lart du passe que le passe  herodotus wrote to illustrate the wonderful ways of providence and the nemesis that falls on sin and his work is a good example of the truth that nothing can dispense with criticism so much as a moral aim  thucydides has no creed to preach no doctrine to prove  he analyses the results which follow inevitably from certain antecedents in order that on a recurrence of the same crisis men may know how to act  his object was to discover the laws of the past so as to serve as a light to illumine the future  we must not confuse the recognition of the utility of history with any ideas of a didactic aim  two points more in thucydides remain for our consideration  his treatment of the rise of greek civilisation and of the primitive condition of hellas as well as the question how far can he be said really to have recognised the existence of laws regulating the complex phenomena of life    chapter iii    the investigation into the two great problems of the origin of society and the philosophy of history occupies such an important position in the evolution of greek thought that to obtain any clear view of the workings of the critical spirit it will be necessary to trace at some length their rise and scientific development as evinced not merely in the works of historians proper but also in the philosophical treatises of plato and aristotle  the important position which these two great thinkers occupy in the progress of historical criticism can hardly be over estimated  i do not mean merely as regards their treatment of the greek bible and platos endeavours to purge sacred history of its immorality by the application of ethical canons at the time when aristotle was beginning to undermine the basis of miracles by his scientific conception of law but with reference to these two wider questions of the rise of civil institutions and the philosophy of history  and first as regards the current theories of the primitive condition of society there was a wide divergence of opinion in hellenic society just as there is now  for while the majority of the orthodox public of whom hesiod may be taken as the representative looked back as a great many of our own day still do to a fabulous age of innocent happiness a bell ete dell auro where sin and death were unknown and men and women were like gods the foremost men of intellect such as aristotle and plato aeschylus and many of the other poets 1 saw in primitive man a few small sparks of humanity preserved on the tops of mountains after some deluge without an idea of cities governments or legislation living the lives of wild beasts in sunless caves their only law being the survival of the fittest  and this too was the opinion of thucydides whose archaeologia as it is contains a most valuable disquisition on the early condition of hellas which it will be necessary to examine at some length  now as regards the means employed generally by thucydides for the elucidation of ancient history i have already pointed out how that while acknowledging that it is the tendency of every poet to exaggerate as it is of every chronicler to seek to be attractive at the expense of truth he yet assumes in the thoroughly euhemeristic way that under the veil of myth and legend there does yet exist a rational basis of fact discoverable by the method of rejecting all supernatural interference as well as any extraordinary motives influencing the actors  it is in complete accordance with this spirit that he appeals for instance to the homeric epithet of greek text which cannot be reproduced as applied to corinth as a proof of the early commercial prosperity of that city to the fact of the generic name hellenes not occurring in the iliad as a corroboration of his theory of the essentially disunited character of the primitive greek tribes and he argues from the line oer many islands and all argos ruled as applied to agamemnon that his forces must have been partially naval for agamemnons was a continental power and he could not have been master of any but the adjacent islands and these would not be many but through the possession of a fleet  anticipating in some measure the comparative method of research he argues from the fact of the more barbarous greek tribes such as the aetolians and acarnanians still carrying arms in his own day that this custom was the case originally over the whole country the fact he says that the people in these parts of hellas are still living in the old way points to a time when the same mode of life was equally common to all  similarly in another passage he shows how a corroboration of his theory of the respectable character of piracy in ancient days is afforded by the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful marauder as well as by the fact that the question are you a pirate is a common feature of primitive society as shown in the poets and finally after observing how the old greek custom of wearing belts in gymnastic contests still survived among the more uncivilised asiatic tribes he observes that there are many other points in which a likeness may be shown between the life of the primitive hellenes and that of the barbarians today  as regards the evidence afforded by ancient remains while adducing as a proof of the insecure character of early greek society the fact of their cities 2 being always built at some distance from the sea yet he is careful to warn us and the caution ought to be borne in mind by all archaeologists that we have no right to conclude from the scanty remains of any city that its legendary greatness in primitive times was a mere exaggeration  we are not justified he says in rejecting the tradition of the magnitude of the trojan armament because mycenae and the other towns of that age seem to us small and insignificant  for if lacedaemon was to become desolate any antiquarian judging merely from its ruins would be inclined to regard the tale of the spartan hegemony as an idle myth for the city is a mere collection of villages after the old fashion of hellas and has none of those splendid public buildings and temples which characterise athens and whose remains in the case of the latter city would be so marvellous as to lead the superficial observer into an exaggerated estimate of the athenian power  nothing can be more scientific than the archaeological canons laid down whose truth is strikingly illustrated to any one who has compared the waste fields of the eurotas plain with the lordly monuments of the athenian acropolis 3  on the other hand thucydides is quite conscious of the value of the positive evidence afforded by archaeological remains  he appeals for instance to the character of the armour found in the delian tombs and the peculiar mode of sepulture as corroboration of his theory of the predominance of the carian element among the primitive islanders and to the concentration of all the temples either in the acropolis or in its immediate vicinity to the name of greek text which cannot be reproduced by which it was still known and to the extraordinary sanctity of the spring of water there as proof that the primitive city was originally confined to the citadel and the district immediately beneath it ii 16  and lastly in the very opening of his history anticipating one of the most scientific of modern methods he points out how in early states of civilisation immense fertility of the soil tends to favour the personal aggrandisement of individuals and so to stop the normal progress of the country through the rise of factions that endless source of ruin and also by the allurements it offers to a foreign invader to necessitate a continual change of population one immigration following on another  he exemplifies his theory by pointing to the endless political revolutions that characterised arcadia thessaly and boeotia the three richest spots in greece as well as by the negative instance of the undisturbed state in primitive time of attica which was always remarkable for the dryness and poverty of its soil  now while undoubtedly in these passages we may recognise the first anticipation of many of the most modern principles of research we must remember how essentially limited is the range of the archaeologia and how no theory at all is offered on the wider questions of the general conditions of the rise and progress of humanity a problem which is first scientifically discussed in the republic of plato  and at the outset it must be premised that while the study of primitive man is an essentially inductive science resting rather on the accumulation of evidence than on speculation among the greeks it was prosecuted rather on deductive principles thucydides did indeed avail himself of the opportunities afforded by the unequal development of civilisation in his own day in greece and in the places i have pointed out seems to have anticipated the comparative method  but we do not find later writers availing themselves of the wonderfully accurate and picturesque accounts given by herodotus of the customs of savage tribes  to take one instance which bears a good deal on modern questions we find in the works of this great traveller the gradual and progressive steps in the development of the family life clearly manifested in the mere gregarious herding together of the agathyrsi their primitive kinsmanship through women in common and the rise of a feeling of paternity from a state of polyandry  this tribe stood at that time on that borderland between umbilical relationship and the family which has been such a difficult point for modern anthropologists to find  the ancient authors however are unanimous in insisting that the family is the ultimate unit of society though as i have said an inductive study of primitive races or even the accounts given of them by herodotus would have shown them that the greek text which cannot be reproduced of a personal household to use platos expression is really a most complex notion appearing always in a late stage of civilisation along with recognition of private property and the rights of individualism  philology also which in the hands of modern investigators has proved such a splendid instrument of research was in ancient days studied on principles too unscientific to be of much use herodotus points out that the word eridanos is essentially greek in character that consequently the river supposed to run round the world is probably a mere greek invention  his remarks however on language generally as in the case of piromis and the ending of the persian names show on what unsound basis his knowledge of language rested  in the bacchae of euripides there is an extremely interesting passage in which the immoral stories of the greek mythology are accounted for on the principle of that misunderstanding of words and metaphors to which modern science has given the name of a disease of language  in answer to the impious rationalism of pentheus  a sort of modern philistine  teiresias who may be termed the max muller of the theban cycle points out that the story of dionysus being inclosed in zeus thigh really arose from the linguistic confusion between greek text which cannot be reproduced and greek text which cannot be reproduced  on the whole however  for i have quoted these two instances only to show the unscientific character of early philology  we may say that this important instrument in recreating the history of the past was not really used by the ancients as a means of historical criticism  nor did the ancients employ that other method used to such advantage in our own day by which in the symbolism and formulas of an advanced civilisation we can detect the unconscious survival of ancient customs  for whereas in the sham capture of the bride at a marriage feast which was common in wales till a recent time we can discern the lingering reminiscence of the barbarous habit of exogamy the ancient writers saw only the deliberate commemoration of an historical event  aristotle does not tell us by what method he discovered that the greeks used to buy their wives in primitive times but judging by his general principles it was probably through some legend or myth on the subject which lasted to his own day and not as we would do by arguing back from the marriage presents given to the bride and her relatives 4  the origin of the common proverb worth so many beeves in which we discern the unconscious survival of a purely pastoral state of society before the use of metals was known is ascribed by plutarch to the fact of theseus having coined money bearing a bulls head similarly the amathusian festival in which a young man imitated the labours of a woman in travail is regarded by him as a rite instituted in ariadnes honour and the carian adoration of asparagus as a simple commemoration of the adventure of the nymph perigune  in the first of these we discern the beginning of agnation and kinsmanship through the father which still lingers in the couvee of new zealand tribes  while the second is a relic of the totem and fetish worship of plants  now in entire opposition to this modern inductive principle of research stands the philosophic plato whose account of primitive man is entirely speculative and deductive  the origin of society he ascribes to necessity the mother of all inventions and imagines that individual man began deliberately to herd together on account of the advantages of the principle of division of labour and the rendering of mutual need  it must however be borne in mind that platos object in this whole passage in the republic was perhaps not so much to analyse the conditions of early society as to illustrate the importance of the division of labour the shibboleth of his political economy by showing what a powerful factor it must have been in the most primitive as well as in the most complex states of society just as in the laws he almost rewrites entirely the history of the peloponnesus in order to prove the necessity of a balance of power he surely i mean must have recognised himself how essentially incomplete his theory was in taking no account of the origin of family life the position and influence of women and other social questions as well as in disregarding those deeper motives of religion which are such important factors in early civilisation and whose influence aristotle seems to have clearly apprehended when he says that the aim of primitive society was not merely life but the higher life and that in the origin of society utility is not the sole motive but that there is something spiritual in it if at least spiritual will bring out the meaning of that complex expression greek text which cannot be reproduced otherwise the whole account in the republic of primitive man will always remain as a warning against the intrusion of a priori speculations in the domain appropriate to induction  now aristotles theory of the origin of society like his philosophy of ethics rests ultimately on the principle of final causes not in the theological meaning of an aim or tendency imposed from without but in the scientific sense of function corresponding to organ  nature maketh no thing in vain is the text of aristotle in this as in other inquiries  man being the only animal possessed of the power of rational speech is he asserts by nature intended to be social more so than the bee or any other gregarious animal  he is greek text which cannot be reproduced and the national tendency towards higher forms of perfection brings the armed savage who used to sell his wife to the free independence of a free state and to the greek text which cannot be reproduced which was the test of true citizenship  the stages passed through by humanity start with the family first as the ultimate unit  the conglomeration of families forms a village ruled by that patriarchal sway which is the oldest form of government in the world as is shown by the fact that all men count it to be the constitution of heaven and the villages are merged into the state and here the progression stops  for aristotle like all greek thinkers found his ideal within the walls of the greek text which cannot be reproduced yet perhaps in his remark that a united greece would rule the world we may discern some anticipation of that federal union of free states into one consolidated empire which more than the greek text which cannot be reproduced is to our eyes the ultimately perfect polity  how far aristotle was justified in regarding the family as the ultimate unit with the materials afforded to him by greek literature i have already noticed  besides aristotle i may remark had he reflected on the meaning of that athenian law which while prohibiting marriage with a uterine sister permitted it with a sistergerman or on the common tradition in athens that before the time of cecrops children bore their mothers names or on some of the spartan regulations could hardly have failed to see the universality of kinsmanship through women in early days and the late appearance of monandry  yet while he missed this point in common it must be acknowledged with many modern writers such as sir henry maine it is essentially as an explorer of inductive instances that we recognise his improvement on plato  the treatise greek text which cannot be reproduced did it remain to us in its entirety would have been one of the most valuable landmarks in the progress of historical criticism and the first scientific treatise on the science of comparative politics  a few fragments still remain to us in one of which we find aristotle appealing to the authority of an ancient inscription on the disk of iphitus one of the most celebrated greek antiquities to corroborate his theory of the lycurgean revival of the olympian festival while his enormous research is evinced in the elaborate explanation he gives of the historical origin of proverbs such as greek text which cannot be reproduced of religious songs like the greek text which cannot be reproduced of the botticean virgins or the praises of love and war  and finally it is to be observed how much wider than platos his theory of the origin of society is  they both rest on a psychological basis but aristotles recognition of the capacity for progress and the tendency towards a higher life shows how much deeper his knowledge of human nature was  in imitation of these two philosophers polybius gives an account of the origin of society in the opening to his philosophy of history  somewhat in the spirit of plato he imagines that after one of the cyclic deluges which sweep off mankind at stated periods and annihilate all preexisting civilisation the few surviving members of humanity coalesce for mutual protection and as in the case with ordinary animals the one most remarkable for physical strength is elected king  in a short time owing to the workings of sympathy and the desire of approbation the moral qualities begin to make their appearance and intellectual instead of bodily excellence becomes the qualification for sovereignty  other points as the rise of law and the like are dwelt on in a somewhat modern spirit and although polybius seems not to have employed the inductive method of research in this question or rather i should say of the hierarchical order of the rational progress of ideas in life he is not far removed from what the laborious investigations of modern travellers have given us  and indeed as regards the working of the speculative faculty in the creation of history it is in all respects marvellous how that the most truthful accounts of the passage from barbarism to civilisation in ancient literature come from the works of poets the elaborate researches of mr tylor and sir john lubbock have done little more than verify the theories put forward in the prometheus bound and the de natura rerum yet neither aeschylus nor lucretias followed in the modern path but rather attained to truth by a certain almost mystic power of creative imagination such as we now seek to banish from science as a dangerous power though to it science seems to owe many of its most splendid generalities 5  leaving then the question of the origin of society as treated by the ancients i shall now turn to the other and the more important question of how far they may he said to have attained to what we call the philosophy of history  now at the outset we must note that while the conceptions of law and order have been universally received as the governing principles of the phenomena of nature in the sphere of physical science yet their intrusion into the domain of history and the life of man has always been met with a strong opposition on the ground of the incalculable nature of two great forces acting on human action a certain causeless spontaneity which men call free will and the extranatural interference which they attribute as a constant attribute to god  now that there is a science of the apparently variable phenomena of history is a conception which we have perhaps only recently begun to appreciate yet like all other great thoughts it seems to have come to the greek mind spontaneously through a certain splendour of imagination in the morning tide of their civilisation before inductive research had armed them with the instruments of verification  for i think it is possible to discern in some of the mystic speculations of the early greek thinkers that desire to discover what is that invariable existence of which there are variable states and to incorporate it in some one formula of law which may serve to explain the different manifestations of all organic bodies man included which is the germ of the philosophy of history the germ indeed of an idea of which it is not too much to say that on it any kind of historical criticism worthy of the name must ultimately rest  for the very first requisite for any scientific conception of history is the doctrine of uniform sequence  in other words that certain events having happened certain other events corresponding to them will happen also that the past is the key of the future  now at the birth of this great conception science it is true presided yet religion it was which at the outset clothed it in its own garb and familiarised men with it by appealing to their hearts first and then to their intellects knowing that at the beginning of things it is through the moral nature and not through the intellectual that great truths are spread  so in herodotus who may be taken as a representative of the orthodox tone of thought the idea of the uniform sequence of cause and effect appears under the theological aspect of nemesis and providence which is really the scientific conception of law only it is viewed from an ethical standpoint  now in thucydides the philosophy of history rests on the probability which the uniformity of human nature affords us that the future will in the course of human things resemble the past if not reproduce it  he appears to contemplate a recurrence of the phenomena of history as equally certain with a return of the epidemic of the great plague  notwithstanding what german critics have written on the subject we must beware of regarding this conception as a mere reproduction of that cyclic theory of events which sees in the world nothing but the regular rotation of strophe and antistrophe in the eternal choir of life and death  for in his remarks on the excesses of the corcyrean revolution thucydides distinctly rests his idea of the recurrence of history on the psychological grounds of the general sameness of mankind  the sufferings he says which revolution entailed upon the cities were many and terrible such as have occurred and always will occurs as long as human nature remains the same though in a severer or milder form and varying in their symptoms according to the variety of the particular cases  in peace and prosperity states and individuals have better sentiments because they are not confronted with imperious necessities but war takes away the easy supply of mens wants and so proves a hard taskmaster which brings most mens characters to a level with their fortunes    chapter iv    it is evident that here thucydides is ready to admit the variety of manifestations which external causes bring about in their workings on the uniform character of the nature of man  yet after all is said these are perhaps but very general statements  the ordinary effects of peace and war are dwelt on but there is no real analysis of the immediate causes and general laws of the phenomena of life nor does thucydides seem to recognise the truth that if humanity proceeds in circles the circles are always widening  perhaps we may say that with him the philosophy of history is partly in the metaphysical stage and see in the progress of this idea from herodotus to polybius the exemplification of the comtian law of the three stages of thought the theological the metaphysical and the scientific  for truly out of the vagueness of theological mysticism this conception which we call the philosophy of history was raised to a scientific principle according to which the past was explained and the future predicted by reference to general laws  now just as the earliest account of the nature of the progress of humanity is to be found in plato so in him we find the first explicit attempt to found a universal philosophy of history upon wide rational grounds  having created an ideally perfect state the philosopher proceeds to give an elaborate theory of the complex causes which produce revolutions of the moral effects of various forms of government and education of the rise of the criminal classes and their connection with pauperism and in a word to create history by the deductive method and to proceed from a priori psychological principles to discover the governing laws of the apparent chaos of political life  there have been many attempts since plato to deduce from a single philosophical principle all the phenomena which experience subsequently verifies for us  fichte thought he could predict the worldplan from the idea of universal time  hegel dreamed he had found the key to the mysteries of life in the development of freedom and krause in the categories of being  but the one scientific basis on which the true philosophy of history must rest is the complete knowledge of the laws of human nature in all its wants its aspirations its powers and its tendencies  and this great truth which thucydides may be said in some measure to have apprehended was given to us first by plato  now it cannot be accurately said of this philosopher that either his philosophy or his history is entirely and simply a priori  on est de son siecle meme quand on y proteste and so we find in him continual references to the spartan mode of life the pythagorean system the general characteristics of greek tyrannies and greek democracies  for while in his account of the method of forming an ideal state he says that the political artist is indeed to fix his gaze on the sun of abstract truth in the heavens of the pure reason but is sometimes to turn to the realisation of the ideals on earth  yet after all the general character of the platonic method which is what we are specially concerned with is essentially deductive and a priori  and he himself in the building up of his nephelococcygia certainly starts with a greek text which cannot be reproduced making a clean sweep of all history and all experience and it was essentially as an a priori theorist that he is criticised by aristotle as we shall see later  to proceed to closer details regarding the actual scheme of the laws of political revolutions as drawn out by plato we must first note that the primary cause of the decay of the ideal state is the general principle common to the vegetable and animal worlds as well as to the world of history that all created things are fated to decay  a principle which though expressed in the terms of a mere metaphysical abstraction is yet perhaps in its essence scientific  for we too must hold that a continuous redistribution of matter and motion is the inevitable result of the nominal persistence of force and that perfect equilibrium is as impossible in politics as it certainly is in physics  the secondary causes which mar the perfection of the platonic city of the sun are to be found in the intellectual decay of the race consequent on injudicious marriages and in the philistine elevation of physical achievements over mental culture while the hierarchical succession of timocracy and oligarchy democracy and tyranny is dwelt on at great length and its causes analysed in a very dramatic and psychological manner if not in that sanctioned by the actual order of history  and indeed it is apparent at first sight that the platonic succession of states represents rather the succession of ideas in the philosophic mind than any historical succession of time  aristotle meets the whole simply by an appeal to facts  if the theory of the periodic decay of all created things he urges be scientific it must be universal and so true of all the other states as well as of the ideal  besides a state usually changes into its contrary and not to the form next to it so the ideal state would not change into timocracy while oligarchy more often than tyranny succeeds democracy  plato besides says nothing of what a tyranny would change to  according to the cycle theory it ought to pass into the ideal state again but as a fact one tyranny is changed into another as at sicyon or into a democracy as at syracuse or into an aristocracy as at carthage  the example of sicily too shows that an oligarchy is often followed by a tyranny as at leontini and gela  besides it is absurd to represent greed as the chief motive of decay or to talk of avarice as the root of oligarchy when in nearly all true oligarchies moneymaking is forbidden by law  and finally the platonic theory neglects the different kinds of democracies and of tyrannies  now nothing can be more important than this passage in aristotles politics v 12 which may he said to mark an era in the evolution of historical criticism  for there is nothing on which aristotle insists so strongly as that the generalisations from facts ought to be added to the data of the a priori method  a principle which we know to be true not merely of deductive speculative politics but of physics also  for are not the residual phenomena of chemists a valuable source of improvement in theory  his own method is essentially historical though by no means empirical  on the contrary this farseeing thinker rightly styled il maestro di color che sanno may be said to have apprehended clearly that the true method is neither exclusively empirical nor exclusively speculative but rather a union of both in the process called analysis or the interpretation of facts which has been defined as the application to facts of such general conceptions as may fix the important characteristics of the phenomena and present them permanently in their true relations he too was the first to point out what even in our own day is incompletely appreciated that nature including the development of man is not full of incoherent episodes like a bad tragedy that inconsistency and anomaly are as impossible in the moral as they are in the physical world and that where the superficial observer thinks he sees a revolution the philosophical critic discerns merely the gradual and rational evolution of the inevitable results of certain antecedents  and while admitting the necessity of a psychological basis for the philosophy of history he added to it the important truth that man to be apprehended in his proper position in the universe as well as in his natural powers must be studied from below in the hierarchical progression of higher function from the lower forms of life  the important maxim that to obtain a clear conception of anything we must study it in its growth from the very beginning is formally set down in the opening of the politics where indeed we shall find the other characteristic features of the modern evolutionary theory such as the differentiation of function and the survival of the fittest explicitly set forth  what a valuable step this was in the improvement of the method of historical criticism it is needless to point out  by it one may say the true thread was given to guide ones steps through the bewildering labyrinth of facts  for history to use terms with which aristotle has made us familiar may be looked at from two essentially different standpoints either as a work of art whose greek text which cannot be reproduced or final cause is external to it and imposed on it from without or as an organism containing the law of its own development in itself and working out its perfection merely by the fact of being what it is  now if we adopt the former which we may style the theological view we shall be in continual danger of tripping into the pitfall of some a priori conclusion  that bourne from which it has been truly said no traveller ever returns  the latter is the only scientific theory and was apprehended in its fulness by aristotle whose application of the inductive method to history and whose employment of the evolutionary theory of humanity show that he was conscious that the philosophy of history is nothing separate from the facts of history but is contained in them and that the rational law of the complex phenomena of life like the ideal in the world of thought is to be reached through the facts not superimposed on them  greek text which cannot be reproduced  and finally in estimating the enormous debt which the science of historical criticism owes to aristotle we must not pass over his attitude towards those two great difficulties in the formation of a philosophy of history on which i have touched above  i mean the assertion of extranatural interference with the normal development of the world and of the incalculable influence exercised by the power of free will  now as regards the former he may be said to have neglected it entirely  the special acts of providence proceeding from gods immediate government of the world which herodotus saw as mighty landmarks in history would have been to him essentially disturbing elements in that universal reign of law the extent of whose limitless empire he of all the great thinkers of antiquity was the first explicitly to recognise  standing aloof from the popular religion as well as from the deeper conceptions of herodotus and the tragic school he no longer thought of god as of one with fair limbs and treacherous face haunting wood and glade nor would he see in him a jealous judge continually interfering in the worlds history to bring the wicked to punishment and the proud to a fall  god to him was the incarnation of the pure intellect a being whose activity was the contemplation of his own perfection one whom philosophy might imitate but whom prayers could never move to the sublime indifference of whose passionless wisdom what were the sons of men their desires or their sins  while as regards the other difficulty and the formation of a philosophy of history the conflict of free will with general laws appears first in greek thought in the usual theological form in which all great ideas seem to be cradled at their birth  it was such legends as those of oedipus and adrastus exemplifying the struggles of individual humanity against the overpowering force of circumstances and necessity which gave to the early greeks those same lessons which we of modern days draw in somewhat less artistic fashion from the study of statistics and the laws of physiology  in aristotle of course there is no trace of supernatural influence  the furies which drive their victim into sin first and then punishment are no longer vipertressed goddesses with eyes and mouth aflame but those evil thoughts which harbour within the impure soul  in this as in all other points to arrive at aristotle is to reach the pure atmosphere of scientific and modern thought  but while he rejected pure necessitarianism in its crude form as essentially a reductio ad absurdum of life he was fully conscious of the fact that the will is not a mysterious and ultimate unit of force beyond which we cannot go and whose special characteristic is inconsistency but a certain creative attitude of the mind which is from the first continually influenced by habits education and circumstance so absolutely modifiable in a word that the good and the bad man alike seem to lose the power of free will for the one is morally unable to sin the other physically incapacitated for reformation  and of the influence of climate and temperature in forming the nature of man a conception perhaps pressed too far in modern days when the race theory is supposed to be a sufficient explanation of the hindoo and the latitude and longitude of a country the best guide to its morals6 aristotle is completely unaware  i do not allude to such smaller points as the oligarchical tendencies of a horsebreeding country and the democratic influence of the proximity of the sea important though they are for the consideration of greek history but rather to those wider views in the seventh book of his politics where he attributes the happy union in the greek character of intellectual attainments with the spirit of progress to the temperate climate they enjoyed and points out how the extreme cold of the north dulls the mental faculties of its inhabitants and renders them incapable of social organisation or extended empire while to the enervating heat of eastern countries was due that want of spirit and bravery which then as now was the characteristic of the population in that quarter of the globe  thucydides has shown the causal connection between political revolutions and the fertility of the soil but goes a step farther and points out the psychological influences on a peoples character exercised by the various extremes of climate  in both cases the first appearance of a most valuable form of historical criticism  to the development of dialectic as to god intervals of time are of no account  from plato and aristotle we pass direct to polybius  the progress of thought from the philosopher of the academe to the arcadian historian may be best illustrated by a comparison of the method by which each of the three writers whom i have selected as the highest expression of the rationalism of his respective age attained to his ideal state  for the latter conception may be in a measure regarded as representing the most spiritual principle which they could discern in history  now plato created his on a priori principles aristotle formed his by an analysis of existing constitutions polybius found his realised for him in the actual world of fact  aristotle criticised the deductive speculations of plato by means of inductive negative instances but polybius will not take the cloud city of the republic into account at all  he compares it to an athlete who has never run on constitution hill to a statue so beautiful that it is entirely removed from the ordinary conditions of humanity and consequently from the canons of criticism  the roman state had attained in his eyes by means of the mutual counteraction of three opposing forces 7 that stable equilibrium in politics which was the ideal of all the theoretical writers of antiquity  and in connection with this point it will be convenient to notice here how much truth there is contained in the accusation often brought against the ancients that they knew nothing of the idea of progress for the meaning of many of their speculations will be hidden from us if we do not try and comprehend first what their aim was and secondly why it was so  now like all wide generalities this statement is at least inaccurate  the prayer of platos ideal city  greek text which cannot be reproduced might be written as a text over the door of the last temple to humanity raised by the disciples of fourier and saintsimon but it is certainly true that their ideal principle was order and permanence not indefinite progress  for setting aside the artistic prejudices which would have led the greeks to reject this idea of unlimited improvement we may note that the modern conception of progress rests partly on the new enthusiasm and worship of humanity partly on the splendid hopes of material improvements in civilisation which applied science has held out to us two influences from which ancient greek thought seems to have been strangely free  for the greeks marred the perfect humanism of the great men whom they worshipped by imputing to them divinity and its supernatural powers while their science was eminently speculative and often almost mystic in its character aiming at culture and not utility at higher spirituality and more intense reverence for law rather than at the increased facilities of locomotion and the cheap production of common things about which our modern scientific school ceases not to boast  and lastly and perhaps chiefly we must remember that the plague spot of all greek states as one of their own writers has called it was the terrible insecurity to life and property which resulted from the factions and revolutions which ceased not to trouble greece at all times raising a spirit of fanaticism such as religion raised in the middle ages of europe  these considerations then will enable us to understand first how it was that radical and unscrupulous reformers as the greek political theorists were yet their end once attained no modern conservatives raised such outcry against the slightest innovation even acknowledged improvements in such things as the games of children or the modes of music were regarded by them with feelings of extreme apprehension as the herald of the drapeau rouge of reform  and secondly it will show us how it was that polybius found his ideal in the commonwealth of rome and aristotle like mr bright in the middle classes  polybius however is not content merely with pointing out his ideal state but enters at considerable length into the question of those general laws whose consideration forms the chief essential of the philosophy of history  he starts by accepting the general principle that all things are fated to decay which i noticed in the case of plato and that as iron produces rust and as wood breeds the animals that destroy it so every state has in it the seeds of its own corruption  he is not however content to rest there but proceeds to deal with the more immediate causes of revolutions which he says are twofold in nature either external or internal  now the former depending as they do on the synchronous conjunction of other events outside the sphere of scientific estimation are from their very character incalculable but the latter though assuming many forms always result from the overgreat preponderance of any single element to the detriment of the others the rational law lying at the base of all varieties of political changes being that stability can result only from the statical equilibrium produced by the counteraction of opposing parts since the more simple a constitution is the more it is insecure  plato had pointed out before how the extreme liberty of a democracy always resulted in despotism but polybius analyses the law and shows the scientific principles on which it rests  the doctrine of the instability of pure constitutions forms an important era in the philosophy of history  its special applicability to the politics of our own day has been illustrated in the rise of the great napoleon when the french state had lost those divisions of caste and prejudice of landed aristocracy and moneyed interest institutions in which the vulgar see only barriers to liberty but which are indeed the only possible defences against the coming of that periodic sirius of politics the greek text which cannot be reproduced  there is a principle which tocqueville never wearies of explaining and which has been subsumed by mr herbert spencer under that general law common to all organic bodies which we call the instability of the homogeneous  the various manifestations of this law as shown in the normal regular revolutions and evolutions of the different forms of government 8 are expounded with great clearness by polybius who claimed for his theory in the thucydidean spirit that it is a greek text which cannot be reproduced not a mere greek text which cannot be reproduced and that a knowledge of it will enable the impartial observer 9 to discover at any time what period of its constitutional evolution any particular state has already reached and into what form it will be next differentiated though possibly the exact time of the changes may be more or less uncertain 10  now in this necessarily incomplete account of the laws of political revolutions as expounded by polybius enough perhaps has been said to show what is his true position in the rational development of the idea which i have called the philosophy of history because it is the unifying of history  seen darkly as it is through the glass of religion in the pages of herodotus more metaphysical than scientific with thucydides plato strove to seize it by the eagle flight of speculation to reach it with the eager grasp of a soul impatient of those slower and surer inductive methods which aristotle in his trenchant criticism of his greater master showed were more brilliant than any vague theory if the test of brilliancy is truth  what then is the position of polybius  does any new method remain for him  polybius was one of those many men who are born too late to be original  to thucydides belongs the honour of being the first in the history of greek thought to discern the supreme calm of law and order underlying the fitful storms of life and plato and aristotle each represents a great new principle  to polybius belongs the office  how noble an office he made it his writings show  of making more explicit the ideas which were implicit in his predecessors of showing that they were of wider applicability and perhaps of deeper meaning than they had seemed before of examining with more minuteness the laws which they had discovered and finally of pointing out more clearly than any one had done the range of science and the means it offered for analysing the present and predicting what was to come  his office thus was to gather up what they had left to give their principles new life by a wider application  polybius ends this great diapason of greek thought  when the philosophy of history appears next as in plutarchs tract on why gods anger is delayed the pendulum of thought had swung back to where it began  his theory was introduced to the romans under the cultured style of cicero and was welcomed by them as the philosophical panegyric of their state  the last notice of it in latin literature is in the pages of tacitus who alludes to the stable polity formed out of these elements as a constitution easier to commend than to produce and in no case lasting  yet polybius had seen the future with no uncertain eye and had prophesied the rise of the empire from the unbalanced power of the ochlocracy fifty years and more before there was joy in the julian household over the birth of that boy who born to power as the champion of the people died wearing the purple of a king  no attitude of historical criticism is more important than the means by which the ancients attained to the philosophy of history the principle of heredity can be exemplified in literature as well as in organic life  aristotle plato and polybius are the lineal ancestors of fichte and hegel of vico and cousin of montesquieu and tocqueville  as my aim is not to give an account of historians but to point out those great thinkers whose methods have furthered the advance of this spirit of historical criticism i shall pass over those annalists and chroniclers who intervened between thucydides and polybius  yet perhaps it may serve to throw new light on the real nature of this spirit and its intimate connection with all other forms of advanced thought if i give some estimate of the character and rise of those many influences prejudicial to the scientific study of history which cause such a wide gap between these two historians  foremost among these is the growing influence of rhetoric and the isocratean school which seems to have regarded history as an arena for the display either of pathos or paradoxes not a scientific investigation into laws  the new age is the age of style  the same spirit of exclusive attention to form which made euripides often like swinburne prefer music to meaning and melody to morality which gave to the later greek statues that refined effeminacy that overstrained gracefulness of attitude was felt in the sphere of history  the rules laid down for historical composition are those relating to the aesthetic value of digressions the legality of employing more than one metaphor in the same sentence and the like and historians are ranked not by their power of estimating evidence but by the goodness of the greek they write  i must note also the important influence on literature exercised by alexander the great for while his travels encouraged the more accurate research of geography the very splendour of his achievements seems to have brought history again into the sphere of romance  the appearance of all great men in the world is followed invariably by the rise of that mythopoeic spirit and that tendency to look for the marvellous which is so fatal to true historical criticism  an alexander a napoleon a francis of assisi and a mahomet are thought to be outside the limiting conditions of rational law just as comets were supposed to be not very long ago while the founding of that city of alexandria in which western and eastern thought met with such strange result to both diverted the critical tendencies of the greek spirit into questions of grammar philology and the like the narrow artificial atmosphere of that university town as we may call it was fatal to the development of that independent and speculative spirit of research which strikes out new methods of inquiry of which historical criticism is one  the alexandrines combined a great love of learning with an ignorance of the true principles of research an enthusiastic spirit for accumulating materials with a wonderful incapacity to use them  not among the hot sands of egypt or the sophists of athens but from the very heart of greece rises the man of genius on whose influence in the evolution of the philosophy of history i have a short time ago dwelt  born in the serene and pure air of the clear uplands of arcadia polybius may be said to reproduce in his work the character of the place which gave him birth  for of all the historians  i do not say of antiquity but of all time  none is more rationalistic than he none more free from any belief in the visions and omens the monstrous legends the grovelling superstitions and unmanly craving for the supernatural greek text that cannot be reproduced11 which he himself is compelled to notice as the characteristics of some of the historians who preceded him  fortunate in the land which bore him he was no less blessed in the wondrous time of his birth  for representing in himself the spiritual supremacy of the greek intellect and allied in bonds of chivalrous friendship to the worldconqueror of his day he seems led as it were by the hand of fate to comprehend as has been said more clearly than the romans themselves the historical position of rome and to discern with greater insight than all other men could those two great resultants of ancient civilisation the material empire of the city of the seven hills and the intellectual sovereignty of hellas  before his own day he says 12 the events of the world were unconnected and separate and the histories confined to particular countries  now for the first time the universal empire of the romans rendered a universal history possible 13  this then is the august motive of his work  to trace the gradual rise of this italian city from the day when the first legion crossed the narrow strait of messina and landed on the fertile fields of sicily to the time when corinth in the east and carthage in the west fell before the resistless wave of empire and the eagles of rome passed on the wings of universal victory from calpe and the pillars of hercules to syria and the nile  at the same time he recognised that the scheme of romes empire was worked out under the aegis of gods will 14  for as one of the middle age scribes most truly says the greek text which cannot be reproduced of polybius is that power which we christians call god the second aim as one may call it of his history is to point out the rational and human and natural causes which brought this result distinguishing as we should say between gods mediate and immediate government of the world  with any direct intervention of god in the normal development of man he will have nothing to do  still less with any idea of chance as a factor in the phenomena of life  chance and miracles he says are mere expressions for our ignorance of rational causes the spirit of rationalism which we recognised in herodotus as a vague uncertain attitude and which appears in thucydides as a consistent attitude of mind never argued about or even explained is by polybius analysed and formulated as the great instrument of historical research  herodotus while believing on principle in the supernatural yet was sceptical at times  thucydides simply ignored the supernatural  he did not discuss it but he annihilated it by explaining history without it  polybius enters at length into the whole question and explains its origin and the method of treating it  herodotus would have believed in scipios dream  thucydides would have ignored it entirely  polybius explains it  he is the culmination of the rational progression of dialectic  nothing he says shows a foolish mind more than the attempt to account for any phenomena on the principle of chance or supernatural intervention  history is a search for rational causes and there is nothing in the world  even those phenomena which seem to us the most remote from law and improbable  which is not the logical and inevitable result of certain rational antecedents  some things of course are to be rejected a priori without entering into the subject  as regards such miracles he says 15 as that on a certain statue of artemis rain or snow never falls though the statue stands in the open air or that those who enter gods shrine in arcadia lose their natural shadows i cannot really be expected to argue upon the subject  for these things are not only utterly improbable but absolutely impossible  for us to argue reasonably on an acknowledged absurdity is as vain a task as trying to catch water in a sieve it is really to admit the possibility of the supernatural which is the very point at issue  what polybius felt was that to admit the possibility of a miracle is to annihilate the possibility of history  for just as scientific and chemical experiments would be either impossible or useless if exposed to the chance of continued interference on the part of some foreign body so the laws and principles which govern history the causes of phenomena the evolution of progress the whole science in a word of mans dealings with his own race and with nature will remain a sealed book to him who admits the possibility of extranatural interference  the stories of miracles then are to be rejected on a priori rational grounds but in the case of events which we know to have happened the scientific historian will not rest till he has discovered their natural causes which for instance in the case of the wonderful rise of the roman empire  the most marvellous thing polybius says which god ever brought about 16  are to be found in the excellence of their constitution greek text which cannot be reproduced the wisdom of their advisers their splendid military arrangements and their superstition greek text which cannot be reproduced  for while polybius regarded the revealed religion as of course objective reality of truth 17 he laid great stress on its moral subjective influence going in one passage on the subject even so far as almost to excuse the introduction of the supernatural in very small quantities into history on account of the extremely good effect it would have on pious people  but perhaps there is no passage in the whole of ancient and modern history which breathes such a manly and splendid spirit of rationalism as one preserved to us in the vatican  strange restingplace for it  in which he treats of the terrible decay of population which had fallen on his native land in his own day and which by the general orthodox public was regarded as a special judgment of god sending childlessness on women as a punishment for the sins of the people  for it was a disaster quite without parallel in the history of the land and entirely unforeseen by any of its politicaleconomy writers who on the contrary were always anticipating that danger would arise from an excess of population overrunning its means of subsistence and becoming unmanageable through its size  polybius however will have nothing to do with either priest or worker of miracles in this matter  he will not even seek that sacred heart of greece delphi apollos shrine whose inspiration even thucydides admitted and before whose wisdom socrates bowed  how foolish he says were the man who on this matter would pray to god  we must search for the rational causes and the causes are seen to be clear and the method of prevention also  he then proceeds to notice how all this arose from the general reluctance to marriage and to bearing the expense of educating a large family which resulted from the carelessness and avarice of the men of his day and he explains on entirely rational principles the whole of this apparently supernatural judgment  now it is to be borne in mind that while his rejection of miracles as violation of inviolable laws is entirely a priori  for discussion of such a matter is of course impossible for a rational thinker  yet his rejection of supernatural intervention rests entirely on the scientific grounds of the necessity of looking for natural causes  and he is quite logical in maintaining his position on these principles  for where it is either difficult or impossible to assign any rational cause for phenomena or to discover their laws he acquiesces reluctantly in the alternative of admitting some extranatural interference which his essentially scientific method of treating the matter has logically forced on him approving for instance of prayers for rain on the express ground that the laws of meteorology had not yet been ascertained  he would of course have been the first to welcome our modern discoveries in the matter  the passage in question is in every way one of the most interesting in his whole work not of course as signifying any inclination on his part to acquiesce in the supernatural but because it shows how essentially logical and rational his method of argument was and how candid and fair his mind  having now examined polybiuss attitude towards the supernatural and the general ideas which guided his research i will proceed to examine the method he pursued in his scientific investigation of the complex phenomena of life  for as i have said before in the course of this essay what is important in all great writers is not so much the results they arrive at as the methods they pursue  the increased knowledge of facts may alter any conclusion in history as in physical science and the canons of speculative historical credibility must be acknowledged to appeal rather to that subjective attitude of mind which we call the historic sense than to any formulated objective rules  but a scientific method is a gain for all time and the true if not the only progress of historical criticism consists in the improvement of the instruments of research  now first as regards his conception of history i have already pointed out that it was to him essentially a search for causes a problem to be solved not a picture to be painted a scientific investigation into laws and tendencies not a mere romantic account of startling incident and wondrous adventure  thucydides in the opening of his great work had sounded the first note of the scientific conception of history  the absence of romance in my pages he says will i fear detract somewhat from its value but i have written my work not to be the exploit of a passing hour but as the possession of all time 18  polybius follows with words almost entirely similar  if he says we banish from history the consideration of causes methods and motives greek text which cannot be reproduced and refuse to consider how far the result of anything is its rational consequent what is left is a mere greek text which cannot be reproduced not a greek text which cannot be reproduced an oratorical essay which may give pleasure for the moment but which is entirely without any scientific value for the explanation of the future  elsewhere he says that history robbed of the exposition of its causes and laws is a profitless thing though it may allure a fool  and all through his history the same point is put forward and exemplified in every fashion  so far for the conception of history  now for the groundwork  as regards the character of the phenomena to be selected by the scientific investigator aristotle had laid down the general formula that nature should be studied in her normal manifestations polybius true to his character of applying explicitly the principles implicit in the work of others follows out the doctrine of aristotle and lays particular stress on the rational and undisturbed character of the development of the roman constitution as affording special facilities for the discovery of the laws of its progress  political revolutions result from causes either external or internal  the former are mere disturbing forces which lie outside the sphere of scientific calculation  it is the latter which are important for the establishing of principles and the elucidation of the sequences of rational evolution  he thus may be said to have anticipated one of the most important truths of the modern methods of investigation  i mean that principle which lays down that just as the study of physiology should precede the study of pathology just as the laws of disease are best discovered by the phenomena presented in health so the method of arriving at all great social and political truths is by the investigation of those cases where development has been normal rational and undisturbed  the critical canon that the more a people has been interfered with the more difficult it becomes to generalise the laws of its progress and to analyse the separate forces of its civilisation is one the validity of which is now generally recognised by those who pretend to a scientific treatment of all history  and while we have seen that aristotle anticipated it in a general formula to polybius belongs the honour of being the first to apply it explicitly in the sphere of history  i have shown how to this great scientific historian the motive of his work was essentially the search for causes and true to his analytical spirit he is careful to examine what a cause really is and in what part of the antecedents of any consequent it is to be looked for  to give an illustration  as regards the origin of the war with perseus some assigned as causes the expulsion of abrupolis by perseus the expedition of the latter to delphi the plot against eumenes and the seizure of the ambassadors in boeotia of these incidents the two former polybius points out were merely the pretexts the two latter merely the occasions of the war  the war was really a legacy left to perseus by his father who was determined to fight it out with rome 19  here as elsewhere he is not originating any new idea  thucydides had pointed out the difference between the real and the alleged cause and the aristotelian dictum about revolutions greek text which cannot be reproduced draws the distinction between cause and occasion with the brilliancy of an epigram  but the explicit and rational investigation of the difference between greek text which cannot be reproduced and greek text which cannot be reproduced was reserved for polybius  no canon of historical criticism can be said to be of more real value than that involved in this distinction and the overlooking of it has filled our histories with the contemptible accounts of the intrigues of courtiers and of kings and the petty plottings of backstairs influence  particulars interesting no doubt to those who would ascribe the reformation to anne boleyns pretty face the persian war to the influence of a doctor or a curtainlecture from atossa or the french revolution to madame de maintenon but without any value for those who aim at any scientific treatment of history  but the question of method to which i am compelled always to return is not yet exhausted  there is another aspect in which it may be regarded and i shall now proceed to treat of it  one of the greatest difficulties with which the modern historian has to contend is the enormous complexity of the facts which come under his notice  dalemberts suggestion that at the end of every century a selection of facts should be made and the rest burned if it was really intended seriously could not of course be entertained for a moment  a problem loses all its value when it becomes simplified and the world would be all the poorer if the sibyl of history burned her volumes  besides as gibbon pointed out a montesquieu will detect in the most insignificant fact relations which the vulgar overlook  nor can the scientific investigator of history isolate the particular elements which he desires to examine from disturbing and extraneous causes as the experimental chemist can do though sometimes as in the case of lunatic asylums and prisons he is enabled to observe phenomena in a certain degree of isolation  so he is compelled either to use the deductive mode of arguing from general laws or to employ the method of abstraction which gives a fictitious isolation to phenomena never so isolated in actual existence  and this is exactly what polybius has done as well as thucydides  for as has been well remarked there is in the works of these two writers a certain plastic unity of type and motive whatever they write is penetrated through and through with a specific quality a singleness and concentration of purpose which we may contrast with the more comprehensive width as manifested not merely in the modern mind but also in herodotus  thucydides regarding society as influenced entirely by political motives took no account of forces of a different nature and consequently his results like those of most modern political economists have to be modified largely 20 before they come to correspond with what we know was the actual state of fact  similarly polybius will deal only with those forces which tended to bring the civilised world under the dominion of rome ix 1 and in the thucydidean spirit points out the want of picturesqueness and romance in his pages which is the result of the abstract method greek text which cannot be reproduced being careful also to tell us that his rejection of all other forces is essentially deliberate and the result of a preconceived theory and by no means due to carelessness of any kind  now of the general value of the abstract method and the legality of its employment in the sphere of history this is perhaps not the suitable occasion for any discussion  it is however in all ways worthy of note that polybius is not merely conscious of but dwells with particular weight on the fact which is usually urged as the strongest objection to the employment of the abstract method  i mean the conception of a society as a sort of human organism whose parts are indissolubly connected with one another and all affected when one member is in any way agitated  this conception of the organic nature of society appears first in plato and aristotle who apply it to cities  polybius as his wont is expands it to be a general characteristic of all history  it is an idea of the very highest importance especially to a man like polybius whose thoughts are continually turned towards the essential unity of history and the impossibility of isolation  farther as regards the particular method of investigating that group of phenomena obtained for him by the abstract method he will adopt he tells us neither the purely deductive nor the purely inductive mode but the union of both  in other words he formally adopts that method of analysis upon the importance of which i have dwelt before  and lastly while without doubt enormous simplicity in the elements under consideration is the result of the employment of the abstract method even within the limit thus obtained a certain selection must be made and a selection involves a theory  for the facts of life cannot be tabulated with as great an ease as the colours of birds and insects can be tabulated  now polybius points out that those phenomena particularly are to be dwelt on which may serve as a greek text which cannot be reproduced or sample and show the character of the tendencies of the age as clearly as a single drop from a full cask will be enough to disclose the nature of the whole contents  this recognition of the importance of single facts not in themselves but because of the spirit they represent is extremely scientific for we know that from the single bone or tooth even the anatomist can recreate entirely the skeleton of the primeval horse and the botanist tell the character of the flora and fauna of a district from a single specimen  regarding truth as the most divine thing in nature the very eye and light of history without which it moves a blind thing polybius spared no pains in the acquisition of historical materials or in the study of the sciences of politics and war which he considered were so essential to the training of the scientific historian and the labour he took is mirrored in the many ways in which he criticises other authorities  there is something as a rule slightly contemptible about ancient criticism  the modern idea of the critic as the interpreter the expounder of the beauty and excellence of the work he selects seems quite unknown  nothing can be more captious or unfair for instance than the method by which aristotle criticised the ideal state of plato in his ethical works and the passages quoted by polybius from timaeus show that the latter historian fully deserved the punning name given to him  but in polybius there is i think little of that bitterness and pettiness of spirit which characterises most other writers and an incidental story he tells of his relations with one of the historians whom he criticised shows that he was a man of great courtesy and refinement of taste  as indeed befitted one who had lived always in the society of those who were of great and noble birth  now as regards the character of the canons by which he criticises the works of other authors in the majority of cases he employs simply his own geographical and military knowledge showing for instance the impossibility in the accounts given of nabiss march from sparta simply by his acquaintance with the spots in question or the inconsistency of those of the battle of issus or of the accounts given by ephorus of the battles of leuctra and mantinea in the latter case he says if any one will take the trouble to measure out the ground of the site of the battle and then test the manoeuvres given he will find how inaccurate the accounts are  in other cases he appeals to public documents the importance of which he was always foremost in recognising showing for instance by a document in the public archives of rhodes how inaccurate were the accounts given of the battle of lade by zeno and antisthenes or he appeals to psychological probability rejecting for instance the scandalous stories told of philip of macedon simply from the kings general greatness of character and arguing that a boy so well educated and so respectably connected as demochares xii 14 could never have been guilty of that of which evil rumour accused him  but the chief object of his literary censure is timaeus who had been unsparing of his strictures on others  the general point which he makes against him impugning his accuracy as a historian is that he derived his knowledge of history not from the dangerous perils of a life of action but in the secure indolence of a narrow scholastic life  there is indeed no point on which he is so vehement as this  a history he says written in a library gives as lifeless and as inaccurate a picture of history as a painting which is copied not from a living animal but from a stuffed one  there is more difference he says in another place between the history of an eyewitness and that of one whose knowledge comes from books than there is between the scenes of real life and the fictitious landscapes of theatrical scenery  besides this he enters into somewhat elaborate detailed criticism of passages where he thought timaeus was following a wrong method and perverting truth passages which it will be worth while to examine in detail  timaeus from the fact of there being a roman custom to shoot a warhorse on a stated day argued back to the trojan origin of that people  polybius on the other hand points out that the inference is quite unwarrantable because horsesacrifices are ordinary institutions common to all barbarous tribes  timaeus here as was common with greek writers is arguing back from some custom of the present to an historical event in the past  polybius really is employing the comparative method showing how the custom was an ordinary step in the civilisation of every early people  in another place 21 he shows how illogical is the scepticism of timaeus as regards the existence of the bull of phalaris simply by appealing to the statue of the bull which was still to be seen in carthage pointing out how impossible it was on any other theory except that it belonged to phalaris to account for the presence in carthage of a bull of this peculiar character with a door between his shoulders  but one of the great points which he uses against this sicilian historian is in reference to the question of the origin of the locrian colony  in accordance with the received tradition on the subject aristotle had represented the locrian colony as founded by some parthenidae or slaves children as they were called a statement which seems to have roused the indignation of timaeus who went to a good deal of trouble to confute this theory  he does so on the following grounds  first of all he points out that in the ancient days the greeks had no slaves at all so the mention of them in the matter is an anachronism and next he declares that he was shown in the greek city of locris certain ancient inscriptions in which their relation to the italian city was expressed in terms of the position between parent and child which showed also that mutual rights of citizenship were accorded to each city  besides this he appeals to various questions of improbability as regards their international relationship on which polybius takes diametrically opposite grounds which hardly call for discussion  and in favour of his own view he urges two points more  first that the lacedaemonians being allowed furlough for the purpose of seeing their wives at home it was unlikely that the locrians should not have had the same privilege and next that the italian locrians knew nothing of the aristotelian version and had on the contrary very severe laws against adulterers runaway slaves and the like now most of these questions rest on mere probability which is always such a subjective canon that an appeal to it is rarely conclusive  i would note however as regards the inscriptions which if genuine would of course have settled the matter that polybius looks on them as a mere invention on the part of timaeus who he remarks gives no details about them though as a rule he is overanxious to give chapter and verse for everything  a somewhat more interesting point is that where he attacks timaeus for the introduction of fictitious speeches into his narrative for on this point polybius seems to be far in advance of the opinions held by literary men on the subject not merely in his own day but for centuries after  herodotus had introduced speeches avowedly dramatic and fictitious thucydides states clearly that where he was unable to find out what people really said he put down what they ought to have said sallust alludes it is true to the fact of the speech he puts into the mouth of the tribune memmius being essentially genuine but the speeches given in the senate on the occasion of the catilinarian conspiracy are very different from the same orations as they appear in cicero  livy makes his ancient romans wrangle and chop logic with all the subtlety of a hortensius or a scaevola  and even in later days when shorthand reporters attended the debates of the senate and a daily news was published in rome we find that one of the most celebrated speeches in tacitus that in which the emperor claudius gives the gauls their freedom is shown by an inscription discovered recently at lugdunum to be entirely fabulous  upon the other hand it must be borne in mind that these speeches were not intended to deceive they were regarded merely as a certain dramatic element which it was allowable to introduce into history for the purpose of giving more life and reality to the narration and were to be criticised not as we should by arguing how in an age before shorthand was known such a report was possible or how in the failure of written documents tradition could bring down such an accurate verbal account but by the higher test of their psychological probability as regards the persons in whose mouths they are placed  an ancient historian in answer to modern criticism would say probably that these fictitious speeches were in reality more truthful than the actual ones just as aristotle claimed for poetry a higher degree of truth in comparison to history  the whole point is interesting as showing how far in advance of his age polybius may be said to have been  the last scientific historian it is possible to gather from his writings what he considered were the characteristics of the ideal writer of history and no small light will be thrown on the progress of historical criticism if we strive to collect and analyse what in polybius are more or less scattered expressions the ideal historian must be contemporary with the events he describes or removed from them by one generation only  where it is possible he is to be an eyewitness of what he writes of where that is out of his power he is to test all traditions and stories carefully and not to be ready to accept what is plausible in place of what is true  he is to be no bookworm living aloof from the experiences of the world in the artificial isolation of a university town but a politician a soldier and a traveller a man not merely of thought but of action one who can do great things as well as write of them who in the sphere of history could be what byron and aeschylus were in the sphere of poetry at once le chantre et le heros  he is to keep before his eyes the fact that chance is merely a synonym for our ignorance that the reign of law pervades the domain of history as much as it does that of political science  he is to accustom himself to look on all occasions for rational and natural causes  and while he is to recognise the practical utility of the supernatural in an educational point of view he is not himself to indulge in such intellectual beating of the air as to admit the possibility of the violation of inviolable laws or to argue in a sphere wherein argument is a priori annihilated  he is to be free from all bias towards friend and country he is to be courteous and gentle in criticism he is not to regard history as a mere opportunity for splendid and tragic writing nor is he to falsify truth for the sake of a paradox or an epigram  while acknowledging the importance of particular facts as samples of higher truths he is to take a broad and general view of humanity  he is to deal with the whole race and with the world not with particular tribes or separate countries  he is to bear in mind that the world is really an organism wherein no one part can be moved without the others being affected also  he is to distinguish between cause and occasion between the influence of general laws and particular fancies and he is to remember that the greatest lessons of the world are contained in history and that it is the historians duty to manifest them so as to save nations from following those unwise policies which always lead to dishonour and ruin and to teach individuals to apprehend by the intellectual culture of history those truths which else they would have to learn in the bitter school of experience  now as regards his theory of the necessity of the historians being contemporary with the events he describes so far as the historian is a mere narrator the remark is undoubtedly true  but to appreciate the harmony and rational position of the facts of a great epoch to discover its laws the causes which produced it and the effects which it generates the scene must be viewed from a certain height and distance to be completely apprehended  a thoroughly contemporary historian such as lord clarendon or thucydides is in reality part of the history he criticises and in the case of such contemporary historians as fabius and philistus polybius in compelled to acknowledge that they are misled by patriotic and other considerations  against polybius himself no such accusation can be made  he indeed of all men is able as from some lofty tower to discern the whole tendency of the ancient world the triumph of roman institutions and of greek thought which is the last message of the old world and in a more spiritual sense has become the gospel of the new  one thing indeed he did not see or if he saw it he thought but little of it  how from the east there was spreading over the world as a wave spreads a spiritual inroad of new religions from the time when the pessinuntine mother of the gods a shapeless mass of stone was brought to the eternal city by her holiest citizen to the day when the ship castor and pollux stood in at puteoli and st paul turned his face towards martyrdom and victory at rome polybius was able to predict from his knowledge of the causes of revolutions and the tendencies of the various forms of governments the uprising of that democratic tone of thought which as soon as a seed is sown in the murder of the gracchi and the exile of marius culminated as all democratic movements do culminate in the supreme authority of one man the lordship of the world under the worlds rightful lord caius julius caesar  this indeed he saw in no uncertain way  but the turning of all mens hearts to the east the first glimmering of that splendid dawn which broke over the hills of galilee and flooded the earth like wine was hidden from his eyes  there are many points in the description of the ideal historian which one may compare to the picture which plato has given us of the ideal philosopher  they are both spectators of all time and all existence  nothing is contemptible in their eyes for all things have a meaning and they both walk in august reasonableness before all men conscious of the workings of god yet free from all terror of mendicant priest or vagrant miracleworker  but the parallel ends here  for the one stands aloof from the worldstorm of sleet and hail his eyes fixed on distant and sunlit heights loving knowledge for the sake of knowledge and wisdom for the joy of wisdom while the other is an eager actor in the world ever seeking to apply his knowledge to useful things  both equally desire truth but the one because of its utility the other for its beauty  the historian regards it as the rational principle of all true history and no more  to the other it comes as an all pervading and mystic enthusiasm like the desire of strong wine the craving of ambition the passionate love of what is beautiful  still though we miss in the historian those higher and more spiritual qualities which the philosopher of the academe alone of all men possessed we must not blind ourselves to the merits of that great rationalist who seems to have anticipated the very latest words of modern science  nor yet is he to be regarded merely in the narrow light in which he is estimated by most modern critics as the explicit champion of rationalism and nothing more for he is connected with another idea the course of which is as the course of that great river of his native arcadia which springing from some arid and sunbleached rock gathers strength and beauty as it flows till it reaches the asphodel meadows of olympia and the light and laughter of ionian waters  for in him we can discern the first notes of that great cult of the sevenhilled city which made virgil write his epic and livy his history which found in dante its highest exponent which dreamed of an empire where the emperor would care for the bodies and the pope for the souls of men and so has passed into the conception of gods spiritual empire and the universal brotherhood of man and widened into the huge ocean of universal thought as the peneus loses itself in the sea  polybius is the last scientific historian of greece  the writer who seems fittingly to complete the progress of thought is a writer of biographies only  i will not here touch on plutarchs employment of the inductive method as shown in his constant use of inscription and statue of public document and building and the like because it involves no new method  it is his attitude towards miracles of which i desire to treat  plutarch is philosophic enough to see that in the sense of a violation of the laws of nature a miracle is impossible  it is absurd he says to imagine that the statue of a saint can speak and that an inanimate object not possessing the vocal organs should be able to utter an articulate sound  upon the other hand he protests against science imagining that by explaining the natural causes of things it has explained away their transcendental meaning  when the tears on the cheek of some holy statue have been analysed into the moisture which certain temperatures produce on wood and marble it yet by no means follows that they were not a sign of grief and mourning set there by god himself  when lampon saw in the prodigy of the onehorned ram the omen of the supreme rule of pericles and when anaxagoras showed that the abnormal development was the rational resultant of the peculiar formation of the skull the dreamer and the man of science were both right it was the business of the latter to consider how the prodigy came about of the former to show why it was so formed and what it so portended  the progression of thought is exemplified in all particulars  herodotus had a glimmering sense of the impossibility of a violation of nature  thucydides ignored the supernatural polybius rationalised it  plutarch raises it to its mystical heights again though he bases it on law  in a word plutarch felt that while science brings the supernatural down to the natural yet ultimately all that is natural is really supernatural  to him as to many of our own day religion was that transcendental attitude of the mind which contemplating a world resting on inviolable law is yet comforted and seeks to worship god not in the violation but in the fulfilment of nature  it may seem paradoxical to quote in connection with the priest of chaeronea such a pure rationalist as mr herbert spencer yet when we read as the last message of modern science that when the equation of life has been reduced to its lowest terms the symbols are symbols still mere signs that is of that unknown reality which underlies all matter and all spirit we may feel how over the wide strait of centuries thought calls to thought and how plutarch has a higher position than is usually claimed for him in the progress of the greek intellect  and indeed it seems that not merely the importance of plutarch himself but also that of the land of his birth in the evolution of greek civilisation has been passed over by modern critics  to us indeed the bare rock to which the parthenon serves as a crown and which lies between colonus and atticas violet hills will always be the holiest spot in the land of greece  and delphi will come next and then the meadows of eurotas where that noble people lived who represented in hellenic thought the reaction of the law of duty against the law of beauty the opposition of conduct to culture yet as one stands on the greek text which cannot be reproduced of cithaeron and looks out on the great double plain of boeotia the enormous importance of the division of hellas comes to ones mind with great force  to the north are orchomenus and the minyan treasurehouse seat of those merchant princes of phoenicia who brought to greece the knowledge of letters and the art of working in gold  thebes is at our feet with the gloom of the terrible legends of greek tragedy still lingering about it the birthplace of pindar the nurse of epaminondas and the sacred band  and from out of the plain where mars loved to dance rises the muses haunt helicon by whose silver streams corinna and hesiod sang while far away under the white aegis of those snowcapped mountains lies chaeronea and the lion plain where with vain chivalry the greeks strove to check macedon first and afterwards rome chaeronea where in the martinmas summer of greek civilisation plutarch rose from the drear waste of a dying religion as the aftermath rises when the mowers think they have left the field bare  greek philosophy began and ended in scepticism  the first and the last word of greek history was faith  splendid thus in its death like winter sunsets the greek religion passed away into the horror of night  for the cimmerian darkness was at hand and when the schools of athens were closed and the statue of athena broken the greek spirit passed from the gods and the history of its own land to the subtleties of defining the doctrine of the trinity and the mystical attempts to bring plato into harmony with christ and to reconcile gethsemane and the sermon on the mount with the athenian prison and the discussion in the woods of colonus  the greek spirit slept for wellnigh a thousand years  when it woke again like antaeus it had gathered strength from the earth where it lay like apollo it had lost none of its divinity through its long servitude  in the history of roman thought we nowhere find any of those characteristics of the greek illumination which i have pointed out are the necessary concomitants of the rise of historical criticism the conservative respect for tradition which made the roman people delight in the ritual and formulas of law and is as apparent in their politics as in their religion was fatal to any rise of that spirit of revolt against authority the importance of which as a factor in intellectual progress we have already seen  the whitened tables of the pontifices preserved carefully the records of the eclipses and other atmospherical phenomena and what we call the art of verifying dates was known to them at an early time but there was no spontaneous rise of physical science to suggest by its analogies of law and order a new method of research nor any natural springing up of the questioning spirit of philosophy with its unification of all phenomena and all knowledge at the very time when the whole tide of eastern superstition was sweeping into the heart of the capital the senate banished the greek philosophers from rome  and of the three systems which did at length take some root in the city those of zeno and epicurus were used merely as the rule for the ordering of life while the dogmatic scepticism of carneades by its very principles annihilated the possibility of argument and encouraged a perfect indifference to research  nor were the romans ever fortunate enough like the greeks to have to face the incubus of any dogmatic system of legends and myths the immoralities and absurdities of which might excite a revolutionary outbreak of sceptical criticism  for the roman religion became as it were crystallised and isolated from progress at an early period of its evolution  their gods remained mere abstractions of commonplace virtues or uninteresting personifications of the useful things of life  the old primitive creed was indeed always upheld as a state institution on account of the enormous facilities it offered for cheating in politics but as a spiritual system of belief it was unanimously rejected at a very early period both by the common people and the educated classes for the sensible reason that it was so extremely dull  the former took refuge in the mystic sensualities of the worship of isis the latter in the stoical rules of life  the romans classified their gods carefully in their order of precedence analysed their genealogies in the laborious spirit of modern heraldry fenced them round with a ritual as intricate as their law but never quite cared enough about them to believe in them  so it was of no account with them when the philosophers announced that minerva was merely memory  she had never been much else  nor did they protest when lucretius dared to say of ceres and of liber that they were only the corn of the field and the fruit of the vine  for they had never mourned for the daughter of demeter in the asphodel meadows of sicily nor traversed the glades of cithaeron with fawnskin and with spear  this brief sketch of the condition of roman thought will serve to prepare us for the almost total want of scientific historical criticism which we shall discern in their literature and has besides afforded fresh corroboration of the conditions essential to the rise of this spirit and of the modes of thought which it reflects and in which it is always to be found  roman historical composition had its origin in the pontifical college of ecclesiastical lawyers and preserved to its close the uncritical spirit which characterised its fountainhead  it possessed from the outset a most voluminous collection of the materials of history which however produced merely antiquarians not historians  it is so hard to use facts so easy to accumulate them  wearied of the dull monotony of the pontifical annals which dwelt on little else but the rise and fall in provisions and the eclipses of the sun cato wrote out a history with his own hand for the instruction of his child to which he gave the name of origines and before his time some aristocratic families had written histories in greek much in the same spirit in which the germans of the eighteenth century used french as the literary language  but the first regular roman historian is sallust  between the extravagant eulogies passed on this author by the french such as de closset and dr mommsens view of him as merely a political pamphleteer it is perhaps difficult to reach the via media of unbiassed appreciation  he has at any rate the credit of being a purely rationalistic historian perhaps the only one in roman literature  cicero had a good many qualifications for a scientific historian and as he usually did thought very highly of his own powers  on passages of ancient legend however he is rather unsatisfactory for while he is too sensible to believe them he is too patriotic to reject them  and this is really the attitude of livy who claims for early roman legend a certain uncritical homage from the rest of the subject world  his view in his history is that it is not worth while to examine the truth of these stories  in his hands the history of rome unrolls before our eyes like some gorgeous tapestry where victory succeeds victory where triumph treads on the heels of triumph and the line of heroes seems never to end  it is not till we pass behind the canvas and see the slight means by which the effect is produced that we apprehend the fact that like most picturesque writers livy is an indifferent critic  as regards his attitude towards the credibility of early roman history he is quite as conscious as we are of its mythical and unsound nature  he will not for instance decide whether the horatii were albans or romans who was the first dictator how many tribunes there were and the like  his method as a rule is merely to mention all the accounts and sometimes to decide in favour of the most probable but usually not to decide at all  no canons of historical criticism will ever discover whether the roman women interviewed the mother of coriolanus of their own accord or at the suggestion of the senate whether remus was killed for jumping over his brothers wall or because they quarrelled about birds whether the ambassadors found cincinnatus ploughing or only mending a hedge  livy suspends his judgment over these important facts and history when questioned on their truth is dumb  if he does select between two historians he chooses the one who is nearer to the facts he describes  but he is no critic only a conscientious writer  it is mere vain waste to dwell on his critical powers for they do not exist  in the case of tacitus imagination has taken the place of history the past lives again in his pages but through no laborious criticism rather through a dramatic and psychological faculty which he specially possessed  in the philosophy of history he has no belief  he can never make up his mind what to believe as regards gods government of the world  there is no method in him and none elsewhere in roman literature  nations may not have missions but they certainly have functions and the function of ancient italy was not merely to give us what is statical in our institutions and rational in our law but to blend into one elemental creed the spiritual aspirations of aryan and of semite  italy was not a pioneer in intellectual progress nor a motive power in the evolution of thought  the owl of the goddess of wisdom traversed over the whole land and found nowhere a restingplace  the dove which is the bird of christ flew straight to the city of rome and the new reign began  it was the fashion of early italian painters to represent in mediaeval costume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of christ and this which was the result of the frank anachronism of all true art may serve to us as an allegory  for it was in vain that the middle ages strove to guard the buried spirit of progress  when the dawn of the greek spirit arose the sepulchre was empty the graveclothes laid aside  humanity had risen from the dead  the study of greek it has been well said implies the birth of criticism comparison and research  at the opening of that education of modern by ancient thought which we call the renaissance it was the words of aristotle which sent columbus sailing to the new world while a fragment of pythagorean astronomy set copernicus thinking on that train of reasoning which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in the universe then it was seen that the only meaning of progress is a return to greek modes of thought  the monkish hymns which obscured the pages of greek manuscripts were blotted out the splendours of a new method were unfolded to the world and out of the melancholy sea of mediaevalism rose the free spirit of man in all that splendour of glad adolescence when the bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality when the eye sees more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what was beforetime hidden from it  to herald the opening of the sixteenth century from the little venetian printing press came forth all the great authors of antiquity each bearing on the titlepage the words greek text which cannot be reproduced words which may serve to remind us with what wondrous prescience polybius saw the worlds fate when he foretold the material sovereignty of roman institutions and exemplified in himself the intellectual empire of greece  the course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism has not been a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now antiquated and of no account  the only spirit which is entirely removed from us is the mediaeval the greek spirit is essentially modern  the introduction of the comparative method of research which has forced history to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us  ours too is a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival  nor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of crucial instances both of which methods have proved of such importance in modern criticism the one adding a most important proof of the statical elements of history and exemplifying the influences of all physical surroundings on the life of man the other as in the single instance of the moulin quignon skull serving to create a whole new science of prehistoric archaeology and to bring us back to a time when man was coeval with the stone age the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros  but except these we have added no new canon or method to the science of historical criticism  across the drear waste of a thousand years the greek and the modern spirit join hands  in the torch race which the greek boys ran from the cerameician field of death to the home of the goddess of wisdom not merely he who first reached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame received a prize  in the lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought let us not forget to render due meed of honour to those who first lit that sacred flame the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps to the faroff divine event of the attainment of perfect truth     the english renaissance of art     among the many debts which we owe to the supreme aesthetic faculty of goethe is that he was the first to teach us to define beauty in terms the most concrete possible to realise it i mean always in its special manifestations  so in the lecture which i have the honour to deliver before you i will not try to give you any abstract definition of beauty  any such universal formula for it as was sought for by the philosophy of the eighteenth century  still less to communicate to you that which in its essence is incommunicable the virtue by which a particular picture or poem affects us with a unique and special joy but rather to point out to you the general ideas which characterise the great english renaissance of art in this century to discover their source as far as that is possible and to estimate their future as far as that is possible  i call it our english renaissance because it is indeed a sort of new birth of the spirit of man like the great italian renaissance of the fifteenth century in its desire for a more gracious and comely way of life its passion for physical beauty its exclusive attention to form its seeking for new subjects for poetry new forms of art new intellectual and imaginative enjoyments  and i call it our romantic movement because it is our most recent expression of beauty  it has been described as a mere revival of greek modes of thought and again as a mere revival of mediaeval feeling  rather i would say that to these forms of the human spirit it has added whatever of artistic value the intricacy and complexity and experience of modern life can give  taking from the one its clearness of vision and its sustained calm from the other its variety of expression and the mystery of its vision  for what as goethe said is the study of the ancients but a return to the real world for that is what they did and what said mazzini is mediaevalism but individuality  it is really from the union of hellenism in its breadth its sanity of purpose its calm possession of beauty with the adventive the intensified individualism the passionate colour of the romantic spirit that springs the art of the nineteenth century in england as from the marriage of faust and helen of troy sprang the beautiful boy euphorion  such expressions as classical and romantic are it is true often apt to become the mere catchwords of schools  we must always remember that art has only one sentence to utter  there is for her only one high law the law of form or harmony  yet between the classical and romantic spirit we may say that there lies this difference at least that the one deals with the type and the other with the exception  in the work produced under the modern romantic spirit it is no longer the permanent the essential truths of life that are treated of it is the momentary situation of the one the momentary aspect of the other that art seeks to render  in sculpture which is the type of one spirit the subject predominates over the situation in painting which is the type of the other the situation predominates over the subject  there are two spirits then  the hellenic spirit and the spirit of romance may be taken as forming the essential elements of our conscious intellectual tradition of our permanent standard of taste  as regards their origin in art as in politics there is but one origin for all revolutions a desire on the part of man for a nobler form of life for a freer method and opportunity of expression  yet i think that in estimating the sensuous and intellectual spirit which presides over our english renaissance any attempt to isolate it in any way from in the progress and movement and social life of the age that has produced it would be to rob it of its true vitality possibly to mistake its true meaning  and in disengaging from the pursuits and passions of this crowded modern world those passions and pursuits which have to do with art and the love of art we must take into account many great events of history which seem to be the most opposed to any such artistic feeling  alien then from any wild political passion or from the harsh voice of a rude people in revolt as our english renaissance must seem in its passionate cult of pure beauty its flawless devotion to form its exclusive and sensitive nature it is to the french revolution that we must look for the most primary factor of its production the first condition of its birth  that great revolution of which we are all the children though the voices of some of us be often loud against it that revolution to which at a time when even such spirits as coleridge and wordsworth lost heart in england noble messages of love blown across seas came from your young republic  it is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history has shown us that neither in politics nor in nature are there revolutions ever but evolutions only and that the prelude to that wild storm which swept over france in 1789 and made every king in europe tremble for his throne was first sounded in literature years before the bastille fell and the palace was taken  the way for those red scenes by seine and loire was paved by that critical spirit of germany and england which accustomed men to bring all things to the test of reason or utility or both while the discontent of the people in the streets of paris was the echo that followed the life of emile and of werther  for rousseau by silent lake and mountain had called humanity back to the golden age that still lies before us and preached a return to nature in passionate eloquence whose music still lingers about our keen northern air and goethe and scott had brought romance back again from the prison she had lain in for so many centuries  and what is romance but humanity  yet in the womb of the revolution itself and in the storm and terror of that wild time tendencies were hidden away that the artistic renaissance bent to her own service when the time came  a scientific tendency first which has borne in our own day a brood of somewhat noisy titans yet in the sphere of poetry has not been unproductive of good  i do not mean merely in its adding to enthusiasm that intellectual basis which in its strength or that more obvious influence about which wordsworth was thinking when he said very nobly that poetry was merely the impassioned expression in the face of science and that when science would put on a form of flesh and blood the poet would lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration  nor do i dwell much on the great cosmical emotion and deep pantheism of science to which shelley has given its first and swinburne its latest glory of song but rather on its influence on the artistic spirit in preserving that close observation and the sense of limitation as well as of clearness of vision which are the characteristics of the real artist  the great and golden rule of art as well as of life wrote william blake is that the more distinct sharp and defined the boundary line the more perfect is the work of art and the less keen and sharp the greater is the evidence of weak imitation plagiarism and bungling  great inventors in all ages knew this  michael angelo and albert durer are known by this and by this alone and another time he wrote with all the simple directness of nineteenthcentury prose to generalise is to be an idiot  and this love of definite conception this clearness of vision this artistic sense of limit is the characteristic of all great work and poetry of the vision of homer as of the vision of dante of keats and william morris as of chaucer and theocritus  it lies at the base of all noble realistic and romantic work as opposed to the colourless and empty abstractions of our own eighteenthcentury poets and of the classical dramatists of france or of the vague spiritualities of the german sentimental school  opposed too to that spirit of transcendentalism which also was root and flower itself of the great revolution underlying the impassioned contemplation of wordsworth and giving wings and fire to the eagle like flight of shelley and which in the sphere of philosophy though displaced by the materialism and positiveness of our day bequeathed two great schools of thought the school of newman to oxford the school of emerson to america  yet is this spirit of transcendentalism alien to the spirit of art  for the artist can accept no sphere of life in exchange for life itself  for him there is no escape from the bondage of the earth  there is not even the desire of escape  he is indeed the only true realist  symbolism which is the essence of the transcendental spirit is alien to him  the metaphysical mind of asia will create for itself the monstrous manybreasted idol of ephesus but to the greek pure artist that work is most instinct with spiritual life which conforms most clearly to the perfect facts of physical life  the storm of revolution as andre chenier said blows out the torch of poetry  it is not for some little time that the real influence of such a wild cataclysm of things is felt  at first the desire for equality seems to have produced personalities of more giant and titan stature than the world had ever known before  men heard the lyre of byron and the legions of napoleon it was a period of measureless passions and of measureless despair ambition discontent were the chords of life and art the age was an age of revolt  a phase through which the human spirit must pass but one in which it cannot rest  for the aim of culture is not rebellion but peace the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash by night being no dwellingplace meet for her to whom the gods have assigned the fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear untroubled air  and soon that desire for perfection which lay at the base of the revolution found in a young english poet its most complete and flawless realisation  phidias and the achievements of greek art are foreshadowed in homer  dante prefigures for us the passion and colour and intensity of italian painting  the modern love of landscape dates from rousseau and it is in keats that one discerns the beginning of the artistic renaissance of england  byron was a rebel and shelley a dreamer but in the calmness and clearness of his vision his perfect selfcontrol his unerring sense of beauty and his recognition of a separate realm for the imagination keats was the pure and serene artist the forerunner of the preraphaelite school and so of the great romantic movement of which i am to speak  blake had indeed before him claimed for art a lofty spiritual mission and had striven to raise design to the ideal level of poetry and music but the remoteness of his vision both in painting and poetry and the incompleteness of his technical powers had been adverse to any real influence  it is in keats that the artistic spirit of this century first found its absolute incarnation  and these preraphaelites what were they  if you ask ninetenths of the british public what is the meaning of the word aesthetics they will tell you it is the french for affectation or the german for a dado and if you inquire about the preraphaelites you will hear something about an eccentric lot of young men to whom a sort of divine crookedness and holy awkwardness in drawing were the chief objects of art  to know nothing about their great men is one of the necessary elements of english education  as regards the preraphaelites the story is simple enough  in the year 1847 a number of young men in london poets and painters passionate admirers of keats all of them formed the habit of meeting together for discussions on art the result of such discussions being that the english philistine public was roused suddenly from its ordinary apathy by hearing that there was in its midst a body of young men who had determined to revolutionise english painting and poetry  they called themselves the pre raphaelite brotherhood  in england then as now it was enough for a man to try and produce any serious beautiful work to lose all his rights as a citizen and besides this the preraphaelite brotherhood  among whom the names of dante rossetti holman hunt and millais will be familiar to you  had on their side three things that the english public never forgives  youth power and enthusiasm  satire always as sterile as it in shameful and as impotent as it is insolent paid them that usual homage which mediocrity pays to genius  doing here as always infinite harm to the public blinding them to what is beautiful teaching them that irreverence which is the source of all vileness and narrowness of life but harming the artist not at all rather confirming him in the perfect rightness of his work and ambition  for to disagree with three fourths of the british public on all points is one of the first elements of sanity one of the deepest consolations in all moments of spiritual doubt  as regards the ideas these young men brought to the regeneration of english art we may see at the base of their artistic creations a desire for a deeper spiritual value to be given to art as well as a more decorative value  preraphaelites they called themselves not that they imitated the early italian masters at all but that in their work as opposed to the facile abstractions of raphael they found a stronger realism of imagination a more careful realism of technique a vision at once more fervent and more vivid an individuality more intimate and more intense  for it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the aesthetic demands of its age  there must be also about it if it is to affect us with any permanent delight the impress of a distinct individuality an individuality remote from that of ordinary men and coming near to us only by virtue of a certain newness and wonder in the work and through channels whose very strangeness makes us more ready to give them welcome  la personnalite said one of the greatest of modem french critics voile ce qui nous sauvera  but above all things was it a return to nature  that formula which seems to suit so many and such diverse movements  they would draw and paint nothing but what they saw they would try and imagine things as they really happened  later there came to the old house by blackfriars bridge where this young brotherhood used to meet and work two young men from oxford edward burnejones and william morris  the latter substituting for the simpler realism of the early days a more exquisite spirit of choice a more faultless devotion to beauty a more intense seeking for perfection  a master of all exquisite design and of all spiritual vision  it is of the school of florence rather than of that of venice that he is kinsman feeling that the close imitation of nature is a disturbing element in imaginative art  the visible aspect of modern life disturbs him not rather is it for him to render eternal all that is beautiful in greek italian and celtic legend  to morris we owe poetry whose perfect precision and clearness of word and vision has not been excelled in the literature of our country and by the revival of the decorative arts he has given to our individualised romantic movement the social idea and the social factor also  but the revolution accomplished by this clique of young men with ruskins faultless and fervent eloquence to help them was not one of ideas merely but of execution not one of conceptions but of creations  for the great eras in the history of the development of all the arts have been eras not of increased feeling or enthusiasm in feeling for art but of new technical improvements primarily and specially  the discovery of marble quarries in the purple ravines of pentelicus and on the little lowlying hills of the island of paros gave to the greeks the opportunity for that intensified vitality of action that more sensuous and simple humanism to which the egyptian sculptor working laboriously in the hard porphyry and rosecoloured granite of the desert could not attain the splendour of the venetian school began with the introduction of the new oil medium for painting  the progress in modern music has been due to the invention of new instruments entirely and in no way to an increased consciousness on the part of the musician of any wider social aim  the critic may try and trace the deferred resolutions of beethoven to some sense of the incompleteness of the modern intellectual spirit but the artist would have answered as one of them did afterwards let them pick out the fifths and leave us at peace  and so it is in poetry also  all this love of curious french metres like the ballade the villanelle the rondel all this increased value laid on elaborate alliterations and on curious words and refrains such as you will find in dante rossetti and swinburne is merely the attempt to perfect flute and viol and trumpet through which the spirit of the age and the lips of the poet may blow the music of their many messages  and so it has been with this romantic movement of ours  it is a reaction against the empty conventional workmanship the lax execution of previous poetry and painting showing itself in the work of such men as rossetti and burnejones by a far greater splendour of colour a far more intricate wonder of design than english imaginative art has shown before  in rossettis poetry and the poetry of morris swinburne and tennyson a perfect precision and choice of language a style flawless and fearless a seeking for all sweet and precious melodies and a sustaining consciousness of the musical value of each word are opposed to that value which is merely intellectual  in this respect they are one with the romantic movement of france of which not the least characteristic note was struck by theophile gautiers advice to the young poet to read his dictionary every day as being the only book worth a poets reading  while then the material of workmanship is being thus elaborated and discovered to have in itself incommunicable and eternal qualities of its own qualities entirely satisfying to the poetic sense and not needing for their aesthetic effect any lofty intellectual vision any deep criticism of life or even any passionate human emotion at all the spirit and the method of the poets working  what people call his inspiration  have not escaped the controlling influence of the artistic spirit  not that the imagination has lost its wings but we have accustomed ourselves to count their innumerable pulsations to estimate their limitless strength to govern their ungovernable freedom  to the greeks this problem of the conditions of poetic production and the places occupied by either spontaneity or selfconsciousness in any artistic work had a peculiar fascination  we find it in the mysticism of plato and in the rationalism of aristotle  we find it later in the italian renaissance agitating the minds of such men as leonardo da vinci  schiller tried to adjust the balance between form and feeling and goethe to estimate the position of selfconsciousness in art  wordsworths definition of poetry as emotion remembered in tranquillity may be taken as an analysis of one of the stages through which all imaginative work has to pass and in keatss longing to be able to compose without this fever i quote from one of his letters his desire to substitute for poetic ardour a more thoughtful and quiet power we may discern the most important moment in the evolution of that artistic life  the question made an early and strange appearance in your literature too and i need not remind you how deeply the young poets of the french romantic movement were excited and stirred by edgar allan poes analysis of the workings of his own imagination in the creating of that supreme imaginative work which we know by the name of the raven  in the last century when the intellectual and didactic element had intruded to such an extent into the kingdom which belongs to poetry it was against the claims of the understanding that an artist like goethe had to protest  the more incomprehensible to the understanding a poem is the better for it he said once asserting the complete supremacy of the imagination in poetry as of reason in prose  but in this century it is rather against the claims of the emotional faculties the claims of mere sentiment and feeling that the artist must react  the simple utterance of joy is not poetry any more than a mere personal cry of pain and the real experiences of the artist are always those which do not find their direct expression but are gathered up and absorbed into some artistic form which seems from such real experiences to be the farthest removed and the most alien  the heart contains passion but the imagination alone contains poetry says charles baudelaire  this too was the lesson that theophile gautier most subtle of all modern critics most fascinating of all modern poets was never tired of teaching  everybody is affected by a sunrise or a sunset  the absolute distinction of the artist is not his capacity to feel nature so much as his power of rendering it  the entire subordination of all intellectual and emotional faculties to the vital and informing poetic principle is the surest sign of the strength of our renaissance  we have seen the artistic spirit working first in the delightful and technical sphere of language the sphere of expression as opposed to subject then controlling the imagination of the poet in dealing with his subject  and now i would point out to you its operation in the choice of subject  the recognition of a separate realm for the artist a consciousness of the absolute difference between the world of art and the world of real fact between classic grace and absolute reality forms not merely the essential element of any aesthetic charm but is the characteristic of all great imaginative work and of all great eras of artistic creation  of the age of phidias as of the age of michael angelo of the age of sophocles as of the age of goethe  art never harms itself by keeping aloof from the social problems of the day  rather by so doing it more completely realises for us that which we desire  for to most of us the real life is the life we do not lead and thus remaining more true to the essence of its own perfection more jealous of its own unattainable beauty is less likely to forget form in feeling or to accept the passion of creation as any substitute for the beauty of the created thing  the artist is indeed the child of his own age but the present will not be to him a whit more real than the past for like the philosopher of the platonic vision the poet is the spectator of all time and of all existence  for him no form is obsolete no subject out of date rather whatever of life and passion the world has known in desert of judaea or in arcadian valley by the rivers of troy or the rivers of damascus in the crowded and hideous streets of a modern city or by the pleasant ways of camelot  all lies before him like an open scroll all is still instinct with beautiful life  he will take of it what is salutary for his own spirit no more choosing some facts and rejecting others with the calm artistic control of one who is in possession of the secret of beauty  there is indeed a poetical attitude to be adopted towards all things but all things are not fit subjects for poetry  into the secure and sacred house of beauty the true artist will admit nothing that is harsh or disturbing nothing that gives pain nothing that is debatable nothing about which men argue  he can steep himself if he wishes in the discussion of all the social problems of his day poorlaws and local taxation free trade and bimetallic currency and the like but when he writes on these subjects it will be as milton nobly expressed it with his left hand in prose and not in verse in a pamphlet and not in a lyric this exquisite spirit of artistic choice was not in byron wordsworth had it not  in the work of both these men there is much that we have to reject much that does not give us that sense of calm and perfect repose which should be the effect of all fine imaginative work  but in keats it seemed to have been incarnate and in his lovely ode on a grecian urn it found its most secure and faultless expression in the pageant of the earthly paradise and the knights and ladies of burnejones it is the one dominant note  it is to no avail that the muse of poetry be called even by such a clarion note as whitmans to migrate from greece and ionia and to placard removed and to let on the rocks of the snowy parnassus calliopes call is not yet closed nor are the epics of asia ended the sphinx is not yet silent nor the fountain of castaly dry  for art is very life itself and knows nothing of death she is absolute truth and takes no care of fact she sees as i remember mr swinburne insisting on at dinner that achilles is even now more actual and real than wellington not merely more noble and interesting as a type and figure but more positive and real  literature must rest always on a principle and temporal considerations are no principle at all  for to the poet all times and places are one the stuff he deals with is eternal and eternally the same  no theme is inept no past or present preferable  the steam whistle will not affright him nor the flutes of arcadia weary him  for him there is but one time the artistic moment but one law the law of form but one land the land of beauty  a land removed indeed from the real world and yet more sensuous because more enduring calm yet with that calm which dwells in the faces of the greek statues the calm which comes not from the rejection but from the absorption of passion the calm which despair and sorrow cannot disturb but intensify only  and so it comes that he who seems to stand most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best because he has stripped life of what is accidental and transitory stripped it of that mist of familiarity which makes life obscure to us  those strange wildeyed sibyls fixed eternally in the whirlwind of ecstasy those mightylimbed and titan prophets labouring with the secret of the earth and the burden of mystery that guard and glorify the chapel of pope sixtus at rome  do they not tell us more of the real spirit of the italian renaissance of the dream of savonarola and of the sin of borgia than all the brawling boors and cooking women of dutch art can teach us of the real spirit of the history of holland  and so in our own day also the two most vital tendencies of the nineteenth century  the democratic and pantheistic tendency and the tendency to value life for the sake of art  found their most complete and perfect utterance in the poetry of shelley and keats who to the blind eyes of their own time seemed to be as wanderers in the wilderness preachers of vague or unreal things  and i remember once in talking to mr burnejones about modern science his saying to me the more materialistic science becomes the more angels shall i paint  their wings are my protest in favour of the immortality of the soul  but these are the intellectual speculations that underlie art where in the arts themselves are we to find that breadth of human sympathy which is the condition of all noble work where in the arts are we to look for what mazzini would call the social ideas as opposed to the merely personal ideas  by virtue of what claim do i demand for the artist the love and loyalty of the men and women of the world  i think i can answer that  whatever spiritual message an artist brings to his aid is a matter for his own soul  he may bring judgment like michael angelo or peace like angelico he may come with mourning like the great athenian or with mirth like the singer of sicily nor is it for us to do aught but accept his teaching knowing that we cannot smite the bitter lips of leopardi into laughter or burden with our discontent goethes serene calm  but for warrant of its truth such message must have the flame of eloquence in the lips that speak it splendour and glory in the vision that is its witness being justified by one thing only  the flawless beauty and perfect form of its expression  this indeed being the social idea being the meaning of joy in art  not laughter where none should laugh nor the calling of peace where there is no peace not in painting the subject ever but the pictorial charm only the wonder of its colour the satisfying beauty of its design  you have most of you seen probably that great masterpiece of rubens which hangs in the gallery of brussels that swift and wonderful pageant of horse and rider arrested in its most exquisite and fiery moment when the winds are caught in crimson banner and the air lit by the gleam of armour and the flash of plume  well that is joy in art though that golden hillside be trodden by the wounded feet of christ and it is for the death of the son of man that that gorgeous cavalcade is passing  but this restless modern intellectual spirit of ours is not receptive enough of the sensuous element of art and so the real influence of the arts is hidden from many of us  only a few escaping from the tyranny of the soul have learned the secret of those high hours when thought is not  and this indeed is the reason of the influence which eastern art is having on us in europe and of the fascination of all japanese work  while the western world has been laying on art the intolerable burden of its own intellectual doubts and the spiritual tragedy of its own sorrows the east has always kept true to arts primary and pictorial conditions  in judging of a beautiful statue the aesthetic faculty is absolutely and completely gratified by the splendid curves of those marble lips that are dumb to our complaint the noble modelling of those limbs that are powerless to help us  in its primary aspect a painting has no more spiritual message or meaning than an exquisite fragment of venetian glass or a blue tile from the wall of damascus  it is a beautifully coloured surface nothing more  the channels by which all noble imaginative work in painting should touch and do touch the soul are not those of the truths of life nor metaphysical truths  but that pictorial charm which does not depend on any literary reminiscence for its effect on the one hand nor is yet a mere result of communicable technical skill on the other comes of a certain inventive and creative handling of colour  nearly always in dutch painting and often in the works of giorgione or titian it is entirely independent of anything definitely poetical in the subject a kind of form and choice in workmanship which is itself entirely satisfying and is as the greeks would say an end in itself  and so in poetry too the real poetical quality the joy of poetry comes never from the subject but from an inventive handling of rhythmical language from what keats called the sensuous life of verse  the element of song in the singing accompanied by the profound joy of motion is so sweet that while the incomplete lives of ordinary men bring no healing power with them the thorn crown of the poet will blossom into roses for our pleasure for our delight his despair will gild its own thorns and his pain like adonis be beautiful in its agony and when the poets heart breaks it will break in music  and health in art  what is that  it has nothing to do with a sane criticism of life  there is more health in baudelaire than there is in kingsley  health is the artists recognition of the limitations of the form in which he works  it is the honour and the homage which he gives to the material he uses  whether it be language with its glories or marble or pigment with their glories  knowing that the true brotherhood of the arts consists not in their borrowing one anothers method but in their producing each of them by its own individual means each of them by keeping its objective limits the same unique artistic delight  the delight is like that given to us by music  for music is the art in which form and matter are always one the art whose subject cannot be separated from the method of its expression the art which most completely realises the artistic ideal and is the condition to which all the other arts are constantly aspiring  and criticism  what place is that to have in our culture  well i think that the first duty of an art critic is to hold his tongue at all times and upon all subjects  cest un grand avantage de navoir rien fait mais il ne faut pas en abuser  it is only through the mystery of creation that one can gain any knowledge of the quality of created things  you have listened to patience for a hundred nights and you have heard me for one only it will make no doubt that satire more piquant by knowing something about the subject of it but you must not judge of aestheticism by the satire of mr gilbert  as little should you judge of the strength and splendour of sun or sea by the dust that dances in the beam or the bubble that breaks on the wave as take your critic for any sane test of art  for the artists like the greek gods are revealed only to one another as emerson says somewhere their real value and place time only can show  in this respect also omnipotence is with the ages  the true critic addresses not the artist ever but the public only  his work lies with them  art can never have any other claim but her own perfection  it is for the critic to create for art the social aim too by teaching the people the spirit in which they are to approach all artistic work the love they are to give it the lesson they are to draw from it  all these appeals to art to set herself more in harmony with modern progress and civilisation and to make herself the mouthpiece for the voice of humanity these appeals to art to have a mission are appeals which should be made to the public  the art which has fulfilled the conditions of beauty has fulfilled all conditions it is for the critic to teach the people how to find in the calm of such art the highest expression of their own most stormy passions i have no reverence said keats for the public nor for anything in existence but the eternal being the memory of great men and the principle of beauty  such then is the principle which i believe to be guiding and underlying our english renaissance a renaissance manysided and wonderful productive of strong ambitions and lofty personalities yet for all its splendid achievements in poetry and in the decorative arts and in painting for all the increased comeliness and grace of dress and the furniture of houses and the like not complete  for there can be no great sculpture without a beautiful national life and the commercial spirit of england has killed that no great drama without a noble national life and the commercial spirit of england has killed that too  it is not that the flawless serenity of marble cannot bear the burden of the modern intellectual spirit or become instinct with the fire of romantic passion  the tomb of duke lorenzo and the chapel of the medici show us that  but it is that as theophile gautier used to say the visible world is dead le monde visible a disparu  nor is it again that the novel has killed the play as some critics would persuade us  the romantic movement of france shows us that the work of balzac and of hugo grew up side by side together nay more were complementary to each other though neither of them saw it  while all other forms of poetry may flourish in an ignoble age the splendid individualism of the lyrist fed by its own passion and lit by its own power may pass as a pillar of fire as well across the desert as across places that are pleasant  it is none the less glorious though no man follow it  nay by the greater sublimity of its loneliness it may be quickened into loftier utterance and intensified into clearer song  from the mean squalor of the sordid life that limits him the dreamer or the idyllist may soar on poesys viewless wings may traverse with fawnskin and spear the moonlit heights of cithaeron though faun and bassarid dance there no more  like keats he may wander through the oldworld forests of latmos or stand like morris on the galleys deck with the viking when king and galley have long since passed away  but the drama is the meetingplace of art and life it deals as mazzini said not merely with man but with social man with man in his relation to god and to humanity  it is the product of a period of great national united energy it is impossible without a noble public and belongs to such ages as the age of elizabeth in london and of pericles at athens it is part of such lofty moral and spiritual ardour as came to greek after the defeat of the persian fleet and to englishman after the wreck of the armada of spain  shelley felt how incomplete our movement was in this respect and has shown in one great tragedy by what terror and pity he would have purified our age but in spite of the cenci the drama is one of the artistic forms through which the genius of the england of this century seeks in vain to find outlet and expression  he has had no worthy imitators  it is rather perhaps to you that we should turn to complete and perfect this great movement of ours for there is something hellenic in your air and world something that has a quicker breath of the joy and power of elizabeths england about it than our ancient civilisation can give us  for you at least are young no hungry generations tread you down and the past does not weary you with the intolerable burden of its memories nor mock you with the ruins of a beauty the secret of whose creation you have lost that very absence of tradition which mr ruskin thought would rob your rivers of their laughter and your flowers of their light may be rather the source of your freedom and your strength  to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside has been defined by one of your poets as a flawless triumph of art  it is a triumph which you above all nations may be destined to achieve for the voices that have their dwelling in sea and mountain are not the chosen music of liberty only other messages are there in the wonder of windswept height and the majesty of silent deep  messages that if you will but listen to them may yield you the splendour of some new imagination the marvel of some new beauty  i foresee said goethe the dawn of a new literature which all people may claim as their own for all have contributed to its foundation  if then this is so and if the materials for a civilisation as great as that of europe lie all around you what profit you will ask me will all this study of our poets and painters be to you  i might answer that the intellect can be engaged without direct didactic object on an artistic and historical problem that the demand of the intellect is merely to feel itself alive that nothing which has ever interested men or women can cease to be a fit subject for culture  i might remind you of what all europe owes to the sorrow of a single florentine in exile at verona or to the love of petrarch by that little well in southern france nay more how even in this dull materialistic age the simple expression of an old mans simple life passed away from the clamour of great cities amid the lakes and misty hills of cumberland has opened out for england treasures of new joy compared with which the treasures of her luxury are as barren as the sea which she has made her highway and as bitter as the fire which she would make her slave  but i think it will bring you something besides this something that is the knowledge of real strength in art  not that you should imitate the works of these men but their artistic spirit their artistic attitude i think you should absorb that  for in nations as in individuals if the passion for creation be not accompanied by the critical the aesthetic faculty also it will be sure to waste its strength aimlessly failing perhaps in the artistic spirit of choice or in the mistaking of feeling for form or in the following of false ideals  for the various spiritual forms of the imagination have a natural affinity with certain sensuous forms of art  and to discern the qualities of each art to intensify as well its limitations as its powers of expression is one of the aims that culture sets before us  it is not an increased moral sense an increased moral supervision that your literature needs  indeed one should never talk of a moral or an immoral poem  poems are either well written or badly written that is all  and indeed any element of morals or implied reference to a standard of good or evil in art is often a sign of a certain incompleteness of vision often a note of discord in the harmony of an imaginative creation for all good work aims at a purely artistic effect  we must be careful said goethe not to be always looking for culture merely in what is obviously moral  everything that is great promotes civilisation as soon as we are aware of it  but as in your cities so in your literature it is a permanent canon and standard of taste an increased sensibility to beauty if i may say so that is lacking  all noble work is not national merely but universal  the political independence of a nation must not be confused with any intellectual isolation  the spiritual freedom indeed your own generous lives and liberal air will give you  from us you will learn the classical restraint of form  for all great art is delicate art roughness having very little to do with strength and harshness very little to do with power  the artist as mr swinburne says must be perfectly articulate  this limitation is for the artist perfect freedom  it is at once the origin and the sign of his strength  so that all the supreme masters of style  dante sophocles shakespeare  are the supreme masters of spiritual and intellectual vision also  love art for its own sake and then all things that you need will be added to you  this devotion to beauty and to the creation of beautiful things is the test of all great civilised nations  philosophy may teach us to bear with equanimity the misfortunes of our neighbours and science resolve the moral sense into a secretion of sugar but art is what makes the life of each citizen a sacrament and not a speculation art is what makes the life of the whole race immortal  for beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm  philosophies fall away like sand and creeds follow one another like the withered leaves of autumn but what is beautiful is a joy for all seasons and a possession for all eternity  wars and the clash of armies and the meeting of men in battle by trampled field or leaguered city and the rising of nations there must always be  but i think that art by creating a common intellectual atmosphere between all countries might  if it could not overshadow the world with the silver wings of peace  at least make men such brothers that they would not go out to slay one another for the whim or folly of some king or minister as they do in europe  fraternity would come no more with the hands of cain nor liberty betray freedom with the kiss of anarchy for national hatreds are always strongest where culture is lowest  how could i said goethe when reproached for not writing like korner against the french  how could i to whom barbarism and culture alone are of importance hate a nation which is among the most cultivated of the earth a nation to which i owe a great part of my own cultivation  mighty empires too there must always be as long as personal ambition and the spirit of the age are one but art at least is the only empire which a nations enemies cannot take from her by conquest but which is taken by submission only  the sovereignty of greece and rome is not yet passed away though the gods of the one be dead and the eagles of the other tired  and we in our renaissance are seeking to create a sovereignty that will still be englands when her yellow leopards have grown weary of wars and the rose of her shield is crimsoned no more with the blood of battle and you too absorbing into the generous heart of a great people this pervading artistic spirit will create for yourselves such riches as you have never yet created though your land be a network of railways and your cities the harbours for the galleys of the world  i know indeed that the divine natural prescience of beauty which is the inalienable inheritance of greek and italian is not our inheritance  for such an informing and presiding spirit of art to shield us from all harsh and alien influences we of the northern races must turn rather to that strained selfconsciousness of our age which as it is the keynote of all our romantic art must be the source of all or nearly all our culture  i mean that intellectual curiosity of the nineteenth century which is always looking for the secret of the life that still lingers round old and bygone forms of culture  it takes from each what is serviceable for the modern spirit  from athens its wonder without its worship from venice its splendour without its sin  the same spirit is always analysing its own strength and its own weakness counting what it owes to east and to west to the olivetrees of colonus and to the palmtrees of lebanon to gethsemane and to the garden of proserpine  and yet the truths of art cannot be taught  they are revealed only revealed to natures which have made themselves receptive of all beautiful impressions by the study and worship of all beautiful things  and hence the enormous importance given to the decorative arts in our english renaissance hence all that marvel of design that comes from the hand of edward burnejones all that weaving of tapestry and staining of glass that beautiful working in clay and metal and wood which we owe to william morris the greatest handicraftsman we have had in england since the fourteenth century  so in years to come there will be nothing in any mans house which has not given delight to its maker and does not give delight to its user  the children like the children of platos perfect city will grow up in a simple atmosphere of all fair things  i quote from the passage in the republic  a simple atmosphere of all fair things where beauty which is the spirit of art will come on eye and ear like a fresh breath of wind that brings health from a clear upland and insensibly and gradually draw the childs soul into harmony with all knowledge and all wisdom so that he will love what is beautiful and good and hate what is evil and ugly for they always go together long before he knows the reason why and then when reason comes will kiss her on the cheek as a friend  that is what plato thought decorative art could do for a nation feeling that the secret not of philosophy merely but of all gracious existence might be externally hidden from any one whose youth had been passed in uncomely and vulgar surroundings and that the beauty of form and colour even as he says in the meanest vessels of the house will find its way into the inmost places of the soul and lead the boy naturally to look for that divine harmony of spiritual life of which art was to him the material symbol and warrant  prelude indeed to all knowledge and all wisdom will this love of beautiful things be for us yet there are times when wisdom becomes a burden and knowledge is one with sorrow  for as every body has its shadow so every soul has its scepticism  in such dread moments of discord and despair where should we of this torn and troubled age turn our steps if not to that secure house of beauty where there is always a little forgetfulness always a great joy to that citte divina as the old italian heresy called it the divine city where one can stand though only for a brief moment apart from the division and terror of the world and the choice of the world too  this is that consolation des arts which is the keynote of gautiers poetry the secret of modern life foreshadowed  as indeed what in our century is not  by goethe  you remember what he said to the german people  only have the courage he said to give yourselves up to your impressions allow yourselves to be delighted moved elevated nay instructed inspired for something great  the courage to give yourselves up to your impressions yes that is the secret of the artistic life  for while art has been defined as an escape from the tyranny of the senses it is an escape rather from the tyranny of the soul  but only to those who worship her above all things does she ever reveal her true treasure  else will she be as powerless to aid you as the mutilated venus of the louvre was before the romantic but sceptical nature of heine  and indeed i think it would be impossible to overrate the gain that might follow if we had about us only what gave pleasure to the maker of it and gives pleasure to its user that being the simplest of all rules about decoration  one thing at least i think it would do for us  there is no surer test of a great country than how near it stands to its own poets but between the singers of our day and the workers to whom they would sing there seems to be an everwidening and dividing chasm a chasm which slander and mockery cannot traverse but which is spanned by the luminous wings of love  and of such love i think that the abiding presence in our houses of noble imaginative work would be the surest seed and preparation  i do not mean merely as regards that direct literary expression of art by which from the little redandblack cruse of oil or wine a greek boy could learn of the lionlike splendour of achilles of the strength of hector and the beauty of paris and the wonder of helen long before he stood and listened in crowded marketplace or in theatre of marble or by which an italian child of the fifteenth century could know of the chastity of lucrece and the death of camilla from carven doorway and from painted chest  for the good we get from art is not what we learn from it it is what we become through it  its real influence will be in giving the mind that enthusiasm which is the secret of hellenism accustoming it to demand from art all that art can do in rearranging the facts of common life for us  whether it be by giving the most spiritual interpretation of ones own moments of highest passion or the most sensuous expression of those thoughts that are the farthest removed from sense in accustoming it to love the things of the imagination for their own sake and to desire beauty and grace in all things for he who does not love art in all things does not love it at all and he who does not need art in all things does not need it at all  i will not dwell here on what i am sure has delighted you all in our great gothic cathedrals  i mean how the artist of that time handicraftsman himself in stone or glass found the best motives for his art always ready for his hand and always beautiful in the daily work of the artificers he saw around him  as in those lovely windows of chartres  where the dyer dips in the vat and the potter sits at the wheel and the weaver stands at the loom  real manufacturers these workers with the hand and entirely delightful to look at not like the smug and vapid shopman of our time who knows nothing of the web or vase he sells except that he is charging you double its value and thinking you a fool for buying it  nor can i but just note in passing the immense influence the decorative work of greece and italy had on its artists the one teaching the sculptor that restraining influence of design which is the glory of the parthenon the other keeping painting always true to its primary pictorial condition of noble colour which is the secret of the school of venice for i wish rather in this lecture at least to dwell on the effect that decorative art has on human life  on its social not its purely artistic effect  there are two kinds of men in the world two great creeds two different forms of natures  men to whom the end of life is action and men to whom the end of life is thought  as regards the latter who seek for experience itself and not for the fruits of experience who must burn always with one of the passions of this fierycoloured world who find life interesting not for its secret but for its situations for its pulsations and not for its purpose the passion for beauty engendered by the decorative arts will be to them more satisfying than any political or religious enthusiasm any enthusiasm for humanity any ecstasy or sorrow for love  for art comes to one professing primarily to give nothing but the highest quality to ones moments and for those moments sake  so far for those to whom the end of life is thought  as regards the others who hold that life is inseparable from labour to them should this movement be specially dear  for if our days are barren without industry industry without art is barbarism  hewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeed among us  our modern machinery has not much lightened the labour of man after all  but at least let the pitcher that stands by the well be beautiful and surely the labour of the day will be lightened  let the wood be made receptive of some lovely form some gracious design and there will come no longer discontent but joy to the toiler  for what is decoration but the workers expression of joy in his work  and not joy merely  that is a great thing yet not enough  but that opportunity of expressing his own individuality which as it is the essence of all life is the source of all art  i have tried i remember william morris saying to me once i have tried to make each of my workers an artist and when i say an artist i mean a man  for the worker then handicraftsman of whatever kind he is art is no longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over the whitened body of a leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his luxury but rather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that has in it something beautiful and noble  and so you must seek out your workman and give him as far as possible the right surroundings for remember that the real test and virtue of a workman is not his earnestness nor his industry even but his power of design merely and that design is not the offspring of idle fancy  it is the studied result of accumulative observation and delightful habit  all the teaching in the world is of no avail if you do not surround your workman with happy influences and with beautiful things  it is impossible for him to have right ideas about colour unless he sees the lovely colours of nature unspoiled impossible for him to supply beautiful incident and action unless he sees beautiful incident and action in the world about him  for to cultivate sympathy you must be among living things and thinking about them and to cultivate admiration you must be among beautiful things and looking at them  the steel of toledo and the silk of genoa did but give strength to oppression and lustre to pride as mr ruskin says let it be for you to create an art that is made by the hands of the people for the joy of the people to please the hearts of the people too an art that will be your expression of your delight in life  there is nothing in common life too mean in common things too trivial to be ennobled by your touch nothing in life that art cannot sanctify  you have heard i think a few of you of two flowers connected with the aesthetic movement in england and said i assure you erroneously to be the food of some aesthetic young men  well let me tell you that the reason we love the lily and the sunflower in spite of what mr gilbert may tell you is not for any vegetable fashion at all  it is because these two lovely flowers are in england the two most perfect models of design the most naturally adapted for decorative art  the gaudy leonine beauty of the one and the precious loveliness of the other giving to the artist the most entire and perfect joy  and so with you  let there be no flower in your meadows that does not wreathe its tendrils around your pillows no little leaf in your titan forests that does not lend its form to design no curving spray of wild rose or brier that does not live for ever in carven arch or window or marble no bird in your air that is not giving the iridescent wonder of its colour the exquisite curves of its wings in flight to make more precious the preciousness of simple adornment  we spend our days each one of us in looking for the secret of life  well the secret of life is in art     house decoration     in my last lecture i gave you something of the history of art in england  i sought to trace the influence of the french revolution upon its development  i said something of the song of keats and the school of the preraphaelites  but i do not want to shelter the movement which i have called the english renaissance under any palladium however noble or any name however revered  the roots of it have indeed to be sought for in things that have long passed away and not as some suppose in the fancy of a few young men  although i am not altogether sure that there is anything much better than the fancy of a few young men  when i appeared before you on a previous occasion i had seen nothing of american art save the doric columns and corinthian chimneypots visible on your broadway and fifth avenue  since then i have been through your country to some fifty or sixty different cities i think  i find that what your people need is not so much high imaginative art but that which hallows the vessels of everyday use  i suppose that the poet will sing and the artist will paint regardless whether the world praises or blames  he has his own world and is independent of his fellowmen  but the handicraftsman is dependent on your pleasure and opinion  he needs your encouragement and he must have beautiful surroundings  your people love art but do not sufficiently honour the handicraftsman of course those millionaires who can pillage europe for their pleasure need have no care to encourage such but i speak for those whose desire for beautiful things is larger than their means  i find that one great trouble all over is that your workmen are not given to noble designs  you cannot be indifferent to this because art is not something which you can take or leave  it is a necessity of human life  and what is the meaning of this beautiful decoration which we call art  in the first place it means value to the workman and it means the pleasure which he must necessarily take in making a beautiful thing  the mark of all good art is not that the thing done is done exactly or finely for machinery may do as much but that it is worked out with the head and the workmans heart  i cannot impress the point too frequently that beautiful and rational designs are necessary in all work  i did not imagine until i went into some of your simpler cities that there was so much bad work done  i found where i went bad wallpapers horribly designed and coloured carpets and that old offender the horsehair sofa whose stolid look of indifference is always so depressing  i found meaningless chandeliers and machinemade furniture generally of rosewood which creaked dismally under the weight of the ubiquitous interviewer  i came across the small iron stove which they always persist in decorating with machinemade ornaments and which is as great a bore as a wet day or any other particularly dreadful institution  when unusual extravagance was indulged in it was garnished with two funeral urns  it must always be remembered that what is well and carefully made by an honest workman after a rational design increases in beauty and value as the years go on  the old furniture brought over by the pilgrims two hundred years ago which i saw in new england is just as good and as beautiful today as it was when it first came here  now what you must do is to bring artists and handicraftsmen together  handicraftsmen cannot live certainly cannot thrive without such companionship  separate these two and you rob art of all spiritual motive  having done this you must place your workman in the midst of beautiful surroundings  the artist is not dependent on the visible and the tangible  he has his visions and his dreams to feed on but the workman must see lovely forms as he goes to his work in the morning and returns at eventide  and in connection with this i want to assure you that noble and beautiful designs are never the result of idle fancy or purposeless daydreaming  they come only as the accumulation of habits of long and delightful observation and yet such things may not be taught  right ideas concerning them can certainly be obtained only by those who have been accustomed to rooms that are beautiful and colours that are satisfying  perhaps one of the most difficult things for us to do is to choose a notable and joyous dress for men  there would be more joy in life if we were to accustom ourselves to use all the beautiful colours we can in fashioning our own clothes  the dress of the future i think will use drapery to a great extent and will abound with joyous colour  at present we have lost all nobility of dress and in doing so have almost annihilated the modern sculptor and in looking around at the figures which adorn our parks one could almost wish that we had completely killed the noble art  to see the frockcoat of the drawingroom done in bronze or the double waistcoat perpetuated in marble adds a new horror to death but indeed in looking through the history of costume seeking an answer to the questions we have propounded there is little that is either beautiful or appropriate  one of the earliest forms is the greek drapery which is exquisite for young girls  and then i think we may be pardoned a little enthusiasm over the dress of the time of charles i so beautiful indeed that in spite of its invention being with the cavaliers it was copied by the puritans and the dress for the children of that time must not be passed over  it was a very golden age of the little ones  i do not think that they have ever looked so lovely as they do in the pictures of that time  the dress of the last century in england is also peculiarly gracious and graceful  there is nothing bizarre or strange about it but it is full of harmony and beauty  in these days when we have suffered dreadfully from the incursions of the modern milliner we hear ladies boast that they do not wear a dress more than once  in the old days when the dresses were decorated with beautiful designs and worked with exquisite embroidery ladies rather took a pride in bringing out the garment and wearing it many times and handing it down to their daughters  a process that would i think be quite appreciated by a modern husband when called upon to settle his wifes bills  and how shall men dress  men say that they do not particularly care how they dress and that it is little matter  i am bound to reply that i do not think that you do  in all my journeys through the country the only welldressed men that i saw  and in saying this i earnestly deprecate the polished indignation of your fifth avenue dandies  were the western miners  their widebrimmed hats which shaded their faces from the sun and protected them from the rain and the cloak which is by far the most beautiful piece of drapery ever invented may well be dwelt on with admiration  their high boots too were sensible and practical  they wore only what was comfortable and therefore beautiful  as i looked at them i could not help thinking with regret of the time when these picturesque miners would have made their fortunes and would go east to assume again all the abominations of modern fashionable attire indeed so concerned was i that i made some of them promise that when they again appeared in the more crowded scenes of eastern civilisation they would still continue to wear their lovely costume  but i do not believe they will  now what america wants today is a school of rational art  bad art is a great deal worse than no art at all  you must show your workmen specimens of good work so that they come to know what is simple and true and beautiful  to that end i would have you have a museum attached to these schools  not one of those dreadful modern institutions where there is a stuffed and very dusty giraffe and a case or two of fossils but a place where there are gathered examples of art decoration from various periods and countries such a place is the south kensington museum in london whereon we build greater hopes for the future than on any other one thing there i go every saturday night when the museum is open later than usual to see the handicraftsman the woodworker the glassblower and the worker in metals  and it is here that the man of refinement and culture comes face to face with the workman who ministers to his joy  he comes to know more of the nobility of the workman and the workman feeling the appreciation comes to know more of the nobility of his work  you have too many white walls  more colour is wanted  you should have such men as whistler among you to teach you the beauty and joy of colour  take mr whistlers symphony in white which you no doubt have imagined to be something quite bizarre  it is nothing of the sort  think of a cool grey sky flecked here and there with white clouds a grey ocean and three wonderfully beautiful figures robed in white leaning over the water and dropping white flowers from their fingers  here is no extensive intellectual scheme to trouble you and no metaphysics of which we have had quite enough in art  but if the simple and unaided colour strike the right keynote the whole conception is made clear  i regard mr whistlers famous peacock room as the finest thing in colour and art decoration which the world has known since correggio painted that wonderful room in italy where the little children are dancing on the walls  mr whistler finished another room just before i came away  a breakfast room in blue and yellow  the ceiling was a light blue the cabinetwork and the furniture were of a yellow wood the curtains at the windows were white and worked in yellow and when the table was set for breakfast with dainty blue china nothing can be conceived at once so simple and so joyous  the fault which i have observed in most of your rooms is that there is apparent no definite scheme of colour  everything is not attuned to a keynote as it should be  the apartments are crowded with pretty things which have no relation to one another  again your artists must decorate what is more simply useful  in your art schools i found no attempt to decorate such things as the vessels for water  i know of nothing uglier than the ordinary jug or pitcher  a museum could be filled with the different kinds of water vessels which are used in hot countries  yet we continue to submit to the depressing jug with the handle all on one side  i do not see the wisdom of decorating dinnerplates with sunsets and soupplates with moonlight scenes  i do not think it adds anything to the pleasure of the canvasback duck to take it out of such glories  besides we do not want a soupplate whose bottom seems to vanish in the distance  one feels neither safe nor comfortable under such conditions  in fact i did not find in the art schools of the country that the difference was explained between decorative and imaginative art  the conditions of art should be simple  a great deal more depends upon the heart than upon the head  appreciation of art is not secured by any elaborate scheme of learning  art requires a good healthy atmosphere  the motives for art are still around about us as they were round about the ancients  and the subjects are also easily found by the earnest sculptor and the painter  nothing is more picturesque and graceful than a man at work  the artist who goes to the childrens playground watches them at their sport and sees the boy stoop to tie his shoe will find the same themes that engaged the attention of the ancient greeks and such observation and the illustrations which follow will do much to correct that foolish impression that mental and physical beauty are always divorced  to you more than perhaps to any other country has nature been generous in furnishing material for art workers to work in  you have marble quarries where the stone is more beautiful in colour than any the greeks ever had for their beautiful work and yet day after day i am confronted with the great building of some stupid man who has used the beautiful material as if it were not precious almost beyond speech  marble should not be used save by noble workmen  there is nothing which gave me a greater sense of barrenness in travelling through the country than the entire absence of wood carving on your houses  wood carving is the simplest of the decorative arts  in switzerland the little barefooted boy beautifies the porch of his fathers house with examples of skill in this direction  why should not american boys do a great deal more and better than swiss boys  there is nothing to my mind more coarse in conception and more vulgar in execution than modern jewellery  this is something that can easily be corrected  something better should be made out of the beautiful gold which is stored up in your mountain hollows and strewn along your river beds  when i was at leadville and reflected that all the shining silver that i saw coming from the mines would be made into ugly dollars it made me sad  it should be made into something more permanent  the golden gates at florence are as beautiful today as when michael angelo saw them  we should see more of the workman than we do  we should not be content to have the salesman stand between us  the salesman who knows nothing of what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it  and watching the workman will teach that most important lesson  the nobility of all rational workmanship  i said in my last lecture that art would create a new brotherhood among men by furnishing a universal language  i said that under its beneficent influences war might pass away  thinking this what place can i ascribe to art in our education  if children grow up among all fair and lovely things they will grow to love beauty and detest ugliness before they know the reason why  if you go into a house where everything is coarse you find things chipped and broken and unsightly  nobody exercises any care  if everything is dainty and delicate gentleness and refinement of manner are unconsciously acquired  when i was in san francisco i used to visit the chinese quarter frequently  there i used to watch a great hulking chinese workman at his task of digging and used to see him every day drink his tea from a little cup as delicate in texture as the petal of a flower whereas in all the grand hotels of the land where thousands of dollars have been lavished on great gilt mirrors and gaudy columns i have been given my coffee or my chocolate in cups an inch and a quarter thick  i think i have deserved something nicer  the art systems of the past have been devised by philosophers who looked upon human beings as obstructions  they have tried to educate boys minds before they had any  how much better it would be in these early years to teach children to use their hands in the rational service of mankind  i would have a workshop attached to every school and one hour a day given up to the teaching of simple decorative arts  it would be a golden hour to the children  and you would soon raise up a race of handicraftsmen who would transform the face of your country  i have seen only one such school in the united states and this was in philadelphia and was founded by my friend mr leyland  i stopped there yesterday and have brought some of the work here this afternoon to show you here are two disks of beaten brass  the designs on them are beautiful the workmanship is simple and the entire result is satisfactory  the work was done by a little boy twelve years old this is a wooden bowl decorated by a little girl of thirteen  the design is lovely and the colouring delicate and pretty  here you see a piece of beautiful wood carving accomplished by a little boy of nine  in such work as this children learn sincerity in art they learn to abhor the liar in art  the man who paints wood to look like iron or iron to look like stone  it is a practical school of morals  no better way is there to learn to love nature than to understand art  it dignifies every flower of the field and the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wing becomes when transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throw the customary stone  what we want is something spiritual added to life  nothing is so ignoble that art cannot sanctify it     art and the handicraftsman     people often talk as if there was an opposition between what is beautiful and what is useful  there is no opposition to beauty except ugliness  all things are either beautiful or ugly and utility will be always on the side of the beautiful thing because beautiful decoration is always on the side of the beautiful thing because beautiful decoration is always an expression of the use you put a thing to and the value placed on it  no workman will beautifully decorate bad work nor can you possibly get good handicraftsmen or workmen without having beautiful designs  you should be quite sure of that  if you have poor and worthless designs in any craft or trade you will get poor and worthless workmen only but the minute you have noble and beautiful designs then you get men of power and intellect and feeling to work for you  by having good designs you have workmen who work not merely with their hands but with their hearts and heads too otherwise you will get merely the fool or the loafer to work for you  that the beauty of life is a thing of no moment i suppose few people would venture to assert  and yet most civilised people act as if it were of none and in so doing are wronging both themselves and those that are to come after them  for that beauty which is meant by art is no mere accident of human life which people can take or leave but a positive necessity of life if we are to live as nature meant us to that is to say unless we are content to be less than men  do not think that the commercial spirit which is the basis of your life and cities here is opposed to art  who built the beautiful cities of the world but commercial men and commercial men only genoa built by its traders florence by its bankers and venice most lovely of all by its noble and honest merchants  i do not wish you remember to build a new pisa nor to bring the life or the decorations of the thirteenth century back again the circumstances with which you must surround your workmen are those of modern american life because the designs you have now to ask for from your workmen are such as will make modern american life beautiful  the art we want is the art based on all the inventions of modern civilisation and to suit all the needs of nineteenthcentury life  do you think for instance that we object to machinery  i tell you we reverence it we reverence it when it does its proper work when it relieves man from ignoble and soulless labour not when it seeks to do that which is valuable only when wrought by the hands and hearts of men  let us have no machinemade ornament at all it is all bad and worthless and ugly  and let us not mistake the means of civilisation for the end of civilisation steamengine telephone and the like are all wonderful but remember that their value depends entirely on the noble uses we make of them on the noble spirit in which we employ them not on the things themselves  it is no doubt a great advantage to talk to a man at the antipodes through a telephone its advantage depends entirely on the value of what the two men have to say to one another  if one merely shrieks slander through a tube and the other whispers folly into a wire do not think that anybody is very much benefited by the invention  the train that whirls an ordinary englishman through italy at the rate of forty miles an hour and finally sends him home without any memory of that lovely country but that he was cheated by a courier at rome or that he got a bad dinner at verona does not do him or civilisation much good  but that swift legion of fieryfooted engines that bore to the burning ruins of chicago the loving help and generous treasure of the world was as noble and as beautiful as any golden troop of angels that ever fed the hungry and clothed the naked in the antique times  as beautiful yes all machinery may be beautiful when it is undecorated even  do not seek to decorate it  we cannot but think all good machinery is graceful also the line of strength and the line of beauty being one  give then as i said to your workmen of today the bright and noble surroundings that you can yourself create  stately and simple architecture for your cities bright and simple dress for your men and women those are the conditions of a real artistic movement  for the artist is not concerned primarily with any theory of life but with life itself with the joy and loveliness that should come daily on eye and ear for a beautiful external world  but the simplicity must not be barrenness nor the bright colour gaudy  for all beautiful colours are graduated colours the colours that seem about to pass into one anothers realm  colour without tone being like music without harmony mere discord barren architecture the vulgar and glaring advertisements that desecrate not merely your cities but every rock and river that i have seen yet in america  all this is not enough  a school of design we must have too in each city  it should be a stately and noble building full of the best examples of the best art of the world  furthermore do not put your designers in a barren whitewashed room and bid them work in that depressing and colourless atmosphere as i have seen many of the american schools of design but give them beautiful surroundings  because you want to produce a permanent canon and standard of taste in your workman he must have always by him and before him specimens of the best decorative art of the world so that you can say to him  this is good work  greek or italian or japanese wrought it so many years ago but it is eternally young because eternally beautiful  work in this spirit and you will be sure to be right  do not copy it but work with the same love the same reverence the same freedom of imagination  you must teach him colour and design how all beautiful colours are graduated colours and glaring colours the essence of vulgarity  show him the quality of any beautiful work of nature like the rose or any beautiful work of art like an eastern carpet  being merely the exquisite gradation of colour one tone answering another like the answering chords of a symphony teach him how the true designer is not he who makes the design and then colours it but he who designs in colour creates in colour thinks in colour too  show him how the most gorgeous stainedglass windows of europe are filled with white glass and the most gorgeous eastern tapestry with toned colours  the primary colours in both places being set in the white glass and the tone colours like brilliant jewels set in dusky gold  and then as regards design show him how the real designer will take first any given limited space little disk of silver it may be like a greek coin or wide expanse of fretted ceiling or lordly wall as tintoret chose at venice it does not matter which and to this limited space  the first condition of decoration being the limitation of the size of the material used  he will give the effect of its being filled with beautiful decoration filled with it as a golden cup will be filled with wine so complete that you should not be able to take away anything from it or add anything to it  for from a good piece of design you can take away nothing nor can you add anything to it each little bit of design being as absolutely necessary and as vitally important to the whole effect as a note or chord of music is for a sonata of beethoven  but i said the effect of its being so filled because this again is of the essence of good design  with a simple spray of leaves and a bird in flight a japanese artist will give you the impression that he has completely covered with lovely design the reed fan or lacquer cabinet at which he is working merely because he knows the exact spot in which to place them  all good design depends on the texture of the utensil used and the use you wish to put it to  one of the first things i saw in an american school of design was a young lady painting a romantic moonlight landscape on a large round dish and another young lady covering a set of dinner plates with a series of sunsets of the most remarkable colours  let your ladies paint moonlight landscapes and sunsets but do not let them paint them on dinner plates or dishes  let them take canvas or paper for such work but not clay or china  they are merely painting the wrong subjects on the wrong material that is all  they have not been taught that every material and texture has certain qualities of its own  the design suitable for one is quite wrong for the other just as the design which you should work on a flat table cover ought to be quite different from the design you would work on a curtain for the one will always be straight the other broken into folds and the use too one puts the object to should guide one in the choice of design  one does not want to eat ones terrapins off a romantic moonlight nor ones clams off a harrowing sunset glory of sun and moon let them be wrought for us by our landscape artist and be on the walls of the rooms we sit in to remind us of the undying beauty of the sunsets that fade and die but do not let us eat our soup off them and send them down to the kitchen twice a day to be washed and scrubbed by the handmaid  all these things are simple enough yet nearly always forgotten your school of design here will teach your girls and your boys your handicraftsmen of the future for all your schools of art should be local schools the schools of particular cities  we talk of the italian school of painting but there is no italian school there were the schools of each city  every town in italy from venice itself queen of the sea to the little hill fortress of perugia each had its own school of art each different and all beautiful  so do not mind what art philadelphia or new york is having but make by the hands of your own citizens beautiful art for the joy of your own citizens for you have here the primary elements of a great artistic movement  for believe me the conditions of art are much simpler than people imagine  for the noblest art one requires a clear healthy atmosphere not polluted as the air of our english cities is by the smoke and grime and horridness which comes from open furnace and from factory chimney  you must have strong sane healthy physique among your men and women  sickly or idle or melancholy people do not do much in art  and lastly you require a sense of individualism about each man and woman for this is the essence of art  a desire on the part of man to express himself in the noblest way possible  and this is the reason that the grandest art of the world always came from a republic  athens venice and florence  there were no kings there and so their art was as noble and simple as sincere  but if you want to know what kind of art the folly of kings will impose on a country look at the decorative art of france under the grand monarque under louis the fourteenth the gaudy gilt furniture writhing under a sense of its own horror and ugliness with a nymph smirking at every angle and a dragon mouthing on every claw  unreal and monstrous art this and fit only for such periwigged pomposities as the nobility of france at that time but not at all fit for you or me  we do not want the rich to possess more beautiful things but the poor to create more beautiful things for ever man is poor who cannot create  nor shall the art which you and i need be merely a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over the whitened body of some leprous king to adorn or to conceal the sin of his luxury but rather shall it be the noble and beautiful expression of a peoples noble and beautiful life  art shall be again the most glorious of all the chords through which the spirit of a great nation finds its noblest utterance  all around you i said lie the conditions for a great artistic movement for every great art  let us think of one of them a sculptor for instance  if a modern sculptor were to come and say very well but where can one find subjects for sculpture out of men who wear frockcoats and chimneypot hats i would tell him to go to the docks of a great city and watch the men loading or unloading the stately ships working at wheel or windlass hauling at rope or gangway  i have never watched a man do anything useful who has not been graceful at some moment of his labour  it is only the loafer and the idle saunterer who is as useless and uninteresting to the artist as he is to himself  i would ask the sculptor to go with me to any of your schools or universities to the running ground and gymnasium to watch the young men start for a race hurling quoit or club kneeling to tie their shoes before leaping stepping from the boat or bending to the oar and to carve them and when he was weary of cities i would ask him to come to your fields and meadows to watch the reaper with his sickle and the cattledriver with lifted lasso  for if a man cannot find the noblest motives for his art in such simple daily things as a woman drawing water from the well or a man leaning with his scythe he will not find them anywhere at all  gods and goddesses the greek carved because he loved them saint and king the goth because he believed in them but you you do not care much for greek gods and goddesses and you are perfectly and entirely right and you do not think much of kings either and you are quite right  but what you do love are your own men and women your own flowers and fields your own hills and mountains and these are what your art should represent to you  ours has been the first movement which has brought the handicraftsman and the artist together for remember that by separating the one from the other you do ruin to both you rob the one of all spiritual motive and all imaginative joy you isolate the other from all real technical perfection  the two greatest schools of art in the world the sculptor at athens and the school of painting at venice had their origin entirely in a long succession of simple and earnest handicraftsmen  it was the greek potter who taught the sculptor that restraining influence of design which was the glory of the parthenon it was the italian decorator of chests and household goods who kept venetian painting always true to its primary pictorial condition of noble colour  for we should remember that all the arts are fine arts and all the arts decorative arts  the greatest triumph of italian painting was the decoration of a popes chapel in rome and the wall of a room in venice  michael angelo wrought the one and tintoret the dyers son the other  and the little dutch landscape which you put over your sideboard today and between the windows tomorrow is no less a glorious piece of work than the extents of field and forest with which benozzo has made green and beautiful the once melancholy arcade of the campo santo at pisa as ruskin says  do not imitate the works of a nation greek or japanese italian or english but their artistic spirit of design and their artistic attitude today their own world you should absorb but imitate never copy never  unless you can make as beautiful a design in painted china or embroidered screen or beaten brass out of your american turkey as the japanese does out of his grey silverwinged stork you will never do anything  let the greek carve his lions and the goth his dragons  buffalo and wild deer are the animals for you  golden rod and aster and rose and all the flowers that cover your valleys in the spring and your hills in the autumn  let them be the flowers for your art  not merely has nature given you the noblest motives for a new school of decoration but to you above all other countries has she given the utensils to work in  you have quarries of marble richer than pentelicus more varied than paros but do not build a great white square house of marble and think that it is beautiful or that you are using marble nobly if you build in marble you must either carve it into joyous decoration like the lives of dancing children that adorn the marble castles of the loire or fill it with beautiful sculpture frieze and pediment as the greeks did or inlay it with other coloured marbles as they did in venice  otherwise you had better build in simple red brick as your puritan fathers with no pretence and with some beauty  do not treat your marble as if it was ordinary stone and build a house of mere blocks of it  for it is indeed a precious stone this marble of yours and only workmen of nobility of invention and delicacy of hand should be allowed to touch it at all carving it into noble statues or into beautiful decoration or inlaying it with other coloured marbles  for the true colours of architecture are those of natural stone and i would fain see them taken advantage of to the full  every variety is here from pale yellow to purple passing through orange red and brown entirely at your command nearly every kind of green and grey also is attainable and with these and with pure white what harmony might you not achieve  of stained and variegated stone the quantity is unlimited the kinds innumerable  were brighter colours required let glass and gold protected by glass be used in mosaic a kind of work as durable as the solid stone and incapable of losing its lustre by time  and let the painters work be reserved for the shadowed loggia and inner chamber  this is the true and faithful way of building  where this cannot be the device of external colouring may indeed be employed without dishonour  but it must be with the warning reflection that a time will come when such aids will pass away and when the building will be judged in its lifelessness dying the death of the dolphin better the less bright more enduring fabric  the transparent alabasters of san miniato and the mosaics of saint marks are more warmly filled and more brightly touched by every return of morning and evening while the hues of the gothic cathedrals have died like the iris out of the cloud and the temples whose azure and purple once flamed above the grecian promontory stand in their faded whiteness like snows which the sunset has left cold  ruskin seven lamps of architecture ii  i do not know anything so perfectly commonplace in design as most modern jewellery  how easy for you to change that and to produce goldsmiths work that would be a joy to all of us  the gold is ready for you in unexhausted treasure stored up in the mountain hollow or strewn on the river sand and was not given to you merely for barren speculation  there should be some better record of it left in your history than the merchants panic and the ruined home we do not remember often enough how constantly the history of a great nation will live in and by its art  only a few thin wreaths of beaten gold remain to tell us of the stately empire of etruria and while from the streets of florence the noble knight and haughty duke have long since passed away the gates which the simple goldsmith ghiberti made for their pleasure still guard their lovely house of baptism worthy still of the praise of michael angelo who called them worthy to be the gates of paradise  have then your school of design search out your workmen and when you find one who has delicacy of hand and that wonder of invention necessary for goldsmiths work do not leave him to toil in obscurity and dishonour and have a great glaring shop and two great glaring shopboys in it not to take your orders  they never do that but to force you to buy something you do not want at all when you want a thing wrought in gold goblet or shield for the feast necklace or wreath for the women tell him what you like most in decoration flower or wreath bird in flight or hound in the chase image of the woman you love or the friend you honour watch him as he beats out the gold into those thin plates delicate as the petals of a yellow rose or draws it into the long wires like tangled sunbeams at dawn  whoever that workman be help him cherish him and you will have such lovely work from his hand as will be a joy to you for all time  this is the spirit of our movement in england and this is the spirit in which we would wish you to work making eternal by your art all that is noble in your men and women stately in your lakes and mountains beautiful in your own flowers and natural life  we want to see that you have nothing in your houses that has not been a joy to the man who made it and is not a joy to those that use it  we want to see you create an art made by the hands of the people to please the hearts of the people too  do you like this spirit or not  do you think it simple and strong noble in its aim and beautiful in its result  i know you do  folly and slander have their own way for a little time but for a little time only  you now know what we mean  you will be able to estimate what is said of us  its value and its motive  there should be a law that no ordinary newspaper should be allowed to write about art  the harm they do by their foolish and random writing it would be impossible to overestimate  not to the artist but to the public blinding them to all but harming the artist not at all  without them we would judge a man simply by his work but at present the newspapers are trying hard to induce the public to judge a sculptor for instance never by his statues but by the way he treats his wife a painter by the amount of his income and a poet by the colour of his necktie  i said there should be a law but there is really no necessity for a new law  nothing could be easier than to bring the ordinary critic under the head of the criminal classes  but let us leave such an inartistic subject and return to beautiful and comely things remembering that the art which would represent the spirit of modern newspapers would be exactly the art which you and i want to avoid  grotesque art malice mocking you from every gateway slander sneering at you from every corner  perhaps you may be surprised at my talking of labour and the workman  you have heard of me i fear through the medium of your somewhat imaginative newspapers as if not a japanese young man at least a young man to whom the rush and clamour and reality of the modern world were distasteful and whose greatest difficulty in life was the difficulty of living up to the level of his blue china  a paradox from which england has not yet recovered  well let me tell you how it first came to me at all to create an artistic movement in england a movement to show the rich what beautiful things they might enjoy and the poor what beautiful things they might create  one summer afternoon in oxford  that sweet city with her dreaming spires lovely as venice in its splendour noble in its learning as rome down the long high street that winds from tower to tower past silent cloister and stately gateway till it reaches that long grey sevenarched bridge which saint mary used to guard used to i say because they are now pulling it down to build a tramway and a light castiron bridge in its place desecrating the loveliest city in england  well we were coming down the street  a troop of young men some of them like myself only nineteen going to river or tenniscourt or cricketfield  when ruskin going up to lecture in cap and gown met us  he seemed troubled and prayed us to go back with him to his lecture which a few of us did and there he spoke to us not on art this time but on life saying that it seemed to him to be wrong that all the best physique and strength of the young men in england should be spent aimlessly on cricket ground or river without any result at all except that if one rowed well one got a pewterpot and if one made a good score a canehandled bat  he thought he said that we should be working at something that would do good to other people at something by which we might show that in all labour there was something noble well we were a good deal moved and said we would do anything he wished  so he went out round oxford and found two villages upper and lower hinksey and between them there lay a great swamp so that the villagers could not pass from one to the other without many miles of a round  and when we came back in winter he asked us to help him to make a road across this morass for these village people to use  so out we went day after day and learned how to lay levels and to break stones and to wheel barrows along a plank  a very difficult thing to do  and ruskin worked with us in the mist and rain and mud of an oxford winter and our friends and our enemies came out and mocked us from the bank  we did not mind it much then and we did not mind it afterwards at all but worked away for two months at our road  and what became of the road well like a bad lecture it ended abruptly  in the middle of the swamp  ruskin going away to venice when we came back for the next term there was no leader and the diggers as they called us fell asunder  and i felt that if there was enough spirit amongst the young men to go out to such work as roadmaking for the sake of a noble ideal of life i could from them create an artistic movement that might change as it has changed the face of england so i sought them out  leader they would call me  but there was no leader  we were all searchers only and we were bound to each other by noble friendship and by noble art  there was none of us idle poets most of us so ambitious were we  painters some of us or workers in metal or modellers determined that we would try and create for ourselves beautiful work  for the handicraftsman beautiful work for those who love us poems and pictures for those who love us not epigrams and paradoxes and scorn  well we have done something in england and we will do something more  now i do not want you believe me to ask your brilliant young men your beautiful young girls to go out and make a road on a swamp for any village in america but i think you might each of you have some art to practise   we must have as emerson said a mechanical craft for our culture a basis for our higher accomplishments in the work of our hands  the uselessness of most peoples hands seems to me one of the most unpractical things  no separation from labour can be without some loss of power or truth to the seer says emerson again  the heroism which would make on us the impression of epaminondas must be that of a domestic conqueror  the hero of the future is he who shall bravely and gracefully subdue this gorgon of fashion and of convention  when you have chosen your own part abide by it and do not weakly try and reconcile yourself with the world  the heroic cannot be the common nor the common the heroic  congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous age  and lastly let us remember that art is the one thing which death cannot harm  the little house at concord may be desolate but the wisdom of new englands plato is not silenced nor the brilliancy of that attic genius dimmed  the lips of longfellow are still musical for us though his dust be turning into the flowers which he loved and as it is with the greater artists poet and philosopher and songbird so let it be with you     lecture to art students     in the lecture which it is my privilege to deliver before you to night i do not desire to give you any abstract definition of beauty at all  for we who are working in art cannot accept any theory of beauty in exchange for beauty itself and so far from desiring to isolate it in a formula appealing to the intellect we on the contrary seek to materialise it in a form that gives joy to the soul through the senses  we want to create it not to define it the definition should follow the work  the work should not adapt itself to the definition  nothing indeed is more dangerous to the young artist than any conception of ideal beauty  he is constantly led by it either into weak prettiness or lifeless abstraction  whereas to touch the ideal at all you must not strip it of vitality  you must find it in life and recreate it in art  while then on the one hand i do not desire to give you any philosophy of beauty  for what i want tonight is to investigate how we can create art not how we can talk of it  on the other hand i do not wish to deal with anything like a history of english art  to begin with such an expression as english art is a meaningless expression  one might just as well talk of english mathematics art is the science of beauty and mathematics the science of truth there is no national school of either  indeed a national school is a provincial school merely  nor is there any such thing as a school of art even  there are merely artists that is all  and as regards histories of art they are quite valueless to you unless you are seeking the ostentatious oblivion of an art professorship  it is of no use to you to know the date of perugino or the birthplace of salvator rosa  all that you should learn about art is to know a good picture when you see it and a bad picture when you see it  as regards the date of the artist all good work looks perfectly modern  a piece of greek sculpture a portrait of velasquez   they are always modern always of our time  and as regards the nationality of the artist art is not national but universal  as regards archaeology then avoid it altogether  archaeology is merely the science of making excuses for bad art it is the rock on which many a young artist founders and shipwrecks it is the abyss from which no artist old or young ever returns  or if he does return he is so covered with the dust of ages and the mildew of time that he is quite unrecognisable as an artist and has to conceal himself for the rest of his days under the cap of a professor or as a mere illustrator of ancient history  how worthless archaeology is in art you can estimate by the fact of its being so popular popularity is the crown of laurel which the world puts on bad art whatever is popular is wrong  as i am not going to talk to you then about the philosophy of the beautiful or the history of art you will ask me what i am going to talk about  the subject of my lecture tonight is what makes an artist and what does the artist make what are the relations of the artist to his surroundings what is the education the artist should get and what is the quality of a good work of art  now as regards the relations of the artist to his surroundings by which i mean the age and country in which he is born  all good art as i said before has nothing to do with any particular century but this universality is the quality of the work of art the conditions that produce that quality are different  and what i think you should do is to realise completely your age in order completely to abstract yourself from it remembering that if you are an artist at all you will be not the mouthpiece of a century but the master of eternity that all art rests on a principle and that mere temporal considerations are no principle at all and that those who advise you to make your art representative of the nineteenth century are advising you to produce an art which your children when you have them will think oldfashioned  but you will tell me this is an inartistic age and we are an inartistic people and the artist suffers much in this nineteenth century of ours  of course he does  i of all men am not going to deny that  but remember that there never has been an artistic age or an artistic people since the beginning of the world  the artist has always been and will always be an exquisite exception  there is no golden age of art only artists who have produced what is more golden than gold  what you will say to me the greeks were not they an artistic people  well the greeks certainly not but perhaps you mean the athenians the citizens of one out of a thousand cities  do you think that they were an artistic people  take them even at the time of their highest artistic development the latter part of the fifth century before christ when they had the greatest poets and the greatest artists of the antique world when the parthenon rose in loveliness at the bidding of a phidias and the philosopher spake of wisdom in the shadow of the painted portico and tragedy swept in the perfection of pageant and pathos across the marble of the stage  were they an artistic people then  not a bit of it what is an artistic people but a people who love their artists and understand their art  the athenians could do neither  how did they treat phidias  to phidias we owe the great era not merely in greek but in all art  i mean of the introduction of the use of the living model  and what would you say if all the english bishops backed by the english people came down from exeter hall to the royal academy one day and took off sir frederick leighton in a prison van to newgate on the charge of having allowed you to make use of the living model in your designs for sacred pictures  would you not cry out against the barbarism and the puritanism of such an idea  would you not explain to them that the worst way to honour god is to dishonour man who is made in his image and is the work of his hands and that if one wants to paint christ one must take the most christlike person one can find and if one wants to paint the madonna the purest girl one knows  would you not rush off and burn down newgate if necessary and say that such a thing was without parallel in history  without parallel  well that is exactly what the athenians did  in the room of the parthenon marbles in the british museum you will see a marble shield on the wall  on it there are two figures one of a man whose face is half hidden the other of a man with the godlike lineaments of pericles  for having done this for having introduced into a bas relief taken from greek sacred history the image of the great statesman who was ruling athens at the time phidias was flung into prison and there in the common gaol of athens died the supreme artist of the old world  and do you think that this was an exceptional case  the sign of a philistine age is the cry of immorality against art and this cry was raised by the athenian people against every great poet and thinker of their day  aeschylus euripides socrates  it was the same with florence in the thirteenth century  good handicrafts are due to guilds not to the people  the moment the guilds lost their power and the people rushed in beauty and honesty of work died  and so never talk of an artistic people there never has been such a thing  but perhaps you will tell me that the external beauty of the world has almost entirely passed away from us that the artist dwells no longer in the midst of the lovely surroundings which in ages past were the natural inheritance of every one and that art is very difficult in this unlovely town of ours where as you go to your work in the morning or return from it at eventide you have to pass through street after street of the most foolish and stupid architecture that the world has ever seen architecture where every lovely greek form is desecrated and defiled and every lovely gothic form defiled and desecrated reducing threefourths of the london houses to being merely like square boxes of the vilest proportions as gaunt as they are grimy and as poor as they are pretentious  the hall door always of the wrong colour and the windows of the wrong size and where even when wearied of the houses you turn to contemplate the street itself you have nothing to look at but chimneypot hats men with sandwich boards vermilion letterboxes and do that even at the risk of being run over by an emeraldgreen omnibus  is not art difficult you will say to me in such surroundings as these  of course it is difficult but then art was never easy you yourselves would not wish it to be easy and besides nothing is worth doing except what the world says is impossible  still you do not care to be answered merely by a paradox  what are the relations of the artist to the external world and what is the result of the loss of beautiful surroundings to you is one of the most important questions of modern art and there is no point on which mr ruskin so insists as that the decadence of art has come from the decadence of beautiful things and that when the artist cannot feed his eye on beauty beauty goes from his work  i remember in one of his lectures after describing the sordid aspect of a great english city he draws for us a picture of what were the artistic surroundings long ago  think he says in words of perfect and picturesque imagery whose beauty i can but feebly echo think of what was the scene which presented itself in his afternoon walk to a designer of the gothic school of pisa  nino pisano or any of his men 22   on each side of a bright river he saw rise a line of brighter palaces arched and pillared and inlaid with deep red porphyry and with serpentine along the quays before their gates were riding troops of knights noble in face and form dazzling in crest and shield horse and man one labyrinth of quaint colour and gleaming light  the purple and silver and scarlet fringes flowing over the strong limbs and clashing mall like seawaves over rocks at sunset  opening on each side from the river were gardens courts and cloisters long successions of white pillars among wreaths of vine leaping of fountains through buds of pomegranate and orange and still along the gardenpaths and under and through the crimson of the pomegranate shadows moving slowly groups of the fairest women that italy ever saw  fairest because purest and thoughtfullest trained in all high knowledge as in all courteous art  in dance in song in sweet wit in lofty learning in loftier courage in loftiest love  able alike to cheer to enchant or save the souls of men  above all this scenery of perfect human life rose dome and belltower burning with white alabaster and gold  beyond dome and belltower the slopes of mighty hills hoary with olive far in the north above a purple sea of peaks of solemn apennine the clear sharpcloven carrara mountains sent up their steadfast flames of marble summit into amber sky the great sea itself scorching with expanse of light stretching from their feet to the gorgonian isles and over all these ever present near or far  seen through the leaves of vine or imaged with all its march of clouds in the arnos stream or set with its depth of blue close against the golden hair and burning cheek of lady and knight  that untroubled and sacred sky which was to all men in those days of innocent faith indeed the unquestioned abode of spirits as the earth was of men and which opened straight through its gates of cloud and veils of dew into the awfulness of the eternal world  a heaven in which every cloud that passed was literally the chariot of an angel and every ray of its evening and morning streamed from the throne of god  what think you of that for a school of design   and then look at the depressing monotonous appearance of any modern city the sombre dress of men and women the meaningless and barren architecture the colourless and dreadful surroundings without a beautiful national life not sculpture merely but all the arts will die  well as regards the religious feeling of the close of the passage i do not think i need speak about that  religion springs from religious feeling art from artistic feeling  you never get one from the other unless you have the right root you will not get the right flower and if a man sees in a cloud the chariot of an angel he will probably paint it very unlike a cloud  but as regards the general idea of the early part of that lovely bit of prose is it really true that beautiful surroundings are necessary for the artist  i think not i am sure not  indeed to me the most inartistic thing in this age of ours is not the indifference of the public to beautiful things but the indifference of the artist to the things that are called ugly for to the real artist nothing is beautiful or ugly in itself at all  with the facts of the object he has nothing to do but with its appearance only and appearance is a matter of light and shade of masses of position and of value  appearance is in fact a matter of effect merely and it is with the effects of nature that you have to deal not with the real condition of the object  what you as painters have to paint is not things as they are but things as they seem to be not things as they are but things as they are not  no object is so ugly that under certain conditions of light and shade or proximity to other things it will not look beautiful no object is so beautiful that under certain conditions it will not look ugly  i believe that in every twentyfour hours what is beautiful looks ugly and what is ugly looks beautiful once  and the commonplace character of so much of our english painting seems to me due to the fact that so many of our young artists look merely at what we may call readymade beauty whereas you exist as artists not to copy beauty but to create it in your art to wait and watch for it in nature  what would you say of a dramatist who would take nobody but virtuous people as characters in his play  would you not say he was missing half of life  well of the young artist who paints nothing but beautiful things i say he misses one half of the world  do not wait for life to be picturesque but try and see life under picturesque conditions  these conditions you can create for yourself in your studio for they are merely conditions of light in nature you must wait for them watch for them choose them and if you wait and watch come they will  in gower street at night you may see a letterbox that is picturesque  on the thames embankment you may see picturesque policemen  even venice is not always beautiful nor france  to paint what you see is a good rule in art but to see what is worth painting is better  see life under pictorial conditions  it is better to live in a city of changeable weather than in a city of lovely surroundings  now having seen what makes the artist and what the artist makes who is the artist  there is a man living amongst us who unites in himself all the qualities of the noblest art whose work is a joy for all time who is himself a master of all time  that man is mr whistler           but you will say modern dress that is bad  if you cannot paint black cloth you could not have painted silken doublet  ugly dress is better for art  facts of vision not of the object  what is a picture  primarily a picture is a beautifully coloured surface merely with no more spiritual message or meaning for you than an exquisite fragment of venetian glass or a blue tile from the wall of damascus  it is primarily a purely decorative thing a delight to look at  all archaeological pictures that make you say how curious all sentimental pictures that make you say how sad all historical pictures that make you say how interesting all pictures that do not immediately give you such artistic joy as to make you say how beautiful are bad pictures           we never know what an artist is going to do  of course not  the artist is not a specialist  all such divisions as animal painters landscape painters painters of scotch cattle in an english mist painters of english cattle in a scotch mist racehorse painters bullterrier painters all are shallow  if a man is an artist he can paint everything  the object of art is to stir the most divine and remote of the chords which make music in our soul and colour is indeed of itself a mystical presence on things and tone a kind of sentinel  am i pleading then for mere technique  no  as long as there are any signs of technique at all the picture is unfinished  what is finish  a picture is finished when all traces of work and of the means employed to bring about the result have disappeared  in the case of handicraftsmen  the weaver the potter the smith  on their work are the traces of their hand  but it is not so with the painter it is not so with the artist  art should have no sentiment about it but its beauty no technique except what you cannot observe  one should be able to say of a picture not that it is well painted but that it is not painted  what is the difference between absolutely decorative art and a painting  decorative art emphasises its material  imaginative art annihilates it  tapestry shows its threads as part of its beauty a picture annihilates its canvas  it shows nothing of it porcelain emphasises its glaze  watercolours reject the paper  a picture has no meaning but its beauty no message but its joy that is the first truth about art that you must never lose sight of  a picture is a purely decorative thing     london models     professional models are a purely modern invention  to the greeks for instance they were quite unknown  mr mahaffy it is true tells us that pericles used to present peacocks to the great ladies of athenian society in order to induce them to sit to his friend phidias and we know that polygnotus introduced into his picture of the trojan women the face of elpinice the celebrated sister of the great conservative leader of the day but these grandes dames clearly do not come under our category  as for the old masters they undoubtedly made constant studies from their pupils and apprentices and even their religious pictures are full of the portraits of their friends and relations but they do not seem to have had the inestimable advantage of the existence of a class of people whose sole profession is to pose  in fact the model in our sense of the word is the direct creation of academic schools  every country now has its own models except america  in new york and even in boston a good model is so great a rarity that most of the artists are reduced to painting niagara and millionaires  in europe however it is different  here we have plenty of models and of every nationality  the italian models are the best  the natural grace of their attitudes as well as the wonderful picturesqueness of their colouring makes them facile  often too facile  subjects for the painters brush  the french models though not so beautiful as the italian possess a quickness of intellectual sympathy a capacity in fact of understanding the artist which is quite remarkable  they have also a great command over the varieties of facial expression are peculiarly dramatic and can chatter the argot of the atelier as cleverly as the critic of the gil blas  the english models form a class entirely by themselves  they are not so picturesque as the italian nor so clever as the french and they have absolutely no tradition so to speak of their order  now and then some old veteran knocks at the studio door and proposes to sit as ajax defying the lightning or as king lear upon the blasted heath  one of them some time ago called on a popular painter who happening at the moment to require his services engaged him and told him to begin by kneeling down in the attitude of prayer  shall i be biblical or shakespearean sir asked the veteran  well  shakespearean answered the artist wondering by what subtle nuance of expression the model would convey the difference  all right sir said the professor of posing and he solemnly knelt down and began to wink with his left eye  this class however is dying out  as a rule the model nowadays is a pretty girl from about twelve to twentyfive years of age who knows nothing about art cares less and is merely anxious to earn seven or eight shillings a day without much trouble  english models rarely look at a picture and never venture on any aesthetic theories  in fact they realise very completely mr whistlers idea of the function of an art critic for they pass no criticisms at all  they accept all schools of art with the grand catholicity of the auctioneer and sit to a fantastic young impressionist as readily as to a learned and laborious academician  they are neither for the whistlerites nor against them the quarrel between the school of facts and the school of effects touches them not idealistic and naturalistic are words that convey no meaning to their ears they merely desire that the studio shall be warm and the lunch hot for all charming artists give their models lunch  as to what they are asked to do they are equally indifferent  on monday they will don the rags of a beggargirl for mr pumper whose pathetic pictures of modern life draw such tears from the public and on tuesday they will pose in a peplum for mr phoebus who thinks that all really artistic subjects are necessarily bc they career gaily through all centuries and through all costumes and like actors are interesting only when they are not themselves  they are extremely goodnatured and very accommodating  what do you sit for said a young artist to a model who had sent him in her card all models by the way have cards and a small black bag  oh for anything you like sir said the girl landscape if necessary  intellectually it must be acknowledged they are philistines but physically they are perfect  at least some are  though none of them can talk greek many can look greek which to a nineteenth century painter is naturally of great importance  if they are allowed they chatter a great deal but they never say anything their observations are the only banalites heard in bohemia however though they cannot appreciate the artist as artist they are quite ready to appreciate the artist as a man  they are very sensitive to kindness respect and generosity  a beautiful model who had sat for two years to one of our most distinguished english painters got engaged to a street vendor of penny ices  on her marriage the painter sent her a pretty wedding present and received in return a nice letter of thanks with the following remarkable postscript  never eat the green ices  when they are tired a wise artist gives them a rest  then they sit in a chair and read penny dreadfuls till they are roused from the tragedy of literature to take their place again in the tragedy of art  a few of them smoke cigarettes  this however is regarded by the other models as showing a want of seriousness and is not generally approved of  they are engaged by the day and by the halfday  the tariff is a shilling an hour to which great artists usually add an omnibus fare  the two best things about them are their extraordinary prettiness and their extreme respectability as a class they are very well behaved particularly those who sit for the figure a fact which is curious or natural according to the view one takes of human nature  they usually marry well and sometimes they marry the artist  for an artist to marry his model is as fatal as for a gourmet to marry his cook  the one gets no sittings and the other gets no dinners  on the whole the english female models are very naive very natural and very goodhumoured  the virtues which the artist values most in them are prettiness and punctuality  every sensible model consequently keeps a diary of her engagements and dresses neatly  the bad season is of course the summer when the artists are out of town  however of late years some artists have engaged their models to follow them and the wife of one of our most charming painters has often had three or four models under her charge in the country so that the work of her husband and his friends should not be interrupted  in france the models migrate en masse to the little seaport villages or forest hamlets where the painters congregate  the english models however wait patiently in london as a rule till the artists come back  nearly all of them live with their parents and help to support the house  they have every qualification for being immortalised in art except that of beautiful hands  the hands of the english model are nearly always coarse and red  as for the male models there is the veteran whom we have mentioned above  he has all the traditions of the grand style and is rapidly disappearing with the school he represents  an old man who talks about fuseli is of course unendurable and besides patriarchs have ceased to be fashionable subjects  then there is the true academy model  he is usually a man of thirty rarely goodlooking but a perfect miracle of muscles  in fact he is the apotheosis of anatomy and is so conscious of his own splendour that he tells you of his tibia and his thorax as if no one else had anything of the kind  then come the oriental models  the supply of these is limited but there are always about a dozen in london  they are very much sought after as they can remain immobile for hours and generally possess lovely costumes however they have a very poor opinion of english art which they regard as something between a vulgar personality and a commonplace photograph  next we have the italian youth who has come over specially to be a model or takes to it when his organ is out of repair  he is often quite charming with his large melancholy eyes his crisp hair and his slim brown figure  it is true he eats garlic but then he can stand like a faun and couch like a leopard so he is forgiven  he is always full of pretty compliments and has been known to have kind words of encouragement for even our greatest artists  as for the english lad of the same age he never sits at all  apparently he does not regard the career of a model as a serious profession  in any case he is rarely if ever to be got hold of  english boys too are difficult to find  sometimes an exmodel who has a son will curl his hair and wash his face and bring him the round of the studios all soap and shininess the young school dont like him but the older school do and when he appears on the walls of the royal academy he is called the infant samuel  occasionally also an artist catches a couple of gamins in the gutter and asks them to come to his studio  the first time they always appear but after that they dont keep their appointments  they dislike sitting still and have a strong and perhaps natural objection to looking pathetic  besides they are always under the impression that the artist is laughing at them it is a sad fact but there is no doubt that the poor are completely unconscious of their own picturesqueness  those of them who can be induced to sit do so with the idea that the artist is merely a benevolent philanthropist who has chosen an eccentric method of distributing alms to the undeserving  perhaps the school board will teach the london gamin his own artistic value and then they will be better models than they are now  one remarkable privilege belongs to the academy model that of extorting a sovereign from any newly elected associate or ra  they wait at burlington house till the announcement is made and then race to the hapless artists house  the one who arrives first receives the money  they have of late been much troubled at the long distances they have had to run and they look with disfavour on the election of artists who live at hampstead or at bedford park for it is considered a point of honour not to employ the underground railway omnibuses or any artificial means of locomotion  the race is to the swift  besides the professional posers of the studio there are posers of the row the posers at afternoon teas the posers in politics and the circus posers  all four classes are delightful but only the last class is ever really decorative  acrobats and gymnasts can give the young painter infinite suggestions for they bring into their art an element of swiftness of motion and of constant change that the studio model necessarily lacks  what is interesting in these slaves of the ring is that with them beauty is an unconscious result not a conscious aim the result in fact of the mathematical calculation of curves and distances of absolute precision of eye of the scientific knowledge of the equilibrium of forces and of perfect physical training  a good acrobat is always graceful though grace is never his object he is graceful because he does what he has to do in the best way in which it can be done  graceful because he is natural  if an ancient greek were to come to life now which considering the probable severity of his criticisms would be rather trying to our conceit he would be found far oftener at the circus than at the theatre  a good circus is an oasis of hellenism in a world that reads too much to be wise and thinks too much to be beautiful  if it were not for the running ground at eton the towingpath at oxford the thames swimming baths and the yearly circuses humanity would forget the plastic perfection of its own form and degenerate into a race of short sighted professors and spectacled precieuses  not that the circus proprietors are as a rule conscious of their high mission  do they not bore us with the haute ecole and weary us with shakespearean clowns  still at least they give us acrobats and the acrobat is an artist  the mere fact that he never speaks to the audience shows how well he appreciates the great truth that the aim of art is not to reveal personality but to please  the clown may be blatant but the acrobat is always beautiful  he is an interesting combination of the spirit of greek sculpture with the spangles of the modern costumier  he has even had his niche in the novels of our age and if manette salomon be the unmasking of the model les freres zemganno is the apotheosis of the acrobat  as regards the influence of the ordinary model on our english school of painting it cannot be said that it is altogether good it is of course an advantage for the young artist sitting in his studio to be able to isolate a little corner of life as the french say from disturbing surroundings and to study it under certain effects of light and shade  but this very isolation leads often to mere mannerism in the painter and robs him of that broad acceptance of the general facts of life which is the very essence of art  modelpainting in a word while it may be the condition of art is not by any means its aim  it is simply practice not perfection  its use trains the eye and the hand of the painter its abuse produces in his work an effect of mere posing and prettiness  it is the secret of much of the artificiality of modern art this constant posing of pretty people and when art becomes artificial it becomes monotonous  outside the little world of the studio with its draperies and its bricebrac lies the world of life with its infinite its shakespearean variety  we must however distinguish between the two kinds of models those who sit for the figure and those who sit for the costume  the study of the first is always excellent but the costumemodel is becoming rather wearisome in modern pictures  it is really of very little use to dress up a london girl in greek draperies and to paint her as a goddess  the robe may be the robe of athens but the face is usually the face of brompton  now and then it is true one comes across a model whose face is an exquisite anachronism and who looks lovely and natural in the dress of any century but her own  this however is rather rare as a rule models are absolutely de notre siecle and should be painted as such  unfortunately they are not and as a consequence we are shown every year a series of scenes from fancy dress balls which are called historical pictures but are little more than mediocre representations of modern people masquerading in france they are wiser  the french painter uses the model simply for study for the finished picture he goes direct to life  however we must not blame the sitters for the shortcomings of the artists  the english models are a wellbehaved and hardworking class and if they are more interested in artists than in art a large section of the public is in the same condition and most of our modern exhibitions seem to justify its choice     poems in prose     the artist   one evening there came into his soul the desire to fashion an image of the pleasure that abideth for a moment  and he went forth into the world to look for bronze  for he could think only in bronze  but all the bronze of the whole world had disappeared nor anywhere in the whole world was there any bronze to be found save only the bronze of the image of the sorrow that endureth for ever  now this image he had himself and with his own hands fashioned and had set it on the tomb of the one thing he had loved in life on the tomb of the dead thing he had most loved had he set this image of his own fashioning that it might serve as a sign of the love of man that dieth not and a symbol of the sorrow of man that endureth for ever  and in the whole world there was no other bronze save the bronze of this image  and he took the image he had fashioned and set it in a great furnace and gave it to the fire  and out of the bronze of the image of the sorrow that endureth for ever he fashioned an image of the pleasure that abideth for a moment   the doer of good   it was nighttime and he was alone  and he saw afaroff the walls of a round city and went towards the city  and when he came near he heard within the city the tread of the feet of joy and the laughter of the mouth of gladness and the loud noise of many lutes  and he knocked at the gate and certain of the gatekeepers opened to him  and he beheld a house that was of marble and had fair pillars of marble before it  the pillars were hung with garlands and within and without there were torches of cedar  and he entered the house  and when he had passed through the hall of chalcedony and the hall of jasper and reached the long hall of feasting he saw lying on a couch of seapurple one whose hair was crowned with red roses and whose lips were red with wine  and he went behind him and touched him on the shoulder and said to him why do you live like this  and the young man turned round and recognised him and made answer and said but i was a leper once and you healed me  how else should i live  and he passed out of the house and went again into the street  and after a little while he saw one whose face and raiment were painted and whose feet were shod with pearls  and behind her came slowly as a hunter a young man who wore a cloak of two colours now the face of the woman was as the fair face of an idol and the eyes of the young man were bright with lust  and he followed swiftly and touched the hand of the young man and said to him why do you look at this woman and in such wise  and the young man turned round and recognised him and said but i was blind once and you gave me sight  at what else should i look  and he ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the woman and said to her is there no other way in which to walk save the way of sin  and the woman turned round and recognised him and laughed and said but you forgave me my sins and the way is a pleasant way  and he passed out of the city  and when he had passed out of the city he saw seated by the roadside a young man who was weeping  and he went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair and said to him why are you weeping  and the young man looked up and recognised him and made answer but i was dead once and you raised me from the dead  what else should i do but weep   the disciple   when narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a cup of sweet waters into a cup of salt tears and the oreads came weeping through the woodland that they might sing to the pool and give it comfort  and when they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of sweet waters into a cup of salt tears they loosened the green tresses of their hair and cried to the pool and said we do not wonder that you should mourn in this manner for narcissus so beautiful was he  but was narcissus beautiful said the pool  who should know that better than you answered the oreads  us did he ever pass by but you he sought for and would lie on your banks and look down at you and in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own beauty  and the pool answered but i loved narcissus because as he lay on my banks and looked down at me in the mirror of his eyes i saw ever my own beauty mirrored   the master   now when the darkness came over the earth joseph of arimathea having lighted a torch of pinewood passed down from the hill into the valley  for he had business in his own home  and kneeling on the flint stones of the valley of desolation he saw a young man who was naked and weeping  his hair was the colour of honey and his body was as a white flower but he had wounded his body with thorns and on his hair had he set ashes as a crown  and he who had great possessions said to the young man who was naked and weeping i do not wonder that your sorrow is so great for surely he was a just man  and the young man answered it is not for him that i am weeping but for myself  i too have changed water into wine and i have healed the leper and given sight to the blind  i have walked upon the waters and from the dwellers in the tombs i have cast out devils  i have fed the hungry in the desert where there was no food and i have raised the dead from their narrow houses and at my bidding and before a great multitude of people a barren fig tree withered away  all things that this man has done i have done also  and yet they have not crucified me   the house of judgment   and there was silence in the house of judgment and the man came naked before god  and god opened the book of the life of the man  and god said to the man thy life hath been evil and thou hast shown cruelty to those who were in need of succour and to those who lacked help thou hast been bitter and hard of heart  the poor called to thee and thou didst not hearken and thine ears were closed to the cry of my afflicted  the inheritance of the fatherless thou didst take unto thyself and thou didst send the foxes into the vineyard of thy neighbours field  thou didst take the bread of the children and give it to the dogs to eat and my lepers who lived in the marshes and were at peace and praised me thou didst drive forth on to the highways and on mine earth out of which i made thee thou didst spill innocent blood  and the man made answer and said even so did i  and again god opened the book of the life of the man  and god said to the man thy life hath been evil and the beauty i have shown thou hast sought for and the good i have hidden thou didst pass by  the walls of thy chamber were painted with images and from the bed of thine abominations thou didst rise up to the sound of flutes  thou didst build seven altars to the sins i have suffered and didst eat of the thing that may not be eaten and the purple of thy raiment was broidered with the three signs of shame thine idols were neither of gold nor of silver that endure but of flesh that dieth  thou didst stain their hair with perfumes and put pomegranates in their hands  thou didst stain their feet with saffron and spread carpets before them  with antimony thou didst stain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear with myrrh thou didst bow thyself to the ground before them and the thrones of thine idols were set in the sun  thou didst show to the sun thy shame and to the moon thy madness  and the man made answer and said even so did i  and a third time god opened the book of the life of the man  and god said to the man evil hath been thy life and with evil didst thou requite good and with wrongdoing kindness  the hands that fed thee thou didst wound and the breasts that gave thee suck thou didst despise  he who came to thee with water went away thirsting and the outlawed men who hid thee in their tents at night thou didst betray before dawn  thine enemy who spared thee thou didst snare in an ambush and the friend who walked with thee thou didst sell for a price and to those who brought thee love thou didst ever give lust in thy turn  and the man made answer and said even so did i  and god closed the book of the life of the man and said surely i will send thee into hell  even into hell will i send thee  and the man cried out thou canst not  and god said to the man wherefore can i not send thee to hell and for what reason  because in hell have i always lived answered the man  and there was silence in the house of judgment  and after a space god spake and said to the man seeing that i may not send thee into hell surely i will send thee unto heaven even unto heaven will i send thee  and the man cried out thou canst not  and god said to the man wherefore can i not send thee unto heaven and for what reason  because never and in no place have i been able to imagine it answered the man  and there was silence in the house of judgment   the teacher of wisdom   from his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect knowledge of god and even while he was yet but a lad many of the saints as well as certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of his birth had been stirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of his answers  and when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood he kissed them and left them and went out into the world that he might speak to the world about god  for there were at that time many in the world who either knew not god at all or had but an incomplete knowledge of him or worshipped the false gods who dwell in groves and have no care of their worshippers  and he set his face to the sun and journeyed walking without sandals as he had seen the saints walk and carrying at his girdle a leathern wallet and a little waterbottle of burnt clay  and as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that comes from the perfect knowledge of god and he sang praises unto god without ceasing and after a time he reached a strange land in which there were many cities  and he passed through eleven cities  and some of these cities were in valleys and others were by the banks of great rivers and others were set on hills  and in each city he found a disciple who loved him and followed him and a great multitude also of people followed him from each city and the knowledge of god spread in the whole land and many of the rulers were converted and the priests of the temples in which there were idols found that half of their gain was gone and when they beat upon their drums at noon none or but a few came with peacocks and with offerings of flesh as had been the custom of the land before his coming  yet the more the people followed him and the greater the number of his disciples the greater became his sorrow  and he knew not why his sorrow was so great  for he spake ever about god and out of the fulness of that perfect knowledge of god which god had himself given to him  and one evening he passed out of the eleventh city which was a city of armenia and his disciples and a great crowd of people followed after him and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on a rock that was on the mountain and his disciples stood round him and the multitude knelt in the valley  and he bowed his head on his hands and wept and said to his soul why is it that i am full of sorrow and fear and that each of my disciples is an enemy that walks in the noonday  and his soul answered him and said god filled thee with the perfect knowledge of himself and thou hast given this knowledge away to others  the pearl of great price thou hast divided and the vesture without seam thou hast parted asunder  he who giveth away wisdom robbeth himself  he is as one who giveth his treasure to a robber  is not god wiser than thou art  who art thou to give away the secret that god hath told thee  i was rich once and thou hast made me poor once i saw god and now thou hast hidden him from me  and he wept again for he knew that his soul spake truth to him and that he had given to others the perfect knowledge of god and that he was as one clinging to the skirts of god and that his faith was leaving him by reason of the number of those who believed in him  and he said to himself i will talk no more about god  he who giveth away wisdom robbeth himself  and after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and bowed themselves to the ground and said master talk to us about god for thou hast the perfect knowledge of god and no man save thee hath this knowledge  and he answered them and said i will talk to you about all other things that are in heaven and on earth but about god i will not talk to you  neither now nor at any time will i talk to you about god  and they were wroth with him and said to him thou hast led us into the desert that we might hearken to thee  wilt thou send us away hungry and the great multitude that thou hast made to follow thee  and he answered them and said i will not talk to you about god  and the multitude murmured against him and said to him thou hast led us into the desert and hast given us no food to eat  talk to us about god and it will suffice us  but he answered them not a word  for he knew that if he spake to them about god he would give away his treasure  and his disciples went away sadly and the multitude of people returned to their own homes  and many died on the way  and when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon and journeyed for seven moons speaking to no man nor making any answer  and when the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert which is the desert of the great river  and having found a cavern in which a centaur had once dwelt he took it for his place of dwelling and made himself a mat of reeds on which to lie and became a hermit  and every hour the hermit praised god that he had suffered him to keep some knowledge of him and of his wonderful greatness  now one evening as the hermit was seated before the cavern in which he had made his place of dwelling he beheld a young man of evil and beautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with empty hands  every evening with empty hands the young man passed by and every morning he returned with his hands full of purple and pearls  for he was a robber and robbed the caravans of the merchants  and the hermit looked at him and pitied him  but he spake not a word  for he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith  and one morning as the young man returned with his hands full of purple and pearls he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon the sand and said to the hermit  why do you look at me ever in this manner as i pass by  what is it that i see in your eyes  for no man has looked at me before in this manner  and the thing is a thorn and a trouble to me  and the hermit answered him and said what you see in my eyes is pity  pity is what looks out at you from my eyes  and the young man laughed with scorn and cried to the hermit in a bitter voice and said to him i have purple and pearls in my hands and you have but a mat of reeds on which to lie  what pity should you have for me  and for what reason have you this pity  i have pity for you said the hermit because you have no knowledge of god  is this knowledge of god a precious thing asked the young man and he came close to the mouth of the cavern  it is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the world answered the hermit  and have you got it said the young robber and he came closer still  once indeed answered the hermit i possessed the perfect knowledge of god  but in my foolishness i parted with it and divided it amongst others  yet even now is such knowledge as remains to me more precious than purple or pearls  and when the young robber heard this he threw away the purple and the pearls that he was bearing in his hands and drawing a sharp sword of curved steel he said to the hermit give me forthwith this knowledge of god that you possess or i will surely slay you wherefore should i not slay him who has a treasure greater than my treasure  and the hermit spread out his arms and said were it not better for me to go unto the uttermost courts of god and praise him than to live in the world and have no knowledge of him  slay me if that be your desire  but i will not give away my knowledge of god  and the young robber knelt down and besought him but the hermit would not talk to him about god nor give him his treasure and the young robber rose up and said to the hermit be it as you will as for myself i will go to the city of the seven sins that is but three days journey from this place and for my purple they will give me pleasure and for my pearls they will sell me joy  and he took up the purple and the pearls and went swiftly away  and the hermit cried out and followed him and besought him  for the space of three days he followed the young robber on the road and entreated him to return nor to enter into the city of the seven sins  and ever and anon the young robber looked back at the hermit and called to him and said will you give me this knowledge of god which is more precious than purple and pearls  if you will give me that i will not enter the city  and ever did the hermit answer all things that i have i will give thee save that one thing only  for that thing it is not lawful for me to give away  and in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great scarlet gates of the city of the seven sins  and from the city there came the sound of much laughter  and the young robber laughed in answer and sought to knock at the gate  and as he did so the hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of his raiment and said to him  stretch forth your hands and set your arms around my neck and put your ear close to my lips and i will give you what remains to me of the knowledge of god  and the young robber stopped  and when the hermit had given away his knowledge of god he fell upon the ground and wept and a great darkness hid from him the city and the young robber so that he saw them no more  and as he lay there weeping he was ware of one who was standing beside him and he who was standing beside him had feet of brass and hair like fine wool  and he raised the hermit up and said to him  before this time thou hadst the perfect knowledge of god now thou shalt have the perfect love of god  wherefore art thou weeping  and he kissed him    footnotes
