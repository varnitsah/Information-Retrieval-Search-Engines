28329856	cleopatra  by h rider haggard     dedication  my dear mother  i have for a long while hoped to be allowed to dedicate some book of mine to you and now i bring you this work because whatever its shortcomings and whatever judgment may be passed upon it by yourself and others it is yet the one i should wish you to accept  i trust that you will receive from my romance of cleopatra some such pleasure as lightened the labour of its building up and that it may convey to your mind a picture however imperfect of the old and mysterious egypt in whose lost glories you are so deeply interested  your affectionate and dutiful son  h rider haggard  january 21 1889     authors note  the history of the ruin of antony and cleopatra must have struck many students of the records of their age as one of the most inexplicable of tragic tales what malign influence and secret hates were at work continually sapping their prosperity and blinding their judgment why did cleopatra fly at actium and why did antony follow her leaving his fleet and army to destruction an attempt is made in this romance to suggest a possible answer to these and some other questions  the reader is asked to bear in mind however that the story is told not from the modern point of view but as from the broken heart and with the lips of an egyptian patriot of royal blood no mere beastworshipper but a priest instructed in the inmost mysteries who believed firmly in the personal existence of the gods of khem in the possibility of communion with them and in the certainty of immortal life with its rewards and punishments to whom also the bewildering and often gross symbolism of the osirian faith was nothing but a veil woven to obscure secrets of the sanctuary whatever proportion of truth there may have been in their spiritual claims and imaginings if indeed there was any such men as the prince harmachis have been told of in the annals of every great religion and as is shown by the testimony of monumental and sacred inscriptions they were not unknown among the worshippers of the egyptian gods and more especially of isis  unfortunately it is scarcely possible to write a book of this nature and period without introducing a certain amount of illustrative matter for by no other means can the long dead past be made to live again before the readers eyes with all its accessories of faded pomp and forgotten mystery to such students as seek a story only and are not interested in the faith ceremonies or customs of the mother of religion and civilisation ancient egypt it is however respectfully suggested that they should exercise the art of skipping and open this tale at its second book  that version of the death of cleopatra has been preferred which attributes her end to poison according to plutarch its actual manner is very uncertain though popular rumour ascribed it to the bite of an asp she seems however to have carried out her design under the advice of that shadowy personage her physician olympus and it is more than doubtful if he would have resorted to such a fantastic and uncertain method of destroying life  it may be mentioned that so late as the reign of ptolemy epiphanes pretenders of native blood one of whom was named harmachis are known to have advanced their claims to the throne of egypt moreover there was a book of prophecy current among the priesthood which declared that after the nations of the greeks the god harsefi would create the chief who is to come it will therefore be seen that although it lacks historical confirmation the story of the great plot formed to stamp out the dynasty of the macedonian lagidae and place harmachis on the throne is not in itself improbable indeed it is possible that many such plots were entered into by egyptian patriots during the long ages of their countrys bondage but ancient history tells us little of the abortive struggles of a fallen race  the chant of isis and the song of cleopatra which appear in these pages are done into verse from the writers prose by mr andrew lang and the dirge sung by charmion is translated by the same hand from the greek of the syrian meleager      cleopatra     introduction  in the recesses of the desolate libyan mountains that lie behind the temple and city of abydus the supposed burying place of the holy osiris a tomb was recently discovered among the contents of which were the papyrus rolls whereupon this history is written the tomb itself is spacious but otherwise remarkable only for the depth of the shaft which descends vertically from the rockhewn cave that once served as the mortuary chapel for the friends and relatives of the departed to the coffinchamber beneath this shaft is no less than eightynine feet in depth the chamber at its foot was found to contain three coffins only though it is large enough for many more two of these which in all probability inclosed the bodies of the high priest amenemhat and of his wife father and mother of harmachis the hero of this history the shameless arabs who discovered them there and then broke up  the arabs broke the bodies up with unhallowed hands they tore the holy amenemhat and the frame of her who had as it is written been filled with the spirit of the hathorstore them limb from limb searching for treasure amidst their bonesperhaps as is their custom selling the very bones for a few piastres to the last ignorant tourist who came their way seeking what he might destroy for in egypt the unhappy the living find their bread in the tombs of the great men who were before them  but as it chanced some little while afterwards one who is known to this writer and a doctor by profession passed up the nile to abydus and became acquainted with the men who had done this thing they revealed to him the secret of the place telling him that one coffin yet remained entombed it seemed to be the coffin of a poor person they said and therefore being pressed for time they had left it unviolated moved by curiosity to explore the recesses of a tomb as yet unprofaned by tourists my friend bribed the arabs to show it to him what ensued i will give in his own words exactly as he wrote it to me  i slept that night near the temple of seti and started before daybreak on the following morning with me were a crosseyed rascal named aliali baba i named himthe man from whom i got the ring which i am sending you and a small but choice assortment of his fellow thieves within an hour after sunrise we reached the valley where the tomb is it is a desolate place into which the sun pours his scorching heat all the long day through till the huge brown rocks which are strewn about become so hot that one can scarcely bear to touch them and the sand scorches the feet it was already too hot to walk so we rode on donkeys some way up the valleywhere a vulture floating far in the blue overhead was the only other visitortill we came to an enormous boulder polished by centuries of action of sun and sand here ali halted saying that the tomb was under the stone accordingly we dismounted and leaving the donkeys in charge of a fellah boy went up to the rock beneath it was a small hole barely large enough for a man to creep through indeed it had been dug by jackals for the doorway and some part of the cave were entirely silted up and it was by means of this jackal hole that the tomb had been discovered ali crept in on his hands and knees and i followed to find myself in a place cold after the hot outside air and in contrast with the light filled with a dazzling darkness we lit our candles and the select body of thieves having arrived i made an examination we were in a cave the size of a large room and hollowed by hand the further part of the cave being almost free from driftdust on the walls are religious paintings of the usual ptolemaic character and among them one of a majestic old man with a long white beard who is seated in a carved chair holding a wand in his hand before him passes a procession of priests bearing sacred images in the right hand corner of the tomb is the shaft of the mummypit a squaremouthed well cut in the black rock we had brought a beam of thornwood and this was now laid across the pit and a rope made fast to it then aliwho to do him justice is a courageous thieftook hold of the rope and putting some candles into the breast of his robe placed his bare feet against the smooth sides of the well and began to descent with great rapidity very soon he had vanished into blackness and the agitation of the cord alone told us that anything was going on below at last the rope ceased shaking and a faint shout came rumbling up the well announcing alis safe arrival then far below a tiny star of light appeared he had lit the candle thereby disturbing hundreds of bats that flitted up in an endless stream and as silently as spirits the rope was hauled up again and now it was my turn but as i declined to trust my neck to the handoverhand method of descent the end of the cord was made fast round my middle and i was lowered bodily into those sacred depths nor was it a pleasant journey for if the masters of the situation above had made any mistake i should have been dashed to pieces also the bats continually flew into my face and clung to my hair and i have a great dislike of bats at last after some minutes of jerking and dangling i found myself standing in a narrow passage by the side of the worthy ali covered with bats and perspiration and with the skin rubbed off my knees and knuckles then another man came down hand over hand like a sailor and as the rest were told to stop above we were ready to go on ali went first with his candleof course we each had a candleleading the way down a long passage about five feet high at length the passage widened out and we were in the tombchamber i think the hottest and most silent place that i ever entered it was simply stifling this chamber is a square room cut in the rock and totally devoid of paintings or sculpture i held up the candles and looked round about the place were strewn the coffin lids and the mummied remains of the two bodies that the arabs had previously violated the paintings on the former were i noticed of great beauty though having no knowledge of hieroglyphics i could not decipher them beads and spicy wrappings lay around the remains which i saw were those of a man and a woman the head had been broken off the body of the man i took it up and looked at it it had been closely shavedafter death i should say from the general indicationsand the features were disfigured with gold leaf but notwithstanding this and the shrinkage of the flesh i think the face was one of the most imposing and beautiful that i ever saw it was that of a very old man and his dead countenance still wore so calm and solemn indeed so awful a look that i grew quite superstitious though as you know i am pretty well accustomed to dead people and put the head down in a hurry there were still some wrappings left upon the face of the second body and i did not remove them but she must have been a fine large woman in her day        this i take it is a portrait of amenemhat himself      editor        doubtless amenemhat and his wifeeditor  there the other mummy said ali pointing to a large and solid case that seemed to have been carelessly thrown down in a corner for it was lying on its side  i went up to it and carefully examined it it was well made but of perfectly plain cedarwoodnot an inscription not a solitary god on it  never see one like him before said ali bury great hurry he no mafish no fineesh throw him down here on side  i looked at the plain case till at last my interest was thoroughly aroused i was so shocked by the sight of the scattered dust of the departed that i had made up my mind not to touch the remaining coffinbut now my curiosity overcame me and we set to work  ali had brought a mallet and a cold chisel with him and having set the coffin straight he began upon it with all the zeal of an experienced tombbreaker and then he pointed out another thing most mummycases are fastened by four little tongues of wood two on either side which are fixed in the upper half and passing into mortices cut to receive them in the thickness of the lower half are there held fast by pegs of hard wood but this mummy case had eight such tongues evidently it had been thought well to secure it firmly at last with great difficulty we raised the massive lid which was nearly three inches thick and there covered over with a deep layer of loose spices a very unusual thing was the body  ali looked at it with open eyesand no wonder for this mummy was not as other mummies are mummies in general lie upon their backs as stiff and calm as though they were cut from wood but this mummy lay upon its side and the wrappings notwithstanding its knees were slightly bent more than that indeed the gold mask which after the fashion of the ptolemaic period had been set upon the face had worked down and was literally pounded up beneath the hooded head  it was impossible seeing these things to avoid the conclusion that the mummy before us had moved with violence since it was put in the coffin  him very funny mummy him not mafish when him go in there said ali  nonsense i said who ever heard of a live mummy  we lifted the body out of the coffin nearly choking ourselves with mummy dust in the process and there beneath it half hidden among the spices we made our first find it was a roll of papyrus carelessly fastened and wrapped in a piece of mummy cloth having to all appearance been thrown into the coffin at the moment of closing        this roll contained the third unfinished book of the      history the other two rolls were neatly fastened in the      usual fashion all three are written by one hand in the      demotic charactereditor  ali eyed the papyrus greedily but i seized it and put it in my pocket for it was agreed that i was to have all that might be discovered then we began to unwrap the body it was covered with very broad strong bandages thickly wound and roughly tied sometimes by means of simple knots the whole working the appearance of having been executed in great haste and with difficulty just over the head was a large lump presently the bandages covering it were off and there on the face lay a second roll of papyrus i put down my hand to lift it but it would not come away it appeared to be fixed to the stout seamless shroud which was drawn over the whole body and tied beneath the feetas a farmer ties sacks this shroud which was also thickly waxed was in one piece being made to fit the form like a garment i took a candle and examined the roll and then i saw why it was fast the spices had congealed and glued it to the sacklike shroud it was impossible to get it away without tearing the outer sheets of papyrus        this accounts for the gaps in the last sheets of the      second roll editor  at last however i wrenched it loose and put it with the other in my pocket  then we went on with our dreadful task in silence with much care we ripped loose the sacklike garment and at last the body of a man lay before us between his knees was a third roll of papyrus i secured it then held down the light and looked at him one glance at his face was enough to tell a doctor how he had died  this body was not much dried up evidently it had not passed the allotted seventy days in natron and therefore the expression and likeness were better preserved than is usual without entering into particulars i will only say that i hope i shall never see such another look as that which was frozen on this dead mans face even the arabs recoiled from it in horror and began to mutter prayers  for the rest the usual opening on the left side through which the embalmers did their work was absent the finelycut features were those of a person of middle age although the hair was already grey and the frame was that of a very powerful man the shoulders being of an extraordinary width i had not time to examine very closely however for within a few seconds from its uncovering the unembalmed body began to crumble now that it was exposed to the action of the air in five or six minutes there was literally nothing left of it but a wisp of hair the skull and a few of the larger bones i noticed that one of the tibiæi forget if it was the right or the lefthad been fractured and very badly set it must have been quite an inch shorter than the other  well there was nothing more to find and now that the excitement was over what between the heat the exertion and the smell of mummy dust and spices i felt more dead than alive  i am tired of writing and this ship rolls this letter of course goes overland and i am coming by long sea but i hope to be in london within ten days after you get it then i will tell you of my pleasing experiences in the course of the ascent from the tombchamber and of how that prince of rascals ali baba and his thieves tried to frighten me into handing over the papyri and how i worsted them then too we will get the rolls deciphered i expect that they only contain the usual thing copies of the book of the dead but there may be something else in them needless to say i did not narrate this little adventure in egypt or i should have had the boulac museum people on my track goodbye mafish fineesh as ali baba always said   in due course my friend the writer of the letter from which i have quoted arrived in london and on the very next day we paid a visit to a learned acquaintance well versed in hieroglyphics and demotic writing the anxiety with which we watched him skilfully damping and unfolding one of the rolls and peering through his goldrimmed glasses at the mysterious characters may well be imagined  hum he said whatever it is this is not a copy of the book of the dead by george whats this clecleocleopatrawhy my dear sirs as i am a living man this is the history of somebody who lived in the days of cleopatra the cleopatra for heres antonys name with hers well theres six months work before me heresix months at the very least and in that joyful prospect he fairly lost control of himself and skipped about the room shaking hands with us at intervals and saying ill translateill translate it if it kills me and we will

agothe egypt of the greek the roman and the ptolemy and that other outworn egypt of the hierophant hoary with years heavy with the legends of antiquity and the memory of longlost honours  he tells you

me witness that i write the truth    even while i write beyond the fertile fields the nile is running red as though with blood before me the sunlight beats upon the far arabian hills and falls upon the piles of abouthis still the priests make orison within the temples at abouthis that know me no more still the sacrifice is offered and the stony roofs echo back the peoples prayers still from this lone cell within my prisontower i the word of shame watch thy fluttering banners abouthis flaunting from thy pylon walls and hear the chants as the long procession winds from sanctuary to sanctuary  abouthis lost abouthis my heart goes out toward thee for the day comes when the desert sands shall fill thy secret places thy gods are doomed o abouthis new faiths shall make a mock of all thy holies and centurion shall call upon centurion across thy fortresswalls i weepi weep tears of blood for mine is the sin that brought about these evils and mine for ever is their shame  behold it is written hereafter    here in abouthis i was born i harmachis and my father the justified in osiris was high priest of the temple of sethi and on that same day of my birth cleopatra the queen of egypt was born also i passed my youth in yonder fields watching the baser people at their labours and going in and out at will among the great courts of the temples of my mother i knew naught for she died when i yet hung at the breast but before she died in the reign of ptolemy aulêtes who is named the piper so did the old wife atoua told me my mother took a golden uræus the snake symbol of our royalty of egypt from a coffer of ivory and laid it on my brow and those who saw her do this believed that she was distraught of the divinity and in her madness foreshadowed that the day of the macedonian lagidæ was ended and that egypts sceptre should pass again to the hand of egypts true and royal race but when my father the old high priest amenemhat whose only child i was she who was his wife before my mother having been for what crime i know not cursed with barrenness by sekhet i say when my father came in and saw what the dying woman had done he lifted up his hands towards the vault of heaven and adored the invisible because of the sign that had been sent and as he adored the hathors filled my dying mother with the spirit of prophecy and she rose in strength from the couch and prostrated herself thrice before the cradle where i lay asleep the royal asp upon my brow crying aloud        the egyptian parcæ or fateseditor  hail to thee fruit of my womb hail to thee royal child hail to thee pharaoh that shalt be hail to thee god that shalt purge the land divine seed of nektnebf the descended from isis keep thee pure and thou shalt rule and deliver egypt and not be broken but if thou dost fail in thy hour of trial then may the curse of all the gods of egypt rest upon thee and the curse of thy royal forefathers the justified who ruled the land before thee from the age of horus then in life mayst thou be wretched and after death may osiris refuse thee and the judges of amenti give judgment against thee and set and sekhet torment thee till such time as thy sin is purged and the gods of egypt called by strange names are once more worshipped in the temples of egypt and the staff of the oppressor is broken and the footsteps of the foreigner are swept clean and the thing is accomplished as thou in thy weakness shalt cause it to be done  when she had spoken thus the spirit of prophecy went out of her and she fell dead across the cradle where i slept so that i awoke with a cry  but my father amenemhat the high priest trembled and was very fearful both because of the words which had been said by the spirit of the hathors through the mouth of my mother and because what had been uttered was treason against ptolemy for he knew that if the matter should come to the ears of ptolemy pharaoh would send his guards to destroy the life of the child concerning whom such things were prophesied therefore my father shut the doors and caused all those who stood by to swear upon the holy symbol of his office and by the name of the divine three and by the soul of her who lay dead upon the stones beside them that nothing of what they had seen and heard should pass their lips  now among the company was the old wife atoua who had been the nurse of my mother and loved her well and in these days though i know not how it had been in the past nor how it shall be in the future there is no oath that can bind a womans tongue and so it came about that byandby when the matter had become homely in her mind and her fear had fallen from her she spoke of the prophecy to her daughter who nursed me at the breast now that my mother was dead she did this as they walked together in the desert carrying food to the husband of the daughter who was a sculptor and shaped effigies of the holy gods in the tombs that are fashioned in the rocktelling the daughter my nurse how great must be her care and love toward the child that should one day be pharaoh and drive the ptolemies from egypt but the daughter my nurse was so filled with wonder at what she heard that she could not keep the tale locked within her breast and in the night she awoke her husband and in her turn whispered it to him and thereby compassed her own destruction and the destruction of her child my fosterbrother for the man told his friend and the friend was a spy of ptolemys and thus the tale came to pharaohs ears  now pharaoh was much troubled thereat for though when he was full of wine he would make a mock of the god of the egyptians and swear that the roman senate was the only god to whom he bowed the knee yet in his heart he was terribly afraid as i have learned from one who was his physician for when he was alone at night he would scream and cry aloud to the great serapis who indeed is no true god and to other gods fearing lest he should be murdered and his soul handed over to the tormentors also when he felt his throne tremble under him he would send large presents to the temples asking a message from the oracles and more especially from the oracle that is at philæ therefore when it came to his ears that the wife of the high priest of the great and ancient temple of abouthis had been filled with the spirit of prophecy before she died and foretold that her son should be pharaoh he was much afraid and summoning some trusty guardswho being greeks did not fear to do sacrilegehe despatched them by boat up the nile with orders to come to abouthis and cut off the head of the child of the high priest and bring it to him in a basket  but as it chanced the boat in which the guards came was of deep draught and the time of their coming being at the lowest ebb of the river it struck and remained fast upon a bank of mud that is opposite the mouth of the road running across the plains to abouthis and as the north wind was blowing very fiercely it was like to sink thereon the guards of pharaoh called out to the common people who laboured at lifting water along the banks of the river to come with boats and take them off but seeing that they were greeks of alexandria the people would not for the egyptians do not love the greeks then the guards cried that they were on pharaohs business and still the people would not asking what was their business whereon a eunuch among them who had made himself drunk in his fear told them that they came to slay the child of amenemhat the high priest of whom it was prophesied that he should be pharaoh and sweep the greeks from egypt and then the people feared to stand longer in doubt but brought boats not knowing what might be meant by the mans words but there was one amongst thema farmer and an overseer of canalswho was a kinsman of my mothers and had been present when she prophesied and he turned and ran swiftly for three parts of an hour till he came to where i lay in the house that is without the north wall of the great temple now as it chanced my father was away in that part of the place of tombs which is to the left of the large fortress and pharaohs guards mounted on asses were hard upon us then the messenger cried to the old wife atoua whose tongue had brought about the evil and told how the soldiers drew near to slay me and they looked at each other not knowing what to do for had they hid me the guards would not have stayed their search till i was found but the man gazing through the doorway saw a little child at play  woman he said whose is that child  it is my grandchild she answered the fosterbrother of the prince harmachis the child to whose mother we owe this evil case  woman he said thou knowest thy duty do it and he again pointed at the child i command thee by the holy name  atoua trembled exceedingly because the child was of her own blood but nevertheless she took the boy and washed him and set a robe of silk upon him and laid him on my cradle and me she took and smeared with mud to make my fair skin darker and drawing my garment from me set me to play in the dirt of the yard which i did right gladly  then the man hid himself and presently the soldiers rode up and asked of the old wife if this were the dwelling of the high priest amenemhat and she told them yea and bidding them enter offered them honey and milk for they were thirsty  when they had drunk the eunuch who was with them asked if that were the son of amenemhat who lay in the cradle and she said yeayea and began to tell the guards how he would be great for it had been prophesied of him that he should one day rule them all  but the greek guards laughed and one of them seizing the child smote off his head with a sword and the eunuch drew forth the signet of pharaoh as warrant for the deed and showed it to the old wife atoua bidding her tell the high priest that his son should be king without a head  and as they went one of their number saw me playing in the dirt and called out that there was more breeding in yonder brat than in the prince harmachis and for a moment they wavered thinking to slay me also but in the end they passed on bearing the head of my fosterbrother for they loved not to murder little children  after a while the mother of the dead child returned from the marketplace and when she found what had been done she and her husband would have killed atoua the old wife her mother and given me up to the soldiers of pharaoh but my father came in also and learned the truth and he caused the man and his wife to be seized by night and hidden away in the dark places of the temple so that none saw them more  but i would today that it had been the will of the gods that i had been slain of the soldiers and not the innocent child    thereafter it was given out that the high priest amenemhat had taken me to be as a son to him in the place of that harmachis who was slain of pharaoh    chapter ii  of the disobedience of harmachis of the slaying of the lion and of the speech of the old wife atoua  and after these things ptolemy the piper troubled us no more nor did he again send his soldiers to seek for him of whom it was prophesied that he should be pharaoh for the head of the child my fosterbrother was brought to him by the eunuch as he sat in his palace of marble at alexandria flushed with cyprian wine and played upon the flute before his women and at his bidding the eunuch lifted up the head by the hair for him to look on then he laughed and smote it on the cheek with his sandal bidding one of the girls crown pharaoh with flowers and he bowed the knee and mocked the head of the innocent child but the girl who was sharp of tonguefor all of this i heard in after yearssaid to him that he did well to bow the knee for this child was indeed pharaoh the greatest of pharaohs and his name was the osiris and his throne was death  aulêtes was much troubled at these words and trembled for being a wicked man he greatly feared entering into amenti so he caused the girl to be slain because of the evil omen of her saying crying that he would send her to worship that pharaoh whom she had named and the other women he sent away and played no more upon the flute till he was once again drunk on the morrow but the alexandrians made a song on the matter which is still sung about the streets and this is the beginning of it       ptolemy the piper played      over dead and dying      piped and played he well      sure that flute of his was made      of the dank reed sighing      oer the streams of hell      there beneath the shadows grey      with the sisters three      shall he pipe for many a day      may the frog his butler be      and his wine the water of that countrie      ptolemy the piper  after this the years passed on nor did i being very little know anything of the great things that came to pass in egypt nor is it my purpose to set them out here for i harmachis having little time left to me will only speak of those things with which i have been concerned  and as the time went on my father and the teachers instructed me in the ancient learning of our people and in such matters appertaining to the gods as it is meet that children should know so i grew strong and comely for my hair was black as the hair of the divine nout and my eyes were blue as the blue lotus and my skin was like the alabaster within the sanctuaries for now that these glories have passed from me i may speak of them without shame i was strong also there was no youth of my years in abouthis who could stand against me to wrestle with me nor could any throw so far with the sling or spear and i much yearned to hunt the lion but he whom i called my father forbade me telling me that my life was of too great worth to be so lightly hazarded but when i bowed before him and prayed he would make his meaning clear to me the old man frowned and answered that the gods made all things clear in their own season for my part however i went away in wroth for there was a youth in abouthis who with others had slain a lion which fell upon his fathers herds and being envious of my strength and beauty he set it about that i was cowardly at heart in that when i went out to hunt i only slew jackals and gazelles now this was when i had reached my seventeenth year and was a man grown  it chanced therefore that as i went sore at heart from the presence of the high priest i met this youth who called to me and mocked me bidding me know the country people had told him that a great lion was down among the rushes by the banks of the canal which runs past the temple lying at a distance of thirty stadia from abouthis and still mocking me he asked me if i would come and help him slay this lion or would i go and sit among the old women and bid them comb my side lock this bitter word so angered me that i was near to falling on him but in place therefore forgetting my fathers saying i answered that if he would come alone i would go with him and seek this lion and he should learn if i were indeed a coward and at first he would not for as men know it is our custom to hunt the lion in companies so it was my hour to mock then he went and fetched his bow and arrows and a sharp knife and i brought forth my heavy spear which had a shaft of thornwood and at its end a pomegranate in silver to hold the hand from slipping and in silence we went side by side to where the lion lay when we came to the place it was near sundown and there upon the mud of the canalbank we found the lions slot which ran into a thick clump of reeds  now thou boaster i said wilt thou lead the way into yonder reeds or shall i and i made as though i would lead the way  nay nay he answered be not so mad the brute will spring upon thee and rend thee see i will shoot among the reeds perchance if he sleeps it will arouse him and he drew his bow at a venture  how it chanced i know not but the arrow struck the sleeping lion and like a flash of light from the belly of a cloud he bounded from the shelter of the reeds and stood before us with bristling mane and yellow eyes the arrow quivering in his flank he roared aloud in fury and the earth shook  shoot with the bow i cried shoot swiftly ere he spring  but courage had left the breast of the boaster his jaw dropped down and his fingers unloosed their hold so that the bow fell from them then with a loud cry he turned and fled behind me leaving the lion in my path but while i stood waiting my doom for though i was sore afraid i would not fly the lion crouched himself and turning not aside with one great bound swept over me touching me not he lit and again he bounded full upon the boasters back striking him such a blow with his great paw that his head was crushed as an egg thrown against a stone he fell down dead and the lion stood and roared over him then i was mad with horror and scarce knowing what i did i grasped my spear and with a shout i charged as i charged the lion lifted himself up above me he smote at me with his paw but with all my strength i drove the broad spear into his throat and shrinking from the agony of the steel his blow fell short and did no more than rip my skin back he fell the great spear far in his throat then rising he roared in pain and leapt twice the height of a man straight into the air smiting at the spear with his forepaws twice he leapt thus horrible to see and twice he fell upon his back then his strength spent itself with his rushing blood and groaning like a bull he died while i being but a lad stood and trembled with fear now that all cause of fear had passed  but as i stood and gazed at the body of him who had taunted me and at the carcass of the lion a woman came running towards me even the same old wife atoua who though i knew it not as yet had offered up her flesh and blood that i might be saved alive for she had been gathering simples in which she had great skill by the waters edge not knowing that there was a lion near and indeed the lions for the most part are not found in the tilled land but rather in the desert and the libyan mountains and had seen from a distance that which i have set down now when she was come she knew me for harmachis and bending herself she made obeisance to me and saluted me calling me royal and worthy of all honour and beloved and chosen of the holy three ay and by the name of the pharaoh the deliverer  but i thinking that terror had made her sick of mind asked her of what she would speak  is it a great thing i asked that i should slay a lion is it a matter worthy of such talk as thine there live and have lived men who have slain many lions did not the divine amenhetep the osirian slay with his own hand more than a hundred lions is it not written on the scarabæus that hangs within my fathers chamber that he slew lions aforetime and have not others done likewise why then speakest thou thus o foolish woman  all of which i said because having now slain the lion i was minded after the manner of youth to hold it as a thing of no account but she did not cease to make obeisance and to call me by names that are too high to be written  o royal one she cried wisely did thy mother prophecy surely the holy spirit the knepth was in her o thou conceived by a god see the omen the lion therehe growls within the capitol at romeand the dead man he is the ptolemythe macedonian spawn that like a foreign weed hath overgrown the land of nile with the macedonian lagidæ thou shalt go to smite the lion of rome but the macedonian cur shall fly and the roman lion shall strike him down and thou shalt strike down the lion and the land of khem shall once more be free free keep thyself but pure according to the commandment of the gods o son of the royal house o hope of khemi be but ware of woman the destroyer and as i have said so shall it be i am poor and wretched yea stricken with sorrow i have sinned in speaking of what should be hid and for my sin i have paid in the coin of that which was born of my womb willingly have i paid for thee but i have still of the wisdom of our people nor do the gods in whose eyes all are equal turn their countenance from the poor the divine mother isis hath spoken to mebut last night she spakebidding me come hither to gather herbs and read to thee the signs that i should see and as i have said so it shall come to pass if thou canst but endure the weight of the great temptation come hither royal one and she led me to the edge of the canal where the water was deep and still and blue now gaze upon that face as the water throws it back is not that brow fitted to bear the double crown do not those gentle eyes mirror the majesty of kings hath not the ptah the creator fashioned that form to fit the imperial garb and awe the glance of multitudes looking through thee to god  nay nay she went on in another voicea shrill old wifes voicei willbe not so foolish boythe scratch of a lion is a venomous thing a terrible thing yea as bad as the bite of an aspit must be treated else it will fester and all thy days thou shalt dream of lions ay and snakes and also it will break out in sores but i know of iti know i am not crazed for nothing for mark everything has its balancein madness is much wisdom and in wisdom much madness la la la pharaoh himself cant say where the one begins and the other ends now dont stand gazing there looking as silly as a cat in a crocuscoloured robe as they say in alexandria but just let me stick these green things on the place and in six days youll heal up as white as a threeyearchild never mind the smart of it lad by him who sleeps at philæ or at abouthis or at abydusas our divine masters have it nowor wherever he does sleep which is a thing we shall all find out before we want toby osiris i say youll live to be as clean from scars as a sacrifice to isis at the new moon if youll but let me put it on  is it not so good folkand she turned to address some people who while she prophesied had assembled unseen by meive been speaking a spell over him just to make a way for the virtue of my medicinela la theres nothing like a spell if you dont believe it just you come to me next time your wives are barren its better than scraping every pillar in the temple of osiris ill warrant ill make em bear like a twentyyearold palm but then you see you must know what to saythats the pointeverything comes to a point at last la la  now when i heard all this i harmachis put my hand to my head not knowing if i dreamed but presently looking up i saw a greyhaired man among those who were gathered together who watched us sharply and afterwards i learned that this man was the spy of ptolemy the very man indeed who had wellnigh caused me to be slain of pharaoh when i was in my cradle then i understood why atoua spoke so foolishly  thine are strange spells old wife the spy said thou didst speak of pharaoh and the double crown and of the form fashioned by ptah to bear it is it not so  yea yeapart of the spell thou fool and what can one swear by better nowadays than by the divine pharaoh the piper whom and whose music may the gods preserve to charm this happy landwhat better than by the double crown he wearsgrace to great alexander of macedonia by the way you know about everything have they got back his chlamys yet which mithridates took to cos pompey wore it last didnt hein his triumph toojust fancy pompey in the cloak of alexandera puppydog in a lions skin and talking of lionslook what this lad hath doneslain a lion with his own spear and right glad you village folks should be to see it for it was a very fierce lionjust see his teeth and his clawshis clawsthey are enough to make a poor silly old woman like me shriek to look at them and the body there the dead bodythe lion slew it alack hes an osiris now the bodyand to think of it but an hour ago he was an everyday mortal like you or me well away with him to the embalmers hell soon swell in the sun and burst and that will save them the trouble of cutting him open not that they will spend a talent of silver over him anyway seventy days in natronthats all hes likely to get la la how my tongue does run and its getting dark come arent you going to take away the body of that poor lad and the lion too there my boy you keep those herbs on and youll never feel your scratches i know a thing or two for all im crazy and you my own grandson dear dear im glad his holiness the high priest adopted you when pharaohosiris bless his holy namemade an end of his son you look so bonny i warrant the real harmachis could not have killed a lion like that give me the common blood i sayits so lusty        the soul when it has been absorbed in the godhead      editor  you know too much and talk too fast grumbled the spy now quite deceived well he is a brave youth here you men bear this body back to abouthis and some of you stop and help me skin the lion well send the skin to you young man he went on not that you deserve it to attack a lion like that was the act of a fool and a fool deserves what he getsdestruction never attack the strong until you are stronger  but for my part i went home wondering    chapter iii  of the rebuke of amenemhat of the prayer of harmachis and of the sign given by the holy gods  for a while as i harmachis went the juice of the green herbs which the old wife atoua had placed upon my wounds caused me much smart but presently the pain ceased and of a truth i believe that there was virtue in them for within two days my flesh healed up so that after a time no marks remained but i bethought me that i had disobeyed the word of the old high priest amenemhat who was called my father for till this day i knew not that he was in truth my father according to the flesh having been taught that his own son was slain as i have written and that he had been pleased with the sanction of the divine ones to take me as an adopted son and rear me up that i might in due season fulfil an office about the temple therefore i was much troubled for i feared the old man who was very terrible in his anger and ever spoke with the cold voice of wisdom nevertheless i determined to go in to him and confess my fault and bear such punishment as he should be pleased to put upon me so with the red spear in my hand and the red wounds on my breast i passed through the outer court of the great temple and came to the door of the place where the high priest dwelt it is a great chamber sculptured round about with the images of the solemn gods and the sunlight comes to it in the daytime by an opening cut through the stones of the massy roof but at night it was lit by a swinging lamp of bronze i passed in without noise for the door was not altogether shut and pushing my way through the heavy curtains that were beyond i stood with a beating heart within the chamber  the lamp was lit for the darkness had fallen and by its light i saw the old man seated in a chair of ivory and ebony at a table of stone on which were spread mystic writings of the words of life and death but he read no more for he slept and his long white beard rested upon the table like the beard of a dead man the soft light from the lamp fell on him on the papyri and the gold ring upon his hand where were graven the symbols of the invisible one but all around was shadow it fell on the shaven head on the white robe on the cedar staff of priesthood at his side and on the ivory of the lionfooted chair it showed the mighty brow of power the features cut in kingly mould the white eyebrows and the dark hollows of the deepset eyes i looked and trembled for there was about him that which was more than the dignity of man he had lived so long with the gods and so long kept company with them and with thoughts divine he was so deeply versed in all those mysteries which we do but faintly discern here in this upper air that even now before his time he partook of the nature of the osiris and was a thing to shake humanity with fear  i stood and gazed and as i stood he opened his dark eyes but looked not on me nor turned his head and yet he saw me and spoke  why hast thou been disobedient to me my son he said how came it that thou wentest forth against the lion when i bade thee not  how knowest thou my father that i went forth i asked in fear  how know i are there then no other ways of knowledge than by the senses ah ignorant child was not my spirit with thee when the lion sprang upon thy companion did i not pray those set about thee to protect thee to make sure thy thrust when thou didst drive the spear into the lions throat how came it that thou wentest forth my son  the boaster taunted me i answered and i went  yes i know it and because of the hot blood of youth i forgive thee harmachis but now listen to me and let my words sink into thy heart like the waters of sihor into the thirsty sand at the rising of sirius listen to me the boaster was sent to thee as a temptation he was sent as a trial of thy strength and see it has not been equal to the burden therefore thy hour is put back hadst thou been strong in this matter the path had been made plain to thee even now but thou hast failed and therefore thy hour is put back        the dogstar whose appearance marked the commencement      of the overflow of the nileeditor  i understand thee not my father i answered  what was it then my son that the old wife atoua said to thee down by the bank of the canal  then i told him all that the old wife had said  and thou believest harmachis my son  nay i answered how should i believe such tales surely she is mad all the people know her for mad  now for the first time he looked towards me who was standing in the shadow  my son my son he cried thou art wrong she is not mad the woman spoke the truth she spoke not of herself but of the voice within her that cannot lie for this atoua is a prophetess and holy now learn thou the destiny that the gods of egypt have given to thee to fulfil and woe be unto thee if by any weakness thou dost fail therein listen thou art no stranger adopted into my house and the worship of the temple thou art my very son saved to me by this same woman but harmachis thou art more than this for in thee and me alone yet flows the imperial blood of egypt thou and i alone of men alive are descended without break or flaw from that pharaoh nektnebf whom ochus the persian drove from egypt the persian came and the persian went and after the persian came the macedonian and now for nigh upon three hundred years the lagidæ have usurped the double crown defiling the land of khem and corrupting the worship of its gods and mark thou this but now two weeks since ptolemy neus dionysus ptolemy aulêtes the piper who would have slain thee is dead and but now hath the eunuch pothinus that very eunuch who came hither years ago to cut thee off set at naught the will of his master the dead aulêtes and placed the boy ptolemy upon the throne and therefore his sister cleopatra that fierce and beautiful girl has fled into syria and there if i err not she will gather her armies and make war upon her brother ptolemy for by her fathers will she was left jointsovereign with him and meanwhile mark thou this my son the roman eagle hangs on high waiting with ready talons till such time as he may fall upon the fat wether egypt and rend him and mark again the people of egypt are weary of the foreign yoke they hate the memory of the persians and they are sick at heart of being named men of macedonia in the markets of alexandria the whole land mutters and murmurs beneath the yoke of the greek and the shadow of the roman  have we not been oppressed have not our children been butchered and our gains wrung from us to fill the bottomless greed and lust of the lagidæ have not the temples been forsakenay have not the majesties of the eternal gods been set at naught by these grecian babblers who have dared to meddle with the immortal truths and name the most high by another nameby the name of serapisconfounding the substance of the invisible does not egypt cry aloud for freedomand shall she cry in vain nay nay for thou my son art the appointed way of deliverance to thee being sunk in eld i have decreed my rights already thy name is whispered in many a sanctuary from abu to athu already priests and people swear allegiance even by the sacred symbols unto him who shall be declared to them still the time is not yet thou art too green a sapling to bear the weight of such a storm but today thou wast tried and found wanting  he who would serve the gods harmachis must put aside the failings of the flesh taunts must not move him nor any lusts of man thine is a high mission but this thou must learn if thou learn it not thou shalt fail therein and then my curse be on thee and the curse of egypt and the curse of egypts broken gods for know thou this that even the gods who are immortal may in the interwoven scheme of things lean upon the man who is their instrument as a warrior on his sword and woe be to the sword that snaps in the hour of battle for it shall be thrown aside to rust or perchance be melted with fire therefore make thy heart pure and high and strong for thine is no common lot and thine no mortal meed triumph harmachis and in glory thou shalt goin glory here and hereafter fail and woewoe be on thee  he paused and bowed his head and then went on  of these matters thou shalt hear more hereafter meanwhile thou hast much to learn tomorrow i will give thee letters and thou shalt journey down the nile past whitewalled memphis to annu there thou shalt sojourn certain years and learn more of our ancient wisdom beneath the shadow of those secret pyramids of which thou too art the hereditary high priest that is to be and meanwhile i will sit here and watch for my hour is not yet and by the help of the gods spin the web of death wherein thou shalt catch and hold the wasp of macedonia  come hither my son come hither and kiss me on the brow for thou art my hope and all the hope of egypt be but true soar to the eagle crest of destiny and thou shalt be glorious here and hereafter be false fail and i will spit upon thee and thou shalt be accursed and thy soul shall remain in bondage till that hour when in the slow flight of time the evil shall once more grow to good and egypt shall again be free  i drew near trembling and kissed him on the brow may all these things come upon me and more i said if i fail thee my father  nay he cried not me not me but rather those whose will i do and now go my son and ponder in thy heart and in thy secret heart digest my words mark what thou shalt see and gather up the dew of wisdom making thee ready for the battle fear not for thyself thou art protected from all ill no harm may touch thee from without thyself alone can be thine own enemy i have said  then i went forth with a full heart the night was very still and none were stirring in the temple courts i hurried through them and reached the entrance to the pylon that is at the outer gate then seeking solitude and as it were to draw near to heaven i climbed the pylons two hundred steps until at length i reached the massive roof here i leaned my breast against the parapet and looked forth as i looked the red edge of the full moon floated up over the arabian hills and her rays fell upon the pylon where i stood and the temple walls beyond lighting the visages of the carven gods then the cold light struck the stretch of welltilled lands now whitening to the harvest and as the heavenly lamp of isis passed up to the sky her rays crept slowly down to the valley where sihor father of the land of khem rolls on toward the sea  now the bright beams kissed the water that smiled an answer back and now mountain and valley river temple town and plain were flooded with white light for mother isis was arisen and threw her gleaming robe across the bosom of the earth it was beautiful with the beauty of a dream and solemn as the hour after death mightily indeed the temples towered up against the face of night never had they seemed so grand to me as in that hourthose eternal shrines before whose walls time himself shall wither and it was to be mine to rule this moonlit land mine to preserve those sacred shrines and cherish the honour of their gods mine to cast out the ptolemy and free egypt from the foreign yoke in my veins ran the blood of those great kings who await the day of resurrection sleeping in the tombs of the valley of thebes my spirit swelled within me as i dreamed upon this glorious destiny i closed my hands and there upon the pylon i prayed as i had never prayed before to the godhead who is called by many names and in many forms made manifest  o amen i prayed god of gods who hast been from the beginning lord of truth who art and of whom all are who givest out thy godhead and gatherest it up again in the circle of whom the divine ones move and are who wast from all time the selfbegot and who shalt be till timehearken unto me        for a somewhat similar definition of the godhead see the      funeral papyrus of nesikhonsu a princess of the twenty      first dynastyeditor  o amenosiris the sacrifice by whom we are justified lord of the region of the winds ruler of the ages dweller in the west the supreme in amenti hearken unto me  o isis great mother goddess mother of the horusmysterious mother sister spouse hearken unto me if indeed i am the chosen of the gods to carry out the purpose of the gods let a sign be given me even now to seal my life to the life above stretch out your arms towards me o ye gods and uncover the glory of your countenance hear ah hear me and i cast myself upon my knees and lifted up my eyes to heaven  and as i knelt a cloud grew upon the face of the moon covering it up so that the night became dark and the silence deepened all aroundeven the dogs far below in the city ceased to howl while the silence grew and grew till it was heavy as death i felt my spirit lifted up within me and my hair rose upon my head then of a sudden the mighty pylon seemed to rock beneath my feet a great wind beat about my brows and a voice spoke within my heart  behold a sign possess thyself in patience o harmachis  and as the voice spoke a cold hand touched my hand and left somewhat within it then the cloud rolled from the face of the moon the wind passed the pylon ceased to tremble and the night was as the night had been  as the light came back i gazed upon that which had been left within my hand it was a bud of the holy lotus new breaking into bloom and from it came a most sweet scent  and while i gazed behold the lotus passed from my grasp and was gone leaving me astonished    chapter iv  of the departure of harmachis and of his meeting with his uncle sepa the high priest of annu el ra of his life at annu and of the words of sepa  at the dawning of the next day i was awakened by a priest of the temple who brought word to me to make ready for the journey of which my father had spoken inasmuch as there was an occasion for me to pass down the river to annu el ra now this is the heliopolis of the greeks whither i should go in the company of some priests of ptah at memphis who had come hither to abouthis to lay the body of one of their great men in the tomb that had been prepared near the resting place of the blessed osiris  so i made ready and the same evening having received letters and embraced my father and those about the temple who were dear to me i passed down the banks of sihor and we sailed with the south wind as the pilot stood upon the prow and with a rod in his hand bade the sailormen loosen the stakes by which the vessel was moored to the banks the old wife atoua hobbled up her basket of simples in her hand and calling out farewell threw a sandal after me for good chance which sandal i kept for many years  so we sailed and for six days passed down the wonderful river making fast each night at some convenient spot but when i lost sight of the familiar things that i had seen day by day since i had eyes to see and found myself alone among strange faces i felt very sore at heart and would have wept had i not been ashamed and of all the wonderful things i saw i will not write here for though they were new to me have they not been known to men since such time as the gods ruled in egypt but the priests who were with me showed me no little honour and expounded to me what were the things i saw  on the morning of the seventh day we came to memphis the city of the white hall here for three days i rested from my journey and was entertained of the priests of the wonderful temple of ptah the creator and shown the beauties of the great and marvellous city also i was led in secret by the high priest and two others into the holy presence of the god apis the ptah who deigns to dwell among men in the form of a bull the god was black and on his forehead there was a white square on his back was a white mark shaped like an eagle beneath his tongue was the likeness of a scarabæus in his tail were double hairs and a plate of pure gold hung between his horns i entered the place of the god and worshipped while the high priest and those with him stood aside watching earnestly and when i had worshipped saying the words which had been told me the god knelt and lay down before me then the high priest and those with him who as i heard in after time were great men of upper egypt approached wondering and saying no word made obeisance to me because of the omen and many other things i saw in memphis that are too long to write of here  on the fourth day some priests of annu came to lead me to sepa my uncle the high priest of annu so having bidden farewell to those of memphis we crossed the river and rode on asses two parts of a days journey through many villages which we found in great poverty because of the oppression of the taxgatherers also as we went i saw for the first time the great pyramids that are beyond the image of the god horemkhu that sphinx whom the greeks name harmachis and the temples of the divine mother isis queen of the memnonia and the god osiris lord of rosatou of which temples together with the temple of the worship of the divine menkaura i harmachis am by right divine the hereditary high priest i saw them and marvelled at their greatness and the white carven limestone and red granite of syene that flashed the suns rays back to heaven but at this time i knew nothing of the treasure that was hid in her which is the third among the pyramidswould i had never known of it  and so at last we came within sight of annu which after memphis has been seen is no large town but stands on raised ground before which are lakes fed by a canal behind the town is the inclosed field of the temple of the god ra  we dismounted at the pylon and were met beneath the portico by a man not great of stature but of noble aspect having his head shaven and with dark eyes that twinkled like the further stars  hold he cried in a great voice which fitted his weak body but ill hold i am sepa who opens the mouth of the gods  and i i said am harmachis son of amenemhat hereditary high priest and ruler of the holy city abouthis and i bear letters to thee o sepa  enter he said enter scanning me all the while with his twinkling eyes enter my son and he took me and led me to a chamber in the inner hall closed to the door and then having glanced at the letters that i brought of a sudden he fell upon my neck and embraced me  welcome he cried welcome son of my own sister and hope of khem not in vain have i prayed the gods that i might live to look upon thy face and impart to thee the wisdom which perchance i alone have mastered of those who are left alive in egypt there are few whom it is lawful that i should teach but thine is the great destiny and thine shall be the ears to hear the lessons of the gods  and he embraced me once more and bade me go bathe and eat saying that on the morrow he would speak with me further  this of a truth he did and at such length that i will forbear to set down all he said both then and afterwards for if i did so there would be no papyrus left in egypt when the task was ended therefore having much to tell and but little time to tell it i will pass over the events of the years that followed  for this was the manner of my life i rose early i attended the worship of the temple and i gave my days to study i learnt of the rites of religion and their meaning and of the beginning of the gods and the beginning of the upper world i learnt of the mystery of the movements of the stars and of how the earth rolls on among them i was instructed in that ancient knowledge which is called magic and in the way of interpretation of dreams and of the drawing nigh to god i was taught the language of symbols and their outer and inner secrets i became acquainted with the eternal laws of good and evil and with the mystery of that trust which is held of man also i learnt the secrets of the pyramidswhich i would that i had never known further i read the records of the past and of the acts and words of the ancient kings who were before me since the rule of horus upon earth and i was made to know all craft of state the lore of earth and with it the history of greece and rome also i learnt the grecian and roman tongues of which indeed i already had some knowledgeand all this while for five long years i kept my hands clean and my heart pure and did no evil in the sight of god or man but laboured heavily to acquire all things and to prepare myself for the destiny that awaited me  twice every year greetings and letters came from my father amenemhat and twice every year i sent back my answers asking if the time had come to cease from labour and so the days of my probation sped away till i grew faint and weary at heart for being now a man ay and learned i longed to make a beginning of the life of men and often i wondered if this talk and prophecy of the things that were to be was but a dream born of the brains of men whose wish ran before their thought i was indeed of the royal blood that i knew for my uncle sepa the priest showed me a secret record of the descent traced without break from father to son and graven in mystic symbols on a tablet of the stone of syene but of what avail was it to be royal by right when egypt my heritage was a slavea slave to do the pleasure and minister to the luxury of the macedonian lagidæay and when she had been so long a serf that perchance she had forgotten how to put off the servile smile of bondage and once more to look across the world with freedoms happy eyes  then i bethought me of my prayer upon the pylon tower of abouthis and of the answer given to my prayer and wondered if that too were a dream  and one night as weary with study i walked within the sacred grove that is in the garden of the temple and mused thus i met my uncle sepa who also was walking and thinking  hold he cried in his great voice why is thy face so sad harmachis has the last problem that we studied overwhelmed thee  nay my uncle i answered i am overwhelmed indeed but not of the problem it was a light one my heart is heavy for i am weary of life within these cloisters and the piledup weight of knowledge crushes me it is of no avail to store up force which cannot be used  ah thou art impatient harmachis he answered it is ever the way of foolish youth thou wouldst taste of the battle thou dost tire of watching the breakers fall upon the beach thou wouldst plunge into them and venture the desperate hazard of the war and so thou wouldst be going harmachis the bird would fly the nest as when they are grown the swallows fly from the eaves of the temple well it shall be as thou desirest the hour is at hand i have taught thee all that i have learned and methinks that the pupil has outrun his master and he paused and wiped his bright black eyes for he was very sad at the thought of my departure  and whither shall i go my uncle i asked rejoicing back to abouthis to be initiated into the mysteries of the gods  ay back to abouthis and from abouthis to alexandria and from alexandria to the throne of thy fathers harmachis listen now things are thus thou knowest how cleopatra the queen fled into syria when that false eunuch pothinus set the will of her father aulêtes at naught and raised her brother ptolemy to the sole lordship of egypt thou knowest also how she came back like a queen indeed with a great army in her train and lay at pelusium and how at this juncture the mighty cæsar that great man that greatest of all men sailed with a weak company hither to alexandria from pharsalias bloody field in hot pursuit of pompey but he found pompey already dead having been basely murdered by achillas the general and lucius septimius the chief of the roman legions in egypt and thou knowest how the alexandrians were troubled at his coming and would have slain his lictors then as thou hast heard cæsar seized ptolemy the young king and his sister arsinoë and bade the army of cleopatra and the army of ptolemy under achillas which lay facing each other at pelusium disband and go their ways and for answer achillas marched on cæsar and besieged him straitly in the bruchium at alexandria and so for a while things were and none knew who should reign in egypt but then cleopatra took up the dice and threw them and this was the throw she madein truth it was a bold one for leaving the army at pelusium she came at dusk to the harbour of alexandria and alone with the sicilian apollodorus entered and landed then apollodorus bound her in a bale of rich rugs such as are made in syria and sent the rugs as a present to cæsar and when the rugs were unbound in the palace behold within them was the fairest girl on all the earthay and the most witty and the most learned and she seduced the great cæsareven his weight of years did not avail to protect him from her charmsso that as a fruit of his folly he wellnigh lost his life and all the glory he had gained in a hundred wars  the fool i broke inthe fool thou callest him great but how can the man be truly great who has no strength to stand against a womans wiles cæsar with the world hanging on his word cæsar at whose breath forty legions marched and changed the fate of peoples cæsar the cold the farseeing the herocæsar to fall like a ripe fruit into a false girls lap why in the issue of what common clay was this roman cæsar and how poor a thing  but sepa looked at me and shook his head be not so rash harmachis and talk not with so proud a voice knowest thou not that in every suit of mail there is a joint and woe to him who wears the harness if the sword should search it out for woman in her weakness is yet the strongest force upon the earth she is the helm of all things human she comes in many shapes and knocks at many doors she is quick and patient and her passion is not ungovernable like that of man but as a gentle steed that she can guide een where she will and as occasion offers can now bit up and now give rein she has a captains eye and stout must be that fortress of the heart in which she finds no place of vantage does thy blood beat fast in youth she will outrun it nor will her kisses tire art thou set toward ambition she will unlock thy inner heart and show thee roads that lead to glory art thou worn and weary she has comfort in her breast art thou fallen she can lift thee up and to the illusion of thy sense gild defeat with triumph ay harmachis she can do these things for nature ever fights upon her side and while she does them she can deceive and shape a secret end in which thou hast no part and thus woman rules the world for her are wars for her men spend their strength in gathering gains for her they do well and ill and seek for greatness to find oblivion but still she sits like yonder sphinx and smiles and no man has ever read all the riddle of her smile or known all the mystery of her heart mock not mock not harmachis for he must be great indeed who can defy the power of woman which pressing round him like the invisible air is often strongest when the senses least discover it  i laughed aloud thou speakest earnestly my uncle sepa i said one might almost think that thou hadst not come unscathed through this fierce fire of temptation well for myself i fear not woman and her wiles i know naught of them and naught do i wish to know and i still hold that this cæsar was a fool had i stood where cæsar stood to cool its wantonness that bale of rugs should have been rolled down the palace steps into the harbour mud  nay cease cease he cried aloud it is evil to speak thus may the gods avert the omen and preserve to thee this cold strength of which thou boastest oh man thou knowest notthou in thy strength and beauty that is without compare in the power of thy learning and the sweetness of thy tonguethou knowest not the world where thou must mix is not a sanctuary as that of the divine isis but thereit may be so pray that thy hearts ice may never melt so thou shalt be great and happy and egypt shall be delivered and now let me take up my talethou seest harmachis even in so grave a story woman claims her place the young ptolemy cleopatras brother being loosed of cæsar treacherously turned on him then cæsar and mithridates stormed the camp of ptolemy who took to flight across the river but his boat was sunk by the fugitives who pressed upon it and such was the miserable end of ptolemy  thereon the war being ended though she had but then borne him a son cæsarion cæsar appointed the younger ptolemy to rule with cleopatra and be her husband in name and he himself departed for rome bearing with him the beautiful princess arsinoë to follow his triumph in her chains but the great cæsar is no more he died as he had lived in blood and right royally and but now cleopatra the queen if my tidings may be trusted has slain ptolemy her brother and husband by poison and taken the child cæsarion to be her fellow on the throne which she holds by the help of the roman legions and as they say of young sextus pompeius who has succeeded cæsar in her love but harmachis the whole land boils and seethes against her in every city the children of khem talk of the deliverer who is to comeand thou art he harmachis the time is almost ripe the hour is nigh at hand go thou back to abouthis and learn the last secrets of the gods and meet those who shall direct the bursting of the storm then act harmachisact i say and strike home for khem rid the land of the roman and the greek and take thy place upon the throne of thy divine fathers and be a king of men for to this end thou wast born o prince    chapter v  of the return of harmachis to abouthis of the celebration of the mysteries of the chant of isis and of the warning of amenemhat  on the next day i embraced my uncle sepa and with an eager heart departed from annu back to abouthis to be short i came thither in safety having been absent five years and a month being now no more a boy but a man full grown and having my mind well stocked with the knowledge of men and the ancient wisdom of egypt so once again i saw the old lands and the known faces though of these some few were wanting having been gathered to osiris now as riding across the fields i came nigh to the enclosure of the temple the priests and people issued forth to bid me welcome and with them the old wife atoua who but for a few added wrinkles that time had cut upon her forehead was just as she had been when she threw the sandal after me five long years before  la la la she cried and there thou art my bonny lad more bonny even than thou wert la what a man what shoulders and what a face and form ah it does an old woman credit to have dandled thee but thou art overpale those priests down there at annu have starved thee surely starve not thyself the gods love not a skeleton empty stomach makes empty head as they say at alexandria but this is a glad hour ay a joyous hour come income in and as i lighted down she embraced me  but i thrust her aside my father where is my father i cried i see him not  nay nay have no fear she answered his holiness is well he waits thee in his chamber there pass on o happy day o happy abouthis  so i went or rather ran and reached the chamber of which i have written and there at the table sat my father amenemhat the same as he had been but very old i came to him and kneeling before him kissed his hand and he blessed me  look up my son he said let my old eyes gaze upon thy face that i may read thy heart  so i lifted up my head and he looked upon me long and earnestly  i read thee he said at length thou art pure and strong in wisdom i have not been deceived in thee oh the years have been lonely but i did well to send thee hence now tell me of thy life for thy letters have told me little and thou canst not know my son how hungry is a fathers heart  and so i told him we sat far into the night and talked together and in the end he bade me know that i must now prepare to be initiated into those last mysteries that are learned of the chosen of the gods  and so it came about that for a space of three months i prepared myself according to the holy customs i ate no meat i was constant in the sanctuaries in the study of the secrets of the great sacrifice and of the woe of the holy mother i watched and prayed before the altars i lifted up my soul to god ay in dreams i communed with the invisible till at length earth and earths desires seemed to pass from me i longed no more for the glory of this world my heart hung above it as an eagle on his outstretched wings and the voice of the worlds blame could not stir it and the vision of its beauty brought no delight for above me was the vast vault of heaven where in unalterable procession the stars pass on drawing after them the destinies of men where the holy ones sit upon their burning thrones and watch the chariotwheels of fate as they roll from sphere to sphere o hours of holy contemplation who having once tasted of your joy could wish again to grovel on the earth o vile flesh to drag us down i would that thou hadst then altogether fallen from me and left my spirit free to seek osiris  the months of probation passed but too swiftly and now the holy day drew near when i was in truth to be united to the universal mother never hath night so longed for the promise of the dawn never hath the heart of a lover so passionately desired the sweet coming of his bride as i longed to see thy glorious face o isis even now that i have been faithless to thee and thou art far from me o divine my soul goes out to thee and once more i knowbut as it is bidden that i should draw the veil and speak of things which have not been told since the beginning of this world let me pass on and reverently set down the history of that holy morn  for seven days the great festival had been celebrated the suffering of the lord osiris had been commemorated the grief of the mother isis had been sung and glory had been done to the memory of the coming of the divine child horus the son the avenger the godbegot all these things had been carried out according to the ancient rites the boats had floated on the sacred lake the priests had scourged themselves before the sanctuaries and the images had been borne through the streets at night  and now as the sun sank on the seventh day once more the great procession gathered to chant the woes of isis and tell how the evil was avenged we went in silence from the temple and passed through the city ways first came those who clear the path then my father amenemhat in all his priestly robes and the wand of cedar in his hand then clad in pure linen i the neophyte followed alone and after me the whiterobed priests holding aloft banners and emblems of the gods next came those who bear the sacred boat and after them the singers and the mourners while stretching as far as the eye could reach all the people marched clad in melancholy black because osiris was no more we went in silence through the city streets till at length we came to the wall of the temple and passed in and as my father the high priest entered beneath the gateway of the outer pylon a sweetvoiced woman singer began to sing the holy chant and thus she sang       sing we osiris dead      lament the fallen head      the light has left the world the world is grey      athwart the starry skies      the web of darkness flies      and isis weeps osiris passed away      your tears ye stars ye fires ye rivers shed      weep children of the nile weep for your lord is dead  she paused in her most sweet song and the whole multitude took up the melancholy dirge       softly we tread our measured footsteps falling      within the sanctuary sevenfold      soft on the dead that liveth are we calling      return osiris from thy kingdom cold      return to them that worship thee of old  the chorus ceased and once again she sang       within the court divine      the sevenfold sacred shrine      we pass while echoes of the temple walls      repeat the long lament      the sound of sorrow sent      far up within the imperishable halls      where each in the others arms the sisters weep      isis and nephthys oer his unawaking sleep  and then again rolled forth the solemn chorus of a thousand voices       softly we tread our measured footsteps falling      within the sanctuary sevenfold      soft on the dead that liveth are we calling      return osiris from thy kingdom cold      return to them that worship thee of old it ceased and sweetly she took up the song       o dweller in the west      lover and lordliest      thy love thy sister isis calls thee home      come from thy chamber dun      thou master of the sun      thy shadowy chamber far below the foam      with weary wings and spent      through all the firmament      through all the horrorhaunted ways of hell      i seek thee near and far      from star to wandering star      free with the dead that in amenti dwell      i search the height the deep the lands the skies      rise from the dead and live our lord osiris rise       softly we tread our measured footsteps falling      within the sanctuary sevenfold      soft on the dead that liveth are we calling      return osiris from thy kingdom cold      return to them that worship thee of old  now in a strain more high and glad the singer sang       he wakesfrom forth the prison      we sing osiris risen      we sing the child that nout conceived and bare      thine own love isis waits      the warden of the gates      she breathes the breath of life on breast and hair      and in her breast and breath      behold he waketh      behold at length he riseth out of rest      touched with her holy hands      the lord of all the lands      he stirs he rises from her breath her breast      but thou fell typhon fly      the judgment day drawn nigh      fleet on thy track as flame speeds horus from the sky       softly we tread our measured footsteps falling      within the sanctuary sevenfold      soft on the dead that liveth are we calling      return osiris from thy kingdom cold      return to them that worship thee of old  once more as we bowed before the holy she sang and sent the full breath of her glad music ringing up the everlasting walls till the silence quivered with her round notes of melody and the hearts of those who hearkened stirred strangely in the breast and thus as we walked she sang the song of osiris risen the song of hope the song of victory       sing we the trinity      sing we the holy three      sing we and praise we and worship the throne      throne that our lord hath set      there peace and truth are met      there in the halls of the holy alone      there in the shadowings      faint of the folded wings      there shall we dwell and rejoice in our rest      we that thy servants are      horus drive ill afar      far in the folds of the dark of the west  again as her notes died away thundered forth the chorus of all the voices       softly we tread our measured footsteps falling      within the sanctuary sevenfold      soft on the dead that liveth are we calling      return osiris from thy kingdom cold      return to them that worship thee of old  the chanting ceased and as the sun sank the high priest raised the statue of the living god and held it before the multitude that was now gathered in the court of the temple then with a mighty and joyful shout of  osiris our hope osiris osiris  the people tore their black wrappings from their dress revealing the white robes they wore beneath and as one man they bowed before the god and the feast was ended   but for me the ceremony was only begun for tonight was the night of my initiation leaving the inner court i bathed myself and clad in pure linen passed as it is ordained into an inner but not the inmost sanctuary and laid the accustomed offerings on the altar then lifting my hands to heaven i remained for many hours in contemplation striving by holy thoughts and prayer to gather up my strength against the mighty moment of my trial  the hours sped slowly in the silence of the temple till at length the door opened and my father amenemhat the high priest came in clad in white and leading by the hand the priest of isis for having been married he did not himself enter into the mysteries of the holy mother  i rose to my feet and stood humbly before them  art thou ready said the priest lifting the lamp he held so that its light fell upon my face o thou chosen one art thou ready to see the glory of the goddess face to face  i am ready i answered  behold thee he said again in solemn tones it is no small thing if thou wilt carry out this thy last desire understand royal harmachis that now this very night thou must die for a while in the flesh what time thy soul shall look on spiritual things and if thou diest and any evil shall be found within thy heart when thou comest at last into that awful presence woe unto thee harmachis for the breath of life shall no more enter in at the gateway of thy mouth thy body shall utterly perish and what shall befall thy other parts if i know i may not say art thou prepared to be taken to the breast of her who was and is and shall be and in all things to do her holy will for her while she shall so command to put away the thought of earthly woman and to labour always for her glory till at the end thy life is gathered to her eternal life        according to the egyptian religion the being man is      composed of four parts the body the double or astral shape      ka the soul bi and the spark of life sprung from      the godhead khoueditor  i am i answered lead on  it is well said the priest noble amenemhat we go hence alone  farewell my son said my father be firm and triumph over things spiritual as thou shalt triumph over things earthly he who would truly rule the world must first be lifted up above the world he must be at one with god for thus only shall he learn the secrets of the divine but beware the gods demand much of those who dare to enter the circle of their divinity if they go back therefrom they shall be judged of a sharper law and scourged with a heavier rod for as their glory is so shall their shame be therefore make thy heart strong royal harmachis and when thou speedest down the ways of night and enterest the holies remember that from him to whom great gifts have been given shall gifts be required again and nowif indeed thy mind be fixedgo whither it is not as yet given me to follow thee farewell  for a moment as my heart weighed these heavy words i wavered as well as i might but i was filled with longing to be gathered to the company of the divine ones and i knew that i had no evil in me and desired to do only the thing that is just therefore having with so much labour drawn the bowstring to my ear i was fain to let fly the shaft lead on i cried with a loud voice lead on thou holy priest i follow thee  and we went forth    chapter vi  of the initiation of harmachis of his visions of his passing to the city that is in the place of death and of the declarations of isis the messenger  in silence we passed into the shrine of isis it was dark and bareonly the feeble light from the lamp gleamed faintly upon the sculptured walls where in a hundred effigies the holy mother suckled the holy child  the priest closed the doors and bolted them once again he said art thou ready harmachis  once again i answered i am ready  he spoke no more but having lifted up his hands in prayer led me to the centre of the holy and with a swift motion put out the lamp  look before thee harmachis he cried and his voice sounded hollow in the solemn place  i gazed and saw nothing but from the niche that is high in the wall where is hid that sacred symbol of the goddess on which few may look there came a sound as of the rattling rods of the sistrum and as i listened awestruck behold i saw the outline of the symbol drawn as with fire upon the blackness of the air it hung above my head and rattled while it hung and as it turned i clearly saw the face of the mother isis that is graven on the one side and signifies unending birth and the face of her holy sister nephthys that is graven on the other and signifies the ending of all birth in death        a musical instrument peculiarly sacred to isis of which      the shape and rods had a mystic significanceeditor  slowly it turned and swung as though some mystic dancer trod the air above me and shook it in her hand but at length the light went out and the rattling ceased  then of a sudden the end of the chamber became luminous and in that white light i beheld picture after picture i saw the ancient nile rolling through deserts to the sea there were no men upon its banks nor any signs of man nor any temples to the gods only wild birds moved on sihors lonely face and monstrous brutes plunged and wallowed in his waters the sun sank in majesty behind the libyan desert and stained the waters red the mountains towered up towards the silent sky but in mountain desert and river there was no sign of human life then i knew that i saw the world as it had been before man was and a terror of its loneliness entered my soul  the picture passed and another rose up in its place once again i saw the banks of sihor and on them crowded wildfaced creatures partaking of the nature of the ape more than of the nature of mankind they fought and slew each other the wild birds sprang up in affright as the fire leapt from reed huts given by foemens hands to flame and pillage they stole and rent and murdered dashing out the brains of children with axes of stone and though no voice told me i knew that i saw man as he was tens of thousands of years ago when first he marched across the earth  yet another picture again i beheld the banks of sihor but on them fair cities bloomed like flowers in and out their gates went men and women passing to and fro from wide welltilled lands but i saw no guards or armies and no weapons of war all was wisdom prosperity and peace and while i wondered a glorious figure clad in raiment that shone as flame came from the gates of a shrine and the sound of music went before and followed after him he mounted an ivory throne which was set in a marketplace facing the water and as the sun sank called in all the multitudes to prayer with one voice they prayed bending in adoration and i understood that herein was shown the reign of the gods on earth which was long before the days of menes  a change came over the dream still the same fair city but other menmen with greed and evil on their faceswho hated the bonds of righteous doing and set their hearts on sin the evening came the glorious figure mounted the throne and called to prayer but none bowed themselves in adoration  we are aweary of thee they cried make evil king slay him slay him and loose the bonds of evil make evil king  the glorious shape rose up gazing with mild eyes upon those wicked men  ye know not what ye ask he cried but as ye will so be it for if i die by me after much travail shall ye once again find a path to the kingdom of good  even as he spoke a form foul and hideous to behold leapt upon him cursing slew him tore him limb from limb and amidst the clamour of the people sat himself upon the throne and ruled but a shape whose face was veiled passed down from heaven on shadowy wings and with lamentations gathered up the rent fragments of the being a moment she bent herself upon them then lifted up her hands and wept and as she wept behold from her side there sprang a warrior armed and with a face like the face of ra at noon he the avenger hurled himself with a shout upon the monster who had usurped the throne and they closed in battle and struggling ever in a strait embrace passed upward to the skies  then came picture after picture i saw powers and peoples clad in various robes and speaking many tongues i saw them pass and pass in millionsloving hating struggling dying some few were happy and some had woe stamped upon their faces but most bore not the seal of happiness nor of woe but rather that of patience and ever as they passed from age to age high above in the heavens the avenger fought on with the evil thing while the scale of victory swung now here now there but neither conquered nor was it given to me to know how the battle ended  and i understood that what i had beheld was the holy vision of the struggle between the good and the evil powers i saw that man was created vile but those who are above took pity on him and came down to him to make him good and happy for the two things are one thing but man returned to his wicked way and then the bright spirit of good who is of us called osiris but who has many names offered himself up for the evildoing of the race that had dethroned him and from him and the divine mother of whom all nature is sprang another spirit who is the protector of us on earth as osiris is our justifier in amenti  for this is the mystery of the osiris  of a sudden as i saw the visions these things became clear to me the mummy cloths of symbol and of ceremony that wrap osiris round fell from him and i understood the secret of religion which is sacrifice  the pictures passed and again the priest my guide spoke to me  hast thou understood harmachis those things which it has been granted thee to see  i have i said are the rites ended  nay they are but begun that which follows thou must endure alone behold i leave thee to return at the morning light once more i warn thee that which thou shalt see few may look upon and live in all my days i have known but three who dared to face this dread hour and of those three at dawn but one was found alive myself i have not trod this path it is too high for me  depart i said my soul is athirst for knowledge i will dare it  he laid his hand upon my shoulder and blessed me he went i heard the door shut to behind him the echoes of his footsteps slowly died away  then i felt that i was alone alone in the holy place with things which are not of the earth silence fellsilence deep and black as the darkness which was around me the silence fell it gathered as the cloud gathered on the face of the moon that night when a lad i prayed upon the pylon towers it gathered denser and yet more dense till it seemed to creep into my heart and call aloud therein for utter silence has a voice that is more terrible than any cry i spoke the echoes of my words came back upon me from the walls and seemed to beat me down the stillness was lighter to endure than an echo such as this what was i about to see should i die even now in the fulness of my youth and strength terrible were the warnings that had been given to me i was fearstricken and bethought me that i would fly flyfly whither the temple door was barred i could not fly i was alone with the godhead alone with the power that i had invoked nay my heart was puremy heart was pure i would face the terror that was to come ay even though i died  isis holy mother i prayed isis spouse of heaven come unto me be with me now i faint be with me now  and then i knew that things were not as things had been the air around me began to stir it rustled as the wings of eagles rustle it took life bright eyes gazed upon me strange whispers shook my soul upon the darkness were bars of light they changed and interchanged they moved to and fro and wove mystic symbols which i could not read swifter and swifter flew that shuttle of the light the symbols grouped gathered faded gathered yet again faster and still more fast till my eyes could count them no more now i was afloat upon a sea of glory it surged and rolled as the ocean rolls it tossed me high it brought me low glory was piled on glory splendour heaped on splendours head and i rode above it all  soon the lights began to pale in the rolling sea of air great shadows shot across it lines of darkness pierced it and rushed together on its breast till at length i was only a shape of flame set like a star on the bosom of immeasurable night bursts of awful music gathered from far away miles and miles away i heard them thrilling faintly through the gloom on they came nearer and more near louder and more loud till they swept past above below around me swept on rushing pinions terrifying and enchanting me they floated by ever growing fainter till they died in space then others came and no two were akin some rattled as ten thousand sistra shaken all to tune some rank from the brazen throats of unnumbered clarions some pealed with a loud sweet chant of voices that were more than human and some rolled along in the slow thunder of a million drums they passed their notes were lost in dying echoes and the silence once more pressed in upon me and overcame me  the strength within me began to fail i felt my life ebbing at its springs death drew near to me and his shape was silence he entered at my heart entered with a sense of numbing cold but my brain was still alive i could yet think i knew that i was drawing near the confines of the dead nay i was dying fast and oh the horror of it i strove to pray and could not there was no more time for prayer one struggle and the stillness crept into my brain the terror passed an unfathomable weight of sleep pressed me down i was dying i was dying and thennothingness  i was dead  a changelife came back to me but between the new life and the life that had been was a gulf and difference once again i stood in the darkness of the shrine but it blinded me no more it was clear as the light of day although it still was black i stood and yet it was not i who stood but rather my spiritual part for at my feet lay my dead self there it lay rigid and still a stamp of awful calm sealed upon its face while i gazed on it  and as i gazed filled with wonder i was caught up on the wings of flame and whirled away away faster than the lightnings flash down i fell through depths of empty space set here and there with glittering crowns of stars down for ten million miles and ten times ten million till at length i hovered over a place of soft unchanging light wherein were temples palaces and abodes such as no man ever saw in the visions of his sleep they were built of flame and they were built of blackness their spires pierced up and up their great courts stretched around even as i hovered they changed continually to the eye what was flame became blackness what was blackness became flame here was the flash of crystal and there the blaze of gems shone even through the glory that rolls around the city which is in the place of death there were trees and their voice as they rustled was the voice of music there was air and as it blew its breath was the sobbing notes of song  shapes changing mysterious wonderful rushed up to meet me and bore me down till i seemed to stand upon another earth  who comes cried a great voice  harmachis answered the shapes that changed continually harmachis who hath been summoned from the earth to look upon the face of her that was and is and shall be harmachis child of earth  throw back the gates and open wide the doors pealed the awful voice throw back the gates and open wide the doors seal up his lips in silence lest his voice jar upon the harmonies of heaven take away his sight lest he see that which may not be seen and let harmachis who hath been summoned pass down the path that leads to the place of the unchanging pass on child of earth but before thou goest look up that thou mayest learn how far thou art removed from earth  i looked up beyond the glory that shone about the city was black night and high on its bosom twinkled one tiny star  behold the world that thou hast left said the voice behold and tremble  then my lips and eyes were sealed with silence and with darkness so that i was dumb and blind the gates rolled back the doors swung wide and i was swept into the city that is in the place of death i was swept swiftly i know not whither till at length i stood upon my feet again the great voice pealed  draw the veil of blackness from his eyes unseal the silence on his lips that harmachis child of earth may see hear and understand and make adoration at the shrine of her that was and is and shall be  and my lips and eyes were touched once more so that my sight and speech came back  behold i stood within a hall of blackest marble so lofty that even in the rosy light scarce could my vision reach the great groins of the roof music wailed about its spaces and all adown its length stood winged spirits fashioned in living fire and such was the brightness of their forms that i could not look on them in its centre was an altar small and square and i stood before the empty altar then again the voice cried  o thou that hast been art and shalt be thou who having many names art yet without a name measurer of time messenger of god guardian of the worlds and the races that dwell thereon universal mother born of nothingness creatix uncreated living splendour without form living form without substance servant of the invisible child of law holder of the scales and sword of fate vessel of life through whom all life flows to whom it again is gathered recorder of things done executrix of decreeshear  harmachis the egyptian who by thy will hath been summoned from the earth waits before thine altar with ears unstopped with eyes unsealed and with an open heart hear and descend descend o manyshaped descend in flame descend in sound descend in spirit hear and descend    the voice ceased and there was silence then through the silence came a sound like the booming of the sea it passed and presently moved thereto by i know not what i raised my eyes from my hands with which i had covered them and saw a small dark cloud hanging over the altar in and out of which a fiery serpent climbed  then all the spirits clad in light fell upon the marble floor and with a loud voice adored but what they said i could not understand behold the dark cloud came down and rested on the altar the serpent of fire stretched itself towards me touched me on the forehead with its forky tongue and was gone from within the cloud a voice sweet and low and clear spoke in heavenly accents  depart ye ministers leave me with my son whom i have summoned  then like arrows rushing from a bow the flameclad spirits leapt from the ground and sped away  o harmachis said the voice be not afraid i am she whom thou dost know as isis of the egyptians but what else i am strive not thou to learn it is beyond thy strength for i am all things life is my spirit and nature is my raiment i am the laughter of the babe i am the maidens love i am the mothers kiss i am the child and servant of the invisible that is god that is law that is fatethough myself i be not god and fate and law when winds blow and oceans roar upon the face of the earth thou hearest my voice when thou gazest on the starry firmament thou seest my countenance when the spring blooms out in flowers that is my smile harmachis for i am natures self and all her shapes are shapes of me i breathe in all that breathes i wax and wane in the changeful moon i grow and gather in the tides i rise with the suns i flash with the lightning and thunder in the storms nothing is too great for the measure of my majesty nothing is so small that i cannot find a home therein i am in thee and thou art in me o harmachis that which bade thee be bade me also be therefore though i am great and thou art little have no fear for we are bound together by the common bond of lifethat life which flows through suns and stars and spaces through spirits and the souls of men welding all nature to a whole that changing ever is yet eternally the same  i bowed my headi could not speak for i was afraid  faithfully hast thou served me o my son went on the low sweet voice greatly thou hast longed to be brought face to face with me here in amenti and greatly hast thou dared to accomplish thy desire for it is no small thing to cast off the tabernacle of the flesh and before the appointed time if only for an hour put on the raiment of the spirit and greatly o my servant and my son have i too desired to look on thee there where i am for the gods love those who love them but with a wider and deeper love and under one who is as far from me as i am from thee mortal i am a god of gods therefore i have caused thee to be brought hither harmachis and therefore i speak to thee my son and bid thee commune with me now face to face as thou didst commune that night upon the temple towers of abouthis for i was there with thee harmachis as i was in ten thousand other worlds it was i o harmachis who laid the lotus in thy hand giving thee the sign which thou didst seek for thou art of the kingly blood of my children who served me from age to age and if thou dost not fail thou shalt sit upon that kingly throne and restore my ancient worship in its purity and sweep my temples from their defilements but if thou dost fail then shall the eternal spirit isis become but a memory in egypt  the voice paused and gathering up my strength at length i spoke aloud  tell me o holy i said shall i then fail  ask me not answered the voice that which it is not lawful that i should answer thee perchance i can read that which shall befall thee perchance it doth not please me so to read what can it profit the divine that hath all time wherein to await the issues to be eager to look upon the blossom that is not blown but which lying a seed in the bosom of the earth shall blow in its season know harmachis that i do not shape the future the future is to thee and not to me for it is born of law and of the rule ordained of the invisible yet thou art free to act therein and thou shalt win or thou shalt fail according to thy strength and the measure of thy hearts purity thine be the burden harmachis as thine in the event shall be the glory or the shame little do i reck of the issue i who am but the minister of what is written now hear me i will always be with thee my son for my love once given can never be taken away though by sin it may seem lost to thee remember then this if thou dost triumph thy guerdon shall be great if thou dost fail heavy indeed shall be thy punishment both in the flesh and in the land that thou callest amenti yet this for thy comfort shame and agony shall not be eternal for however deep the fall from righteousness if but repentance holds the heart there is a patha stony and a cruel pathwhereby the height may be climbed again let it not be thy lot to follow it harmachis  and now because thou hast loved me my son and wandering through the maze of fable wherein men lose themselves upon the earth mistaking the substance for the spirit and the altar for the god hast yet grasped a clue of truth the manyfaced and because i love thee and look on to the day that perchance shall come when thou shalt dwell blessed in my light and in the doing of my tasks because of this i say it shall be given to thee o harmachis to hear the word whereby i may be summoned from the uttermost by one who hath communed with me and to look upon the face of isiseven into the eyes of the messenger and not die the death  behold  the sweet voice ceased the dark cloud upon the altar changed and changedit grew white it shone and seemed at length to take the shrouded shape of a woman then the golden snake crept from its heart once more and like a living diadem twined itself about the cloudy brows  now suddenly a voice called aloud the awful word then the vapours burst and melted and with my eyes i saw that glory at the very thought of which my spirit faints but what i saw it is not lawful to utter for though i have been bidden to write what i have written of this matter perchance that a record may remain thereon i have been warneday even now after these many years i saw and what i saw cannot be imagined for there are glories and there are shapes which are beyond the reach of mans imagination i sawthen with the echo of that word and the memory of that sight stamped for ever on my heart my spirit failed me and i sank down before the glory  and as i fell it seemed that the great hall burst open and crumbled into flakes of fire round me then a great wind blew there was a sound as the sound of worlds rushing down the flood of timeand i knew no more    chapter vii  of the awaking of harmachis of the ceremony of his crowning as pharaoh of the upper and the lower land and of the offerings made to pharaoh  once again i woketo find myself stretched at length upon the stone flooring of the holy place of isis that is at abouthis by me stood the old priest of the mysteries and in his hand was a lamp he bent over me and gazed earnestly upon my face  it is daythe day of thy new birth and thou hast lived to see it harmachis he said at length i give thanks arise royal harmachisnay tell me naught of that which has befallen thee arise beloved of the holy mother come forth thou who hast passed the fire and learned what lies behind the darknesscome forth o newlyborn  i rose and walking faintly went with him and passing out of the darkness of the shrines filled with thought and wonder came once more into the pure light of the morning and then i went to my own chamber and slept nor did any dreams come to trouble me but no mannot even my fatherasked me aught of what i saw upon that dread night or after what fashion i had communed with the goddess  after these things which have been written i applied myself for a space to the worship of the mother isis and to the further study of the outward forms of those mysteries to which i now held the key moreover i was instructed in matters politic for many great men of our following came secretly to see me from all quarters of egypt and told me much of the hatred of the people towards cleopatra the queen and of other things at last the hour drew nigh it was three months and ten days from the night when for a while i left the flesh and yet living with our life was gathered to the breast of isis on which it was agreed that with due and customary rites although in utter secrecy i should be called to the throne of the upper and the lower land so it came about that as the solemn time drew nigh great men of the party of egypt gathered to the number of thirtyseven from every nome and each great city of their nome meeting together at abouthis they came in every guisesome as priests some as pilgrims to the shrine and some as beggars among them was my uncle sepa who though he clad himself as a travelling doctor had much ado to keep his loud voice from betraying him indeed i myself knew him by it meeting him as i walked in thought upon the banks of the canal although it was then dusk and the great cape which after the fashion of such doctors he had thrown about his head half hid his face  a pest on thee he cried when i greeted him by his name cannot a man cease to be himself for a single hour didst thou but know the pains that it has cost me to learn to play this partand now thou readest who i am even in the dark  and then still talking in his loud voice he told me how he had travelled hither on foot the better to escape the spies who ply to and fro upon the river but he said he should return by the water or take another guise for since he had come as a doctor he had been forced to play a doctors part knowing but little of the arts of medicine and as he greatly feared there were many between annu and abouthis who had suffered from it and he laughed loudly and embraced me forgetting his part for he was too whole at heart to be an actor and other than himself and would have entered abouthis with me holding my hand had i not chid him for his folly        in ancient egypt an unskilful or negligent physician was      liable to very heavy penaltieseditor  at length all were gathered  it was night and the gates of the temple were shut none were left within them except the thirtyseven my father the high priest amenemhat that aged priest who had led me to the shrine of isis the old wife atoua who according to ancient custom was to prepare me for the anointing and some five other priests sworn to secrecy by that oath which none may break they gathered in the second hall of the great temple but i remained alone clad in my white robe in the passage where are the names of sixandseventy ancient kings who were before the day of the divine sethi there i rested in darkness till at length my father amenemhat came bearing a lamp and bowing low before me led me by the hand forth into the great hall here and there between its mighty pillars lights were burning that dimly showed the sculptured images upon the walls and dimly fell upon the long line of the sevenandthirty lords priests and princes who seated upon carven chairs awaited my coming in silence before them facing away from the seven sanctuaries a throne was set around which stood the priests holding the sacred images and banners as i came into the dim and holy place the dignitaries rose and bowed before me speaking no word while my father led me to the steps of the throne and in a low voice bade me stand before it  then he spoke  lords priests and princes of the ancient orders of the land of khemnobles from the upper and the lower country have gathered in answer to my summons hear me i present to you with such scant formality as the occasion can afford the prince harmachis by right and true descent of blood the descendant and heir of the ancient pharaohs of our most unhappy land he is priest of the inmost circle of the mysteries of the divine isis master of the mysterieshereditary priest of the pyramids which are by memphis instructed in the solemn rites of the holy osiris is there any among you who has aught to urge against the true line of his blood  he paused and my uncle sepa rising from his chair spoke we have made examination of the records and there is none o amenemhat he is of the royal blood his descent is true  is there any among you went on my father who can deny that this royal harmachis by sanction of the very gods has been gathered to isis been shown the way of the osiris been admitted to be the hereditary high priest of the pyramids which are by memphis and of the temples of the pyramids  then that old priest rose who had been my guide in the sanctuary of the mother and made answer there is none o amenemhat i know these things of my own knowledge  once more my father spoke is there any among you who has aught to urge against this royal harmachis in that by wickedness of heart or life by uncleanliness or falsity it is not fit or meet that we should crown him lord of all the lands  then an aged prince of memphis arose and made answer  we have inquired of these matters there is none o amenemhat  it is well said my father then naught is wanting in the prince harmachis seed of nektnebf the osirian let the woman atoua stand forth and tell this company those things that came to pass when at the hour of her death she who was my wife prophesied over this prince being filled with the spirit of the hathors  thereon old atoua crept forward from the shadow of the columns and earnestly told those things that have been written  ye have heard said my father do you believe that the woman who was my wife spake with the divine voice  we do they answered  now my uncle sepa rose and spoke  royal harmachis thou hast heard know now that we are gathered here to crown thee king of the upper and the lower landsthy holy father amenemhat renouncing all his right on thy behalf we are met not indeed in that pomp and ceremony which is due to the occasionfor what we do must be done in secret lest our lives and the cause that is more dear to us than life should pay the forfeitbut yet with such dignity and observance of the ancient rites as our circumstance may command learn now how this matter hangs and if after learning thy mind consents thereto then mount thy throne o pharaohand swear the oath  long has khemi groaned beneath the mailed heel of the greek and trembled at the shadow of the romans spear long has the ancient worship of its gods been desecrated and its people crushed with oppression but we believe that the hour of deliverance is at hand and with the solemn voice of egypt and by the ancient gods of egypt to whose cause thou art of all men bound we call upon thee prince to be the sword of our deliverance hearken twenty thousand good and leal men are sworn to wait upon thy word and at thy signal to rise as one to put the grecian to the sword and with their blood and substance to build thee a throne set more surely on the soil of khem than are its ancient pyramidssuch a throne as shall even roll the roman legions back and for the signal it shall be the death of that bold harlot cleopatra thou must compass her death harmachis in such fashion as shall be shown to thee and with her blood anoint the royal throne of egypt  canst thou refuse o our hope doth not the holy love of country swell within thy heart canst thou dash the cup of freedom from thy lips and bear to drink the bitter draught of slaves the emprise is great maybe it shall fail and thou with thy life as we with ours shalt pay the price of our endeavour but what of it harmachis is life then so sweet are we so softly cushioned on the stony bed of earth is bitterness and sorrow in its sum so small and scant a thing do we here breathe so divine an air that we should fear to face the passage of our breath what have we here but hope and memory what see we here but shadows shall we then fear to pass purehanded where fulfilment is and memory is lost in its own source and shadows die in the light which cast them o harmachis that man alone is truly blest who crowns his life with fames most splendid wreath for since to all the brood of earth death hands his poppyflowers he indeed is happy to whom there is occasion given to weave them in a crown of glory and how can a man die better than in a great endeavour to strike the gyves from his countrys limbs so that she again may stand in the face of heaven and raise the shrill shout of freedom and clad once more in a panoply of strength trample under foot the fetters of her servitude defying the tyrant nations of the earth to set their seal upon her brow  khem calls thee harmachis come then thou deliverer leap like horus from the firmament break her chains scatter her foes and rule a pharaoh on pharaohs throne  enough enough i cried while the long murmur of applause swept about the columns and up the massy walls enough is there any need to adjure me thus had i a hundred lives would i not most gladly lay them down for egypt  well said well said answered sepa now go forth with the woman yonder that she may make thy hands clean before they touch the sacred emblems and anoint thy brow before it is encircled of the diadem  and so i went into a chamber apart with the old wife atoua there muttering prayers she poured pure water over my hands into a ewer of gold and having dipped a fine cloth into oil wiped my brow with it  o happy egypt she said o happy prince that art come to rule in egypt o royal youthtoo royal to be a priestso shall many a fair woman think but perchance for thee they will relax the priestly rule else how shall the race of pharaoh be carried on o happy i who dandled thee and gave my flesh and blood to save thee o royal and beautiful harmachis born for splendour happiness and love  cease cease i said for her talk jarred upon me call me not happy till thou knowest my end and speak not to me of love for with love comes sorrow and mine is another and a higher way  ay ay so thou sayestand joy too that comes with love never talk lightly of love my king for it brought thee here la la but it is always the waythe goose on the wing laughs at crocodiles so goes their saying down at alexandria but when the goose is asleep on the water it is the crocodiles that laugh not but what women are pretty crocodiles men worship the crocodiles at anthribiscrocodilopolis they call it now dont theybut they worship women all the world over la how my tongue runs on and thou about to be crowned pharaoh did i not prophesy it to thee well thou art clean lord of the double crown go forth  so i went from the chamber with the old wifes foolish talk ringing in my ears though of a truth her folly had ever a grain of wit in it  as i came the dignitaries rose once more and bowed before me then my father without delay drew near me and placed in my hands a golden image of the divine ma the goddess of truth and golden images of the arks of the god amenra of the divine mout and the divine khons and spoke solemnly  thou swearest by the living majesty of ma by the majesty of amenra of mout and of khons  i swear i said  thou swearest by the holy land of khem by sihors flood by the temples of the gods and the eternal pyramids  i swear  remembering thy hideous doom if thou shouldst fail therein thou swearest that thou wilt in all things govern egypt according to its ancient laws that thou wilt preserve the worship of its gods that thou wilt do equal justice that thou wilt not oppress that thou wilt not betray that thou wilt make no alliance with the roman or the greek that thou wilt cast out the foreign idols that thou wilt devote thy life to the liberty of the land of khem  i swear  it is well mount then the throne that in the presence of these thy subjects i may name thee pharaoh  i mounted upon the throne of which the footstool is a sphinx and the canopy the overshadowing wings of ma then amenemhat drew nigh once again and placed the pshent upon my brow and on my head the double crown and the royal robe about my shoulders and in my hands the sceptre and the scourge  royal harmachis he cried by these outward signs and tokens i the high priest of the temple of ramenma at abouthis crown thee pharaoh of the upper and lower land reign and prosper o hope of khemi  reign and prosper pharaoh echoed the dignitaries bowing down before me  then one by one they swore allegiance till all had sworn and having sworn my father took me by the hand he led me in solemn procession into each of the seven sanctuaries that are in this temple of ramenma and in each i made offerings swung incense and officiated as priest clad in the royal robes i made offerings in the shrine of horus in the shrine of isis in the shrine of osiris in the shrine of amenra in the shrine of horemku in the shrine of ptah till at length i reached the shrine of the kings chamber  here they made their offering to me as the divine pharaoh and left me very wearybut a king  here the first and smallest of the papyrus rolls comes to an end     book iithe fall of harmachis    chapter i  of the farewell of amenemhat to harmachis of the coming of harmachis to alexandria of the exhortation of sepa of the passing of cleopatra robed as isis and of the overthrow of the gladiator by harmachis  now the long days of preparation had passed and the time was at hand i was initiated and i was crowned so that although the common folk knew me not or knew me only as priest of isis there were in egypt thousands who at heart bowed down to me as pharaoh the hour was at hand and my soul went forth to meet it for i longed to overthrow the foreigner to set egypt free to mount the throne that was my heritage and cleanse the temples of my gods i was fain for the struggle and i never doubted of its end i looked into the mirror and saw triumph written on my brows the future stretched a path of glory from my feetay glittering with glory like sihor in the sun i communed with my mother isis i sat within my chamber and took counsel with my heart i planned new temples i revolved great laws that i would put forth for my peoples weal and in my ears rang the shouts of exultation which should greet victorious pharaoh on his throne  but still i tarried a little while at abouthis and having been commanded to do so let my hair that had been shorn grow again long and black as the ravens wing instructing myself meanwhile in all manly exercises and feats of arms also for a purpose which shall be seen i perfected myself in the magic art of the egyptians and in the reading of the stars in which things indeed i already have great skill  now this was the plan that had been built up my uncle sepa had for a while left the temple of annu giving out that his health had failed him thence he had moved down to a house in alexandria to gather strength as he said from the breath of the sea and also to learn for himself the wonders of the great museum and the glory of cleopatras court there it was planned that i should join him for there at alexandria the egg of the plot was hatching accordingly when at last the summons came all things being prepared i made ready for the journey and passed into my fathers chamber to receive his blessing before i went there sat the old man as once before he sat when he had rebuked me because i went out to slay the lion his long white beard resting on the table of stone and sacred writings in his hand when i came in he rose from his seat and would have knelt before me crying hail pharaoh but i caught him by the hand  it is not meet my father i said  it is meet he answered it is meet that i should bow before my king but be it as thou wilt and so thou goest harmachis my blessings go with thee o my son and may those whom i serve grant to me that my old eyes may indeed behold thee on the throne i have searched long striving harmachis to read the future that shall be but i can learn naught by all my wisdom it is hid from me and at times my heart fails but hear this there is danger in thy path and it comes in the form of woman i have known it long and therefore thou hast been called to the worship of the heavenly isis who bids her votaries put away the thought of woman till such time as she shall think well to slacken the rule oh my son i would that thou wert not so strong and fairstronger and fairer indeed than any man in egypt as a king should befor in that strength and beauty may lie a cause of stumbling beware then of those witches of alexandria lest like a worm some one of them creep into my heart and eat its secret out  have no fear my father i answered frowning my thought is set on other things than red lips and smiling eyes  it is good he answered so may it befall and now farewell when next we meet may it be in that happy hour when with all the priests of the upper land i move down from abouthis to do my homage to pharaoh on his throne  so i embraced him and went alas i little thought how we should meet again    thus it came about that once more i passed down the nile travelling as a man of no estate and to such as were curious about me it was given out that i was the adopted son of the high priest of abouthis having been brought up to the priesthood and that i had at the last refused the service of the gods and chosen to go to alexandria to seek my fortune for be it remembered i was still held to be the grandson of the old wife atoua by all those who did not know the truth  on the tenth night sailing with the wind we reached the mighty city of alexandria the city of a thousand lights above them all towered the white pharos that wonder of the world from the crown of which a light like the light of the sun blazed out across the waters of the harbour to guide mariners on their way across the sea the vessel having been cautiously made fast to the quay for it was night i disembarked and stood wondering at the vast mass of houses and confused by the clamour of many tongues for here all peoples seemed to be gathered together each speaking after the fashion of his own land and as i stood a young man came and touched me on the shoulder asking me if i was from abouthis and named harmachis i said yea then bending over me he whispered the secret password into my ear and beckoning to two slaves bade them bring my baggage from the ship this they did fighting their way through the crowd of porters who were clamouring for hire then i followed him down the quay which was bordered with drinkingplaces where all sorts of men were gathered tippling wine and watching the dancing of women some of whom were but scantily arrayed and some not arrayed at all  and so we went through the lamplit houses till at last we reached the shore of the great harbour and turned to the right along a wide way paved with granite and bordered by strong houses having cloisters in front of them the like of which i had never seen turning once more to the right we came to a quieter portion of the city where except for parties of strolling revellers the streets were still presently my guide halted at a house built of white stone we passed in and crossing a small courtyard entered a chamber where there was a light and here at last i found my uncle sepa most glad to see me safe  when i had washed and eaten he told me that all things went well and that as yet there was no thought of evil at the court further he said it having come to the ears of the queen that the priest of annu was sojourning at alexandria she sent for him and closely questioned himnot as to any plot for of that she never thought but as to the rumour which had reached her that there was treasure hid in the great pyramid which is by annu for being ever wasteful she was ever in want of money and had bethought her of opening the pyramid but he laughed at her telling her the pyramid was the buryingplace of the divine khufu and that he knew nothing of its secrets then she was angered and swore that so surely as she ruled in egypt she would tear it down stone by stone and discover the secret at its heart again he laughed and in the words of the proverb which they have at alexandria told her that mountains live longer than kings thereon she smiled at his ready answer and let him go also my uncle sepa told me that on the morrow i should see this cleopatra for it was her birthday as indeed it was also mine and dressed in the robes of the holy isis she would pass in state from her palace on the lochias to the serapeum to offer a sacrifice at the shrine of the false god who sits in the temple and he said that thereafter the fashion by which i should gain entrance to the household of the queen should be contrived  then being very weary i went to rest but could sleep little for the strangeness of the place the noises in the streets and the thought of the morrow while it was yet dark i rose climbed the stair to the roof of the house and waited presently the suns rays shot out like arrows and lit upon the white wonder of the marble pharos whose light instantly sank and died as though indeed the sun had killed it now the rays fell upon the palaces of the lochias where cleopatra lay and lit them up till they flamed like a jewel set on the dark cool bosom of the sea away the light flew kissing the somas sacred dome beneath which alexander sleeps touching the high tops of a thousand palaces and temples past the porticoes of the great museum that loomed near at hand striking the lofty shrine where carved of ivory is the image of the false god serapis and at last seeming to lose itself in the vast and gloomy necropolis then as the dawn gathered into day the flood of brightness overbrimming the bowl of night flowed into the lower lands and streets and showed alexandria red in the sunrise as the mantle of a king and shaped as a mantle the etesian wind came up from the north and swept away the vapour from the harbours so that i saw their blue waters rocking a thousand ships i saw too that mighty mole the heptastadium i saw the hundreds of streets the countless houses the innumerable wealth and splendour of alexandria set like a queen between lake mareotis and the ocean and dominating both and i was filled with wonder this then was one city in my heritage of lands and cities well it was worth the grasping and having looked my full and fed my heart as it were with the sight of splendour i communed with the holy isis and came down from the roof  in the chamber beneath was my uncle sepa i told him that i had been watching the sun rise over the city of alexandria  so he said looking at me from beneath his shaggy eyebrows and what thinkest thou of alexandria  i think it is like some city of the gods i answered  ay he replied fiercely a city of the infernal godsa sink of corruption a bubbling well of iniquity a home of false faith springing from false hearts i would that not one stone of it was left upon another stone and that its wealth lay deep beneath yonder waters i would that the gulls were screaming across its site and that the wind untainted by a grecian breath swept through its ruins from the ocean to mareotis o royal harmachis let not the luxury and beauty of alexandria poison thy sense for in their deadly air faith perishes and religion cannot spread her heavenly wings when the hour comes for thee to rule harmachis cast down this accursed city and as thy fathers did set up thy throne in the white walls of memphis for i tell thee that for egypt alexandria is but a splendid gate of ruin and while it endures all nations of the earth shall march through it to the plunder of the land and all false faiths shall nestle in it and breed the overthrow of egypts gods  i made no answer for there was truth in his words and yet to me the city seemed very fair to look on after we had eaten my uncle told me it was now time to set out to view the march of cleopatra as she went in triumph to the shrine of serapis for although she would not pass till within two hours of the midday yet these people of alexandria have so great a love of shows and idling that had we not presently set forth by no means could we have come through the press of the multitudes who were already gathering along the highways where the queen must ride so we went out to take our places upon a stand built of timber that had been set up at the side of the great road which pierces through the city to the canopic gate for my uncle had already purchased a right to enter there and that dearly  we won our way with much struggle through the great crowds that were already gathered in the streets till we reached the scaffolding of timber which was roofed in with an awning and gaily hung with scarlet cloths here we seated ourselves upon a bench and waited for some hours watching the multitude press past shouting singing and talking loudly in many tongues at length soldiers came to clear the road clad after the roman fashion in breastplates of chainarmour after them marched heralds enjoining silence at which the population sung and shouted all the more loudly and crying that cleopatra the queen was coming then followed a thousand cilician skirmishers a thousand thracians a thousand macedonians and a thousand gauls each armed after the fashion of their country then passed five hundred men of those who are called the fenced horsemen for both men and horses were altogether covered with mail next came youths and maidens sumptuously draped and wearing golden crowns and with them images symbolising day and night morning and noon the heavens and the earth after these walked many fair women pouring perfumes on the road and others scattering blooming flowers now there rose a great shout of cleopatra cleopatra and i held my breath and bent forward to see her who dared to put on the robes of isis  but at that moment the multitude so gathered and thickened in front of where i was that i could no longer clearly see so in my eagerness i leapt over the barrier of the scaffolding and being very strong pushed my way through the crowd till i reached the foremost rank and as i did so nubian slaves armed with thick staves and crowned with ivyleaves ran up striking the people one man i noted more especially for he was a giant and being strong was insolent beyond measure smiting the people without cause as indeed is the wont of low persons set in authority for a woman stood near to me an egyptian by her face bearing a child in her arms whom the man seeing that she was weak struck on the head with his rod so that she fell prone and the people murmured but at the sight my blood rushed of a sudden through my veins and drowned my reason i held in my hand a staff of olivewood from cyprus and as the black brute laughed at the sight of the stricken woman and her babe rolling on the ground i swung the staff aloft and smote so shrewdly did i strike that the tough rod split upon the giants shoulders and the blood spurted forth staining his trailing leaves of ivy  then with a shriek of pain and furyfor those who smite love not that they be smittenhe turned and sprang at me and all the people round gave back save only the woman who could not rise leaving us two in a ring as it were on he came with a rush and as he came being now mad i smote him with my clenched fist between the eyes having nothing else with which to smite and he staggered like an ox beneath the first blow of the priests axe then the people shouted for they love to see a fight and the man was known to them as a gladiator victorious in the games gathering up his strength the knave came on with an oath and whirling his heavy staff on high struck me in such a fashion that had i not avoided the blow by nimbleness i had surely been slain but as it chanced the staff hit upon the ground and so heavily that it flew in fragments thereon the multitude shouted again and the great man blind with fury rushed at me to smite me down but with a cry i sprang straight at his throatfor he was so heavy a man that i knew i could not hope to throw him by strengthay and gripped it there i clung though his fists battered me like bludgeons driving my thumbs into his throat round and round we turned till at length he flung himself to the earth trusting thus to shake me off but i held on fast as we rolled over and over on the ground till at last he grew faint for want of breath then i being uppermost drove my knee down upon his chest and as i believe should thus have slain him in my rage had not my uncle and others there gathered fallen upon me and dragged me from him  and meanwhile though i know it not the chariot in which the queen sat with elephants going before and lions led after it had reached the spot and had been halted because of the tumult i looked up and thus torn panting my white garments stained with the blood that had rushed from the mouth and nostrils of the mighty nubian i for the first time saw cleopatra face to face her chariot was all of gold and drawn by milkwhite steeds she sat in it with two fair girls clad in greek attire standing one on either side fanning her with glittering fans on her head was the covering of isis the golden horns between which rested the moons round disk and the emblem of osiris throne with the uræus twined around beneath this covering was the vulture cap of gold the blue enamelled wings and the vulture head with gemmy eyes under which her long dark tresses flowed towards her feet about her rounded neck was a broad collar of gold studded with emeralds and coral round her arms and wrists were bracelets of gold studded with emeralds and coral and in one hand she held the holy cross of life fashioned of crystal and in the other the golden rod of royalty her breast was bare but under it was a garment that glistened like the scaly covering of a snake everywhere sewn with gems beneath this robe was a skirt of golden cloth half hidden by a scarf of the broidered silk of cos falling in folds to the sandals that fastened with great pearls adorned her white and tiny feet  all this i discerned at a glance as it were then i looked upon the facethat face which seduced cæsar ruined egypt and was doomed to give octavian the sceptre of the world i looked upon the flawless grecian features the rounded chin the full rich lips the chiselled nostrils and the ears fashioned like delicate shells i saw the forehead low broad and lovely the crisped dark hair falling in heavy waves that sparkled in the sun the arched eyebrows and the long bent lashes there before me was the grandeur of her imperial shape there burnt the wonderful eyes hued like the cyprian violeteyes that seemed to sleep and brood on secret things as night broods upon the desert and yet as the night to shift change and be illumined by gleams of sudden splendour born within their starry depths all those wonders i saw though i have small skill in telling them but even then i knew that it was not in these charms alone that the might of cleopatras beauty lay it was rather in a glory and a radiance cast through the fleshly covering from the fierce soul within for she was a thing of flame like unto which no woman has ever been or ever will be even when she brooded the fire of her quick heart shone through her but when she woke and the lightning leapt suddenly from her eyes and the passionladen music of her speech chimed upon her lips ah then who can tell how cleopatra seemed for in her met all the splendours that have been given to woman for her glory and all the genius which man has won from heaven and with them dwelt every evil of that greater sort which fearing nothing and making a mock of laws has taken empires for its place of play and smiling watered the growth of its desires with the rich blood of men in her breast they gathered together fashioning that cleopatra whom no man may draw and yet whom no man having seen ever can forget they fashioned her grand as the spirit of storm lovely as lightning cruel as pestilence yet with a heart and what she did is known woe to the world when such another comes to curse it  for a moment i met cleopatras eyes as she idly bent herself to find the tumults cause at first they were sombre and dark as though they saw indeed but the brain read nothing then they awoke and their very colour seemed to change as the colour of the sea changes when the water is shaken first there was anger written in them next an idle noting then when she looked upon the huge bulk of the man whom i had overcome and knew him for the gladiator something perchance that was not far from wonder at the least they softened though indeed her face changed no whit but he who would read cleopatras mind had need to watch her eyes for her countenance varied but a little turning she said some word to her guards they came forward and led me to her while all the multitude waited silently to see me slain  i stood before her my arms folded on my breast overcome though i was by the wonder of her loveliness i hated her in my heart this woman who dared to clothe herself in the dress of isis this usurper who sat upon my throne this wanton squandering the wealth of egypt in chariots and perfumes when she had looked me over from head to the feet she spake in a low full voice and in the tongue of khemi which she alone had learned of all the lagidæ  and who and what art thou egyptianfor egyptian i see thou artwho darest to smite my slave when i make progress through my city  i am harmachis i answered boldly harmachis the astrologer adopted son of the high priest and governor of abouthis who am come hither to seek my fortune i smote thy slave o queen because for no fault he struck down the woman yonder ask of those who saw royal egypt  harmachis she said the name has a high soundand thou hast a high look and then speaking to a soldier who had seen all she bade him tell her what had come to pass this he did truthfully being friendly disposed towards me because i had overcome the nubian thereon she turned and spoke to the girl bearing the fan who stood beside hera woman with curling hair and shy dark eyes very beautiful to see the girl answered somewhat then cleopatra bade them bring the slave to her so they led forward the giant who had found his breath again and with him the woman whom he had smitten down  thou dog she said in the same low voice thou coward who being strong didst smite down this woman and being a coward wast overthrown of this young man see thou i will teach thee manners henceforth when thou smitest women it shall be with thy left arm ho guards seize this black slave and strike off his right hand  her command given she sank back in her golden chariot and again the cloud gathered in her eyes but the guards seized the giant and notwithstanding his cries and prayers for mercy struck off his hand with a sword upon the wood of the scaffolding and he was carried away groaning then the procession moved on again as it went the fair woman with the fan turned her head caught my eye and smiled and nodded as though she rejoiced at which i wondered somewhat  the people cheered also and made jests saying that i should soon practice astrology in the palace but as soon as we might i and my uncle escaped and made our way back to the house all the while he rated me for my rashness but when we came to the chamber of the house he embraced me and rejoiced greatly because i had overthrown the giant with so little hurt to myself    chapter ii  of the coming of charmion and of the wrath of sepa  that same night while we sat at supper in the house there came a knock upon the door it was opened and a woman passed in wrapped from head to foot in a large dark peplos or cloak in such fashion that her face could not be clearly seen  my uncle rose and as he did so the woman uttered the secret word  i am come my father she said in a sweet clear voice though of a truth it was not easy to escape the revels at the palace yonder but i told the queen that the sun and the riot in the streets had made me sick and she let me go  it is well he answered unveil thyself here thou art safe  with a little sigh of weariness she unclasped the peplos and let it slip from her giving to my sight the face and form of that beauteous girl who had stood to fan cleopatra in the chariot for she was very fair and pleasant to look upon and her grecian robes clung sweetly about her supple limbs and budding form her wayward hair flowing in a hundred little curls was bound in with a golden fillet and on her feet were sandals fastened with studs of gold her cheeks blushed like a flower and her dark soft eyes were downcast as though with modesty but smiles and dimples trembled about her lips  my uncle frowned when his eyes fell upon her dress  why comest thou in this garb charmion he asked sternly is not the dress of thy mothers good enough for thee this is no time or place for womans vanities thou art not here to conquer but to obey  nay be not wroth my father she answered softly perchance thou knowest not that she whom i serve will have none of our egyptian dress it is out of fashion to wear it would have been to court suspicionalso i came in haste and as she spoke i saw that all the while she watched me covertly through the long lashes which fringed her modest eyes  well well he said sharply fixing his keen glance upon her face doubtless thou speakest truth charmion be ever mindful of thy oath girl and of the cause to which thou art sworn be not lightminded and i charge thee forget the beauty with which thou hast been cursed for mark thou this charmion fail us but one jot and vengeance shall fall on theethe vengeance of man and the vengeance of the gods to this service he continued lashing himself to anger as he went on till his great voice rang in the narrow room thou hast been bred to this end thou hast been instructed and placed where thou art to gain the ear of that wicked wanton whom thou seemest to serve see thou forget it not see that the luxury of yonder court does not corrupt thy purity and divert thy aim charmion and his eyes flashed and his small form seemed to grow till it attained to dignitynay almost to grandeur  charmion he went on advancing towards her with outstretched finger i say that at times i do not trust thee but two nights gone i dreamed i saw thee standing in the desert i saw thee laugh and lift thy hand to heaven and from it fell a rain of blood then the sky sank down on the land of khem and covered it whence came the dream girl and what is its meaning i have naught against thee as yet but hearken on the moment that i have though thou art of my kin and i have loved theeon that moment i say i will doom those delicate limbs which thou lovest so much to show to the kite and the jackal and the soul within thee to all the tortures of the gods unburied shalt thou lie and bodiless and accursed shalt thou wander in amentiay for ever and ever  he paused for his sudden burst of passion had spent itself but by it more clearly than before i saw how deep a heart this man had beneath the cloak of his merriness and simplicity of mien and how fiercely the mind within him was set upon his aim as for the girl she shrank from him terrified and placing her hands before her sweet face began to weep  nay speak not so my father she said between her sobs for what have i done i know nothing of the evil wandering of thy dreams i am no soothsayer that i should read dreams have i not carried out all things according to thy desire have i not been ever mindful of that dread oathand she trembled have i not played the spy and told thee all have i not won the heart of the queen so that she loves me as a sister refusing me nothingay and the hearts of those about her why dost thou affright me thus with thy words and threats and she wept afresh looking even more beautiful in her sorrow than she was before  enough enough he answered what i have said i have said be warned and affront our sight no more with this wanton dress thinkest thou that we would feed our eyes upon those rounded armswe whose stake is egypt and who are dedicated to the gods of egypt girl behold thy cousin and thy king  she ceased weeping wiping her eyes with her chiton and i saw that they seemed but the softer for her tears  methinks most royal harmachis and beloved cousin she said as she bent before me that we are already made acquainted  yea cousin i answered not without shamefacedness for i had never before spoken to so fair a maid thou wert in the chariot with cleopatra this day when i struggled with the nubian  assuredly she said with a smile and a sudden lighting of the eyes it was a gallant fight and gallantly didst thou overthrow that black brute i saw the fray and though i knew thee not i greatly feared for one so brave but i paid him for my fright for it was i who put it into the mind of cleopatra to bid the guards strike off his handnow knowing who thou art i would i had said his head and she looked up shooting a glance at me and then smiled  enough put in my uncle sepa the time draws on tell thou thy mission charmion and be gone  then her manner changed she folded her hands meekly before her and spoke  let pharaoh hearken to his handmaiden i am the daughter of pharaohs uncle the brother of his father who is now long dead and therefore in my veins also flows the royal blood of egypt also i am of the ancient faith and hate these greeks and to see thee set upon the throne has been my dearest hope now for many years to this end i charmion have put aside my rank and become servingwoman to cleopatra that i might cut a notch in which thou couldst set thy foot when the hour came for thee to climb the throne and pharaoh the notch is cut  this then is our plot royal cousin thou must gain an entrance to the household and learn its ways and secrets and so far as may be suborn the eunuchs and captains some of whom i have already tempted this done and all things being prepared without thou must slay cleopatra and aided by me with those whom i control in the confusion that shall ensue throw wide the gates and admitting those of our party who are in waiting put such of the troops as remain faithful to the sword and seize the bruchium which being finished within two days thou shalt hold this fickle alexandria at the same time those who are sworn to thee in every city of egypt shall rise in arms and in ten days from the death of cleopatra thou shalt indeed be pharaoh this is the counsel which has been taken and thou seest royal cousin that though our uncle yonder thinks so ill of me i have learned my partay and played it  i hear thee cousin i answered marvelling that so young a womanshe had but twenty yearscould weave so bold a plot for in its origin the scheme was hers but in those days i little knew charmion go on how then shall i gain entrance to the palace of cleopatra  nay cousin as things are it is easy thus cleopatra loves to look upon a man andgive me pardonthy face and form are fair today she noted them and twice she said she would she had asked where that astrologer might be found for she held that an astrologer who could wellnigh slay a nubian gladiator with his bare hands must indeed be a master of the fortunate stars i answered her that i would cause inquiry to be made so hearken royal harmachis at midday cleopatra sleeps in her inner hall which looks over the gardens to the harbour at that hour tomorrow then i will meet thee at the gates of the palace whither thou shalt come boldly asking for the lady charmion i will make appointment for thee with cleopatra so that she shall see thee alone when she wakes and the rest shall be for thee harmachis for much she loves to play with the mysteries of magic and i have known her stand whole nights watching the stars and making a pretence to read them and but lately she has sent away dioscorides the physician because poor fool he ventured on a prophecy from the conjunction of the stars that cassius would defeat mark antony thereon cleopatra sent orders to the general allienus bidding him add the legions she had sent to syria to help antony to the army of cassius whose victory forsooth wasaccording to dioscorideswritten on the stars but as it chanced antony beat cassius first and brutus afterwards and so dioscorides has departed and now he lectures on herbs in the museum for his bread and hates the name of stars but his place is empty and thou shalt fill it and then we will work in secret and in the shadow of the sceptre ay we will work like the worm at the heart of a fruit till the time of plucking comes and at thy daggers touch royal cousin the fabric of this grecian throne crumbles to nothingness and the worm that rotted it bursts his servile covering and in the sight of empires spreads his royal wings oer egypt  i gazed at this strange girl once more astonished and saw that her face was lit up with such a light as i had never seen in the eyes of woman  ah broke in my uncle who was watching her ah i love to see thee so girl there is the charmion that i knew and i bred upnot the court girl whom i like not draped in silks of cos and fragrant with essences let thy heart harden in this moulday stamp it with the fervid zeal of patriot faith and thy reward shall find thee and now cover up that shameless dress of thine and leave us for it grows late tomorrow harmachis shall come as thou hast said and so farewell  charmion bowed her head and turning wrapped her darkhued peplos round her then taking my hand she touched it with her lips and went without any further word  a strange woman said sepa when she had gone a most strange woman and an uncertain  methought my uncle i said that thou wast somewhat harsh with her  ay he answered but not without a cause look thou harmachis beware of this charmion she is too wayward and i fear me may be led away in truth she is a very woman and like a restive horse will take the path that pleases her she has brain and fire and she loves our cause but i pray that the cause come not face to face with her desires for what her heart is set on that will she do at any cost she will do it therefore i frightened her now while i may for who can know but that she will pass beyond my power i tell thee that in this one girls hand lie all our lives and if she play us false what then alas and alas that we must use such tools as these but it was needful there was no other way and yet i misdoubted me i pray that it may be well still at times i fear my niece charmionshe is too fair and the blood of youth runs too warm in those blue veins of hers  ah woe to the cause that builds its strength upon a womans faith for women are faithful only where they love and when they love their faithlessness becomes their faith they are not fixed as men are fixed they rise more high and sink more lowthey are strong and changeful as the sea harmachis beware of this charmion for like the ocean she may float thee home or like the ocean she may wreck thee and with thee the hope of egypt    chapter iii  of the coming of harmachis to the palace of how he drew paulus through the gates of cleopatra sleeping and of the magic of harmachis which he showed her  thus it came to pass that on the next day i arrayed myself in a long and flowing robe after the fashion of a magician or astrologer i placed a cap on my head about which were broidered images of the stars and in my belt a scribes palette and a roll of papyrus written over with magic spells and signs in my hand i held a wand of ebony tipped with ivory such as is used by priests and masters of magic among these indeed i took high rank filling my knowledge of their secrets which i had learned at annu what i lacked in that skill which comes from use and so with no small shame for i love not such play and hold this common magic in contempt i set forth through the bruchium to the palace on the lochias being guided on my way by my uncle sepa at length passing up the avenue of sphinxes we came to the great marble gateway and the gates of bronze within which is the guardhouse here my uncle left me breathing many prayers for my safety and success but i advanced with an easy air to the gate where i was roughly challenged by the gallic sentries and asked of my name following and business i gave my name harmachis the astrologer saying that my business was with the lady charmion the queens lady thereon the man made as though to let me pass in when a captain of the guard a roman named paulus came forward and forbade it now this paulus was a large limbed man with a womans face and a hand that shook from winebibbing still he knew me again  why he cried in the latin tongue to one who came with him this is the fellow who wrestled yesterday with the nubian gladiator that same who now howls for his lost hand underneath my window curses on the black brute i had a bet upon him for the games i have backed him against caius and now hell never fight again and i must lose my money all through this astrologer what is it thou sayestthou hast business with the lady charmion nay then that settles it i will not let thee through fellow i worship the lady charmionay we all worship her though she gives us more slaps than sighs and dost thou think that we will suffer an astrologer with such eyes and such a chest as thine to cut in the gameby bacchus no she must come out to keep the tryst for in thou shalt not go  sir i said humbly and yet with dignity i pray that a message may be sent to the lady charmion for my business will not brook delay  ye gods answered the fool whom have we here that he cannot wait a cæsar in disguise nay be offbe off if thou wouldst not learn how a spearprick feels behind  nay put in the other officer he is an astrologer make him prophesymake him play tricks  ay cried the others who had sauntered up let the fellow show his art if he is a magician he can pass the gates paulus or no paulus  right willingly good sirs i answered for i saw no other means of entering wilt thou my young and noble lordand i addressed him who was with paulussuffer that i look thee in the eyes perhaps i may read what is written there  right answered the youth but i wish that the lady charmion was the sorceress i would stare her out of countenance i warrant  i took him by the hand and gazed deep into his eyes i see i said a field of battle at night and about it bodies stretchedamong them is thy body and a hyena tears its throat most noble sir thou shalt die by swordthrusts within a year  by bacchus said the youth turning white to the gills thou art an illomened sorcerer and he slunk offshortly afterwards as it chanced to meet this very fate for he was sent on service and slain in cyprus  now for thee great captain i said speaking to paulus i will show thee how i will pass those gates without thy leaveay and draw thee through them after me be pleased to fix thy princely gaze upon the point of this wand in my hand  being urged by his comrades he did this unwillingly and i let him gaze till i saw his eyes grow empty as an owls eyes in the sun then i suddenly withdrew the wand and shifting my countenance into the place of it i seized him with my will and stare and beginning to turn round and round drew him after me his fierce face drawn fixed as it were almost to my own then i moved slowly backwards till i had passed the gates still drawing him after me and suddenly jerked my head away he fell to the ground to rise wiping his brow and looking very foolish  art thou content most noble captain i said thou seest we have passed the gates would any other noble sir wish that i should show more of my skill  by taranis lord of thunder and all the gods of olympus thrown in no growled an old centurion a gaul named brennus i like thee not i say the man who could drag our paulus through those gates by the eye as it were is not a man to play with paulus too who always goes the way you dont want himbackwards like an asspaulus why sirrah thou needst must have a woman in one eye and a winecup in the other to draw our paulus thus  at this moment the talk was broken for charmion herself came down the marble path followed by an armed slave she walked calm and carelessly her hands folded behind her and her eyes gazing at nothingness as it were but it was when charmion thus looked upon nothing that she saw most and as she came the officers and men of the guard made way for her bowing for as i learned afterwards this girl next to cleopatras self wielded more power than anyone about the palace  what is this tumult brennus she said speaking to the centurion and making as if she saw me not knowest thou not that the queen sleeps at this hour and if she be awakened it is thou who must answer for it and that dearly  nay lady said the centurion humbly but it is thus we have hereand he jerked his thumb towards mea magician of the most pestilentum i crave his pardonof the very best sort for he hath but just now only by placing his eyes close to the nose of the worthy captain paulus dragged him the said paulus through the gates that paulus swore the magician should not pass by the same token lady the magician says that he has business with youwhich grieves me for your sake  charmion turned and looked at me carelessly ay i remember she said and so he hasat least the queen would see his tricks but if he can do none better than cause a sothere she cast a glance of scorn at the wondering paulusto follow his nose through the gates he guards he had better go whence he came follow me sir magician and for thee brennus i say keep thy riotous crew more quiet for thee most honourable paulus get thee sober and next time i am asked for at the gates give him who asks a hearing and with a queenly nod of her small head she turned and led the way followed at a distance by myself and the armed slave  we passed up the marble walk which runs through the garden grounds and is set on either side with marble statues for the most part of heathen gods and goddesses with which these lagidæ were not ashamed to defile their royal dwellings at length we came to a beautiful portico with fluted columns of the grecian style of art where we found more guards who made way for the lady charmion crossing the portico we reached a marble vestibule where a fountain splashed softly and thence by a low doorway a second chamber known as the alabaster hall most beautiful to see its roof was upheld by light columns of black marble but all its walls were panelled with alabaster on which grecian legends were engraved its floor was of rich and manyhued mosaic that told the tale of the passion of psyche for the grecian god of love and about it were set chairs of ivory and gold charmion bade the armed slave stay at the doorway of this chamber so that we passed in alone for the place was empty except for two eunuchs who stood with drawn swords before the curtain at the further end  i am vexed my lord she said speaking very low and shyly that thou shouldst have met with such affronts at the gate but the guard there served a double watch and i had given my commands to the officer of the company that should have relieved it those roman officers are ever insolent who though they seem to serve know well that egypt is their plaything but it is not amiss for these rough soldiers are superstitious and will fear thee now bide thou here while i go into cleopatras chamber where she sleeps i have but just sung her to sleep and if she be awake i will call thee for she waits thy coming and without more words she glided from my side  in a little time she returned and coming to me spoke  wouldst see the fairest woman in all the world asleep she whispered if so follow me nay fear not when she awakes she will but laugh for she bade me be sure to bring thee instantly whether she slept or woke see i have her signet  so we passed up the beautiful chamber till we came to where the eunuchs stood with drawn swords and these would have barred my entry but charmion frowned and drawing the signet from her bosom held it before their eyes having examined the writing that was on the ring they bowed dropping their sword points and we passed through the heavy curtains broidered with gold into the restingplace of cleopatra it was beautiful beyond imaginingbeautiful with many coloured marbles with gold and ivory gems and flowersall art can furnish and all luxury can dream of were here here were pictures so real that birds might have pecked the painted fruits here were statues of womans loveliness frozen into stone here were draperies fine as softest silk but woven of a web of gold here were couches and carpets such as i never saw the air too was sweet with perfume while through the open window places came the far murmur of the sea and at the further end of the chamber on a couch of gleaming silk and sheltered by a net of finest gauze cleopatra lay asleep there she laythe fairest thing that man ever sawfairer than a dream and the web of her dark hair flowed all about her one white rounded arm made a pillow for her head and one hung down towards the ground her rich lips were parted in a smile showing the ivory lines of teeth and her rosy limbs were draped in so thin a robe of the silk of cos held about her by a jewelled girdle that the white gleam of flesh shone through it i stood astonished and though my thoughts had little bent that way the sight of her beauty struck me like a blow so that for a moment i lost myself as it were in the vision of its power and was grieved at heart because i must slay so fair a thing  turning suddenly from the sight i found charmion watching me with her quick eyeswatching as though she would search my heart and indeed something of my thought must have been written on my face in a language that she could read for she whispered in my ear  ay it is pity is it not harmachis being but a man methinks that thou wilt need all thy ghostly strength to nerve thee to the deed  i frowned but before i could frame an answer she touched me lightly on the arm and pointed to the queen a change had come upon her her hands were clenched and about her face all rosy with the hue of sleep gathered a cloud of fear her breath came quick she raised her arms as though to ward away a blow then with a stifled moan sat up and opened the windows of her eyes they were dark dark as night but when the light found them they grew blue as the sky grows blue before the blushing of the dawn  cæsarion she said where is my son cæsarionwas it then a dream i dreamed that juliusjulius who is deadcame to me a bloody toga wrapped about his face and having thrown his arms about his child led him away then i dreamed i dieddied in blood and agony and one i might not see mocked me as i died ah who is that man  peace madam peace said charmion it is but the magician harmachis whom thou didst bid me bring to thee at this hour  ah the magicianthat harmachis who overthrew the giant i remember now he is welcome tell me sir magician can thy magic mirror call forth an answer to this dream nay how strange a thing is sleep that wrapping the mind in a web of darkness straightly compels it to its will whence then come those images of fear rising on the horizon of the soul like some untimely moon upon a midday sky who grants them power to stalk so lifelike from memorys halls and pointing to their wounds thus confront the present with the past are they then messengers does the halfdeath of sleep give them foothold in our brains and thus upknit the cut thread of human kinship that was cæsars self i tell thee who but now stood at my side and murmured through his muffled robe warning words of which the memory is lost to me read me this riddle thou egyptian sphinx and ill show thee a rosier path to fortune than all thy stars can point thou hast brought the omen solve thou its problem        alluding to his name harmachis was the grecian title of      the divinity of the sphinx as horemkhu was the egyptian      editor  i come in a good hour most mighty queen i answered for i have some skill in the mysteries of sleep that is as thou hast rightly guessed a stair by which those who are gathered to osiris may from time to time enter at the gateways of our living sense and by signs and words that can be read of instructed mortals repeat the echoes of that hall of truth which is their habitation yes sleep is a stair by which the messengers of the guardian gods may descend in many shapes upon the spirit of their choice for o queen to those who hold the key the madness of our dreams can show a clearer purpose and speak more certainly than all the acted wisdom of our waking life which is a dream indeed thou didst see great cæsar in his bloody robe and he threw his arms about the prince cæsarion and led him hence hearken now to the secret of thy vision it was cæsars self thou sawest coming to thy side from amenti in such a guise as might not be mistaken when he embraced the child cæsarion he did it for a sign that to him and him alone had passed his greatness and his love when he seemed to lead him hence he led him forth from egypt to be crowned in the capitol crowned the emperor of rome and lord of all the lands for the rest i know not it is hid from me  thus then i read the vision though to my sense it had a darker meaning but it is not well to prophesy evil unto kings  meanwhile cleopatra had risen and having thrown back the gnat gauze was seated upon the edge of her couch her eyes fixed upon my face while her fingers played with her girdles jewelled ends  of a truth she cried thou art the best of all magicians for thou readest my heart and drawest a hidden sweet out of the rough shell of evil omen  ay o queen said charmion who stood by with downcast eyes and i thought that there was bitter meaning in her soft tones may no rougher words ever affront thy ears and no evil presage tread less closely upon its happy sense  cleopatra placed her hands behind her head and leaning back looked at me with halfshut eyes  come show us of thy magic egyptian she said it is yet hot abroad and i am weary of those hebrew ambassadors and their talk of herod and jerusalem i hate that herod as he shall findand will have none of the ambassadors today though i yearn a little to try my hebrew on them what canst thou do hast thou no new trick by serapis if thou canst conjure as well as thou canst prophesy thou shalt have a place at court with pay and perquisites to boot if thy lofty soul does not scorn perquisites  nay i answered all tricks are old but there are some forms of magic to be rarely used and with discretion that may be new to thee o queen art thou afraid to venture on the charm  i fear nothing go on and do thy worst come charmion and sit by me but stay where are all the girlsiras and merirathey too love magic  not so i said the charms work ill before so many now behold and gazing at the twain i cast my wand upon the marble and murmured a spell for a moment it was still and then as i muttered the rod slowly began to writhe it bent itself it stood on end and moved of its own motion next it put on scales and behold it was a serpent that crawled and fiercely hissed  fie on thee cried cleopatra clapping her hands callest thou that magic why it is an old trick that any wayside conjurer can do i have seen it a score of times  wait o queen i answered thou hast not seen all and as i spoke the serpent seemed to break in fragments and from each fragment grew a new serpent and these too broke in fragments and bred others till in a little while the place to their glamoured sight was a seething sea of snakes that crawled hissed and knotted themselves in knots then i made a sign and the serpents gathered themselves round me and seemed slowly to twine themselves about my body and my limbs till save my face i was wreathed thick with hissing snakes  oh horrible horrible cried charmion hiding her countenance in the skirt of the queens garment  nay enough magician enough said the queen thy magic overwhelms us  i waved my snakewrapped arms and all was gone there at my feet lay the black wand tipped with ivory and naught beside  the two women looked upon each other and gasped with wonder but i took up the wand and stood with folded arms before them  is the queen content with my poor art i asked most humbly  ay that i am egyptian never did i see its like thou art court astronomer from this day forward with right of access to the queens presence hast thou more of such magic at thy call  yea royal egypt suffer that the chamber be a little darkened and i will show thee one more thing  half am i afraid she answered nevertheless do thou as this harmachis says charmion  so the curtains were drawn and the chamber made as though the twilight were at hand i came forward and stood beside cleopatra gaze thou there i said sternly pointing with my wand to the empty space where i had been and thou shalt behold that which is in thy mind  then for a little space was silence while the two women gazed fixedly and half fearful at the spot  and as they gazed a cloud gathered before them very slowly it took shape and form and the form it took was the form of a man though as yet he was but vaguely mapped upon the twilight and seemed now to grow and now to melt away  then i cried with a loud voice  spirit i conjure thee appear  and as i cried the thing perfect in every part leapt into form before us suddenly as the flash of day his shape was the shape of royal cæsar the toga thrown about his face and on his form a vestment bloody from a hundred wounds an instant so he stood then i waved my wand and he was gone  i turned to the two women on the couch and saw cleopatras lovely face all clothed in terror her lips were ashy white her eyes stared wide and all the flesh was shaking on her bones  man she gasped man who and what art thou who canst bring the dead before our eyes  i am the queens astronomer magician servantwhat the queen wills i answered laughing was this the form that was on the queens mind  she made no answer but rising left the chamber by another door  then charmion rose also and took her hands from her face for she too had been stricken with dread  how dost thou these things royal harmachis she said tell me for of a truth i fear thee  be not afraid i answered perchance thou didst see nothing but what was in my mind all things are shadows how canst thou then know their nature or what is and what only seems to be but how goes it remember charmion this sport is played to an end  it goes well she said by tomorrow mornings dawn these tales will have gone round and thou wilt be more feared than any man in alexandria follow me i pray thee    chapter iv  of the ways of charmion and of the crowning of harmachis as the king of love  on the following day i received the writing of my appointment as astrologer and magicianinchief to the queen with the pay and perquisites of that office which were not small rooms were given me in the palace also through which i passed at night to the high watchtower whence i looked on the stars and drew their auguries for at this time cleopatra was much troubled about matters political and not knowing how the great struggle among the roman factions would end but being very desirous to side with the strongest she took constant counsel with me as to the warnings of the stars these i read to her in such manner as best seemed to fit the high interest of my ends for antony the roman triumvir was now in asia minor and rumour ran very wroth because it had been told him that cleopatra was hostile to the triumvirate in that her general serapion had aided cassius but cleopatra protested loudly to me and others that serapion had acted against her will yet charmion told me that as with allienus it was because of a prophecy of dioscorides the unlucky that the queen herself had secretly ordered serapion so to do still this did not save serapion for to prove to antony that she was innocent she dragged the general from the sanctuary and slew him woe be to those who carry out the will of tyrants if the scale should rise against them and so serapion perished  meanwhile all things went well with us for the minds of cleopatra and those about her were so set upon affairs abroad that neither she nor they thought of revolt at home but day by day our party gathered strength in the cities of egypt and even in alexandria which is to egypt as another land all things being foreign there day by day those who doubted were won over and sworn to the cause by that oath which cannot be broken and our plans of action more firmly laid and every other day i went forth from the palace to take counsel with my uncle sepa and there at his house met the nobles and the great priests who were for the party of khem  i saw much of cleopatra the queen and i was ever more astonished at the wealth and splendour of her mind that for richness and variety was as a woven cloth of gold throwing back all lights from its changing face she feared me somewhat and therefore wished to make a friend of me asking me of many matters that seemed to be beyond the province of my office i saw much of the lady charmion alsoindeed she was ever at my side so that i scarce knew when she came and when she went for she would draw nigh with that soft step of hers and i would turn to find her at hand and watching me beneath the long lashes of her downcast eyes there was no service that was too hard for her and no task too long for day and night she laboured for me and for our cause  but when i thanked her for her loyalty and said it should be had in mind in that time which was at hand she stamped her foot and pouted with her lips like an angry child saying that among all the things which i had learned this had i not learnedthat loves service asked no payment and was its own guerdon and i being innocent in such matters and foolish that i was holding the ways of women as of small account read her sayings in the sense that her services to the cause of khem which she loved brought with them their own reward but when i praised so fine a spirit she burst into angry tears and left me wondering for i knew nothing of the trouble at her heart i knew not then that unsought this woman had given me her love and that she was rent and torn by pangs of passion fixed like arrows in her breast i did not knowhow should i know it who never looked upon her otherwise than as an instrument of our joint and holy cause her beauty never stirred meno not even when she leaned over me and breathed upon my hair i never thought of it otherwise than as a man thinks of the beauty of a statue what had i to do with such delights i who was sworn to isis and dedicate to the cause of egypt o ye gods bear me witness that i am innocent of this thing which was the source of all my woe and the woe of khem  how strange a thing is this love of woman that is so small in its beginning and in its ends so great see at the first it is as the little spring of water welling from a mountains heart and at the last what is it it is a mighty river that floats argosies of joy and makes wide lands to smile or perchance it is a torrent to wash in a flood of ruin across the fields of hope bursting in the barriers of design and bringing to tumbled nothingness the tenement of mans purity and the temples of his faith for when the invisible conceived the order of the universe he set this seed of womans love within its plan that by its most unequal growth is doomed to bring about equality of law for now it lifts the low to heights untold and now it brings the noble to the level of the dust and thus while woman that great surprise of nature is good and evil can never grow apart for still she stands and blind with love shoots the shuttle of our fate and pours sweet water into the cup of bitterness and poisons the wholesome breath of life with the doom of her desire turn this way and turn that she is at hand to meet thee her weakness is thy strength her might is thy undoing of her thou art to her thou goest she is thy slave yet holds thee captive at her touch honour withers locks open and barriers fall she is infinite as ocean she is variable as heaven and her name is the unforeseen man strive not to escape from woman and the love of woman for fly where thou wilt she is yet thy fate and whateer thou buildest thou buildest it for her  and thus it came to pass that i harmachis who had put such matters far from me was yet doomed to fall by the thing i held of no account for see this charmion she loved mewhy i know not of her own thought she learned to love me and of her love came what shall be told but i knowing naught treated her like a sister walking as it were hand in hand with her towards our common end  and so the time passed on till at length all things were made ready  it was the night before the night when the blow should fall and there were revellings in the palace that very day i had seen sepa and with him the captains of a band of five hundred men who should burst into the palace at midnight on the morrow when i had slain cleopatra the queen and put the roman and the gallic legionaries to the sword that very day i had suborned the captain paulus who since i drew him through the gates was my wills slave half by fear and half by promises of great reward i had prevailed upon him for the watch was his to unbar that small gate which faces to the east at the signal on the morrow night  all was made readythe flower of freedom that had been fiveandtwenty years in growth was on the point of bloom armed companies were gathering in every city from abu to athu and spies looked out from their walls awaiting the coming of the messenger who should bring tidings that cleopatra was no more and that harmachis the royal egyptian had seized the throne  all was prepared triumph hung in my hand as a ripe fruit to the hand of the plucker yet as i sat at the royal feast my heart was heavy and a shadow of coming woe lay cold within my mind i sat there in a place of honour near the majesty of cleopatra and looked down the lines of guests bright with gems and garlanded with flowers marking those whom i had doomed to die there before me lay cleopatra in all her beauty which thrilled the beholder as he is thrilled by the rushing of the midnight gale or by the sight of stormy waters i gazed on her as she touched her lips with wine and toyed with the chaplet of roses on her brow thinking of the dagger beneath my robe that i had sworn to bury in her breast again and yet again i gazed and strove to hate her strove to rejoice that she must dieand could not there too behind herwatching me now as ever with her deepfringed eyeswas the lovely lady charmion who to look at her innocent face would believe that she was the setter of that snare in which the queen who loved her should miserably perish who would dream that the secret of so much death was locked in her girlish breast i gazed and grew sick at heart because i must anoint my throne with blood and by evil sweep away the evil of the land at that hour i wished indeed that i was nothing but some humble husbandman who in its season grows and in its season garners the golden grain alas the seed that i had been doomed to sow was the seed of death and now i must reap the red fruit of the harvest  why harmachis what ails thee said cleopatra smiling her slow smile has the golden skein of stars got tangled my astronomer or dost thou plan some new feat of magic say what is it that thou dost so poorly grace our feast nay now did i not know having made inquiry that things so low as we poor women are far beneath thy gaze why i should swear that eros had found thee out harmachis  nay that i am spared o queen i answered the servant of the stars marks not the smaller light of womans eyes and therein is he happy  cleopatra leaned herself towards me looking on me long and steadily in such fashion that despite my will the blood fluttered at my heart  boast not thou proud egyptian she said in a low voice which none but i and charmion could hear lest perchance thou dost tempt me to match my magic against thine what woman can forgive that a man should push us by as things of no account it is an insult to our sex which natures self abhors and she leaned back again and laughed most musically but glancing up i saw charmion her teeth on her lip and an angry frown upon her brow  pardon royal egypt i answered coldly but with such wit as i could summon before the queen of heaven even stars grow pale this i said of the moon which is the sign of the holy mother whom cleopatra dared to rival naming herself isis come to earth  happily said she answered clapping her white hands why heres an astronomer who has wit and can shape a compliment nay such a wonder must not pass unnoted lest the gods resent it charmion take this rosechaplet from my hair and set it upon the learned brow of our harmachis he shall be crowned king of love whether he will it or not  charmion lifted the chaplet from cleopatras brows and bearing it to where i was with a smile set it upon my head yet warm and fragrant from the queens hair but so roughly that she pained me somewhat she did this because she was wroth although she smiled with her lips and whispered an omen royal harmachis for though she was so very much a woman yet when she was angered or suffered jealousy charmion had a childish way  having thus fixed the chaplet she curtsied low before me and with the softest tone of mockery named me in the greek tongue harmachis king of love then cleopatra laughed and pledged me as king of love and so did all the company finding the jest a merry one for in alexandria they love not those who live straitly and turn aside from women  but i sat there a smile upon my lips and black wrath in my heart for knowing who and what i was it irked me to think myself a jest for the frivolous nobles and light beauties of cleopatras court but i was chiefly angered against charmion because she laughed the loudest and i did not then know that laughter and bitterness are often the veils with which a sore heart wraps its weakness from the world an omen she said it wasthat crown of flowersand so it proved indeed for i was fated to barter the double diadem of the upper and the lower land for a wreath of passions roses that fade before they fully bloom and pharaohs ivory bed of state for the pillow of a faithless womans breast  king of love they crowned me in their mockery ay and king of shame and i with the perfumed roses on my browi by descent and ordination the pharaoh of egyptthought of the imperishable halls of abouthis and of that other crowning which on the morrow should be consummate  but still smiling i pledged them back and answered with a jest for rising i bowed before cleopatra and craved leave to go venus i said speaking of the planet that we know as donaou in the morning and bonou in the evening was in the ascendant therefore as newcrowned king of love i must now pass to do my homage to its queen for these barbarians name venus queen of love  and so amidst their laughter i withdraw to my watchtower and dashing that shameful chaplet down amidst the instruments of my craft made pretence to note the rolling of the stars there i waited thinking on many things that were to be until charmion should come with the last lists of the doomed and the messages of my uncle sepa whom she had seen that evening  at length the door opened softly and she came jewelled and clad in her white robes as she had left the feast    chapter v  of the coming of cleopatra to the chamber of harmachis of the throwing forth of the kerchief of charmion of the stars and of the gift by cleopatra of her friendship to her servant harmachis  at length thou art come charmion i said it is overlate  yea my lord but by no means could i escape cleopatra her mood is strangely crossed tonight i know not what it may portend strange whims and fancies blow across it like light and contrary airs upon a summer sea and i cannot read her purpose  well well enough of cleopatra hast thou seen our uncle  yes royal harmachis  and hast thou the last lists  yes here they are and she drew them from her bosom here is the list of those who after the queen must certainly be put to the sword among them thou wilt note is the name of that old gaul brennus i grieve for him for we are friends but it must be it is a heavy list  it is so i answered conning it when men write out their count they forget no item and our count is long what must be must be now for the next  here is the list of those to be spared as friendly or uncertain and here that of the towns which will certainly rise as soon as the messenger reaches their gates with tidings of the death of cleopatra  good and nowand i pausedand now as to the manner of cleopatras death how hast thou settled it must it be by my own hand  yea my lord she answered and again i caught that note of bitterness in her voice doubtless pharaoh will rejoice that his should be the hand to rid the land of this false queen and wanton woman and at one blow break the chains which gall the neck of egypt  talk not thus girl i said thou knowest well that i do not rejoice being but driven to the act by deep necessity and the pressure of my vows can she not then be poisoned or can no one of the eunuchs be suborned to slay her my soul turns from this bloody work indeed i marvel however heavy be her crimes that thou canst speak so lightly of the death by treachery of one who loves thee  surely pharaoh is overtender forgetting the greatness of the moment and all that hangs upon this daggerstroke that shall cut the thread of cleopatras life listen harmachis thou must do the deed and thou alone myself i would do it had my arm the strength but it has not it cannot be done by poison for every drop she drinks and every morsel that shall touch her lips is strictly tasted by three separate tasters who cannot be suborned nor may the eunuchs of the guard be trusted two indeed are sworn to us but the third cannot be come at he must be cut down afterwards and indeed when so many men must fall what matters a eunuch more or less thus it shall be then tomorrow night at three hours before midnight thou dost cast the final augury of the issue of the war and then thou wilt as is agreed descend alone with me having the signet to the outer chamber of the queens apartment for the vessel bearing orders to the legions sails from alexandria at the following dawn and alone with cleopatra since she wills that the thing be kept secret as the sea thou wilt read the message of the stars and as she pores over the papyrus then must thou stab her in the back so that she dies and see thou that thy will and arm fail thee not the deed being doneand indeed it will be easythou wilt take the signet and pass out to where the eunuch isfor the others will be wanting if by any chance there is trouble with himbut there will be no trouble for he dare not enter the private rooms and the sounds of death cannot reach so farthou must cut him down then i will meet thee and passing on we will come to paulus and it shall be my care to see that he is neither drunk nor backward for i know how to hold him to the task and he and those with him shall throw open the side gate when sepa and the five hundred chosen men who are in waiting shall pour in and cast themselves upon the sleeping legionaries putting them to the sword why the thing is easy so thou rest true to thyself and let no womanish fears creep into thy heart what is this daggers thrust it is nothing and yet upon it hang the destinies of egypt and the world  hush i said what is thati hear a sound  charmion ran to the door and gazing down the long dark passage listened in a moment she came back her finger on her lips it is the queen she whispered hurriedly the queen who mounts the stair alone i heard her bid iras to leave her i may not be found alone with thee at this hour it has a strange look and she may suspect what wants she here where can i hide  i glanced round at the further end of the chamber was a heavy curtain that hid a little place built in the thickness of the wall which i used for the storage of rolls and instruments  haste theethere i said and she glided behind the curtain which swung back and covered her then i thrust the fatal scroll of death into the bosom of my robe and bent over the mystic chart presently i heard the sweep of womans robes and there came a low knock upon the door  enter whoever thou art i said  the latch lifted and cleopatra swept in royally arrayed her dark hair hanging about her and the sacred snake of royalty glistening on her brow  of a truth harmachis she said with a sigh as she sank into a seat the path to heaven is hard to climb ah i am weary for those stairs are many but i was minded my astronomer to see thee in thy haunts  i am honoured overmuch o queen i said bowing low before her  art thou now and yet that dark face of thine has a somewhat angry lookthou art too young and handsome for this dry trade harmachis why i vow thou hast cast my wreath of roses down amidst thy rusty tools kings would have cherished that wreath along with their choicest diadems harmachis and thou dost throw it away as a thing of no account why what a man art thou but stay what is this a ladys kerchief by isis nay now my harmachis how came this here are our poor kerchiefs also instruments of thy high art oh fie fiehave i caught thee then art thou indeed a fox  nay most royal cleopatra nay i said turning for the kerchief which had fallen from charmions neck had an awkward look i know not indeed how the frippery came here perhaps some one of the women who keeps the chamber may have let it fall  ah soso she said dryly and still laughing like a rippling brook yes surely the slavewomen who keep chambers own such toys as this of the very finest silk worth twice its weight in gold and broidered too in many colours why myself i should not shame to wear it of a truth it seems familiar to my sight and she threw it round her neck and smoothed the ends with her white hand but there doubtless it is a thing unholy in thine eyes that the scarf of thy beloved should rest upon my poor breast take it harmachis take it and hide it in thy bosomnigh thy heart indeed  i took the accursed thing and muttering what i may not write stepped on to the giddy platform whence i watched the stars then crushing it into a ball i threw it to the winds of heaven  at this the lovely queen laughed once more  nay think now she cried what would the lady say could she see her lovegauge thus cast to all the world mayhap harmachis thou wouldst deal thus with my wreath also see the roses fade cast it forth and stooping she took up the wreath and gave it to me  for a moment so vexed was i i had a mind to take her at her word and send the wreath to join the kerchief but i thought better of it  nay i said more softly it is a queens gift and i will keep it and as i spoke i saw the curtain shake often since that night i have sorrowed over those simple words  gracious thanks be to the king of love for this small mercy she answered looking at me strangely now enough of wit come forth upon this balconytell me of the mystery of those stars of thine for i always loved the stars that are so pure and bright and cold and so far away from our fevered troubling there i would wish to dwell rocked on the dark bosom of the night and losing the little sense of self as i gazed for ever on the countenance of yon sweeteyed space naywho can tell harmachisperhaps those stars partake of our very substance and linked to us by natures invisible chain do indeed draw our destiny with them as they roll what says the greek fable of him who became a star perchance it has truth for yonder tiny sparks may be the souls of men but grown more purely bright and placed in happy rest to illume the turmoil of their motherearth or are they lamps hung high in the heavenly vault that night by night some godhead whose wings are darkness touches with his immortal fire so that they leap out in answering flame give me of thy wisdom and open these wonders to me my servant for i have little knowledge yet my heart is large and i would fill it for i have the wit could i but find the teacher  thereon being glad to find footing on a safer shore and marvelling somewhat to learn that cleopatra had a place for lofty thoughts i spoke and willingly told her such things as are lawful i told her how the sky is a liquid mass pressing round the earth and resting on the elastic pillars of the air and how above is the heavenly ocean nout in which the planets float like ships as they rush upon their radiant way i told her many things and amongst them how through the certain neverceasing movement of the orbs of light the planet venus that was called donaou when she showed as the morning star became the planet bonou when she came as the sweet star of eve and while i stood and spoke watching the stars she sat her hands clasped upon her knee and watched my face  ah she broke in at length and so venus is to be seen both in the morning and the evening sky well of a truth she is everywhere though she best loves the night but thou lovest not that i should use these latin names to thee come we will talk in the ancient tongue of khem which i know well i am the first mark thou of all the lagidæ who know it and now she went on speaking in my own tongue but with a little foreign accent that did but make her talk more sweet enough of stars for when all is said they are but fickle things and perhaps may even now be storing up an evil hour for thee or me or for both of us together not but what i love to hear thee speak of them for then thy face loses that gloomy cloud of thought which mars it and grows quick and human harmachis thou art too young for such a solemn trade methinks that i must find thee a better youth comes but once why waste it in these musings it is time to think when we can no longer act tell me how old art thou harmachis  i have sixandtwenty years o queen i answered for i was born in the first month of shomou in the summer season and on the third day of the month  why then we are of an age even to a day she cried for i too have sixandtwenty years and i too was born on the third day of the first month of shomou well this may we say those who begot us need have no shame for if i be the fairest woman in egypt methinks harmachis that there is in egypt no man more fair and strong than thou ay or more learned born of the same day why tis manifest that we were destined to stand together i as the queen and thou perchance harmachis as one of the chief pillars of my throne and thus to work each others weal  or maybe each others woe i answered looking up for her sweet speeches stung my ears and brought more colour to my face than i loved that she should see there  nay never talk of woe be seated here by me harmachis and let us talk not as queen and subject but as friend to friend thou wast angered with me at the feast tonight because i mocked thee with yonder wreathwas it not so nay it was but a jest didst thou know how heavy is the task of monarchs and how wearisome are their hours thou wouldst not be wroth because i lit my dulness with a jest oh they weary me those princes and those nobles and those stiffnecked pompous romans to my face they vow themselves my slaves and behind my back they mock me and proclaim me the servant of their triumvirate or their empire or their republic as the wheel of fortune turns and each rises on its round there is never a man among themnothing but fools parasites and puppetsnever a man since with their coward daggers they slew that cæsar whom all the world in arms was not strong enough to tame and i must play off one against the other if maybe by so doing i can keep egypt from their grip and for reward what why this is my rewardthat all men speak ill of meand i know it my subjects hate me yes i believe that woman though i am they would murder me could they find a means  she paused covering her eyes with her hand and it was well for her words pierced me so that i shrank upon the seat beside her  they think ill of me i know it and call me wanton who have never stepped aside save once when i loved the greatest man of all the world and at the touch of love my passion flamed indeed but burnt a hallowed flame these ribald alexandrians swear that i poisoned ptolemy my brotherwhom the roman senate would most unnaturally have forced on me his sister as a husband but it is false he sickened and died of fever and even so they say that i would slay arsinoë my sisterwho indeed would slay mebut that too is false though she will have none of me i love my sister yes they all think ill of me without a cause even thou dost think ill of me harmachis  o harmachis before thou judgest remember what a thing is envythat foul sickness of the mind which makes the jaundiced eye of pettiness to see all things distraughtto read evil written on the open face of good and find impurity in the whitest virgins soul think what a thing it is harmachis to be set on high above the gaping crowd of knaves who hate thee for thy fortune and thy wit who gnash their teeth and shoot the arrows of their lies from the cover of their own obscureness whence they have no wings to soar and whose hearts quest it is to drag down thy nobility to the level of the groundling and the fool  be not then swift to think evil of the great whose every word and act is searched for error by a million angry eyes and whose most tiny fault is trumpeted by a thousand throats till the world shakes with echoes of their sin say not it is thus tis certainly thussay rather may it not be otherwise have we heard aright did she this thing of her own will judge gently harmachis as wert thou i thou wouldst be judged remember that a queen is never free she is indeed but the point and instrument of those forces politic with which the iron books of history are graved o harmachis be thou my friendmy friend and counsellormy friend whom i can trust indeedfor here in this crowded court i am more utterly alone than any soul that breathes about its corridors but thee i trust there is faith written in those quiet eyes and i am minded to lift thee high harmachis i can no longer bear my solitude of mindi must find one with whom i may commune and speak that which lies within my heart i have faults i know it but i am not all unworthy of thy faith for there is good grain among the evil seed say harmachis wilt thou take pity on my loneliness and befriend me who have lovers courtiers slaves dependents more thick than i can count but never one single friend and she leant towards me touching me lightly and gazed on me with her wonderful blue eyes  i was overcome thinking of the morrow night shame and sorrow smote me i her friendi whose assassin dagger lay against my breast i bent my head and a sob or a groan i know not which burst from the agony of my heart  but cleopatra thinking only that i was moved beyond myself by the surprise of her graciousness smiled sweetly and said  it grows late tomorrow night when thou bringest the auguries we will speak again o my friend harmachis and thou shalt answer me and she gave me her hand to kiss scarce knowing what i did i kissed it and in another moment she was gone  but i stood in the chamber gazing after her like one asleep    chapter vi  of the words and jealousy of charmion of the laughter of harmachis of the making ready for the deed of blood and of the  i stood still plunged in thought then by hazard as it were i took up the wreath of roses and looked on it how long i stood so i know not but when next i lifted up my eyes they fell upon the form of charmion whom indeed i had altogether forgotten and though at the moment i thought but little of it i noted vaguely that she was flushed as though with anger and beat her foot upon the floor  oh it is thou charmion i said what ails thee art thou cramped with standing so long in thy hidingplace why didst not thou slip hence when cleopatra led me to the balcony  where is my kerchief she asked shooting an angry glance at me i let fall my broidered kerchief  thy kerchiefwhy didst thou not see cleopatra twitted me about it and i flung it from the balcony  yes i saw answered the girl i saw but too well thou didst fling away my kerchief but the wreath of rosesthat thou wouldst not fling away it was a queens gift forsooth and therefore the royal harmachis the priest of isis the chosen of the gods the crowned pharaoh wed to the weal of khem cherished it and saved it but my kerchief stung by the laughter of that light queen he cast away  what meanest thou i asked astonished at her bitter tone i cannot read thy riddles  what mean i she answered tossing up her head and showing the white curves of her throat nay i mean naught or all take it as thou wilt wouldst know what i mean harmachis my cousin and my lord she went on in a hard low voice then i will tell theethou art in danger of the great offence this cleopatra has cast her fatal wiles about thee and thou goest near to loving her harmachisto loving her whom tomorrow thou must slay ay stand and stare at that wreath in thy handthe wreath thou couldst not send to join my kerchiefsure cleopatra wore it but tonight the perfume of the hair of cæsars mistresscæsars and othersyet mingles with the odour of its roses now prithee harmachis how far didst thou carry the matter on yonder balcony for in that hole where i lay hid i could not hear or see tis a sweet spot for lovers is it notay and a sweet hour too venus surely rules the stars tonight  all of this she said so quietly and in so soft and modest a way though her words were not modest and yet so bitterly that every syllable cut me to the heart and angered me till i could find no speech  of a truth thou hast a wise economy she went on seeing her advantage tonight thou dost kiss the lips that tomorrow thou shalt still for ever it is frugal dealing with the occasion of the moment ay worthy and honourable dealing  then at last i broke forth girl i cried how darest thou speak thus to me mindest thou who and what i am that thou loosest thy peevish gibes upon me  i mind what it behoves thee to be she answered quick what thou art that i mind not now surely thou knowest alonethou and cleopatra  what meanest thou i said am i to blame if the queen  the queen what have we here pharaoh owns a queen  if cleopatra wills to come hither of a night and talk  of stars harmachissurely of stars and roses and naught beside  after that i know not what i said for troubled as i was the girls bitter tongue and quiet way drove me wellnigh to madness but this i know i spoke so fiercely that she cowered before me as she had cowered before my uncle sepa when he rated her because of her grecian garb and as she wept then so she wept now only more passionately and with great sobs  at length i ceased halfshamed but still angry and smarting sorely for even while she wept she could find a tongue to answer withand a womans shafts are sharp  thou shouldst not speak to me thus she sobbed it is cruelit is unmanly but i forget thou art but a priest not a manexcept mayhap for cleopatra  what right hast thou i said what canst thou mean  what right have i she asked looking up her dark eyes all aflood with tears that ran down her sweet face like the dew of morning down a lilys heart what right have i o harmachis art thou blind didst thou not know by what right i speak thus to thee then i must tell thee well it is the fashion in alexandria by that first and holy right of womanby the right of the great love i bear thee and which it seems thou hast no eyes to seeby the right of my glory and my shame oh be not wroth with me harmachis nor set me down as light because the truth at last has burst from me for i am not so i am what thou wilt make me i am the wax within the moulders hands and as thou dost fashion me so i shall be there breathes within me now a breath of glory blowing across the waters of my soul that can waft me to ends more noble than ever i have dreamed afore if thou wilt be my pilot and my guide but if i lose thee then i lose all that holds me from my worse selfand let shipwreck come thou knowest me not harmachis thou canst not see how big a spirit struggles in this frail form of mine to thee i am a girl clever wayward shallow but i am more show me thy loftiest thought and i will match it the deepest puzzle of thy mind and i will make it clear of one blood we are and love can ravel up our little difference and make us grow one indeed one end we have one land we love one vow binds us both take me to thy heart harmachis set me by thee on the double throne and i swear that i will lift thee higher than ever man has climbed reject me and beware lest i pull thee down and now putting aside the cold delicacy of custom stung to it by what i saw of the arts of that lovely living falsehood cleopatra which for pastime she practises on thy folly i have spoken out my heart and answer thou and she clasped her hands and drawing one pace nearer gazed all white and trembling on my face  for a moment i stood struck dumb for the magic of her voice and the power of her speech despite myself stirred me like the rush of music had i loved the woman doubtless she might have fired me with her flame but i loved her not and i could not play at passion and so thought came and with thought that laughing mood which is ever apt to fashion upon nerves strained to the point of breaking in a flash as it were i bethought me of the way in which she had that very night forced the wreath of roses on my head i thought of the kerchief and how i had flung it forth i thought of charmion in the little chamber watching what she held to be the arts of cleopatra and of her bitter speeches lastly i thought of what my uncle sepa would say of her could he see her now and of the strange and tangled skein in which i was inmeshed and i laughed aloudthe fools laughter that was my knell of ruin  she turned whiter yetwhite as the deadand a look grew upon her face that checked my foolish mirth thou findest then harmachis she said in a low choked voice and dropping the level of her eyes thou findest cause of merriment in what i have said  nay i answered nay charmion forgive me if i laughed it was rather a laugh of despair for what am i to say to thee thou hast spoken high words of all thou mightest be is it left for me to tell thee what thou art  she shrank and i paused  speak she said  thou knowestnone so wellwho i am and what my mission is thou knowestnone so wellthat i am sworn to isis and may by law divine have naught to do with thee  ay she broke in in her low voice and with her eyes still fixed upon the grounday and i know that thy vows are broken in spirit if not in formbroken like wreaths of cloud for harmachisthou lovest cleopatra  it is a lie i cried thou wanton girl who wouldst seduce me from my duty and put me to an open shamewho led by passion or ambition or the love of evil hast not shamed to break the barriers of thy sex and speak as thou hast spokenbeware lest thou go too far and if thou wilt have an answer here it is put straightly as thy question charmion outside the matter of my duty and my vows thou art naught to menor for all thy tender glances will my heart beat one pulse more fast hardly art thou now my friendfor of a truth i scarce can trust thee but once more beware to me thou mayest do thy worst but if thou dost dare to lift a finger against our cause that day thou diest and now is this play done  and as wild with anger i spoke thus she shrank back and yet further back till at length she rested against the wall her eyes covered with her hand but when i ceased she dropped her hand glancing up and her face was as the face of a statue in which the great eyes glowed like embers and round them was a ring of purple shadow  not altogether done she answered gently the arena must yet be sanded this she said having reference to the covering up of the bloodstains at the gladiatorial shows with fine sand well she went on waste not thine anger on a thing so vile i have thrown my throw and i have lost væ victisah væ victis wilt thou not lend me the dagger in thy robe that here and now i may end my shame no then one word more most royal harmachis if thou canst forget my folly but at the least have no fear from me i am now as ever thy servant and the servant of our cause farewell  and she went leaning her hand against the wall but i passing to my chamber flung myself upon my couch and groaned in bitterness of spirit alas we shape our plans and by slow degrees build up our house of hope never counting on the guests that time shall bring to lodge therein for who can guard againstthe unforeseen  at length i slept and my dreams were evil when i woke the light of the day which should see the red fulfilment of the plot was streaming through the casement and the birds sang merrily among the garden palms i woke and as i woke the sense of trouble pressed in upon me for i remembered that before this day was gathered to the past i must dip my hands in bloodyes in the blood of cleopatra who trusted me why could i not hate her as i should there had been a time when i looked on to this act of vengeance with somewhat of a righteous glow of zeal and nowand nowwhy i would frankly give my royal birthright to be free from its necessity but alas i knew that there was no escape i must drain this cup or be for ever cast away i felt the eyes of egypt watching me and the eyes of egypts gods i prayed to my mother isis to give me strength to do this deed and prayed as i had never prayed before and oh wonder no answer came nay how was this what then had loosed the link between us that for the first time the goddess deigned no reply to her son and chosen servant could it be that i had sinned in heart against her what had charmion saidthat i loved cleopatra was this sickness love nay a thousand times nayit was but the revolt of nature against an act of treachery and blood the goddess did but try my strength or perchance she also turned her holy countenance from murder  i rose filled with terror and despair and went about my task like a man without a soul i conned the fatal lists and noted all the plansay in my brain i gathered up the very words of that proclamation of my royalty which on the morrow i should issue to the startled world  citizens of alexandria and dwellers in the land of egypt it began cleopatra the macedonian hath by the command of the gods suffered justice for her crimes  all these and other things i did but i did them as a man without a soulas a man moved by a force from without and not from within and so the minutes wore away in the third hour of the afternoon i went as by appointment fixed to the house where my uncle sepa lodged that same house to which i had been brought some three months gone when i entered alexandria for the first time and here i found the leaders of the revolt in the city assembled in secret conclave to the number of seven when i had entered and the doors were barred they prostrated themselves and cried hail pharaoh but i bade them rise saying that i was not yet pharaoh for the chicken was still in the egg  yea prince said my uncle but his beak shows through not in vain hath egypt brooded all these years if thou fail not with that daggerstroke of thine tonight and how canst thou fail nothing can now stop our course to victory  it is on the knees of the gods i answered  nay he said the gods have placed the issue in the hands of a mortalin thy hands harmachisand there it is safe see here are the last lists thirtyone thousand men who bear arms are sworn to rise when the tidings come to them within five days every citadel in egypt will be in our hands and then what have we to fear from rome but little for her hands are full and besides we will make alliance with the triumvirate and if need be buy them off for of money there is plenty in the land and if more be wanted thou harmachis knowest where it is stored against the need of khem and outside the romans reach of arm who is there to harm us there is none perchance in this turbulent city there may be struggle and a counterplot to bring arsinoë to egypt and set her on the throne therefore alexandria must be severely dealt withay even to destruction if need be as for arsinoë those go forth tomorrow on the news of the queens death who shall slay her secretly  there remains the lad cæsarion i said rome might claim through cæsars son and the child of cleopatra inherits cleopatras rights here is a double danger  fear not said my uncle tomorrow cæsarion joins those who begat him in amenti i have made provision the ptolemies must be stamped out so that no shoot shall ever spring from that root blasted by heavens vengeance  is there no other means i asked sadly my heart is sick at the promise of this red rain of blood i know the child well he has cleopatras fire and beauty and great cæsars wit it were shame to murder him  nay be not so chickenhearted harmachis said my uncle sternly what ails thee then if the lad is thus the more reason that he should die wouldst thou nurse up a young lion to tear thee from the throne  be it so i answered sighing at least he is spared much and will go hence innocent of evil now for the plans  we sat long taking counsel till at length in face of the great emergency and our high emprise i felt something of the spirit of former days flow back into my heart at the last all was ordered and so ordered that it could scarce miscarry for it was fixed that if by any chance i could not come to slay cleopatra on this night then the plot should hang in the scale till the morrow when the deed must be done upon occasion for the death of cleopatra was the signal these matters being finished once more we stood and our hands upon the sacred symbol swore the oath that may not be written and then my uncle kissed me with tears of hope and joy standing in his keen black eyes he blessed me saying that he would gladly give his life ay and a hundred lives if they were his if he might but live to see egypt once more a nation and me harmachis the descendant of its royal and ancient blood seated on the throne for he was a patriot indeed asking nothing for himself and giving all things to his cause and i kissed him in turn and thus we parted nor did i ever see him more in the flesh who has earned the rest that as yet is denied to me  so i went and there being yet time walked swiftly from place to place in the great city taking note of the positions of the gates and of the places where our forces must be gathered at length i came to that quay where i had landed and saw a vessel sailing for the open sea i looked and in my heaviness of heart longed that i were aboard of her to be borne by her white wings to some far shore where i might live obscure and die forgotten also i saw another vessel that had dropped down the nile from whose deck the passengers were streaming for a moment i stood watching them idly wondering if they were from abouthis when suddenly i heard a familiar voice beside me  la la said the voice why what a city is this for an old woman to seek her fortune in and how shall i find those to whom i am known as well look for the rush in the papyrusroll begone thou knave and let my basket of simples lie or by the gods ill doctor thee with them        papyrus was manufactured from the pith of rushes hence      atouas sayingeditor  i turned wondering and found myself face to face with my fosternurse atoua she knew me instantly for i saw her start but in the presence of the people she checked her surprise  good sir she whined lifting her withered countenance towards me and at the same time making the secret sign by thy dress thou shouldst be an astronomer and i was specially told to avoid astronomers as a pack of lying tricksters who worship their own star only and therefore i speak to thee acting on the principle of contraries which is law to us women for surely in this alexandria where all things are upside down the astronomers may be the honest men since the rest are clearly knaves and then being by now out of earshot of the press royal harmachis i am come charged with a message to thee from thy father amenemhat  is he well i asked  yes he is well though waiting for the moment tries him sorely  and his message  it is this he sends greeting to thee and with it warning that a great danger threatens thee though he cannot read it these are his words be steadfast and prosper  i bowed my head and the words struck a new chill of fear into my soul  when is the time she asked  this very night where goest thou  to the house of the honourable sepa priest of annu canst thou guide me thither  nay i may not stay nor is it wise that i should be seen with thee hold and i called a porter who was idling on the quay and giving him a piece of money bade him guide the old wife to the house  farewell she whispered farewell till tomorrow be steadfast and prosper  then i turned and went my way through the crowded streets where the people made place for me the astronomer of cleopatra for my fame had spread abroad  and even as i went my footsteps seemed to beat be steadfast be steadfast be steadfast till at last it was as though the very ground cried out its warning to me    chapter vii  of the veiled words of charmion of the passing of harmachis into the presence of cleopatra and of the overthrow of harmachis  it was night and i sat alone in my chamber waiting the moment when as it was agreed charmion should summon me to pass down to cleopatra i sat alone and there before me lay the dagger that was to pierce her it was long and keen and the handle was formed of a sphinx of solid gold i sat alone questioning the future but no answer came at length i looked up and charmion stood before mecharmion no longer gay and bright but pale of face and holloweyed  royal harmachis she said cleopatra summons thee presently to declare to her the voices of the stars  so the hour had fallen  it is well charmion i answered are all things in order  yea my lord all things are in order well primed with wine paulus guards the gates the eunuchs are withdrawn save one the legionaries sleep and already sepa and his force lie hid without nothing has been neglected and no lamb skipping at the shamble doors can be more innocent of its doom than is queen cleopatra  it is well i said again let us be going and rising i placed the dagger in the bosom of my robe taking a cup of wine that stood near i drank deep of it for i had scarce tasted food all that day  one word charmion said hurriedly for it is not yet time last nightah last night and her bosom heaved i dreamed a dream that haunts me strangely and perchance thou also didst dream a dream it was all a dream and tis forgotten is it not so my lord  yes yes i said why troublest thou me thus at such an hour  nay i know not but tonight harmachis fate is in labour of a great event and in her painful throes mayhap shell crush me in her gripme or thee or the twain of us harmachis and if that be sowell i would hear from thee before it is done that twas naught but a dream and that dream forgot  yes it is all a dream i said idly thou and i and the solid earth and this heavy night of terror ay and this keen knifewhat are these but dreams and with what face shall the waking come  so now thou fallest in my humour royal harmachis as thou sayest we dream and while we dream yet can the vision change for the phantasies of dreams are wonderful seeing that they have no stability but vary like the vaporous edge of sunset clouds building now this thing and now that being now dark and heavy and now alight with splendour therefore before we wake tomorrow tell me one word is that vision of last night wherein i seemed to be quite shamed and thou didst seem to laugh upon my shame a fixed phantasy or can it perchance yet change its countenance for remember when that waking comes the vagaries of our sleep will be more unalterable and more enduring than are the pyramids then they will be gathered into that changeless region of the past where all things great and smallay even dreams harmachis are each in its own semblance frozen to stone and built into the tomb of time immortal  nay charmion i replied i grieve if i did pain thee but over that vision comes no change i said what was in my heart and theres an end thou art my cousin and my friend i can never be more to thee  it is welltis very well she said let it be forgotten and now on from dreamto dream and she smiled with such a smile as i had never seen her wear before it was sadder and more fateful than any stamp that grief can set upon the brow  for though being blinded by my own folly and the trouble at my heart i knew it not with that smile the happiness of youth died for charmion the egyptian the hope of love fled and the holy links of duty burst asunder with that smile she consecrated herself to evil she renounced her country and her gods and trampled on her oath ay that smile marks the moment when the stream of history changed its course for had i never seen it on her face octavianus had not bestridden the world and egypt had once more been free and great  and yet it was but a womans smile  why lookest thou thus strangely girl i asked  in dreams we smile she answered and now it is time follow thou me be firm and prosper royal harmachis and bending forward she took my hand and kissed it then with one strange last look she turned and led the way down the stair and through the empty halls  in the chamber that is called the alabaster hall the roof of which is upborne by columns of black marble we stayed for beyond was the private chamber of cleopatra the same in which i had seen her sleeping  abide thou here she said while i tell cleopatra of thy coming and she glided from my side  i stood for long mayhap in all the half of an hour counting my own heartbeats and as in a dream striving to gather up my strength to that which lay before me  at length charmion came back her head held low and walking heavily  cleopatra waits thee she said pass on there is no guard  where do i meet thee when what must be done is done i asked hoarsely  thou meetest me here and then to paulus be firm and prosper harmachis fare thee well  and so i went but at the curtain i turned suddenly and there in the midst of that lonely lamplit hall i saw a strange sight far away in such a fashion that the light struck full upon her stood charmion her head thrown back her white arms outstretched as though to clasp and on her girlish face a stamp of anguished passion so terrible to see that indeed i cannot tell it for she believed that i whom she loved was passing to my death and this was her last farewell to me  but i knew naught of this matter so with another passing pang of wonder i drew aside the curtains gained the doorway and stood in cleopatras chamber and there upon a silken couch at the far end of the perfumed chamber clad in wonderful white attire rested cleopatra in her hand was a jewelled fan of ostrich plumes with which she gently fanned herself and by her side was her harp of ivory and a little table whereon were figs and goblets and a flask of rubycoloured wine i drew near slowly through the soft dim light to where the wonder of the world lay in all her glowing beauty and indeed i have never seen her look so fair as she did upon that fatal night couched in her amber cushions she seemed to shine as a star on the twilights glow perfume came from her hair and robes music fell from her lips and in her heavenly eyes all lights changed and gathered as in the ominous opals disc  and this was the woman whom presently i must slay  slowly i drew near bowing as i came but she took no heed she lay there and the jewelled fan floated to and fro like the bright wing of some hovering bird  at length i stood before her and she glanced up the ostrichplumes pressed against her breast as though to hide its beauty  what friend art thou come she said it is well for i grew lonely here nay tis a weary world we know so many faces and there are so few whom we love to see again well stand not there so mute but be seated and she pointed with her fan to a carven chair that was placed near her feet  once more i bowed and took the seat  i have obeyed the queens desire i said and with much care and skill worked out the lessons of the stars and here is the record of my labour if the queen permits i will expound it to her and i rose in order that i might pass round the couch and as she read stab her in the back  nay harmachis she said quietly and with a slow and lovely smile bide thou where thou art and give me the writing by serapis thy face is too comely for me to wish to lose the sight of it  checked in this design i could do nothing but hand her the papyrus thinking to myself that while she read i would arise suddenly and plunge the dagger to her heart she took it and as she did so touched my hand then she made pretence to read but she read no word for i saw that her eyes were fixed upon me over the edge of the scroll  why placest thou thy hand within thy robe she asked presently for indeed i clutched the daggers hilt is thy heart stirred  yea o queen i said it beats high  she gave no answer but once more made pretence to read and the while she watched me  i took counsel with myself how should i do the hateful deed if i flung myself upon her now she would see me and scream and struggle nay i must wait a chance  the auguries are favourable then harmachis she said at length though this she must have guessed  yes o queen i answered  it is well and she cast the writing on the marble the ships shall sail for good or bad i am weary of weighing chances  this is a heavy matter o queen i said i had wished to show upon what circumstance i base my forecast  nay not so harmachis i have wearied of the ways of stars thou hast prophesied that is enough for me for doubtless being honest thou hast written honestly therefore save thou thy reasons and well be merry what shall we do i could dance to theethere are none who can dance so wellbut it would scarce be queenly nay i have it i will sing and leaning forward she raised herself and bending the harp towards her struck some wandering chords then her low voice broke out in perfect and most sweet song  and thus she sang       night on the sea and night upon the sky      and music in our hearts we floated there      lulled by the low sea voices thou and i      and the winds kisses in my cloudy hair      and thou didst gaze on me and call me fair      enfolded by the starry robe of night      and then thy singing thrilled upon the air      voice of the hearts desire and loves delight       adrift with starlit skies above      with starlit seas below      we move with all the suns that move      with all the seas that flow      for bond or free earth sky and sea      wheel with one circling will      and thy heart drifteth on to me      and only time stands still       between two shores of death we drift      behind are things forgot      before the tide is driving swift      to lands beholden not      above the sky is far and cold      below the moaning sea      sweeps oer the loves that were of old      but oh love kiss thou me       ah lonely are the ocean ways      and dangerous the deep      and frail the fairy barque that strays      above the seas asleep      ah toil no more at sail nor oar      we drift or bond or free      on yon far shore the breakers roar      but oh love kiss thou me       and ever as thou sangest i drew near      then sudden silence heard our hearts that beat      for now there was an end of doubt and fear      now passion filled my soul and led my feet      then silent didst thou rise thy love to meet      who sinking on thy breast knew naught but thee      and in the happy night i kissed thee sweet      ah sweet between the starlight and the sea  the last echoes of her rich notes floated down the chamber and slowly died away but in my heart they rolled on and on i have heard among the womensingers at abouthis voices more perfect than the voice of cleopatra but never have i heard one so thrilling or so sweet with passions honeynotes and indeed it was not the voice alone it was the perfumed chamber in which was set all that could move the sense it was the passion of the thought and words and the surpassing grace and loveliness of that most royal woman who sang them for as she sang i seemed to think that we twain were indeed floating alone with the night upon the starlit summer sea and when she ceased to touch the harp and rising suddenly stretched out her arms towards me and with the last low notes of song yet quivering upon her lips let fall the wonder of her eyes upon my eyes she almost drew me to her but i remembered and would not  hast thou then no word of thanks for my poor singing harmachis she said at length  yea o queen i answered speaking very low for my voice was choked but thy songs are not good for the sons of men to hearof a truth they overwhelm me  nay harmachis there is no fear for thee she said laughing softly seeing that i know how far thy thoughts are set from womans beauty and the common weakness of thy sex with cold iron we may safely toy  i thought within myself that coldest iron can be brought to whitest heat if the fire be fierce enough but i said nothing and though my hand trembled i once more grasped the daggers hilt and wild with fear at my own weakness set myself to find a means to slay her while yet my sense remained  come hither harmachis she went on in her softest voice come sit by me and we will talk together for i have much to tell thee and she made place for me at her side upon the silken seat  and i thinking that i might so more swiftly strike rose and seated myself some little way from her on the couch while flinging back her head she gazed on me with her slumbrous eyes  now was my occasion for her throat and breast were bare and with a mighty effort once again i lifted my hand to clutch the daggerhilt but more quick than thought she caught my fingers with her own and gently held them  why lookest thou so wildly harmachis she said art sick  ay sick indeed i gasped  then lean thou on the cushions and rest thee she answered still holding my hand from which the strength had fled the fit will surely pass too long hast thou laboured with thy stars how soft is the night air that flows from yonder casement heavy with the breath of lilies hark to the whisper of the sea lapping against the rocks that though it is faint yet being so strong doth almost drown the quick cool fall of yonder fountain list to philomel how sweet from a full heart of love she sings her message to her dear indeed it is a lovely night and most beautiful is natures music sung with a hundred voices from wind and trees and birds and oceans wrinkled lips and yet sung all to tune listen harmachis i have guessed something concerning thee thou too art of a royal race no humble blood pours in those veins of thine surely such a shoot could spring but from the stock of princes what gazest thou at the leafmark on my breast it was pricked there in honour of great osiris whom with thee i worship see  let me hence i groaned striving to rise but all my strength had gone  nay not yet awhile thou wouldst not leave me yet thou canst not leave me yet harmachis hast thou never loved  nay nay o queen what have i to do with love let me hencei am fainti am fordone  never to have lovedtis strange never to have known some womanheart beat all in tune to thinenever to have seen the eyes of thy adored aswim with passions tears as she sighed her vows upon thy breastnever to have lovednever to have lost thyself in the mystery of anothers soul nor to have learned how nature can overcome our naked loneliness and with the golden web of love of twain weave one identity why it is never to have lived harmachis  and ever as she murmured she drew nearer to me till at last with a long sweet sigh she flung one arm about my neck and gazed upon me with blue unfathomable eyes and smiled her dark slow smile that like an opening flower revealed beauty within beauty hidden nearer she bent her queenly form and still more nearnow her perfumed breath played upon my hair and now her lips met mine  and woe is me in that kiss more deadly and more strong than the embrace of death were forgotten isis my heavenly hope oaths honour country friends all thingsall things save that cleopatra clasped me in her arms and called me love and lord  now pledge me she sighed pledge me one cup of wine in token of thy love  i took the draught and i drank deep then too late i knew that it was drugged  i fell upon the couch and though my senses still were with me i could neither speak nor rise  but cleopatra bending over me drew the dagger from my robe  ive won she cried shaking back her long hair ive won and for the stake of egypt why twas a game worth playing with this dagger then thou wouldst have slain me o my royal rival whose myrmidons even now are gathered at my palace gate art still awake now what hinders me that i should not plunge it to thy heart  i heard and feebly pointed to my breast for i was fain to die she drew herself to the full of her imperial height and the great knife glittered in her hand down it came till its edge pricked my flesh  nay she cried again and cast it from her too well i like thee it were pity to slay such a man i give thee thy life live on lost pharaoh live on poor fallen prince blasted by a womans wit live on harmachisto adorn my triumph    then sight left me and in my ears i only heard the song of the nightingale the murmur of the sea and the music of cleopatras laugh of victory and as i sank away the sound of that low laugh still followed me into the land of sleep and still it follows me through life to death    chapter viii  of the awaking of harmachis of the sight of death of the coming of cleopatra and of her comfortable words  once more i woke it was to find myself in my own chamber i started up surely i too had dreamed a dream it could be nothing but a dream it could not be that i woke to know myself a traitor that the opportunity had gone for ever that i had betrayed the cause and that last night those brave men headed by my uncle had waited in vain at the outer gate that egypt from abu to athu was even now waitingwaiting in vain nay whatever else might be this could not be oh it was an awful dream which i had dreamed a second such would slay a man it were better to die than face such another vision sent from hell but though the thing was naught but a hateful phantasy of a mind oerstrained where was i now where was i now i should be in the alabaster hall waiting till charmion came forth  where was i and o ye gods what was that dreadful thing whose shape was the shape of a manthat thing draped in bloodstained white and huddled in a hideous heap at the foot of the couch on which i seemed to lie  i sprang at it with a shriek as a lion springs and struck with all my strength the blow fell heavily and beneath its weight the thing rolled over upon its side half mad with terror i rent away the white covering and there his knees bound beneath his hanging jaw was the naked body of a manand that man the roman captain paulus there he lay through his heart a daggermy dagger handled with the sphinx of goldand pinned by its blade to his broad breast a scroll and on the scroll writing in the roman character i drew near and read and this was the writing  harmachidisalvereegosumquemsubderenoras paulusromanusdiscehincquidprodereprosit  greeting harmachis i was that roman paulus whom thou didst suborn learn now how blessed are traitors  sick and faint i staggered back from the sight of that white corpse stained with its own blood sick and faint i staggered back till the wall stayed me while without the birds sang a merry greeting to the day so it was no dream and i was lost lost  i thought of my aged father amenemhat yes the vision of him flashed into my mind as he would be when they came to tell him his sons shame and the ruin of all his hopes i thought of that patriot priest my uncle sepa waiting the long night through for the signal which never came ah and another thought followed swift how would it go with them i was not the only traitor i too had been betrayed by whom by yonder paulus perchance if it were paulus he knew but little of those who conspired with me but the secret lists had been in my robe o osiris they were gone and the fate of paulus would be the fate of all the patriots in egypt and at this thought my mind gave way i sank and swooned even where i stood  my sense came back to me and the lengthening shadows told me that it was afternoon i staggered to my feet the corpse of paulus was still there keeping its awful watch above me i ran desperately to the door it was barred and without i heard the tramp of sentinels as i stood they challenged and grounded their spears then the bolts were shot back the door opened and radiant clad in royal attire came the conquering cleopatra she came alone and the door was shut behind her i stood like one distraught but she swept on till she was face to face with me  greeting harmachis she said smiling sweetly so my messenger has found thee and she pointed to the corpse of paulus pah he has an ugly look ho guards  the door was opened and two armed gauls stepped across the threshold  take away this carrion said cleopatra and fling it to the kites stay draw that dagger from his traitor breast the men bowed low and the knife rusted red with blood was dragged from the heart of paulus and laid upon the table then they seized him by the head and body and staggered thence and i heard their heavy footfalls as they bore him down the stairs  methinks harmachis thou art in an evil case she said when the sound of the footfalls had died away how strangely the wheel of fortune turns but for that traitor and she nodded towards the door through which the corpse of paulus had been carried i should now be as ill a thing to look on as he is and the red rust on yonder knife would have been gathered from my heart  so it was paulus who had betrayed me  ay she went on and when thou camest to me last night i knew that thou camest to slay when time upon time thou didst place thy hand within thy robe i knew that it grasped a dagger hilt and that thou wast gathering thy courage to the deed which thou didst little love to do oh it was a strange wild hour well worth the living and i wondered greatly from moment to moment which of us twain would conquer as we matched guile with guile and force to force  yea harmachis the guards tramp before thy door but be not deceived did i not know that i hold thee to me by bonds more strong than prison chainsdid i not know that i am hedged from ill at thy hands by a fence of honour harder for thee to pass than all the spears of all my legions thou hadst been dead ere now harmachis see here is thy knife and she handed me the dagger now slay me if thou canst and she drew near tore open the bosom of her robe and stood waiting with calm eyes  thou canst not slay me she went on for there are things as i know well that no manno man such as thou artmay do and live and this is the chief of themto slay the woman who is all his own nay stay thy hand turn not that dagger against thy breast for if thou mayst not slay me by how much more mayst thou not slay thyself o thou forsworn priest of isis art thou then so eager to face that outraged majesty in amenti with what eyes thinkest thou will the heavenly mother look upon her son who shamed in all things and false to his most sacred vow comes to greet her his lifeblood on his hands where then will be the space for thy atonementif indeed thou mayest atone  then i could bear no more for my heart was broken alas it was too truei dared not die i was come to such a pass that i did not even dare to die i flung myself upon the couch and weptwept tears of blood and anguish  but cleopatra came to me and seating herself beside me she strove to comfort me throwing her arms about my neck  nay love look up she said all is not lost for thee nor am i angered against thee we did play a mighty game but as i warned thee i matched my womans magic against thine and i have conquered but i will be open with thee both as queen and woman thou hast my pityay and more nor do i love to see thee plunged in sorrow it was well and right that thou shouldst strive to win back that throne my fathers seized and the ancient liberty of egypt myself as lawful queen had done the same nor shrunk from the deed of darkness to which i was sworn therein then thou hast my sympathy that ever goes out to what is great and bold it is well also that thou shouldst grieve over the greatness of thy fall therein then as womanas loving womanthou hast my sympathy nor is all lost thy plan was foolishfor as i hold egypt could never have stood alonefor though thou hadst won the crown and countryas without a doubt thou must have doneyet there was the roman to be reckoned with and for thy hope learn this i am little known there is no heart in this wide land that beats with a truer love for ancient khem than does this heart of minenay not thine own harmachis yet i have been heavily shackled heretoforefor wars rebellions envies plots have hemmed me in on every side so that i might not serve my people as i would but thou harmachis shalt show me how thou shalt be my counsellor and my love is it a little thing harmachis to have won the heart of cleopatra that heartfie on theethat thou wouldst have stilled yes thou shalt unite me to my people and we will reign together thus linking in one the new kingdom and the old and the new thought and the old so do all things work for gooday for the very best and thus by another and a gentler road thou shalt climb to pharaohs throne  see thou this harmachis thy treachery shall be cloaked about as much as may be was it then thy fault that a roman knave betrayed thy plans that thereon thou wast drugged thy secret papers stolen and their key guessed will it then be a blame to thee the great plot being broken and those who built it scattered that thou still faithful to thy trust didst serve thee of such means as nature gave thee and win the heart of egypts queen that through her gentle love thou mightest yet attain thy ends and spread thy wings of power across the land of nile am i an illcounsellor thinkest thou harmachis  i lifted my head and a ray of hope crept into the darkness of my heart for when men fall they grasp at feathers then i spoke for the first time  and those with methose who trusted mewhat of them  ay she answered amenemhat thy father the aged priest of abouthis and sepa thy uncle that fiery patriot whose great heart is hid beneath so common a shell of form and  i thought she would have said charmion but she named her not  and many othersoh i know them all  ay i said what of them  hear now harmachis she answered rising and placing her hand upon my arm for thy sake i will show mercy to them i will do no more than must be done i swear by my throne and by all the gods of egypt that not one hair of thy aged fathers head shall be harmed by me and if it be not too late i will also spare thy uncle sepa ay and the others i will not do as did my forefather epiphanes who when the egyptians rose against him dragged athinis pausiras chesuphus and irobasthus bound to his chariotnot as achilles dragged hector but yet livinground the city walls i will spare them all save the hebrews if there be any hebrews for the jews i hate  there are no hebrews i said  it is well she said for no hebrew will i ever spare am i then indeed so cruel a woman as they say in thy list harmachis were many doomed to die and i have but taken the life of one roman knave a double traitor for he betrayed both me and thee art thou not overwhelmed harmachis with the weight of mercy which i give thee becausesuch are a womans reasonsthou pleasest me harmachis nay by serapis she added with a little laugh ill change my mind i will not give thee so much for nothing thou shalt buy it from me and the price shall be a heavy oneit shall be a kiss harmachis  nay i said turning from that fair temptress the price is too heavy i kiss no more  bethink thee she answered with a heavy frown bethink thee and choose i am but a woman harmachis and one who is not wont to sue to men do as thou wilt but this i say to theeif thou dost put me away i will gather up the mercy i have meted out therefore most virtuous priest choose thou between the heavy burden of my love and the swift death of thy aged father and of all those who plotted with him  i glanced at her and saw that she was angered for her eyes shone and her bosom heaved so i sighed and kissed her thereby setting the seal upon my shame and bondage then smiling like the triumphant aphrodité of the greeks she went thence bearing the dagger with her  i knew not yet how deeply i was betrayed or why i was still left to draw the breath of life or why cleopatra the tigerhearted had grown merciful i did not know that she feared to slay me lest so strong was the plot and so feeble her hold upon the double crown the tumult that might tread hard upon the tidings of my murder should shake her from the throneeven when i was no more i did not know that because of fear and the weight of policy only she showed scant mercy to those whom i had betrayed or that because of cunning and not for the holy sake of womans lovethough in truth she liked me well enoughshe chose rather to bind me to her by the fibres of my heart and yet i will say this in her behalf even when the dangercloud had melted from her sky she kept faith nor save paulus and one other did any suffer the utmost penalty of death for their part in the great plot against cleopatras crown and dynasty but they suffered many other things  and so she went leaving the vision of her glory to strive with the shame and sorrow in my heart oh bitter were the hours that could not now be made light with prayer for the link between me and the divine was snapped and isis communed with her priest no more bitter were the hours and dark but ever through their darkness shone the starry eyes of cleopatra and came the echo of her whispered love for not yet was the cup of sorrow full hope still lingered in my heart and i could almost think that i had failed to some higher end and that in the depths of ruin i should find another and more flowery path to triumph  for thus those who sin deceive themselves striving to lay the burden of their evil deeds upon the back of fate striving to believe their wickedness may compass good and to murder conscience with the sharp plea of necessity but it can avail nothing for hand in hand down the path of sin rush remorse and ruin and woe to him they follow ay and woe to me who of all sinners am the chief    chapter ix  of the imprisonment of harmachis of the scorn of charmion of the setting free of harmachis and of the coming of quintus dellius  for a space of eleven days i was thus kept prisoned in my chamber nor did i see anyone except the sentries at my doors the slaves who in silence brought me food and drink and cleopatras self who came continually but though her words of love were many she would tell me nothing of how things went without she came in many moodsnow gay and laughing now full of wise thoughts and speech and now passionate only and to every mood she gave some newfound charm she was full of talk as to how i should help her make egypt great and lessen the burdens on the people and fright the roman eagles back and though at first i listened heavily when she spoke thus by slow advance as she wrapped me closer and yet more close in her magic web from which there was no escape my mind fell in time with hers then i too opened something of my heart and somewhat also of the plans that i had formed for egypt she seemed to listen gladly weighing them all and spoke of means and methods telling me how she would purify the faith and repair the ancient templesay and build new ones to the gods and ever she crept deeper into my heart till at length now that every other thing had gone from me i learned to love her with all the unspent passion of my aching soul i had naught left to me but cleopatras love and i twined my life about it and brooded on it as a widow over her only babe and thus the very author of my shame became my all my dearest dear and i loved her with a strong love that grew and grew till it seemed to swallow up the past and make the present a dream for she had conquered me she had robbed me of my honour and steeped me to the lips in shame and i poor fallen blinded wretch i kissed the rod that smote me and was her very slave  ay even now in those dreams which still come when sleep unlocks the secret heart and sets its terrors free to roam through the opened halls of thought i seem to see her royal form as erst i saw it come with arms outstretched and loves own light shining in her eyes with lips apart and flowing locks and stamped upon her face the look of utter tenderness that she alone could wear ay still after all the years i seem to see her come as erst she came and still i wake to know her an unutterable lie  and thus one day she came she had fled in haste she said from some great council summoned concerning the wars of antony in syria and she came as she had left the council in all her robes of state the sceptre in her hand and on her brow the uræus diadem of gold there she sat before me laughing for wearying of them she had told the envoys to whom she gave audience in the council that she was called from their presence by a sudden message come from rome and the jest seemed merry to her suddenly she rose took the diadem from her brow and set it on my hair and on my shoulders her royal mantle and in my hand the sceptre and bowed the knee before me then laughing again she kissed me on the lips and said i was indeed her king but remembering how i had been crowned in the halls of abouthis and remembering also that wreath of roses of which the odour haunts me yet i rose pale with wrath and cast the trinkets from me asking how she dared to mock meher caged bird and i think there was that about me which startled her for she fell back  nay harmachis she said be not wroth how knowest thou that i mock thee how knowest thou that thou shalt not be pharaoh in fact and deed  what meanest thou i said wilt thou then wed me before egypt how else can i be pharaoh now  she cast down her eyes perchance love it is in my mind to wed thee she said gently listen she went on thou growest pale here in this prison and thou dost eat little gainsay me not i know it from the slaves i have kept thee here harmachis for thy own sake that is so dear to me and for thy own sake and thy honours sake thou must still seem to be my prisoner else wouldst thou be shamed and slainay murdered secretly but i can meet thee here no more therefore tomorrow i shall free thee in all save in the name and thou shalt once more be seen at court as my astronomer and i will give this reasonthat thou hast cleared thyself and moreover that thy auguries as regards the war have been auguries of truthas indeed they have though for this i have no cause to thank thee seeing that thou didst suit thy prophecies to fit thy cause now farewell for i must return to those heavybrowed ambassadors and grow not so sudden wroth harmachis for who knows what may come to pass betwixt thee and me  and with a little nod she went leaving it on my mind that she had it in her heart to wed me openly and of a truth i believe that at this hour such was her thought for if she loved me not still she held me dear and as yet she had not wearied of me  on the morrow cleopatra came not but charmion camecharmion whom i had not seen since that fatal night of ruin she entered and stood before me with pale face and downcast eyes and her first words were words of bitterness  pardon me she said in her gentle voice in that i dare to come to thee in cleopatras place thy joy is not delayed for long for thou shalt see her presently  i shrank at her words as well i might and seeing her vantage she seized it  i come harmachisroyal no morei come to say that thou art free thou art free to face thine own infamy and see it thrown back from every eye which trusted thee as shadows are from water i come to tell thee that the great plotthe plot of twenty years and moreis at its utter end none have been slain indeed unless it is sepa who has vanished but all the leaders have been seized and put in chains or driven from the land and their party is broken and scattered the storm has melted before it burst egypt is lost and lost for ever for her last hope is gone no longer may she strugglenow for all time she must bow her neck to the yoke and bare her back to the rod of the oppressor  i groaned aloud alas i was betrayed i said paulus betrayed us  thou wast betrayed nay thou thyself wast the betrayer how came it that thou didst not slay cleopatra when thou wast alone with her speak thou forsworn  she drugged me i said again  o harmachis answered the pitiless girl how low art thou fallen from that prince whom once i knewthou who dost not scorn to be a liar yea thou wast druggeddrugged with a lovephiltre yea thou didst sell egypt and thy cause for the price of a wantons kiss thou sorrow and thou shame she went on pointing her finger at me and lifting her eyes to my face thou scornthou outcastand thou contempt deny if it thou canst ay shrink from meknowing what thou art well mayst thou shrink crawl to cleopatras feet and kiss her sandals till such time as it pleases her to trample thee in thy kindred dirt but from all honest folk shrinkshrink  my soul quivered beneath the lash of her bitter scorn and hate but i had no words to answer  how comes it i said at last in a heavy voice that thou too art not betrayed but art still here to taunt me thou who once didst swear that thou didst love me being a woman hast thou no pity for the frailty of man  my name was not on the lists she said dropping her dark eyes here is an opportunity betray me also harmachis ay it is because i once loved theedost thou indeed remember itthat i feel thy fall the more the shame of one whom we have loved must in some sort become our shame and must ever cling to us because we blindly held a thing so base close to our inmost heart art thou also then a fool wouldst thou fresh from thy royal wantons arms come to me for comfortto me of all the world  how know i i said that it was not thou who in thy jealous anger didst betray our plans charmion long ago sepa warned me against thee and of a truth now that i recall  it is like a traitor she broke in reddening to her brow to think that all are of his family and hold a common mind nay i betrayed thee not it was that poor knave paulus whose heart failed him at the last and who is rightly served nor will i stay to hear thoughts so base harmachisroyal no morecleopatra queen of egypt bids me say that thou art free and that she waits thee in the alabaster hall  and shooting one swift glance through her long lashes she curtsied and was gone    so once more i came and went about the court though but sparingly for my heart was full of shame and terror and on every face i feared to see the scorn of those who knew me for what i was but i saw nothing for all those who had knowledge of the plot had fled and charmion had spoken no word for her own sake also cleopatra had put it about that i was innocent but my guilt lay heavy on me and made me thin and wore away the beauty of my countenance and though i was free in name yet i was ever watched nor might i stir beyond the palace grounds  and at length came the day which brought with it quintus dellius that false roman knight who ever served the rising star he bore letters to cleopatra from marcus antonius the triumvir who fresh from the victory of philippi was now in asia wringing gold from the subject kings with which to satisfy the greed of his legionaries  well i mind me of the day cleopatra clad in her robes of state attended by the officers of her court among whom i stood sat in the great hall on her throne of gold and bade the heralds admit the ambassador of antony the triumvir the great doors were thrown wide and amidst the blare of trumpets and salutes of the gallic guards the roman came in clad in glittering golden armour and a scarlet cloak of silk and followed by his suite of officers he was smoothfaced and fair to look upon and with a supple form but his mouth was cold and false were his shifting eyes and while the heralds called out his name titles and offices he fixed his gaze on cleopatrawho sat idly on her throne all radiant with beautyas a man who is amazed then when the heralds had made an end and he still stood thus not stirring cleopatra spoke in the latin tongue  greeting to thee noble dellius envoy of the most mighty antony whose shadow lies across the world as though mars himself now towered up above us petty princesgreeting and welcome to our poor city of alexandria unfold we pray thee the purpose of thy coming  still the crafty dellius made no answer but stood as a man amazed  what ails thee noble dellius that thou dost not speak asked cleopatra hast thou then wandered so long in asia that the doors of roman speech are shut to thee what tongue hast thou name it and we will speak in itfor all tongues are known to us  then at last he spoke in a soft full voice oh pardon me most lovely egypt if i have thus been stricken dumb before thee but too great beauty like death himself doth paralyse the tongue and steal our sense away the eyes of him who looks upon the fires of the midday sun are blind to all beside and thus this sudden vision of thy glory royal egypt overwhelmed my mind and left me helpless and unwitting of all things else  of a truth noble dellius answered cleopatra they teach a pretty school of flattery yonder in cilicia  how goes the saying here in alexandria replied the courtly roman the breath of flattery cannot waft a cloud does it not but to my task here royal egypt are letters under the hand and seal of the noble antony treating of certain matters of the state is it thy pleasure that i should read them openly        in other words what is divine is beyond the reach of      human praiseeditor  break the seals and read she answered  then bowing he broke the seals and read  the triumviri reipublicæ constituendæ by the mouth of marcus antonius the triumvir to cleopatra by grace of the roman people queen of upper and lower egypt send greeting whereas it has come to our knowledge that thou cleopatra hast contrary to thy promise and thy duty both by thy servant allienus and by thy servant serapion the governor of cyprus aided the rebel murderer cassius against the arms of the most noble triumvirate and whereas it has come to our knowledge that thou thyself wast but lately making ready a great fleet to this end we summon thee that thou dost without delay journey to cilicia there to meet the noble antony and in person make answer concerning these charges which are laid against thee and we warn thee that if thou dost disobey this our summons it is at thy peril farewell  the eyes of cleopatra flashed as she hearkened to these high words and i saw her hands tighten on the golden lions heads whereon they rested  we have had the flattery she said and now lest we be cloyed with sweets we have its antidote listen thou dellius the charges in that letter or rather in that writ of summons are false as all folk can bear us witness but it is not now and it is not to thee that we will make defence of our acts of war and policy nor will we leave our kingdom to journey into far cilicia and there like some poor suppliant at law plead our cause before the court of the noble antony if antony would have speech with us and inquire concerning these high matters the sea is open and his welcome shall be royal let him come thither that is our answer to thee and to the triumvirate o dellius  but dellius smiled as one who would put away the weight of wrath and once more spoke  royal egypt thou knowest not the noble antony he is stern on paper and ever he sets down his thoughts as though his stylus were a spear dipped in the blood of men but face to face with him thou of all the world shalt find him the gentlest warrior that ever won a battle be advised o egypt and come send me not hence with such angry words for if thou dost draw antony to alexandria then woe to alexandria to the people of the nile and to thee great egypt for then he will come armed and breathing war and it shall go hard with thee who dost defy the gathered might of rome i pray thee then obey this summons come to cilicia come with peaceful gifts and not in arms come in thy beauty and tricked in thy best attire and thou hast naught to fear from the noble antony he paused and looked at her meaningly while i taking his drift felt the angry blood surge into my face  cleopatra too understood for i saw her rest her chin upon her hand and the cloud of thought gathered in her eyes for a time she sat thus while the crafty dellius watched her curiously and charmion standing with the other ladies by the throne she also read his meaning for her face lit up as a summer cloud lights in the evening when the broad lightning flares behind it then once more it grew pale and quiet  at length cleopatra spoke this is a heavy matter she said and therefore noble dellius we must have time to let our judgment ripen rest thou here and make thee as merry as our poor circumstances allow thou shalt have thy answer within ten days  the envoy thought awhile then replied smiling it is well o egypt on the tenth day from now i will attend for my answer and on the eleventh i sail hence to join antony my lord  once more at a sign from cleopatra the trumpets blared and he withdrew bowing    chapter x  of the trouble of cleopatra of her oath to harmachis and of the telling by harmachis to cleopatra of the secret of the treasure that lay beneath the mass of her  that same night cleopatra summoned me to her private chamber i went and found her much troubled in mind never before had i seen her so deeply moved she was alone and like some trapped lioness walked to and fro across the marble floor while thought chased thought across her mind each as clouds scudding over the sea for a moment casting its shadow in her deep eyes  so thou art come harmachis she said resting for a while as she took my hand counsel me for never did i need counsel more oh what days have the gods measured out to medays restless as the ocean i have known no peace from childhood up and it seems none shall i know scarce by a very little have i escaped thy daggers point harmachis when this new trouble that like a storm has gathered beneath the horizons rim suddenly bursts over me didst mark that tigerish fop well should i love to trap him how soft he spoke ay he purred like a cat and all the time he stretched his claws didst hear the letter too it has an ugly sound i know this antony when i was but a child budding into womanhood i saw him but my eyes were ever quick and i took his measure half hercules and half a fool with a dash of genius veining his folly through easily led by those who enter at the gates of his voluptuous sense but if crossed an iron foe true to his friends if indeed he loves them and ofttimes false to his own interest generous hardy and in adversity a man of virtue in prosperity a sot and a slave to woman that is antony how deal with such a man whom fate and opportunity despite himself have set on the crest of fortunes wave one day it will overwhelm him but till that day he sweeps across the world and laughs at those who drown  antony is but a man i answered and a man with many foes and being but a man he can be overthrown  ay he can be overthrown but he is one of three harmachis now that cassius hath gone where all fools go rome has thrown out a hydra head crush one and another hisses in thy face theres lepidus and with him that young octavianus whose cold eyes may yet with a smile of triumph look on the murdered forms of empty worthless lepidus of antony and of cleopatra if i go not to cilicia mark thou antony will knit up a peace with these parthians and taking the tales they tell of me for truthand indeed there is truth in themwill fall with all his force on egypt and how then  how then why then well drum him back to rome  ah thou sayest so and perchance harmachis had i not won that game we played together some twelve days gone thou being pharaoh mightest well have done this thing for round thy throne old egypt would have gathered but egypt loves not me nor my greek blood and i have but now scattered that great plot of thine in which half the land was meshed will these men then arise to succour me were egypt true to me i could indeed hold my own against all the force that rome may bring but egypt hates me and had as lief be ruled by the roman as the greek still i might make defence had i the gold for with money soldiers can be bought to feed the maw of mercenary battle but i have none my treasuries are dry and though there is wealth in the land yet debts perplex me these wars have brought me ruin and i know not how to find a talent perchance harmachis thou who art by hereditary right priest of the pyramids and she drew near and looked me in the eyes perchance if long descended rumour does not lie thou canst tell me where i can touch the gold to save thy land from ruin and thy love from the grasp of antony say is it so  i thought a while and then i answered  and if such a tale were true and if i could show thee treasure stored by the mighty pharaohs of the most faroff age against the needs of khem how can i know that thou wouldst indeed make use of that wealth to those good ends  is there then a treasure she asked curiously nay fret me not harmachis for of a truth the very name of gold at this time of want is like the sight of water in the desert  i believe i said that there is such a treasure though i myself have never seen it but i know this that if it still lie in the place where it was set it is because so heavy a curse will rest upon him who shall lay hands on it wickedly and for selfish ends that none of those pharaohs to whom it has been shown have dared to touch it however sore their need  so she said they were cowardly aforetime or else their need was not great wilt thou show me this treasure then harmachis  perhaps i answered i will show it to thee if it still be there when thou hast sworn that thou wilt use it to defend egypt from this roman antony and for the welfare of her people  i swear it she said earnestly oh i swear by every god in khem that if thou showest me this great treasure i will defy antony and send dellius back to cilicia with sharper words than those he brought yes ill do more harmachis so soon as may be i will take thee to husband before all the world and thou thyself shalt carry out thy plans and beat off the roman eagles  thus she spoke gazing at me with truthful earnest eyes i believed her and for the first time since my fall was for a moment happy thinking that all was not lost to me and that with cleopatra whom i loved thus madly i might yet win my place and power back  swear it cleopatra i said  i swear beloved and thus i seal my oath and she kissed me on the forehead and i too kissed her and we talked of what we would do when we were wed and how we should overcome the roman  and thus i was again beguiled though i believe that had it not been for the jealous anger of charmionwhich as shall be seen was ever urging her forward to fresh deeds of shamecleopatra would have wedded me and broken with the roman and indeed in the issue it had been better for her and egypt  we sat far into the night and i revealed to her somewhat of that ancient secret of the mighty treasure hid beneath the mass of her thither it was agreed we should go on the morrow and the second night from now attempt its search so early on the next day a boat was secretly made ready and cleopatra entered it veiled as an egyptian lady about to make a pilgrimage to the temple of horemkhu and i also entered cloaked as a pilgrim and with us ten of her most trusted servants disguised as sailors but charmion went not with us we sailed with a fair wind from the canopic mouth of the nile and that night pushing on with the moon we reached sais at midnight and here rested for a while at dawn we once more loosed our craft and all that day sailed swiftly till at last at the third hour from the sunset we came in sight of the lights of that fortress which is called babylon here on the opposite bank of the river we moored our ship safely in a bed of reeds  then on foot and secretly we set out for the pyramids which were at a distance of two leagues cleopatra i and one trusted eunuch for we left the other servants with the boat only i caught an ass for cleopatra to ride that was wandering in a tilled field and threw a cloak upon it she sat on it and i led the ass by paths i knew the eunuch following us on foot and within little more than an hour having gained the great causeway we saw the mighty pyramids towering up through the moonlit air and aweing us to silence we passed on in utter silence through the haunted city of the dead for all around us stood the solemn tombs till at length we climbed the rocky hill and stood in the deep shadow of khufu khut the splendid throne of khufu  of a truth whispered cleopatra as she gazed up the dazzling marble slope above her everywhere blazoned over with a million mystic charactersof a truth there were gods ruling in khem in those days and not men this place is sad as deathay and as mighty and far from man is it here that we must enter  nay i answered it is not here pass on  i led the way through a thousand ancient tombs till we stood in the shadow of ur the great and gazed at his red heavenpiercing mass  is it here that we must enter she whispered once again  nay i answered it is not here pass on  we passed on through many more tombs till we stood in the shadow of her and cleopatra gazed astonished at its polished beauty which for thousands of years night by night had mirrored back the moon and at the black girdle of ethiopian stone that circled its base about for this is the most beautiful of all pyramids        the upper now known as the third pyramideditor  is it that we must enter she said  i answered it is here  we passed round between the temple of the worship of his divine majesty menkaura the osirian and in the base of the pyramid till we came to the north side here in the centre is graved the name of pharaoh menkaura who built the pyramid to be his tomb and stored his treasure in it against the need of khem  if the treasure still remains i said to cleopatra as it remained in the days of my greatgreatgrandfather who was priest of this pyramid before me it is hid deep in the womb of the mass before thee cleopatra nor can it be come by without toil danger and terror of mind art thou prepared to enterfor thou thyself must enter and must judge  canst thou not go in with the eunuch harmachis and bring the treasure forth she said for a little her courage began to fail her  nay cleopatra i answered not even for thee and for the weal of egypt can i do this thing for of all sins it would be the greatest sin but it is lawful for me to do this i as hereditary holder of the secret may upon demand show to the ruling monarch of khem the place where the treasure lies and show also the warning that is written and if on seeing and reading the pharaoh deems that the need of khem is so sore and strait that it is lawful for him to brave the curse of the dead and draw forth the treasure it is well for on his head must rest the weight of this dread deed three monarchsso say the records that i have readhave thus dared to enter in the time of need they were the divine queen hatshepsu that wonder known to the gods alone her divine brother tahutimes menkheperra and the divine rameses miamen but of these three majesties not one when they saw dared to touch for though sharp their need it was not great enough to consecrate the act so fearing lest the curse should fall upon them they went hence sorrowing  she thought a little till at last her spirit overcame her fear  at the least i will see with mine own eyes she said  it is well i answered then stones having been piled up by me and the eunuch who was with us on a certain spot at the base of the pyramid to somewhat more than the height of a man i climbed on them and searched for the secret mark no larger than a leaf i found it with some trouble for the weather and the rubbing of the windstirred sand had worn even the ethiopian stone having found it i pressed on it with all my strength in a certain fashion even after the lapse of many years the stone swung round showing a little opening through which a man might scarcely creep as it swung a mighty bat white in colour as though with unreckoned age and such as i had never seen before for bigness for his measure was the measure of a hawk flew forth and for a moment hovered over cleopatra then sailed slowly up and up in circles till at last he was lost in the bright light of the moon  but cleopatra uttered a cry of terror and the eunuch who was watching fell down in fear believing it to be the guardian spirit of the pyramid and i too feared though i said nothing for even now i believe that it was the spirit of menkaura the osirian who taking the form of a bat flew forth from his holy house in warning  i waited a while till the foul air should clear from the passage then i drew out the lamps kindled them and passed them to the number of three into the entrance of the passage this done i went to the eunuch and taking him aside i swore him by the living spirit of him who sleeps at abouthis that he should not reveal those things which he was about to see  this he swore trembling sorely for he was very much afraid nor indeed did he reveal them  this done i clambered through the opening taking with me a coil of rope which i wound around my middle and beckoned to cleopatra to come making fast the skirt of her robe she came and i drew her through the opening so that at length she stood behind me in the passage which is lined with slabs of granite after her came the eunuch and he also stood in the passage then having taken counsel of the plan of the passage that i had brought with me and which in signs that none but the initiated can read was copied from those ancient writings that had come down to me through oneandforty generations of my predecessors the priests of this pyramid of her and of the worship of the temple of the divine menkaura the osirian i led the way through that darksome place towards the utter silence of the tomb guided by the feeble light of our lamps we passed down the steep incline gasping in the heat and the thick stagnated air presently we had left the region of the masonry and were slipping down a gallery hewn in the living rock for twenty paces or more it ran steeply then its slope lessened and shortly we found ourselves in a chamber painted white so low that i being tall had scarcely room to stand but in length four paces and in breadth three and cased throughout with sculptured panels here cleopatra sank upon the floor and rested awhile overcome by the heat and the utter darkness  rise i said we must not linger here or we faint  so she rose and passing hand in hand through that chamber we found ourselves face to face with a mighty door of granite let down from the roof in grooves once more i took counsel of the plan pressed with my foot upon a certain stone and waited then suddenly and softly i know not by what means the mass heaved itself from its bed of living rock we passed beneath and found ourselves face to face with a second door of granite again i pressed on a certain spot and this door swung wide of itself and we went through to find ourselves face to face with a third door yet more mighty than the two through which we had won our way following the secret plan i struck this door with my foot upon a certain spot and it sank slowly as though at a word of magic till its head was level with the floor of rock we crossed and gained another passage which descending gently for a length of fourteen paces led us into a great chamber paved with black marble more than nine cubits high by nine cubits broad and thirty cubits long in this marble floor was sunk a great sarcophagus of granite and on its lid were graved the name and titles of the queen of menkaura in this chamber too the air was purer though i know not by what means it came thither  is the treasure here gasped cleopatra  nay i answered follow me and i led the way to a gallery which we entered through an opening in the floor of the great chamber it had been closed by a trapdoor of stone but the door was open creeping along this shaft or passage for some ten paces we came at length to a well seven cubits in depth making fast one end of the rope that i had brought about my body and the other to a ring in the rock i was lowered holding the lamp in my hand till i stood in the last restingplace of the divine menkaura then the rope was drawn up and cleopatra being made fast to it was let down by the eunuch and i received her in my arms but i bade the eunuch sorely against his will since he feared to be left alone await our return at the mouth of the shaft for it was not lawful that he should enter whither we went    chapter xi  of the tomb of the divine menkaura of the writing on the breast of menkaura of the drawing forth of the treasure of the dweller in the tomb and of the flight of cleopatra and harmachis from the holy place  we stood within a small arched chamber paved and lined with great blocks of the granite stone of syene there before ushewn from a single mass of basalt shaped like a wooden house and resting on a sphinx with a face of goldwas the sarcophagus of the divine menkaura  we stood and gazed in awe for the weight of the silence and the solemnity of that holy place seemed to crush us above us cubit over cubit in its mighty measure the pyramid towered up to heaven and was kissed of the night air but we were deep in the bowels of the rock beneath its base we were alone with the dead whose rest we were about to break and no sound of the murmuring air and no sight of life came to dull the awful edge of solitude i gazed on the sarcophagus its heavy lid had been lifted and rested at its side and around it the dust of ages had gathered thick  see i whispered pointing to a writing daubed with pigment upon the wall in the sacred symbols of ancient times  read it harmachis answered cleopatra in the same low voice for i cannot  then i read i rameses miamen in my day and in my hour of need visited this sepulchre but though great my need and bold my heart i dared not face the curse of menkaura judge o thou who shalt come after me and if thy soul is pure and khem be utterly distressed take thou that which i have left  where then is the treasure she whispered is that sphinxface of gold  even there i answered pointing to the sarcophagus draw near and see  and she took my hand and drew near  the cover was off but the painted coffin of the pharaoh lay in the depths of the sarcophagus we climbed the sphinx then i blew the dust from the coffin with my breath and read that which was written on its lid and this was written  pharaoh menkaura the child of heaven  pharaoh menkaura royal son of the sun  pharaoh menkaura who didst lie beneath the heart of nout  nout thy mother wraps thee in the spell of her holy name  the name of thy mother nout is the mystery of heaven  nout thy mother gathers thee to the number of the gods  nout thy mother breathes on thy foes and utterly destroys them  o pharaoh menkaura who livest for ever  where then is the treasure she asked again here indeed is the body of the divine menkaura but the flesh even of pharaohs is not gold and if the face of this sphinx be gold how may we move it  for answer i bade her stand upon the sphinx and grasp the upper part of the coffin while i grasped its foot then at my word we lifted and the lid of the case which was not fixed came away and we set it upon the floor and there in the case was the mummy of pharaoh as it had been laid three thousand years before it was a large mummy and somewhat ungainly nor was it adorned with a gilded mask as is the fashion of our day for the head was wrapped in clothes yellow with age which were made fast with pink flaxen bandages under which were pushed the stems of lotusblooms and on the breast wreathed round with lotusflowers lay a large plate of gold closely written over with sacred writing i lifted up the plate and holding it to the light i read  i menkaura the osirian aforetime pharaoh of the land of khem who in my day did live justly and ever walked in the path marked for my feet by the decree of the invisible who was the beginning and is the end speak from my tomb to those who after me shall for an hour sit upon my throne behold i menkaura the osirian having in the days of my life been warned of a dream that a time will come when khem shall fear to fall into the hands of strangers and her monarch shall have great need of treasure wherewith to furnish armies to drive the barbarian back have out of my wisdom done this thing for it having pleased the protecting gods to give me wealth beyond any pharaoh who has been since the days of horusthousands of cattle and geese thousands of calves and asses thousands of measures of corn and hundreds of measures of gold and gems this wealth i have used sparingly and that which remains i have bartered for precious stoneseven for emeralds the most beautiful and largest that are in the world these stones then i have stored up against that day of the need of khem but because as there have been so there shall be those who do wickedly on the earth and who in the lust of gain might seize this wealth that i have stored and put it to their uses behold thou unborn one who in the fulness of time shalt stand above me and read this that i have caused to be written i have stored the treasure thuseven among my bones therefore o thou unborn one sleeping in the womb of nout i say this to thee if thou indeed hast need of riches to save khem from the foes of khem fear not and delay not but tear me the osirian from my tomb loose my wrappings and rip the treasure from my breast and all shall be well with thee for this only i do command that thou dost replace my bones within my hollow coffin but if the need be passing and not great or if there be guile in thy heart then the curse of menkaura be on thee on thee be the curse that shall smite him who breaks in upon the dead on thee be the curse that follows the traitor on thee be the curse that smites him who outrages the majesty of the gods unhappy shalt thou live in blood and misery shalt thou die and in misery shalt thou be tormented for ever and for ever for wicked one there in amenti we shall come face to face  and to the end of the keeping of this secret i menkaura have set up a temple of my worship which i have built upon the eastern side of this my house of death it shall be made known from time to time to the hereditary high priest of this my temple and if any high priest that shall be do reveal this secret to another than the pharaoh or her who wears the pharaohs crown and is seated upon the throne of khem accursed be he also thus have i menkaura the osirian written now to thee who sleeping in the womb of nout yet shall upon a time stand over me and read i say judge thou and if thou judgest evilly on thee shall fall this the curse of menkaura from which there is no escape greeting and farewell  thou hast heard o cleopatra i said solemnly now search thy heart judge thou and for thine own sake judge justly  she bent her head in thought  i fear to do this thing she said presently let us hence  it is well i said with a lightening of the heart and bent down to lift the wooden lid for i too feared  and yet what said the writing of the divine menkaurait was emeralds was it not and emeralds are now so rare and hard to come by ever did i love emeralds and i can never find them without a flaw  it is not a matter of what thou dost love cleopatra i said it is a matter of the need of khem and of the secret meaning of thy heart which thou alone canst know  ay surely harmachis surely and is not the need of egypt great there is no gold in the treasury and how can i defy the roman if i have no gold and have i not sworn to thee that i will wed thee and defy the roman and do i not swear it againyes even in this solemn hour with my hand upon dead pharaohs heart why here is that occasion of which the divine menkaura dreamed thou seest it is so for else hatshepsu or rameses or some other pharaoh had drawn forth the gems but no they left them to come to this hour because the time was not yet come now it must be come for if i take not the gems the roman will surely seize on egypt and then there will be no pharaoh to whom the secret may be told nay let us away with fears and to the work why dost look so frightened having pure hearts there is naught to fear harmachis  even as thou wilt i said again it is for thee to judge since if thou judgest falsely on thee will surely fall the curse from which there is no escape  so harmachis take pharaohs head and i will take hisoh what an awful place is this and suddenly she clung to me methought i saw a shadow yonder in the darkness methought that it moved toward us and then straightway vanished let us be going didst thou see naught  i saw nothing cleopatra but mayhap it was the spirit of the divine menkaura for the spirit ever hovers round its mortal tenement let us then be going i shall be right glad to go  she made as though to start then turned back again and spoke once more  it was naughtnaught but the mind that in such a house of horror bodies forth those shadowy forms of fear it dreads to see nay i must look upon these emeralds indeed if i die i must look cometo the work and stooping she with her own hands lifted from the tomb one of the four alabaster jars each sealed with the graven likeness of the heads of the protecting gods that held the holy heart and entrails of the divine menkaura but nothing was found in these jars save only what should be there  then together we mounted on the sphinx and with toil drew forth the body of the divine pharaoh laying it on the ground now cleopatra took my dagger and with it cut loose the bandages which held the wrappings in their place and the lotusflowers that had been set in them by loving hands three thousand years before fell down upon the pavement then we searched and found the end of the outer bandage which was fixed in at the hinder part of the neck this we cut loose for it was glued fast this done we began to unroll the wrappings of the holy corpse setting my shoulders against the sarcophagus i sat upon the rocky floor the body resting on my knees and as i turned it cleopatra unwound the cloths and awesome was the task presently something fell out it was the sceptre of the pharaoh fashioned of gold and at its end was a pomegranate cut from a single emerald  cleopatra seized the sceptre and gazed on it in silence then once more we went on with our dread business and ever as we unwound other ornaments of gold such as are buried with pharaohs fell from the wrappingscollars and bracelets models of sistra an inlaid axe and an image of the holy osiris and of the holy khem at length all the bandages were unwound and beneath we found a covering of coarsest linen for in those very ancient days the craftsmen were not so skilled in matters pertaining to the embalming of the body as they are now and on the linen was written in an oval menkaura royal son of the sun we could in no wise loosen this linen it held so firm on to the body therefore faint with the great heat choked with mummy dust and the odour of spices and trembling with fear of our unholy task wrought in that most lonesome and holy place we laid the body down and ripped away the last covering with the knife first we cleared pharaohs head and now the face that no man had gazed on for three thousand years was open to our view it was a great face with a bold brow yet crowned with the royal uræus beneath which the white locks stained yellow by the spices fell in long straight wisps not the cold stamp of death and not the slow flight of three thousand years had found power to mar the dignity of those shrunken features we gazed on them and then made bold with fear stripped the covering from the body there at last it lay before us stiff yellow and dread to see and on the left side above the thigh was the cut through which the embalmers had done their work but it was sewn up so deftly that we could scarcely find the mark  the gems are within i whispered for i felt that the body was very heavy now if thy heart fail thee not thou must make an entry to this poor house of clay that once was pharaoh and i gave her the daggerthe same dagger which had drunk the life of paulus  it is too late to doubt she answered lifting her white beauteous face and fixing her blue eyes all big with terror upon my own she took the dagger and with set teeth the queen of this day plunged it into the dead breast of the pharaoh of three thousand years ago and even as she did so there came a groaning sound from the opening to the shaft where we had left the eunuch we leapt to our feet but heard no more and the lamplight still streamed down through the opening  it is nothing i said let us make an end  then with much toil we hacked and rent the hard flesh open and as we did so i heard the knife point grate upon the gems within  cleopatra plunged her hand into the dead breast and drew forth somewhat she held it to the light and gave a little cry for from the darkness of pharaohs heart there flashed into light and life the most beauteous emerald that ever man beheld it was perfect in colour very large without a flaw and fashioned to a scarabæus form and on the under side was an oval inscribed with the divine name of menkaura son of the sun  again again and yet again she plunged in her hand and drew emeralds from pharaohs breast bedded there in spices some were fashioned and some were not but all were perfect in colour without a flaw and in value priceless again and again she plunged her white hand into that dread breast till at length all were found and there were one hundred and forty and eight of such gems as are not known in the world the last time that she searched she brought forth not emeralds indeed but two great pearls wrapped in linen such as never have been seen and of these pearls more hereafter  so it was done and all the mighty treasure lay glittering in a heap before us there it lay and there too lay the regalia of gold the spiced and sicklyscented wrappings and the torn body of whitehaired pharaoh menkaura the osirian the ever living in amenti  we rose and a great awe fell upon us now that the deed was done and our hearts were no more upborne by the rage of searchso great an awe indeed that we could not speak i made a sign to cleopatra she grasped the head of pharaoh and i grasped his feet and together we lifted him climbed the sphinx and placed him once more within his coffin i piled the torn mummy cloths over him and on them laid the lid of the coffin  and now we gathered up the great gems and such of the ornaments as might be carried with ease and i hid them as many as i could in the folds of my robe those that were left cleopatra hid upon her breast heavily laden with the priceless treasure we gave one last look at the solemn place at the sarcophagus and the sphinx on which it rested whose gleaming face of calm seemed to mock us with its everlasting smile of wisdom then we turned and went from the tomb  at the shaft we halted i called to the eunuch who stayed above and methought a faint mocking laugh answered me too smitten with terror to call again and fearing that should we delay cleopatra would certainly swoon i seized the rope and being strong and quick mounted by it and gained the passage there burnt the lamp but the eunuch i saw not thinking surely that he was a little way down the passage and sleptas in truth he didi bade cleopatra make the rope fast about her middle and with much labour drew her up then having rested awhile we moved with the lamps to seek for the eunuch  he was stricken with terror and has fled leaving the lamp said cleopatra o ye gods who is that seated there  i peered into the darkness thrusting out the lamps and this was what their light fell onthis at the very dream of which my soul sickens there facing us his back resting against the rock and his hands splayed on either side upon the floor sat the eunuchdead his eyes and mouth were open his fat cheeks dropped down his thin hair yet seemed to bristle and on his countenance was frozen such a stamp of hideous terror as well might turn the beholders brain and lo fixed to his chin by its hinder claws hung that grey and mighty bat which flying forth when we entered the pyramid vanished in the sky but returning had followed us to its depths there it hung upon the dead mans chin slowly rocking itself to and fro and we could see the fiery eyes shining in its head  aghast utterly aghast we stood and stared at the hateful sight till presently the bat spread his huge wings and losing his hold sailed to us now he hovered before cleopatras face fanning her with his white wings then with a scream like a womans shriek of fury the accursed thing flittered on seeking his violated tomb and vanished down the well into the sepulchre i fell against the wall but cleopatra sank in a heap upon the floor and covering her head with her arms she shrieked till the hollow passages rang with the echoes of her cries that seemed to grow and double and rush along the depths in volumes of shrill sound  rise i cried rise and let us hence before the spirit shall return to haunt us if thou dost suffer thyself to be overwhelmed in this place thou art lost for ever  she staggered to her feet and never may i forget the look upon her ashy face or in her glowing eyes seizing lamps with a rush we passed the dead eunuchs horrid form i holding her by the hand we gained the great chamber where was the sarcophagus of the queen of menkaura and traversed its length we fled along the passage what if the thing had closed the three mighty doors no they were open and we sped through them the last only did i stay to close i touched the stone as i knew how and the great door crashed down shutting us off from the presence of the dead eunuch and the horror that had hung upon the eunuchs chin now we were in the white chamber with the sculptured panels and now we faced the last steep ascent oh that last ascent twice cleopatra slipped and fell upon the polished floor the second timeit was when half the distance had been doneshe let fall her lamp and would indeed have rolled down the slide had i not saved her but in doing thus i too let fall my lamp that bounded away into shadow beneath us and we were in utter darkness and perchance about us in the darkness hovered that awful thing  be brave i cried o love be brave and struggle on or both are lost the way though steep is not far and though it be dark we can scarce come to harm in this straight shaft if the gems weight thee cast them away  nay she gasped that i will not this shall not be endured to no end i die with them  then it was that i saw the greatness of this womans heart for in the dark and notwithstanding the terrors we had passed and the awfulness of our state she clung to me and clambered on up that dread passage on we clambered hand in hand with bursting hearts till there by the mercy or the anger of the gods at length we saw the faint light of the moon creeping through the little opening in the pyramid one struggle more now the hole was gained and like a breath from heaven the sweet night air played upon our brows i climbed through and standing on a pile of stones lifted and dragged cleopatra after me she fell to the ground and then sank down upon it motionless  i pressed upon the turning stone with trembling hands it swung to and caught leaving no mark of the secret place of entry then i leapt down and having pushed away the pile of stones looked on cleopatra she had swooned and notwithstanding the dust and grime upon her face it was so pale that at first i believed she must be dead but placing my hand upon her heart i felt it stir beneath and being spent i flung myself down beside her upon the sand to gather up my strength again    chapter xii  of the coming back of harmachis of the greeting of charmion and of the answer of cleopatra to quintus dellius the ambassador of antony the triumvir  presently i lifted myself and laying the head of egypts queen upon my knee strove to call her back to life how fair she seemed even in her disarray her long hair streaming down her breast how deadly fair she seemed in the faint lightthis woman the story of whose beauty and whose sin shall outlive the solid mass of the mighty pyramid that towered over us the heaviness of her swoon had smoothed away the falseness of her face and nothing was left but the divine stamp of womans richest loveliness softened by shadows of the night and dignified by the cast of deathlike sleep i gazed upon her and all my heart went out to her it seemed that i did but love her more because of the depth of the treasons to which i had sunk to reach her and because of the terrors we had outfaced together weary and spent with fears and the pangs of guilt my heart sought hers for rest for now she alone was left to me she had sworn to wed me also and with the treasure we had won we would make egypt strong and free her from her foes and all should yet be well ah could i have seen the picture that was to come how and in what place and circumstance once again this very womans head should be laid upon my knee pale with that cast of death ah could i have seen  i chafed her hand between my hands i bent down and kissed her on the lips and at my kiss she woke she woke with a little sob of feara shiver ran along her delicate limbs and she stared upon my face with wide eyes  ah it is thou she said i mind methou hast saved me from that horrorhaunted place and she threw her arms about my neck drew me to her and kissed me come love she said let us be going i am sore athirst andah so very weary the gems too chafe my breast never was wealth so hardly won come let us be going from the shadow of this ghostly spot see the faint lights glancing from the wings of dawn how beautiful they are and how sweet to behold never in those halls of eternal night did i think to look upon the blush of dawn again ah i can still see the face of that dead slave with the horror hanging to his beardless chin bethink theethere hell sit for evertherewith the horror come where may we find water i would give an emerald for a cup of water  at the canal on the borders of the tilled land below the temple of horemkhuit is close by i answered if any see us we will say that we are pilgrims who have lost our way at night among the tombs veil thyself closely therefore cleopatra and beware lest thou dost show aught of those gems about thee  so she veiled herself and i lifted her on to the ass which was tethered near at hand we walked slowly through the plain till we came to the place where the symbol of the god horemkhu fashioned as a mighty sphinx whom the greeks call harmachis and crowned with the royal crown of egypt looks out in majesty across the land his eyes ever fixed upon the east as we walked the first arrow of the rising sun quivered through the grey air striking upon horemkhus lips of holy calm and the dawn kissed her greeting to the god of dawn then the light gathered and grew upon the gleaming sides of twenty pyramids and like a promise from life to death rested on the portals of ten thousand tombs it poured in a flood of gold across the desert sandit pierced the heavy sky of night and fell in bright beams upon the green of fields and the tufted crest of palms then from his horizon bed royal ra rose up in pomp and it was day        that is horus on the horizon and signifies the power      of light and good overcoming the power of darkness and evil      incarnate in his enemy typhoneditor  passing the temple of granite and of alabaster that was built before the days of khufu to the glory of the majesty of horemkhu we descended the slope and came to the banks of the canal there we drank and that draught of muddy water was sweeter than all the choicest wine of alexandria also we washed the mummy dust and grime from our hands and brows and made us clean as she bathed her neck stooping over the water one of the great emeralds slipped from cleopatras breast and fell into the canal and it was but by chance that at length i found it in the mire then once more i lifted cleopatra onto the beast and slowly for i was very weary we marched back to the banks of sihor where our craft was and having at length come thither seeing no one save some few peasants going out to labour on the lands i turned the ass loose in that same field where we had found him and we boarded the craft while the crew were yet sleeping then waking them we bade them make all sail saying that we had left the eunuch to sojourn a while behind us as in truth we had so we sailed having first hidden away the gems and such of the ornaments of gold as we could bring to the boat  we spent four days and more in coming to alexandria for the wind was for the most part against us and they were happy days at first indeed cleopatra was somewhat silent and heavy at heart for what she had seen and felt in the womb of the pyramid weighed her down but soon her imperial spirit awoke and shook the burden from her breast and she became herself againnow gay now learned now loving and now cold now queenly and now altogether simpleever changing as the winds of heaven and as the heaven deep beauteous and unsearchable  night after night for those four perfect nights the last happy hours i ever was to know we sat hand in hand upon the deck and heard the waters lap the vessels side and watched the soft footfall of the moon as she trod the depths of nile there we sat and talked of love talked of our marriage and all that we would do also i drew up plans of war and of defence against the roman which now we had the means to carry out and she approved them sweetly saying that what seemed good to me was good to her and so the time passed all too swiftly  oh those nights upon the nile their memory haunts me yet yet in my dreams i see the moonbeams break and quiver and hear cleopatras murmured words of love mingle with the sound of murmuring waters dead are those dear nights dead is the moon that lit them the waters which rocked us on their breast are lost in the wide salt sea and where we kissed and clung there lips unborn shall kiss and cling how beautiful was their promise doomed like an unfruitful blossom to wither fall and rot and their fulfilment ah how drear for all things end in darkness and in ashes and those who sow in folly shall reap in sorrow ah those nights upon the nile  and so at length once more we stood within the hateful walls of that fair palace on the lochias and the dream was done    whither hast thou wandered with cleopatra harmachis charmion asked of me when i met her by chance on that day of return on some new mission of betrayal or was it but a lovejourney  i went with cleopatra upon secret business of the state i answered sternly  so those who go secretly go evilly and foul birds love to fly at night not but what thou art wise for it would scarce beseem thee harmachis to show thy face openly in egypt  i heard and felt my passion rise within me for i could ill bear this fair girls scorn  hast thou never a word without a sting i asked know then that i went whither thou hadst not dared to go to gather means to hold egypt from the grasp of antony  so she answered looking up swiftly thou foolish man thou hadst done better to save thy labour for antony will grasp egypt in thy despite what power hast thou today in egypt  that he may do in my despite but in despite of cleopatra that he cannot do i said  nay but with the aid of cleopatra he can and will do it she answered with a bitter smile when the queen sails in state up cydnus stream she will surely draw this coarse antony thence to alexandria conquering and yet like thee a slave  it is false i say that it is false cleopatra goes not to tarsus and antony comes not to alexandria or if he come it will be to take the chance of war  now thinkest thou thus she answered with a little laugh well if it please thee think as thou wilt within three days thou shalt know it is pretty to see how easily thou art fooled farewell go dream on love for surely love is sweet  and she went leaving me angered and troubled at heart    i saw cleopatra no more that day but on the day which followed i saw her she was in a heavy mood and had no gentle word for me i spake to her of the defence of egypt but she put the matter away  why dost thou weary me she said with anger canst thou not see that i am lost in troubles when dellius has had his answer tomorrow then we will speak of these matters  ay i said when dellius has had his answer and knowest thou that but yesterday charmionwhom about the palace they name the keeper of the queens secretscharmion swore that the answer would be go in peace i come to antony  charmion knows nothing of my heart said cleopatra stamping her foot in anger and if she talk so freely the girl shall be scourged out of my court as is her desert though in truth she added she has more wisdom in that small head of hers than all my privy councillorsay and more wit to use it knowest thou that i have sold a portion of those gems to the rich jews of alexandria and at a great price ay at five thousand sestertia for each one but a few in truth for they could not buy more as yet it was rare to see their eyes when they fell upon them they grew large as apples with avarice and wonder and now leave me harmachis for i am weary the memory of that dreadful night is with me yet        about forty thousand pounds of our moneyeditor  i bowed and rose to go and yet stood wavering  pardon me cleopatra it is of our marriage  our marriage why are we not indeed already wed she answered  yes but not before the world thou didst promise  ay harmachis i promised and tomorrow when i have rid me of this dellius i will keep my promise and name thee cleopatras lord before the court see that thou art in thy place art content  and she stretched out her hand for me to kiss looking on me with strange eyes as though she struggled with herself then i went but that night i strove once more to see cleopatra and could not the lady charmion was with the queen so said the eunuchs and none might enter    on the morrow the court met in the great hall one hour before midday and i went thither with a trembling heart to hear cleopatras answer to dellius and to hear myself also named kingconsort to the queen of egypt it was a full and splendid court there were councillors lords captains eunuchs and waitingwomen all save charmion the house passed but cleopatra and charmion came not at length charmion entered gently by a side entrance and took her place among the waitingladies about the throne even as she did so she cast a glance at me and there was triumph in her eyes though i knew not over what she triumphed i little guessed that she had but now brought about my ruin and sealed the fate of egypt  then presently the trumpets blared and clad in her robes of state the uræus crown upon her head and on her breast flashing like a star that great emerald scarabæus which she had dragged from dead pharaohs heart cleopatra swept in splendour to her throne followed by a glittering guard of northmen her lovely face was dark dark were her slumbrous eyes and none might read their message though all that court searched them for a sign of what should come she seated herself slowly as one who may not be moved and spoke to the chief of the heralds in the greek tongue  does the ambassador of the noble antony wait  the herald bowed low and made assent  let him come in and hear our answer  the doors were flung wide and followed by his train of knights dellius clad in his golden armour and his purple mantle walked with catlike step up the great hall and made obeisance before the throne  most royal and beauteous egypt he said in his soft voice as thou hast graciously been pleased to bid me thy servant i am here to take thy answer to the letter of the noble antony the triumvir whom tomorrow i sail to meet at tarsus in cilicia and i will say this royal egypt craving pardon the while for the boldness of my speechbethink thee well before words that cannot be unspoken fall from those sweet lips defy antony and antony will wreck thee but like thy mother aphrodité rise glorious on his sight from the bosom of the cyprian wave and for wreck he will give thee all that can be dear to womans royaltyempire and pomp of place cities and the sway of men fame and wealth and the diadem of rule made sure for mark antony holds this eastern world in the hollow of his warlike hand at his will kings are and at his frown they cease to be  and he bowed his head and folding his hands meekly on his breast awaited answer  for a while cleopatra answered not but sat like the sphinx horemkhu dumb and inscrutable gazing with lost eyes down the length of that great hall  then like soft music her answer came and trembling i listened for egypts challenge to the roman  noble delliuswe have bethought us much of the matter of thy message from great antony to our poor royalty of egypt we have bethought us much and we have taken counsel from the oracles of the gods from the wisest among our friends and from the teachings of our heart that ever like a nesting bird broods over our peoples weal sharp are the words that thou has brought across the sea methinks they had been better fitted to the ears of some petty halftamed prince than to those of egypts queen therefore we have numbered the legions that we can gather and the triremes and the galleys wherewith we may breast the sea and the moneys which shall buy us all things wanting to our war and we find this that though antony be strong yet has egypt naught to fear from the strength of antony  she paused and a murmur of applause of her high words ran down the hall only dellius stretched out his hand as though to push them back then came the end  noble delliushalf are we minded there to bid our tongue stop and strong in our fortresses of stone and our other fortresses built of the hearts of men abide the issue and yet thou shalt not go thus we are guiltless of those charges against us that have come to the ears of noble antony and which now he rudely shouts in ours nor will we journey into cilicia to answer them  here the murmur arose anew while my heart beat high in triumph and in the pause that followed dellius spoke once more  then royal egypt my word to antony is word of war  nay she answered it shall be one of peace listen we said that we would not come to make answer to these charges nor will we butand she smiled for the first timewe will gladly come and that swiftly in royal friendship to make known our fellowship of peace upon the banks of cydnus  i heard and was bewildered could i hear aright was it thus that cleopatra kept her oaths moved beyond the hold of reason i lifted up my voice and cried  o queen remember  she turned upon me like a lioness with a flashing of the eyes and a swift shake of her lovely head  peace slave she said who bade thee break in upon our counsels mind thou thy stars and leave matters of the world to the rulers of the world  i sank back shamed and as i did so once more i saw the smile of triumph on the face of charmion followed by what was perhaps the shadow of pity for my fall  now that yon brawling charlatan said dellius pointing at me with his jewelled finger has been rebuked grant me leave o egypt to thank thee from my heart for these gentle words  we ask no thanks from thee noble dellius nor lies it in thy mouth to chide our servant broke in cleopatra frowning heavily we will take thanks from the lips of antony alone get thee to thy master and say to him that before he can make ready a fitting welcome our keels shall follow in the track of thine and now farewell thou shalt find some small token of our bounty upon thy vessel  dellius bowed thrice and withdrew while the court stood waiting the queens word and i too waited wondering if she would yet make good her promise and name me royal spouse there in the face of egypt but she said nothing only still frowning heavily she rose and followed by her guards left the throne and passed into the alabaster hall then the court broke up and as the lords and councillors went by they looked on me with mockery for though none knew all my secret nor how it stood between me and cleopatra yet they were jealous of the favour shown me by the queen and rejoiced greatly at my fall but i took no heed of their mocking as i stood dazed with misery and felt the world of hope slip from beneath my feet    chapter xiii  of the reproach of harmachis of the struggle of harmachis with the guards of the blow of brennus and of the secret speech of cleopatra  and at length all being gone i too turned to go when a eunuch struck me on the shoulder and roughly bade me wait on the presence of the queen an hour past this fellow would have crawled to me on his knees but he had heard and now he treated meso brutish is the nature of such slavesas the world treats the fallen with scorn for to come low after being great is to learn all shame unhappy therefore are the great for they may fall  i turned upon the slave with so fierce a word that curlike he sprang behind me then i passed on to the alabaster hall and was admitted by the guards in the centre of the hall near the fountain sat cleopatra and with her were charmion and the greek girl iras and merira and other of her waitingladies go she said to these i would speak with my astrologer so they went and left us face to face  stand thou there she said lifting her eyes for the first time come not nigh me harmachis i trust thee not perchance thou hast found another dagger now what hast thou to say by what right didst thou dare to break in upon my talk with the roman  i felt the blood rush through me like a storm bitterness and burning anger took hold of my heart what hast thou to say cleopatra i answered boldly where is thy vow sworn on the dead heart of menkaura the everliving where now thy challenge to this roman antony where thy oath that thou wouldest call me husband in the face of egypt and i choked and ceased  well doth it become harmachis who never was forsworn to speak to me of oaths she said in bitter mockery and yet o thou most pure priest of isis and yet o thou most faithful friend who never didst betray thy friends and yet o thou most steadfast honourable and upright man who never bartered thy birthright thy country and thy cause for the price of a womans passing loveby what token knowest thou that my word is void  i will not answer thy taunts cleopatra i said holding back my heart as best i might for i have earned them all though not from thee by this token then i know it thou goest to visit antony thou goest as said that roman knave tricked in thy best attire to feast with him whom thou shouldst give to vultures for their feast perhaps for aught i know thou art about to squander those treasures that thou hast filched from the body of menkaura those treasures stored against the need of egypt upon wanton revels which shall complete the shame of egypt by these things then i know that thou art forsworn and i who loving thee believed thee tricked and by this also that thou who didst but yesternight swear to wed me dost today cover me with taunts and even before that roman put me to an open shame  to wed thee and i did swear to wed thee well and what is marriage is it the union of the heart that bond beautiful as gossamer and than gossamer more light which binds soul to soul as they float through the dreamy night of passion a bond to be perchance melted in the dews of dawn or is it the iron link of enforced unchanging union whereby if sinks the one the other must be dragged beneath the sea of circumstance there like a punished slave to perish of unavoidable corruption marriage i to marry i to forget freedom and court the worst slavery of our sex which by the selfish will of man the stronger still binds us to a bed grown hateful and enforces a service that love mayhap no longer hallows of what use then to be a queen if thereby i may not escape the evil of the meanly born mark thou harmachis woman being grown hath two ills to feardeath and marriage and of these twain is marriage the more vile for in death we may find rest but in marriage should it fail us we must find hell nay being above the breath of common slander that enviously would blast those who of true virtue will not consent to stretch affections links i love harmachis but i marry not        referring to the roman custom of chaining a living felon      to the body of one already deadeditor  and yesternight cleopatra thou didst swear that thou wouldst wed me and call me to thy side before the face of egypt  and yesternight harmachis the red ring round the moon marked the coming of the storm and yet the day is fair but who knows that the tempest may not break tomorrow who knows that i have not chosen the easier path to save egypt from the roman who knows harmachis that thou shalt not still call me wife  then i no longer could bear her falsehood for i saw that she but played with me and so i spoke that which was in my heart  cleopatra i cried thou didst swear to protect egypt and thou art about to betray egypt to the roman thou didst swear to use the treasures that i revealed to thee for the service of egypt and thou art about to use them to be her means of shameto fashion them as fetters for her wrists thou didst swear to wed me who loved thee and for thee gave all and thou dost mock me and reject me therefore i saywith the voice of the dread gods i say itthat on thee shall fall the curse of menkaura whom thou hast robbed indeed let me go hence and work out my fate let me go o thou fair shame thou living lie whom i have loved to my doom and who hast brought upon me the last curse of doom let me hide myself and see thy face no more  she rose in her wrath and she was terrible to see  let thee go to stir up evil against me nay harmachis thou shalt not go to build new plots against my throne i say to thee that thou too shalt come to visit antony in cilicia and there perchance i will let thee go and ere i could answer she had struck upon the silver gong that hung near her  before its rich echo had died away charmion and the waitingwomen entered from one door and from the other a file of soldiersfour of them of the queens bodyguard mighty men with winged helmets and long fair hair  seize that traitor cried cleopatra pointing to me the captain of the guardit was brennussaluted and came towards me with drawn sword  but i being mad and desperate and caring little if they slew me flew straight at his throat and dealt him such a heavy blow that the great man fell headlong and his armour clashed upon the marble floor as he fell i seized his sword and targe and meeting the next who rushed on me with a shout caught his blow upon the shield and in answer smote with all my strength the sword fell where the neck is set into the shoulder and shearing through the joints of his harness slew him so that his knees were loosened and he sank down dead and the third as he came i caught upon the point of my sword before he could strike and it pierced him and he died then the last rushed on me with a cry of taranis and i too rushed on him for my blood was aflame now the women shriekedonly cleopatra said nothing but stood and watched the unequal fray we met and i struck with all my strength and it was a mighty blow for the sword shore through the iron shell and shattered there leaving me weaponless with a shout of triumph the guard swung up his sword and smote down upon my head but i caught the blow with my shield again he smote and again i parried but when he raised his sword a third time i saw this might not endure so with a cry i hurled my buckler at his face glancing from his shield it struck him on the breast and staggered him then before he could gain his balance i rushed in beneath his guard and gripped him round the middle  for a full minute the tall man and i struggled furiously and then so great was my strength in those days i lifted him like a toy and dashed him down upon the marble floor in such fashion that his bones were shattered so that he spoke no more but i could not save myself and fell upon him and as i fell the captain brennus whom i had smitten to earth with my fist having once more found his sense came up behind me and smote me upon the head and shoulders with the sword of one of those whom i had slain but i being on the ground the blow did not fall with all its weight also my thick hair and broidered cap broke its force and thus it came to pass that though sorely wounded the life was yet whole in me but i could struggle no more  then the cowardly eunuchs who had gathered at the sound of blows and stood huddled together like a herd of cattle seeing that i was spent threw themselves upon me and would have butchered me with their knives but brennus now that i was down would strike no more but stood waiting and the eunuchs had surely slain me for cleopatra watched like one who watches in a dream and made no sign already my head was dragged back and their knifepoints were at my throat when charmion rushing forward threw herself upon me and calling them dogs desperately thrust her body before them in such fashion that they could not smite now brennus with an oath seized first one and then another and cast them from me  spare his life queen he cried in his barbarous latin by jupiter he is a brave man myself felled like an ox in the shambles and three of my boys finished by a man without armour and taken unawares i grudge them not to such a man a boon queen spare his life and give him to me  ay spare him spare him cried charmion white and trembling  cleopatra drew near and looked upon the dead and him who lay dying as i had dashed him to the ground and on me her lover of two days gone whose wounded head rested now on charmions white robes  i met the queens glance spare not i gasped væ victis then a flush gathered on her browmethinks it was a flush of shame  dost after all love this man at heart charmion she said with a little laugh that thou didst thrust thy tender body between him and the knives of these sexless hounds and she cast a look of scorn upon the eunuchs  nay the girl answered fiercely but i cannot stand by to see a brave man murdered by such as these  ay said cleopatra he is a brave man and he fought gallantly i have never seen so fierce a fight even in the games at rome well i spare his life though he is weak of mewomanish weak take him to his own chamber and guard him there till he is healed ordead  then my brain reeled a great sickness seized upon me and i sank into the nothingness of a swoon    dreams dreams dreams without end and everchanging as for years and years i seemed to toss upon a sea of agony and through them a vision of a darkeyed womans tender face and the touch of a white hand soothing me to rest visions too of a royal countenance bending at times over my rocking beda countenance that i could not grasp but whose beauty flowed through my fevered veins and was a part of mevisions of childhood and of the temple towers of abouthis and of the whitehaired amenemhat my fatheray and an everpresent vision of that dread hall in amenti and of the small altar and the spirits clad in flame there i seemed to wander everlastingly calling on the holy mother whose memory i could not grasp calling ever and in vain for no cloud descended upon the altar only from time to time the great voice pealed aloud strike out the name of harmachis child of earth from the living book of her who was and is and shall be lost lost lost  and then another voice would answer  not yet not yet repentance is at hand strike not out the name of harmachis child of earth from the living book of her who was and is and shall be by suffering may sin be wiped away  i woke to find myself in my own chamber in the tower of the palace i was so weak that i scarce could lift my hand and life seemed but to flutter in my breast as flutters a dying dove i could not turn my head i could not stir yet in my heart there was a sense of rest and of dark trouble done the light from the lamp hurt my eyes i shut them and as i shut them heard the sweep of a womans robes upon the stair and a swift light step that i knew well it was that of cleopatra  she entered and drew near i felt her come every pulse of my poor frame beat an answer to her footfall and all my mighty love and hate rose from the darkness of my deathlike sleep and rent me in their struggle she leaned over me her ambrosial breath played upon my face i could hear the beating of her heart lower she leaned till at last her lips touched me softly on the brow  poor man i heard her murmur poor weak dying man fate hath been hard to thee thou wert too good to be the sport of such a one as ithe pawn that i must move in my play of policy ah harmachis thou shouldst have ruled the game those plotting priests could give thee learning but they could not give thee knowledge of mankind nor fence thee against the march of natures law and thou didst love me with all thy heartah well i know it manlike thou didst love the eyes that as a pirates lights beckoned thee to shipwrecked ruin and didst hang doting on the lips which lied thy heart away and called thee slave well the game was fair for thou wouldst have slain me and yet i grieve so thou dost die and this is my farewell to thee never may we meet again on earth and perchance it is well for who knows when my hour of tenderness is past how i might deal with thee didst thou live thou dost die they saythose learned longfaced fools who if they let thee die shall pay the price and where then shall we meet again when my last throw is thrown we shall be equal there in the kingdom that osiris rules a little time a few yearsperhaps tomorrowand we shall meet then knowing all i am how wilt thou greet me nay here as there still must thou worship me for injuries cannot touch the immortality of such a love as thine contempt alone like acid can eat away the love of noble hearts and reveal the truth in its pitiful nakedness thou must still cling to thee harmachis for whatever my sins yet i am great and set above thy scorn would that i could have loved thee as thou lovest me almost i did so when thou slewest those guards and yetnot quite  what a fenced city is my heart that none can take it and even when i throw the gates wide no man may win its citadel oh to put away this loneliness and lose me in anothers soul oh for a year a month an hour to quite forget policy peoples and my pomp of place and be but a loving woman harmachis fare thee well go join great julius whom thy art called up from death before me and take egypts greetings to him ah well i fooled thee and i fooled cæsarperchance before all is done fate will find me and myself i shall be fooled harmachis fare thee well  she turned to go and as she turned i heard the sweep of another dress and the light fall of another womans foot  ah it is thou charmion well for all thy watching the man dies  ay she answered in a voice thick with grief ay o queen so the physicians say forty hours has he lain in stupor so deep that at times his breath could barely lift this tiny feathers weight and hardly could my ear placed against his breast take notice of the rising of his heart i have watched him now for ten long days watched him day and night till my eyes stare wide with want of sleep and for faintness i can scarce keep myself from falling and this is the end of all my labour the coward blow of that accursed brennus has done its work and harmachis dies  love counts not its labour charmion nor can it weight its tenderness on the scale of purchase that which it has it gives and craves for more to give and give till the souls infinity be drained dear to thy heart are these heavy nights of watching sweet to thy weary eyes is that sad sight of strength brought so low that it hangs upon thy weakness like a babe to its mothers breast for charmion thou dost love this man who loves thee not and now that he is helpless thou canst pour thy passion forth over the unanswering darkness of his soul and cheat thyself with dreams of what yet might be  i love him not as thou hast proof o queen how can i love one who would have slain thee who art as my hearts sister it is for pity that i nurse him  she laughed a little as she answered pity is loves own twin charmion wondrous wayward are the paths of womans love and thou hast shown thine strangely that i know but the more high the love the deeper the gulf whereinto it can fallay and thence soar again to heaven once more to fall poor woman thou art thy passions plaything now tender as the morning sky and now when jealousy grips thy heart more cruel than the sea well thus are we made soon after all this troubling nothing will be left thee but tears remorse andmemory  and she went forth    chapter xiv  of the tender care of charmion of the healing of harmachis of the sailing of the fleet of cleopatra for cilicia and of the speech of brennus to harmachis  cleopatra went and for a while i lay silent gathering up my strength to speak but charmion came and stood over me and i felt a great tear fall from her dark eyes upon my face as the first heavy drop of rain falls from a thunder cloud  thou goest she whispered thou goest fast whither i may not follow o harmachis how gladly would i give my life for thine  then at length i opened my eyes and spoke as best i could  restrain thy grief dear friend i said i live yet and in truth i feel as though new life gathered in my breast  she gave a little cry of joy and i never saw aught more beautiful than the change that came upon her weeping face it was as when the first lights of the day run up the pallor of that sad sky which veils the night from dawn all rosy grew her lovely countenance her dim eyes shone out like stars and a smile of wonderment more sweet than the sudden smile of the sea as its ripples wake to brightness beneath the kiss of the risen moon broke through her rain of tears  thou livest she cried throwing herself on her knees beside my couch thou livestand i thought thee gone thou art come back to me oh what say i how foolish is a womans heart tis this long watching nay sleep and rest thee harmachiswhy dost thou talk not one more word i command thee straitly where is the draught left by that longbearded fool nay thou shalt have no draught there sleep harmachis sleep and she crouched down at my side and laid her cool hand upon my brow murmuring sleep sleep  and when i woke there she was still but the lights of dawn were peeping through the casement there she knelt one hand upon my forehead and her head in all its disarray of curls resting upon her outstretched arm  charmion i whispered have i slept  instantly she was wide awake and gazing on me with tender eyes yea thou hast slept harmachis  how long then have i slept  nine hours  and thou hast held thy place there at my side for nine long hours  yes it is nothing i also have slepti feared to waken thee if i stirred  go rest i said it shames me to think of this thing go rest thee charmion  vex not thyself she answered see i will bid a slave watch thee and to wake me if thou needest aught i sleep there in the outer chamber peacei go and she strove to rise but so cramped was she fell straightway on the floor  i can scarcely tell the sense of shame that filled me when i saw her fall alas i could not stir to help her  it is naught she said move not i did but catch my foot there and she rose again to falla pest upon my awkwardness whyi must be sleeping tis well now ill send the slave and she staggered thence like one overcome with wine  and after that i slept once more for i was very weak when i woke it was afternoon and i craved for food which charmion brought me  i ate then i die not i said  nay she answered with a toss of her head thou wilt live in truth i did waste my pity on thee  and thy pity saved my life i said wearily for now i remembered  it is nothing she answered carelessly after all thou art my cousin also i love nursingit is a womans trade like enough i had done as much for any slave now too that the danger is past i leave thee  thou hadst done better to let me die charmion i said after a while for life to me can now be only one long shame tell me then when sails cleopatra for cilicia  she sails in twenty days and with such pomp and glory as egypt has never seen of a truth i cannot guess where she has found the means to gather in this store of splendour as a husbandman gathers his golden harvest  but i knowing whence the wealth came groaned in bitterness of spirit and made no answer  goest thou also charmion i asked presently  ay i and all the court thou toothou goest  i go nay why is this  because thou art cleopatras slave and must march in gilded chains behind her chariot because she fears to leave thee here in khem because it is her will and there is an end  charmion can i not escape  escape thou poor sick man nay how canst thou escape even now thou art most strictly guarded and if thou didst escape whither wouldst thou fly theres not an honest man in egypt but would spit on thee in scorn  once more i groaned in spirit and being so very weak i felt the tears roll adown my cheek  weep not she said hastily and turning her face aside be a man and brave these troubles out thou hast sown now must thou reap but after harvest the waters rise and wash away the rotting roots and then seedtime comes again perchance yonder in cilicia a way may be found when once more thou art strong by which thou mayst flyif in truth thou canst bear thy life apart from cleopatras smile then in some far land must thou dwell till these things are forgotten and now my task is done so fare thee well at times i will come to visit thee and see that thou needest nothing  so she went and i was nursed thenceforward and that skilfully by the physician and two womenslaves and as my wound healed so my strength came back to me slowly at first then most swiftly in four days from that time i left my couch and in three more i could walk an hour in the palace gardens another week and i could read and think though i went no more to court and at length one afternoon charmion came and bade me make ready for the fleet would sail in two days first for the coast of syria and thence to the gulf of issus and cilicia  thereon with all formality and in writing i craved leave of cleopatra that i might be left urging that my health was so feeble that i could not travel but a message was sent to me in answer that i must come  and so on the appointed day i was carried in a litter down to the boat and together with that very soldier who had cut me down the captain brennus and others of his troop who indeed were sent to guard me we rowed aboard a vessel where she lay at anchor with the rest of the great fleet for cleopatra was voyaging as though to war in much pomp and escorted by a fleet of ships among which her galley built like a house and lined throughout with cedar and silken hangings was the most beautiful and costly that the world has ever seen but i went not on this vessel and therefore it chanced that i did not see cleopatra or charmion till we landed at the mouth of the river cydnus  the signal being made the fleet set sail and the wind being fair we came to joppa on the evening of the second day thence we sailed slowly with contrary winds up the coast of syria making cæsarea and ptolemais and tyrus and berytus and past lebanons white brow crowned with his crest of cedars on to heraclea and across the gulf of issus to the mouth of cydnus and ever as we journeyed the strong breath of the sea brought back my health till at length save for a line of white upon my head where the sword had fallen i was almost as i had been and one night as we drew near cydnus while brennus and i sat alone together on the deck his eye fell upon the white mark his sword had made and he swore a great oath by his heathen gods an thou hadst died lad he said methinks i could never again have held up my head ah that was a coward stroke and i am shamed to think that it was i who struck it and thou on the ground with thy back to me knowest thou that when thou didst lie between life and death i came every day to ask tidings of thee and i swore by taranis that if thou didst die id turn my back upon that soft palace life and then away for the bonny north  nay trouble not brennus i answered it was thy duty  mayhap but there are duties that a brave man should not donay not at the bidding of any queen who ever ruled in egypt thy blow had dazed me or i had not struck what is it ladart in trouble with this queen of ours why art thou dragged a prisoner upon this pleasure party knowest thou that we are strictly charged that if thou dost escape our lives shall pay the price  ay in sore trouble friend i answered ask me no more  then being of the age thou art theres a woman in itthat i swearand perchance though i am rough and foolish i might make a guess look thou lad what sayest thou i am weary of this service of cleopatra and this hot land of deserts and of luxury that sap a mans strength and drain his pocket and so are others whom i know of what sayest thou lets take one of these unwieldy vessels and away to the north ill lead thee to a better land than egypta land of lake and mountain and great forests of sweetscented pine ay and find thee a girl fit to mate withmy own niecea girl strong and tall with wide blue eyes and long fair hair and arms that could crack thy ribs were she of a mind to hug thee come what sayest thou put away the past and away for the bonny north and be a son to me  for a moment i thought and then sadly shook my head for though i was sorely tempted to be gone i knew that my fate lay in egypt and i might not fly my fate  it may not be brennus i answered fain would i that it might be but i am bound by a chain of destiny which i cannot break and in the land of egypt i must live and die  as thou wilt lad said the old warrior i should have dearly loved to marry thee among my people and make a son of thee at the least remember that while i am here thou hast brennus for a friend and one thing more beware of that beauteous queen of thine for by taranis perhaps an hour may come when she will hold that thou knowest too much and then and he drew his hand across his throat and now good night a cup of wine then to sleep for tomorrow the foolery  here several lengths of the second roll of papyrus are so broken as to be undecipherable they seem to have been descriptive of cleopatras voyage up the cydnus to the city of tarsus  andthe writing continuesto those who could take joy in such things the sight must indeed have been a gallant one for the stern of our galley was covered with sheets of beaten gold the sails were of the scarlet of tyre and the oars of silver touched the water to a measure of music and there in the centre of the vessel beneath an awning ablaze with gold embroidery lay cleopatra attired as the roman venus and surely venus was not more fair in thin robes of whitest silk bound in beneath her breast with a golden girdle delicately graven over with scenes of love all about her were little rosy boys chosen for their beauty and clad in naught save downy wings strapped upon their shoulders and on their backs cupids bow and quiver who fanned her with fans of plumes upon the vessels decks handling the cordage that was of silken web and softly singing to the sound of harps and the beat of oars were no rough sailors but women lovely to behold some robed as graces and some as nereidsthat is scarce robed at all except in their scented hair and behind the couch with drawn sword stood brennus in splendid armour and winged helm of gold and by him othersi among themin garments richly worked and knew that i was indeed a slave on the high poop also burned censers filled with costliest incense of which the fragrant steam hung in little clouds about our wake  thus as in a dream of luxury followed by many ships we glided on towards the wooded slopes of taurus at whose foot lay that ancient city tarshish and ever as we came the people gathered on the banks and ran before us shouting venus is risen from the sea venus hath come to visit bacchus we drew near to the city and all its peopleeveryone who could walk or be carriedcrowded down in thousands to the docks and with them came the whole army of antony so that at length the triumvir was left alone upon the judgment seat  dellius the falsetongued came also fawning and bowing and in the name of antony gave the queen of beauty greeting bidding her to a feast that antony had made ready but she made high answer and said forsooth it is antony who should wait on us not we on antony bid the noble antony to our poor table this nightelse we dine alone  dellius went bowing to the ground the feast was made ready and then at last i set eyes on antony he came clad in purple robes a great man and beautiful to see set in the stout prime of life with bright eyes of blue and curling hair and features cut sharply as a grecian gem for he was great of form and royal of mien and with an open countenance on which his thoughts were so clearly written that all might read them only the weakness of the mouth belied the power of the brow he came attended by his generals and when he reached the couch where cleopatra lay he stood astonished gazing on her with wideopened eyes she too gazed on him earnestly i saw the red blood run up beneath her skin and a great pang of jealousy seized upon my heart and charmion who saw all beneath her downcast eyes saw this also and smiled but cleopatra spoke no word only she stretched out her white hand for him to kiss and he saying no word took her hand and kissed it  behold noble antony she said at last in her voice of music thou hast called me and i am come  venus has come he answered in his deep notes and still holding his eyes fixed upon her face i called a womana goddess hath risen from the deep  to find a god to greet her on the land she laughed with ready wit well a truce to compliments for being on the earth even venus is ahungered noble antony thy hand  the trumpets blared and through the bowing crowd cleopatra followed by her train passed hand in hand with antony to the feast  here there is another break in the papyrus    chapter xv  of the feast of cleopatra of the melting of the pearl of the saying of harmachis and of cleopatras vow of love  on the third night the feast was once more prepared in the hall of the great house that had been set aside to the use of cleopatra and on this night its splendour was greater even than on the nights before for the twelve couches that were set about the table were embossed with gold and those of cleopatra and antony were of gold set with jewels the dishes also were all of gold set with jewels the walls were hung with purple cloths sewn with gold and on the floor covered with a net of gold fresh roses were strewn ankledeep that as the slaves trod them sent up their perfume once again i was bidden to stand with charmion and iras and merira behind the couch of cleopatra and like a slave from time to time call out the hours as they flew and there being no help i went wild at heart but this i sworeit should be for the last time since i could not bear that shame for though i would not yet believe what charmion told methat cleopatra was about to become the love of antonyyet i could no more endure this ignominy and torture for from cleopatra now i had no words save such as a queen speaks to her slave and methinks it gave her dark heart pleasure to torment me  thus it came to pass that i the pharaoh crowned of khem stood among eunuchs and waitingwomen behind the couch of egypts queen while the feast went merrily and the winecup passed and ever antony sat his eyes fixed upon the face of cleopatra who from time to time let her deep glance lose itself in his and then for a little while their talk died away for he told her tales of war and of deeds that he had doneay and lovejests such as are not meet for the ears of women but she took offence at nothing rather falling into his humour she would cap his stories with others of a finer wit but not less shameless  at length the rich meal being finished antony gazed at the splendour around him  tell me then most lovely egypt he said are the sands of nile compact of gold that thou canst night by night thus squander the ransom of a king upon a single feast whence comes this untold wealth  i bethought me of the tomb of the divine menkaura whose holy treasure was thus wickedly wasted and looked up so that cleopatras eye caught mine but reading my thoughts she frowned heavily  why noble antony she said surely it is nothing in egypt we have our secrets and know whence to conjure riches at our need say what is the value of this golden service and of the meats and drinks that have been set before us  he cast his eyes about and hazarded a guess  maybe a thousand sestertia        about eight thousand pounds of english moneyeditor  thou hast understated it by half noble antony but such as it is i will give it thee and those with thee as a free token of my friendship and more will i show thee now i myself will eat and drink ten thousand sestertia at a draught  that cannot be fair egypt  she laughed and bade a slave bring her white vinegar in a glass when it was brought she set it before her and laughed again while antony rising from his couch drew near and set himself at her side and all the company leant forward to see what she would do and this she did she took from her ear one of those great pearls which last of all had been drawn from the body of the divine pharaoh and before any could guess her purpose she let it fall into the vinegar then came silence the silence of wonder and slowly the priceless pearl melted in the strong acid when it was melted she lifted the glass and shook it then drank the vinegar to the last drop  more vinegar slave she cried my meal is but half finished and she drew forth the second pearl  by bacchus no that shalt thou not cried antony snatching at her hands i have seen enough and at that moment moved to it by i know not what i called aloud  the hour falls o queenthe hour of the coming of the curse of menkaura  an ashy whiteness grew upon cleopatras face and she turned upon me furiously while all the company gazed wondering not knowing what the words might mean  thou illomened slave she cried speak thus once more and thou shalt be scourged with rodsay scourged like an evildoerthat i promise thee harmachis  what means the knave of an astrologer asked antony speak sirrah and make clear thy meaning for those who deal in curses must warrant their wares  i am a servant of the gods noble antony that which the gods put in my mind that must i say nor can i read their meaning i answered humbly  oh oh thou servest the gods dost thou thou manycoloured mystery this he said having reference to my splendid robes well i serve the goddesses which is a softer cult and theres this between us that though what they put in my mind i say neither can i read their meaning and he glanced at cleopatra as one who questions  let the knave be she said impatiently tomorrow well be rid of him sirrah begone  i bowed and went and as i went i heard antony say well he may be a knavefor that all men arebut this for thy astrologer he hath a royal air and the eye of a kingay and wit in it  without the door i paused not knowing what to do for i was bewildered with misery and as i stood someone touched me on the hand i glanced upit was charmion who in the confusion of the rising of the guests had slipped away and followed me  for in trouble charmion was ever at my side  follow me she whispered thou art in danger  i turned and followed her why should i not  whither go we i asked at length  to my chamber she said fear not we ladies of cleopatras court have small good fame to lose if anyone by chance should see us theyll think that it is a lovetryst and such are all the fashion  i followed and presently skirting the crowd we came unseen to a little side entrance that led to a stair up which we passed the stair ended in a passage we turned down it till we found a door on the left hand charmion entered silently and i followed her into a dark chamber being in she barred the door and kindling tinder to a flame lit a hanging lamp as the light grew strong i gazed around the chamber was not large and had but one casement closely shuttered for the rest it was simply furnished having white walls some chests for garments an ancient chair what i took to be a tiring table on which were combs perfumes and all the frippery that pertains to woman and a white bed with a broidered coverlid over which was hung a gnatgauze  be seated harmachis she said pointing to the chair i took the chair and charmion throwing back the gnatgauze sat herself upon the bed before me  knowest thou what i heard cleopatra say as thou didst leave the banquetinghall she asked presently  nay i know not  she gazed after thee and as i went over to her to do some service she murmured to herself by serapis i will make an end i will wait no longer tomorrow he shall be strangled  so i said it may be though after all that has been i can scarce believe that she will murder me  why canst thou not believe it thou most foolish of men dost forget how nigh thou wast to death there in the alabaster hall who saved thee then from the knives of the eunuchs was it cleopatra or was it i and brennus stay i will tell thee thou canst not yet believe it because in thy folly thou dost not think it possible that the woman who has but lately been as a wife to thee can now in so short a time doom thee to be basely done to death nay answer noti know all and i tell thee this thou hast not measured the depth of cleopatras perfidy nor canst thou dream the blackness of her wicked heart she had surely slain thee in alexandria had she not feared that thy slaughter being noised abroad might bring trouble on her therefore has she brought thee here to kill thee secretly for what more canst thou give her she has thy hearts love and is wearied of thy strength and beauty she has robbed thee of thy royal birthright and brought thee a king to stand amidst the waitingwomen behind her at her feasts she has won from thee the great secret of the holy treasure  ah thou knowest that  yes i know all and tonight thou seest how the wealth stored against the need of khem is being squandered to fill up the wanton luxury of khems macedonian queen thou seest how she has kept her oath to wed thee honourably harmachisat length thine eyes are open to the truth  ay i see too well and yet she swore she loved me and i poor fool i believed her  she swore she loved thee answered charmion lifting her dark eyes now i will show thee how she loves thee knowest thou what was this house it was a priests college and as thou wottest harmachis priests have their ways this little room aforetime was the room of the head priest and the chamber that is beyond and below was the gatheringplace of the other priests the old slave who keeps the house told me all this and also she revealed what i shall show thee now harmachis be silent as the dead and follow me  she blew out the lamp and by the little light that crept through the shuttered casement led me by the hand to the far corner of the room here she pressed upon the wall and a door opened in its thickness we entered and she closed the spring now we were in a little chamber some five cubits in length by four in breadth for a faint light struggled into the closet and also the sound of voices i knew not whence loosing my hand she crept to the end of the place and looked steadfastly at the wall then crept back and whispering silence led me forward with her then i saw that there were eyeholes in the wall which pierced it and were hidden on the farther side by carved work in stone i looked through the hole that was in front of me and i saw this six cubits below was the level of the floor of another chamber lit with fragrant lamps and most richly furnished it was the sleepingplace of cleopatra and there within ten cubits of where we stood sat cleopatra on a gilded couch and by her side sat antony  tell me cleopatra murmuredfor this place was so built that every word spoken in the room below came to the ears of the listener abovetell me noble antony wast pleased with my poor festival  ay he answered in his deep soldiers voice ay egypt i have made feasts and been bidden to feasts but never saw i aught like thine and i tell thee this though i am rough of tongue and unskilled in pretty sayings such as women love thou wast the richest sight of all that splendid board the red wine was not so red as thy beauteous cheek the roses smelt not so sweet as the odour of thy hair and no sapphire there with its changing light was so lovely as thy eyes of ocean blue  what praise from antony sweet words from the lips of him whose writings are so harsh why it is praise indeed  ay he went on it was a royal feast though i grieve that thou didst waste that great pearl and what meant that hourcalling astrologer of thine with his illomened talk of the curse of menkaura  a shadow fled across her glowing face i know not he was lately wounded in a brawl and methinks the blow has crazed him  he seemed not crazed and there was that about his voice which rings in my ears like some oracle of fate so wildly too he looked upon thee egypt with those piercing eyes of his like one who loved and yet hated through the love  he is a strange man i tell thee noble antony and a learned myself at times i almost fear him for he is deeply versed in the ancient arts of egypt knowest thou that the man is of royal blood and once he plotted to slay me but i won him over and slew him not for he had the key to secrets that i fain would learn and indeed i loved his wisdom and to listen to his deep talk of all hidden things  by bacchus i grow jealous of the knave and now egypt  and now i have sucked his knowledge dry and have no more cause to fear him didst thou not see that i have made him stand these three nights a slave amid my slaves and call aloud the hours as they fled in festival no captive king marching in thy roman triumphs can have suffered pangs so keen as that proud egyptian prince when he stood shamed behind my couch  here charmion laid her hand on mine and pressed it as though in tenderness  well he shall trouble us no more with his words of evil omen cleopatra went on slowly tomorrow morn he diesdies swiftly and in secret leaving no trace of what his fate has been on this is my mind fixed of a truth noble antony it is fixed even as i speak the fear of this man grows and gathers in my breast half am i minded to give the word even now for i breathe not freely till he be dead and she made as though to rise  let it be till morning he said catching her by the hand the soldiers drink and the deed will be ill done tis pity too i love not to think of men slaughtered in their sleep  in the morning perchance the hawk may have flown she answered pondering he hath keen ears this harmachis and can summon things to aid him that are not of the earth perchance even now he hears me in the spirit for of a truth i seem to feel his presence breathing round me i could tell theebut no let him be noble antony be my tiringwoman and loose me this crown of gold it chafes my brow be gentle hurt me notso  he lifted the uræus crown from her brows and she shook loose her heavy weight of hair that fell about her like a garment  take back thy crown royal egypt he said speaking low take it from my hand i will not rob thee of it but rather set it more firmly on that beauteous brow  what means my lord she asked smiling and looking into his eyes  what mean i why then this thou camest hither at my bidding to make answer of the charges laid against thee as to matters politic and knowest thou egypt that hadst thou been other than thou art thou hadst not gone back to queen it on the nile for of this i am sure the charges against thee are true in fact but being what thou artand look thou never did nature serve a woman betteri forgive thee all for the sake of thy grace and beauty i forgive thee that which had not been forgiven to virtue or to patriotism or to the dignity of age see now how good a thing is womans wit and loveliness that can make kings forget their duty and cozen even blindfolded justice to peep ere she lifts her sword take back thy crown o egypt it is now my care that though it be heavy it shall not chafe thee  these are royal words most notable antony she made answer gracious and generous words such as befit the conqueror of the world and touching my misdeeds in the pastif misdeeds there have beeni say this and this alonethen i knew not antony for knowing antony who could sin against him what woman could lift a sword against one who must be to all women as a godone who seen and known draws after him the whole allegiance of the heart as the sun draws flowers and what more can i say and not cross the bounds of womans modesty why only thisset that crown upon my brow great antony and i will take it as a gift from thee by the giving made doubly dear and to thy uses i will guard it  there now i am thy vassal queen and through me all old egypt that i rule does homage to antony the triumvir who shall be antony the emperor of rome and khems imperial lord  and having set the crown upon her locks he stood gazing on her grown passionate in the warm breath of her living beauty till at length he caught her by both hands and drawing her to him kissed her thrice saying  cleopatra i love thee sweeti love thee as i never loved before she drew back from his embrace smiling softly and as she did so the golden circlet of the sacred snakes fell being but loosely set upon her brow and rolled away into the darkness beyond the ring of light  i saw the omen and even in the bitter anguish of my heart knew its evil import but these twain took no note  thou lovest me she said most sweetly how know i that thou lovest me perchance it is fulvia whom thou lovestfulvia thy wedded wife  nay it is not fulvia tis thou cleopatra and thou alone many women have looked favourably upon me from my boyhood up but to never a one have i known such desire as to thee o thou wonder of the world like unto whom no woman ever was canst thou love me cleopatra and to me be true not for my place or power not for that which i can give or can withhold not for the stern music of my legions tramp or for the light that flows from my bright star of fortune but for myself for the sake of antony the rough captain grown old in camps ay for the sake of antony the reveller the frail the unfixed of purpose but who yet never did desert a friend or rob a poor man or take an enemy unawares say canst thou love me egypt oh if thou wilt why i am more happy than though i sat tonight in the capitol at rome crowned absolute monarch of the world  and ever as he spoke she gazed on him with wonderful eyes and in them shone a light of truth and honesty such as was strange to me  thou speakest plainly she said and thy words are sweet to mine earsthey would be sweet even were things otherwise than they are for what woman would not love to see the worlds master at her feet but things being as they are why antony what can be so sweet as thy sweet words the harbour of his rest to the stormtossed marinersurely that is sweet the dream of heavens bliss which cheers the poor ascetic priest on his path of sacrificesurely that is sweet the sight of dawn the rosyfingered coming in his promise to glad the watching earthsurely that is sweet but ah not one of these nor all dear delightful things that are can match the honeysweetness of thy words to me o antony for thou knowest notnever canst thou knowhow drear my life hath been and empty since thus it is ordained that in love only can woman lose her solitude and i have never lovednever might i lovetill this happy night ay take me in thy arms and let us swear a great vow of lovean oath that may not be broken while life is in us behold antony now and for ever i do vow most strict fidelity unto thee now and for ever i am thine and thine alone    then charmion took me by the hand and drew me thence  hast seen enough she asked when we were once more within the chamber and the lamp was lit  yea i answered my eyes are opened    chapter xvi  of the plan of charmion of the confession of charmion and of the answer of harmachis  for some while i sat with bowed head and the last bitterness of shame sank into my soul this then was the end for this i had betrayed my oaths for this i had told the secret of the pyramid for this i had lost my crown my honour and perchance my hope of heaven could there be another man in the wide world so steeped in sorrow as i was that night surely not one where should i turn what could i do and even through the tempest of my torn heart the bitter voice of jealousy called aloud for i loved this woman to whom i had given all and she at this momentshe wasah i could not bear to think of it and in my utter agony my heart burst in a river of tears such as are terrible to weep  then charmion drew near me and i saw that she too was weeping  weep not harmachis she sobbed kneeling at my side i cannot endure to see thee weep oh why wouldst thou not be warned then hadst thou been great and happy and not as now listen harmachis thou didst hear what that false and tigerish woman saidtomorrow she hands thee over to the murderers  it is well i gasped  nay it is not well harmachis give her not this last triumph over thee thou hast lost all save life but while life remains hope remains also and with hope the chance of vengeance  ah i said starting from my seat i had not thought of that aythe chance of vengeance it would be sweet to be avenged  it would be sweet harmachis and yet thisvengeance is an arrow that in falling oft pierces him who shot it myselfi know it and she sighed but a truce to talk and grief there will be time for us twain to grieve if not to talk in all the heavy coming years thou must flybefore the coming of the light must thou fly here is a plan tomorrow ere the dawn a galley that but yesterday came from alexandria bearing fruit and stores sails thither again and its captain is known to me but to thee he is not known now i will find thee the garb of a syrian merchant and cloak thee as i know how and furnish thee with a letter to the captain of the galley he shall give thee passage to alexandria for to him thou wilt seem but as a merchant going on the business of thy trade brennus is officer of the guard tonight and brennus is a friend to me and thee perhaps he will guess somewhat or perhaps he will not guess at the least the syrian merchant shall safely pass the lines what sayest thou  it is well i answered wearily little do i reck the issue  rest thou then here harmachis while i make these matters ready and harmachis grieve not overmuch there are others who should grieve more heavily than thou and she went leaving me alone with my agony which rent me like a torturebed had it not been for that fierce desire of vengeance which from time to time flashed across my tormented mind as the lightning over a midnight sea methinks my reason had left me in that dark hour at length i heard her footstep at the door and she entered breathing heavily for she bore a sack of clothing in her arms  it is well she said here is the garb with spare linen and writingtablets and all things needful i have seen brennus also and told him that a syrian merchant would pass the guard an hour before the dawn and though he made pretence of sleep i think he understood for he answered yawning that if they but had the password antony fifty syrian merchants might go through about their lawful business and here is the letter to the captainthou canst not mistake the galley for she is moored along to the righta small galley painted black as thou dost enter on the great quay and moreover the sailors make ready for sailing now i will wait here without while thou dost put off the livery of thy service and array thyself  when she was gone i tore off my gorgeous garments and spat upon them and trod them on the ground then i put on the modest robe of a merchant and bound the tablets round me on my feet the sandals of untanned hide and at my waist the knife when it was done charmion entered once again and looked on me  too much art thou still the royal harmachis she said see it must be changed  then she took scissors from her tiringtable and bidding me be seated she cut off my locks clipping the hair close to the head next she found stains of such sort as women use to make dark the eyes and mixed them cunningly rubbing the stuff on my face and hands and on the white mark in my hair where the sword of brennus had bitten to the bone  now thou art changedsomewhat for the worse harmachis she said with a dreary laugh scarce myself should i know thee stay there is one more thing and going to a chest of garments she drew thence a heavy bag of gold  take thou this she said thou wilt have need of money  i cannot take thy gold charmion  yes take it it was sepa who gave it to me for the furtherance of our cause and therefore it is fitting that thou shouldst spend it moreover if i want money doubtless antony who is henceforth my master will give me more he is much beholden to me and this he knows well there waste not the precious time in haggling oer the pelfnot yet art thou all a merchant harmachis and without more words she thrust the pieces into the leather bag that hung across my shoulders then she made fast the sack containing the spare garments and so womanly thoughtful was she placed in it an alabaster jar of pigment with which i might stain my countenance afresh and taking the broidered robes of my office that i had cast off hid them in the secret passage and so at last all was made ready  is it time that i should go i asked  not yet a while be patient harmachis for but one little hour more must thou endure my presence and then perchance farewell for ever  i made a gesture signifying that this was no time for sharp words  forgive me my quick tongue she said but from a salt spring bitter waters well be seated harmachis i have heavier words to speak to thee before thou goest  say on i answered words however heavy can move me no more  she stood before me with folded hands and the lamplight shone upon her beauteous face i noticed idly how great was its pallor and how wide and dark were the rings about the deep black eyes twice she lifted her white face and strove to speak twice her voice failed her and when at last it came it was in a hoarse whisper  i cannot let thee go she saidi cannot let thee go unwitting of the truth  harmachis twas i who did betray thee  i sprang to my feet an oath upon my lips but she caught me by the hand  oh be seated she saidbe seated and hear me then when thou hast heart do to me as thou wilt listen from that evil moment when in the presence of thy uncle sepa for the second time i set eyes upon thy face i loved theehow much thou canst little guess think upon thine own love for cleopatra and double it and double it again and perchance thou mayst come near to my loves mighty sum i loved thee day by day i loved thee more till in thee and for thee alone i seemed to live but thou wast coldthou wast worse than cold thou didst deal with me not as a breathing woman but rather as the instrument to an endas a tool with which to grave thy fortunes and then i sawyes long before thou knewest it thyselfthy hearts tide was setting strong towards that ruinous shore whereon today thy life is broken and at last that night came that dreadful night when hid within the chamber i saw thee cast my kerchief to the winds and with sweet words cherish my royal rivals gift thenoh thou knowestin my pain i betrayed the secret that thou wouldst not see and thou didst make a mock of me harmachis oh the shame of itthou in thy foolishness didst make a mock of me i went thence and within me were rising all the torments which can tear a womans heart for now i was sure that thou didst love cleopatra ay and so mad was i even that night i was minded to betray thee but i thoughtnot yet not yet tomorrow he may soften then came the morrow and all was ready for the bursting of the great plot that should make thee pharaoh and i too camethou dost rememberand again thou didst put me away when i spake to thee in parables as something of little worthas a thing too small to claim a moments weighty thought and knowing that this was becausethough thou knewest it notthou didst love cleopatra whom now thou must straightway slay i grew mad and a wicked spirit entered into me possessing me utterly so that i was myself no longer nor could control myself and because thou hadst scorned me i did this to my everlasting shame and sorrowi passed into cleopatras presence and betrayed thee and those with thee and our holy cause saying that i had found a writing which thou hadst let fall and read all this therein  i gasped and sat silent and gazing sadly at me she went on  when she understood how great was the plot and how deep its roots cleopatra was much troubled and at first she would have fled to sais or taken ship and run for cyprus but i showed her that the ways were barred then she said she would cause thee to be slain there in the chamber and i left her so believing for at that hour i was glad that thou shouldst be slainay even if i wept out my heart upon thy grave harmachis but what said i just nowvengeance is an arrow that oft falls on him who looses it so it was with me for between my going and thy coming cleopatra hatched a deeper plan she feared that to slay thee would only be to light a fiercer fire of revolt but she saw that to bind thee to her and having left men awhile in doubt to show thee faithless would strike the imminent danger at its roots and wither it this plot once formed being great she dared its doubtful issue andneed i go on thou knowest harmachis how she won and thus the shaft of vengeance that i loosed fell upon my own head for on the morrow i knew that i had sinned for naught that the burden of my betrayal had been laid on the wretched paulus and that i had but ruined the cause to which i was sworn and given the man i loved to the arms of wanton egypt  she bowed her head awhile and then as i spoke not once more went on  let all my sin be told harmachis and then let justice come see now this thing happened half did cleopatra learn to love thee and deep in her heart she bethought her of taking thee to wedded husband for the sake of this half love of hers she spared the lives of those in the plot whom she had meshed bethinking her that if she wedded thee she might use them and thee to draw the heart of egypt which loves not her nor any ptolemy and then once again she entrapped thee and in thy folly thou didst betray to her the secret of the hidden wealth of egypt which today she squanders to delight the luxurious antony and of a truth at that time she purposed to make good her oath and marry thee but on the very morn when dellius came for answer she sent for me and telling me allfor my wit above any she holds at pricedemanded of me my judgment whether she should defy antony and wed thee or whether she should put the thought away and come to antony and inow mark thou all my sini in my bitter jealousy rather than i would see her thy wedded wife and thou her loving lord counselled her most strictly that she should come to antony well knowingfor i had had speech with delliusthat if she came this weak antony would fall like a ripe fruit at her feet as indeed he has fallen and but now i have shown thee the issue of the scheme antony loves cleopatra and cleopatra loves antony and thou art robbed and matters have gone well for me who of all women on the earth tonight am the wretchedest by far for when i saw how thy heart broke but now my heart seemed to break with thine and i could no longer bear the burden of my evil deeds but knew that i must tell them and take my punishment  and now harmachis i have no more to say save that i thank thee for thy courtesy in hearkening and this one thing i add driven by my great love i have sinned against thee unto death i have ruined thee i have ruined khem and myself also i have ruined let death reward me slay thou me harmachisi will gladly die upon thy sword ay and kiss its blade slay thou me and go for if thou slayest me not myself i will surely slay and she threw herself upon her knees lifting her fair breast toward me that i might smite her with my dagger and in my bitter fury i was minded to strike for above all i thought how when i was fallen this woman who herself was my cause of shame had scourged me with her whip of scorn but it is hard to slay a fair woman and even as i lifted my hand to strike i remembered that she had now twice saved my life  woman thou shameless woman i said arise i slay thee not who am i that i should judge thy crime that with mine own doth overtop all earthly judgment  slay me harmachis she moaned slay me or i slay myself my burden is too great for me to bear be not so deadly calm curse me and slay  what was it that thou didst say to me just now charmionthat as i had sown so i must reap it is not lawful that thou shouldst slay thyself it is not lawful that i thine equal in sin should slay thee because through thee i sinned as thou hast sown charmion so must thou also reap base woman whose cruel jealousy has brought all these woes on me and egypt livelive on and from year to year pluck the bitter fruit of crime haunted be thy sleep by visions of thy outraged gods whose vengeance awaits thee and me in their dim amenti haunted be thy days by memories of that man whom thy fierce love brought to shame and ruin and by the sight of khem a prey to the insatiate cleopatra and a slave to roman antony  oh speak not thus harmachis thy words are sharper than any sword and more surely if more slowly shall they slay listen harmachis and she grasped my robe when thou wast great and all power lay within thy grasp thou didst reject me wilt reject me now that cleopatra hast cast thee from hernow that thou art poor and shamed and with no pillow to thy head still am i fair and still i worship thee let me fly with thee and make atonement for my lifelong love or if this be too great a thing to ask let me be but as thy sister and thy servantthy very slave so that i may still look upon thy face and share thy trouble and minister to thee o harmachis let me but come and i will brave all things and endure all things and nothing but death himself shall stay me from thy side for i do believe that the love that sank me to so low a depth dragging thee with me can yet lift me to an equal height and thee with me  wouldst tempt me to fresh sin woman and dost thou think charmion that in some hovel where i must hide i could bear day by day to look upon thy fair face and seeing remember that those lips betrayed me not thus easily shalt thou atone this i know even now many and heavy shall be thy lonely days of penance perchance that hour of vengeance yet may come and perchance thou shalt live to play thy part in it thou must still abide in the court of cleopatra and while thou art there if i yet live i will from time to time find means to give thee tidings perhaps a day may dawn when once more i shall need thy service now swear that in this event thou wilt not fail me a second time  i swear harmachisi swear may everlasting torments too hideous to be dreamedmore hideous even by far than those that wring me nowbe my portion if i fail thee in one jot or tittleay though i wait a lifetime for thy word  it is well see that thou keep the oathnot twice may we betray i go to work out my fate abide thou to work out thine perchance our divers threads will once more mingle ere the web be spun charmion who unasked didst love meand who prompted by that gentle love of thine didst betray and ruin mefare thee well  she gazed wildly upon my faceshe stretched out her arms as though to clasp me then in the agony of her despair she cast herself at length and grovelled upon the ground  i took up the sack of clothing and the staff and gained the door and as i passed it i threw one last glance upon her there she lay with arms outstretchedmore white than her white robesher dark hair streaming about her and her fair brows hidden in the dust  and thus i left her nor did i again set my eyes upon her till nine long years had come and gone  here ends the second and largest roll of papyrus     book iiithe vengeance of harmachis    chapter i  of the escape of harmachis from tarsus of his being cast forth as an offering to the gods of the sea of his sojourn in the isle of cyprus of his return to abouthis and of the death of amenemhat  i made my way down the stair in safety and presently stood in the courtyard of that great house it was but an hour from dawn and none were stirring the last reveller had drunk his fill the dancinggirls had ceased their dancing and silence lay upon the city i drew near the gate and was challenged by an officer who stood on guard wrapped in a heavy cloak  who passes said the voice of brennus  a merchant may it please you sir who having brought gifts from alexandria to a lady of the queens household and having been entertained of the lady now departs to his galley i answered in a feigned voice  umph he growled the ladies of the queens household keep their guests late well it is a time of festival the password sir shopkeeper without the password you must needs return and crave the ladys further hospitality  antony sir and a right good word too ah ive wandered far and never saw i so goodly a man or so great a general and mark you sir ive travelled far and seen many generals  ay antonys the word and antony is a good general in his waywhen it is a sober way and when he cannot find a skirt to follow ive served with antonyand against him too and know his points well well hes got an armful now  and all this while that he was holding me in talk the sentry had been pacing to and fro before the gate but now he moved a little way to the right leaving the entrance clear  fare thee well harmachis and begone whispered brennus leaning forward and speaking quickly linger not but at times bethink thee of brennus who risked his neck to save thine farewell lad i would that we were sailing north together and he turned his back upon me and began to hum a tune  farewell brennus thou honest man i answered and was gone and as i heard long afterwards when on the morrow the hue and cry was raised because the murderers could not find me though they sought me everywhere to slay me brennus did me a service for he swore that as he kept his watch alone an hour after midnight he saw me come and stand upon the parapet of the roof that then i stretched out my robes and they became wings on which i floated up to heaven leaving him astonished and all those about the court lent ear to this history believing in it because of the great fame of my magic and they wondered much what the marvel might portend the tale also travelled into egypt and did much to save my good name among those whom i had betrayed for the more ignorant among them believed that i acted not of my will but of the will of the dread gods who of their own purpose wafted me into heaven and thus to this day the saying runs that when harmachis comes again egypt shall be free but alas harmachis comes no more only cleopatra though she was much afraid doubted her of the tale and sent an armed vessel to search for the syrian merchant but not to find him as shall be told    when i reached the galley of which charmion had spoken i found her about to sail and gave the writing to the captain who conned it looking on me curiously but said nothing  so i went aboard and immediately we dropped swiftly down the river with the current and having come to the mouth of the river unchallenged though we passed many vessels we put out to sea with a strong favouring wind that before night freshened to a great gale then the sailor men being much afraid would have put about and run for the mouth of cydnus again but could not because of the wildness of the sea all that night it blew furiously and by dawn our mast was carried away and we rolled helplessly in the trough of the great waves but i sat wrapped in a cloak little heeding and because i showed no fear the sailors cried out that i was a wizard and sought to cast me into the sea but the captain would not at dawn the wind slackened but ere noon it once more blew in terrible fury and at the fourth hour from noon we came in sight of the rocky coast of that cape in the island of cyprus which is called dinaretum where is a mountain named olympus and thitherwards we drifted swiftly then when the sailors saw the terrible rocks and how the great waves that smote on them spouted up in foam once more they grew much afraid and cried out in their fear for seeing that i still sat unmoved they swore that i certainly was a wizard and came to cast me forth as a sacrifice to the gods of the sea and this time the captain was overruled and said nothing therefore when they came to me i rose and defied them saying cast me forth if ye will but if ye cast me forth ye shall perish  for in my heart i cared little having no more any love of life but rather a desire to die though i greatly feared to pass into the presence of my holy mother isis but my weariness and sorrow at the bitterness of my lot overcame even this heavy fear so that when being mad as brute beasts they seized me and lifting me hurled me into the raging waters i did but utter one prayer to isis and made ready for death but it was fated that i should not die for when i rose to the surface of the water i saw a spar of wood floating near me to which i swam and clung and a great wave came and swept me riding as it were upon the spar as when a boy i had learned to do in the waters of the nile past the bulwarks of the galley where the fiercefaced sailors clustered to see me drown and when they saw me come mounted on the wave cursing them as i came and saw too that the colour of my face had changedfor the salt water had washed way the pigment they shrieked with fear and threw themselves down upon the deck and within a very little while as i rode toward the rocky coast a great wave poured into the vessel that rolled broadside on and pressed her down into the deep whence she rose no more  so she sank with all her crew and in that same storm also sank the galley which cleopatra had sent to search for the syrian merchant thus all traces of me were lost and of a surety she believed that i was dead  but i rode on toward the shore the wind shrieked and the salt waves lashed my face as alone with the tempest i rushed upon my way while the seabirds screamed about my head i felt no fear but rather a wild uplifting of the heart and in the stress of my imminent peril the love of life seemed to waken again and so i plunged and drifted now tossed high toward the lowering clouds now cast into the deep valleys of the sea till at length the rocky headland loomed before me and i saw the breakers smite upon the stubborn rocks and through the screaming of the wind heard the sullen thunder of their fall and the groan of stones sucked seaward from the beach on highthroned upon the mane of a mighty billowfifty cubits beneath me the level of the hissing waters above me the inky sky it was done the spar was torn from me and dragged downwards by the weight of the bag of gold and the clinging of my garments i sank struggling furiously  now i was underthe green light for a moment streamed through the waters and then came darkness and on the darkness pictures of the past picture after pictureall the long scene of life was written here then in my ears i only heard the song of the nightingale the murmur of the summer sea and the music of cleopatras laugh of victory following me softly and yet more soft as i sank away to sleep    once more my life came back and with it a sense of deadly sickness and of aching pain i opened my eyes and saw a kind face bending over me and knew that i was in the room of a builded house  how came i hither i asked faintly  of a truth poseidon brought thee stranger answered a rough voice in barbarous greek we found thee cast high upon the beach like a dead dolphin and brought thee to our house for we are fisherfolk and here methinks thou must lie a while for thy left leg is broken by the force of the waves  i strove to move my foot and could not it was true the bone was broken above the knee  who art thou and how art thou named asked the roughbearded sailor  i am an egyptian traveller whose ship has sunk in the fury of the gale and i am named olympus i answered for these people called a mountain that we had sighted olympus and therefore i took the name at hazard and as olympus i was henceforth known  here with these rough fisherfolk i abode for the half of a year paying them a little out of the sum of gold that had come safely ashore upon me for it was long before my bones grew together again and then i was left somewhat of a cripple for i who had been so tall and straight and strong now limpedone limb being shorter than the other and after i recovered from my hurt i still lived there and toiled with them at the trade of fishing for i knew not whither i should go or what i should do and for a while i was fain to become a peasant fisherman and so wear my weary life away and these people entreated me kindly though as others they feared me much holding me to be a wizard brought hither by the sea for my sorrows had stamped so strange an aspect on my face that men gazing at me grew fearful of what lay beneath its calm  there then i abode till at length one night as i lay and strove to sleep great restlessness came upon me and a mighty desire once more to see the face of sihor but whether this desire was of the gods or born of my own heart not knowing i cannot tell so strong was it at the least that before it was dawn i rose from my bed of straw and clothed myself in my fisher garb and because i had no wish to answer questions thus i took farewell of my humble hosts first i placed some pieces of gold on the wellcleaned table of wood and then taking a pot of flour i strewed it in the form of letters writing  this gift from olympus the egyptian who returns into the sea  then i went and on the third day i came to the great city of salamis that is also on the sea here i abode in the fishermens quarters till a vessel was about to sail for alexandria and to the captain of this vessel a man of paphos i hired myself as a sailor we sailed with a favouring wind and on the fifth day i came to alexandria that hateful city and saw the light dancing on its golden domes  here i might not abide so again i hired myself out as a sailor giving my labour in return for passage and we passed up the nile and i learned from the talk of men that cleopatra had come back to alexandria drawing antony with her and that they lived together with royal state in the palace on the lochias indeed the boatmen already had a song thereon which they sang as they laboured at the oar also i heard how the galley that was sent to search for the vessel which carried the syrian merchant had foundered with all her crew and the tale that the queens astronomer harmachis had flown to heaven from the roof of the house at tarsus and the sailors wondered because i sat and laboured and would not sing their ribald song of the loves of cleopatra for they too began to fear me and mutter concerning me among themselves then i knew that i was a man accursed and set aparta man whom none might love  on the sixth day we drew nigh to abouthis where i left the craft and the sailors were right glad to see me go and with a breaking heart i walked through the fertile fields seeing faces that i knew well but in my rough disguise and limping gait none knew me at length as the sun sank i came near to the great outer pylon of the temple and here i crouched down in the ruins of a house not knowing why i had come or what i was about to do like a lost ox i had strayed from far back to the fields of my birth and for what if my father amenemhat still lived surely he would turn his face from me i dared not go into the presence of my father i sat hidden there among the broken rafters and idly watched the pylon gates to see if perchance a face i knew should issue from them but none came forth or entered in though the great gates stood wide and then i saw that herbs were growing between the stones where no herbs had grown for ages what could this be was the temple deserted nay how could the worship of the eternal gods have ceased that for thousands of years had day by day been offered in the holy place was then my father dead it well might be and yet why this silence where were the priests where the worshippers  i could bear the doubt no more but as the sun sank red i crept like a hunted jackal through the open gates and on till i reached the first great hall of pillars here i paused and gazed around menot a sight not a sound in the dim and holy place i went on with a beating heart to the second great hall the hall of sixandthirty pillars where i had been crowned lord of all the lands still not a sight or a sound thence half fearful of my own footfall so terribly did it echo in the silence of the deserted holies i passed down the passage of the names of the pharaohs towards my fathers chamber the curtain still swung over the doorway but what would there be withinalso emptiness i lifted it and noiselessly passed in and there in his carven chair at the table on which his long white beard flowed sat my father amenemhat clad in his priestly robes at first i thought that he was dead he sat so still but at length he turned his head and i saw that his eyes were white and sightless he was blind and his face was thin as the face of a dead man and woeful with age and grief  i stood still and felt the blind eyes wandering over me i could not speak to himi dared not speak to him i would go and hide myself afresh  i had already turned and grasped the curtain when my father spoke in a deep slow voice  come hither thou who wast my son and art a traitor come hither thou harmachis on whom khem builded up her hope not in vain then have i drawn thee from far away not in vain have i held my life in me till i heard thy footfall creeping down these empty holies like the footfall of a thief  oh my father i gasped astonished thou art blind how knowest thou me  how do i know theeand askest thou that who hast learned of our lore enough i know thee and i brought thee hither would harmachis that i knew thee not would that i had been blasted of the invisible ere i drew thee down from the womb of nout to be my curse and shame and the last woe of khem  oh speak not thus i moaned is not my burden already more than i can bear am i not myself betrayed and utterly outcast be pitiful my father  be pitifulbe pitiful to thee who hast shown so great pity it was thy pity which gave up noble sepa to die beneath the hands of the tormentors  oh not thatnot that i cried  ay traitor thatto die in agony with his last poor breath proclaiming thee his murderer honest and innocent be pitiful to thee who gavest all the flower of khem as the price of a wantons armsthinkest thou that labouring in the darksome desert mines those noble ones in thought are pitiful to thee harmachis be pitiful to thee by whom this holy temple of abouthis hath been ravaged its lands seized its priests scattered and i alone old and withered left to count out its ruinto thee who hast poured the treasures of her into thy lemans lap who hast forsworn thyself thy country thy birthright and thy gods yea thus am i pitiful accursed be thou fruit of my loinsshame be thy portion agony thy end and hell receive thee at the last where art thou yea i grew blind with weeping when i heard the truthsure they strove to hide it from me let me find thee that i may spit upon thee thou renegade thou apostate thou outcastand he rose from his seat and staggered like a living wrath toward me smiting the air with his wand and as he came with outstretched arms awful to see suddenly his end found him and with a cry he sank down upon the ground the red blood streaming from his lips i ran to him and lifted him and as he died he babbled  he was my son a brighteyed lovely boy and full of promise as the spring and nowand nowoh would that he were dead  then came a pause and the breath rattled in his throat  harmachis he gasped art there  yea father  harmachis atoneatone vengeance can still be wreakedforgiveness may still be won theres gold ive hidden itatouashe can tell theeah this pain farewell  and he struggled faintly in my arms and was dead    thus then did i and my holy father the prince amenemhat meet together for the last time in the flesh and for the last time part    chapter ii  of the last misery of harmachis of the calling down of the holy isis by the word of fear of the promise of isis of the coming of atoua and of the words of atoua  i crouched upon the floor gazing at the dead body of my father who had lived to curse me the utterly accursed while the darkness crept and gathered round us till at length the dead and i were alone in the black silence oh how tell the misery of that hour imagination cannot dream it nor words paint it forth once more in my wretchedness i bethought me of death a knife was at my girdle with which i might cut the thread of sorrow and set my spirit free free ay free to fly and face the last vengeance of the holy gods alas and alas i did not dare to die better the earth with all its woes than the quick approach of those unimagined terrors that hovering in dim amenti wait the advent of the fallen  i grovelled on the ground and wept tears of agony for the lost unchanging pastwept till i could weep no more but no answer came from the silenceno answer but the echoes of my grief not a ray of hope my soul wandered in a darkness more utter than that which was about mei was forsaken of the gods and cast out of men terror took hold upon me crouching in that lonely place hard by the majesty of the awful dead i rose to fly how could i fly in this gloomand where should i fly who had no place of refuge once more i crouched down and the great fear grew on me till the cold sweat ran from my brow and my soul was faint within me then in my last despair i prayed aloud to isis to whom i had not dared to pray for many days  o isis holy mother i cried put away thy wrath and of thine infinite pity o thou allpitiful hearken to the voice of the anguish of him who was thy son and servant but who by sin hath fallen from the vision of thy love o throned glory who being in all things hast of all things understanding and of all griefs knowledge cast the weight of thy mercy against the scale of my evildoing and make the balance equal look down upon my woe and measure it count up the sum of my repentance and take thou note of the flood of sorrow that sweeps my soul away o thou holy whom it was given to me to look upon face to face by that dread hour of commune i summon thee i summon thee by the mystic word come then in mercy to save me or in anger to make an end of that which can no more be borne  and rising from my knees i stretched out my arms and dared to cry aloud the word of fear to use which unworthily is death  swiftly the answer came for in the silence i heard the sound of the shaken sistra heralding the coming of the glory then at the far end of the chamber grew the semblance of the horned moon gleaming faintly in the darkness and betwixt the golden horns rested a small dark cloud in and out of which the fiery serpent climbed  my knees waxed loose in the presence of the glory and i sank down before it  then spake the small sweet voice within the cloud  harmachis who wast my servant and my son i have heard thy prayer and the summons that thou hast dared to utter which on the lips of one with whom i have communed hath power to draw me from the uttermost no more harmachis may we be one in the bond of love divine for thou hast put me away of thine own act therefore after this long silence i come harmachis clothed in terrors and perchance ready for vengeance for not lightly can isis be drawn from the halls of her divinity  smite goddess i answered smite and give me over to those who wreak thy vengeance for i can no longer bear the burden of my woe  and if thou canst not bear thy burden here upon this upper earth came the soft reply how then shalt thou bear the greater burden that shall be laid upon thee there coming defiled and yet unpurified into my dim realm of death that is life and change unending nay harmachis i smite thee not for not all am i wroth that thou hast dared to utter the awful word which calls me down to thee hearken harmachis i praise not and i reproach not for i am the minister of reward and punishment and the executrix of decrees and if i give i give in silence and if i smite in silence do i smite therefore i will add naught to thy burden by the weight of heavy words though through thee it has come to pass that soon shall isis the mothermystery be but a memory in egypt thou hast sinned and heavy shall be thy punishment as i did warn thee both in the flesh and in my kingdom of amenti but i told thee that there is a road of repentance and surely thy feet are set thereon and therein must thou walk with a humble heart eating of the bread of bitterness till such time as thy doom be measured  have i then no hope o holy  that which is done harmachis is done nor can its issues be altered khem shall no more be free till all its temples are as the desert dust strange peoples shall from age to age hold her hostage and in bonds new religions shall arise and wither within the shadow of her pyramids for to every world race and age the countenances of the gods are changed this is the tree that shall spring from thy seed of sin harmachis and from the sin of those who tempted thee  alas i am undone i cried  yea thou art undone and yet shall this be given to thee thy destroyer thou shalt destroyfor so in the purpose of my justice it is ordained when the sign comes to thee arise go to cleopatra and in such manner as i shall put into thy heart do heavens vengeance upon her and now for thyself one word for thou hast put me from thee harmachis and no more shall i come face to face with thee till cycles hence the last fruit of thy sin hath ceased to be upon this earth yet through the vastness of the unnumbered years remember thou this the love divine is love eternal which cannot be extinguished though it be everlastingly estranged repent my son repent and do well while there is yet time that at the dim end of ages thou mayest once more be gathered unto me still harmachis though thou seest me not still when the very name by which thou knowest me has become a meaningless mystery to those who shall be after thee still i whose hours are eternali who have watched universes wither wane and beneath the breath of time melt into nothingness again to gather and reborn thread the maze of spacestill i say i shall companion thee wherever thou goest in whatever form of life thou livest there i shall be art thou wafted to the farthest star art thou buried in amentis lowest deepin lives in deaths in sleeps in wakings in remembrances in oblivions in all the fevers of the outer life in all the changes of the spiritstill if thou wilt but atone and forget me no more i shall be with thee waiting thine hour of redemption for this is the nature of love divine wherewith it loves that which partakes of its divinity and by the holy tie hath once been bound to it judge then harmachis was it well to put this from thee to win the dust of earthly woman and now dare not again to utter the word of power till these things are done harmachis for this season fare thee well    as the last note of the sweet voice died away the fiery snake climbed into the heart of the cloud now the cloud rolled from the horns of light and was gathered into the blackness the vision of the crescent moon grew dim and vanished then as the goddess passed once more came the faint and dreadful music of the shaken sistra and all was still  i hid my face in my robe and even then though my outstretched hand could touch the chill corpse of that father who had died cursing me i felt hope come back into my heart knowing that i was not altogether lost nor utterly rejected of her whom i had forsaken but whom i yet loved and then weariness overpowered me and i slept    i woke the faint lights of dawn were creeping from the opening in the roof ghastly they lay upon the shadowy sculptured walls and ghastly upon the dead face and white beard of my father the gathered to osiris i started up remembering all things and wondering in my heart what i should do and as i rose i heard a faint footfall creeping down the passage of the names of the pharaohs  la la la mumbled a voice that i knew for the voice of the old wife atoua why tis dark as the house of the dead the holy ones who built this temple loved not the blessed sun however much they worshipped him now wheres the curtain  presently it was drawn and atoua entered a stick in one hand and a basket in the other her face was somewhat more wrinkled and her scanty locks were somewhat whiter than aforetime but for the rest she was as she had ever been she stood and peered around with her sharp black eyes for as yet she could see nothing because of the shadows  now where is he she muttered osirisglory to his namesend that he has not wandered in the night and he blind alack that i could not return before the dark alack and alack what times have we fallen on when the holy high priest and the governor by descent of abouthis is left with one aged crone to minister to his infirmity o harmachis my poor boy thou hast laid trouble at our doors why whats this surely he sleeps not there upon the groundtwill be his death prince holy father amenemhat awake arise and she hobbled towards the corpse why how is it by him who sleeps hes dead untended and alonedead dead and she sent her long wail of grief ringing up the sculptured walls  hush woman be still i said gliding from the shadows  oh what art thou she cried casting down her basket wicked man hast thou murdered this holy one the only holy one in egypt surely the curse will fall on thee for though the gods do seem to have forsaken us now in our hour of trial yet is their arm long and certainly they will be avenged on him who hath slain their anointed  look on me atoua i cried  look ay i lookthou wicked wanderer who hast dared this cruel deed harmachis is a traitor and lost far away and amenemhat his holy father is murdered and now im all alone without kith or kin i gave them for him i gave them for harmachis the traitor come slay me also thou wicked one  i took a step toward her and she thinking that i was about to smite her cried out in fear  nay good sir spare me eighty and six by the holy ones eighty and six come next flood of nile and yet i would not die though osiris is merciful to the old who served him come no nearerhelp help  thou fool be silent i said knowest thou me not  know thee can i know every wandering boatman to whom sebek grants to earn a livelihood till typhon claims his own and yetwhy tis strangethat changed countenancethat scarthat stumbling gait it is thou harmachistis thou o my boy art come back to glad mine old eyes i hoped thee dead let me kiss theenay i forget harmachis is a traitor ay and a murderer here lies the holy amenemhat murdered by the traitor harmachis get thee gone ill have none of traitors and of parricides get thee to thy wantonit is not thou whom i did nurse  peace woman peace i slew not my fatherhe died alashe died even in my arms  ay surely and cursing thee harmachis thou hast given death to him who gave thee life la la i am old and ive seen many a trouble but this is the heaviest of them all i never liked the looks of mummies but i would i were one this hour get thee gone i pray thee  old nurse reproach me not have i not enough to bear  ah yes yesi did forget well and what is thy sin a woman was thy bane as women have been to those before thee and shall be to those after thee and what a woman la la i saw her a beauty such as never wasan arrow pointed by the evil gods for destruction and thou a young man bred as a priestan ill traininga very ill training twas no fair match who can wonder that she mastered thee come harmachis let me kiss thee it is not for a woman to be hard on a man because he loved our sex too much why that is but nature and nature knows her business else she had made us otherwise but here is an evil case knowest thou that this macedonian queen of thine hath seized the temple lands and revenues and driven away the priestsall save the holy amenemhat who lies here and whom she left i know not why ay and caused the worship of the gods to cease within these walls well hes gonehes gone and indeed he is better with osiris for his life was a sore burden to him and hark thou harmachis he hath not left thee emptyhanded for so soon as the plot failed he gathered all his wealth and it is large and hid itwhere i can show theeand it is thine by right of descent  talk not to me of wealth atoua where shall i go and how shall i hide my shame  ah true true here mayst thou not abide for if they found thee surely they would put thee to the dreadful deathay to the death by the waxen cloth nay i will hide thee and when the funeral rites of the holy amenemhat have been performed we will fly hence and cover us from the eyes of men till these sorrows are forgotten la la it is a sad world and full of trouble as the nile mud is full of beetles come harmachis come    chapter iii  of the life of him who was named the learned olympus in the tomb of the harpers that is by tÁpÉ of his counsel to cleopatra of the message of charmion and of the passing of olympus down to alexandria  these things then came to pass for eighty days i was hidden of the old wife atoua while the body of the prince my father was made ready for burial by those skilled in the arts of embalming and when at last all things were done in order i crept from my hidingplace and made offerings to the spirit of my father and placing lotusflowers on his breast went thence sorrowing and on the following day from where i lay hid i saw the priests of the temple of osiris and of the holy shrine of isis come forth and in slow procession bear his painted coffin to the sacred lake and lay it beneath the funeral tent in the consecrated boat i saw them celebrate the symbol of the trial of the dead and name him above all men just and then bear him thence to lay him by his wife my mother in the deep tomb that he had hewn in the rock near to the restingplace of the holy osiris where notwithstanding my sins i too hope to sleep ere long and when all these things were done and the deep tomb sealed the wealth of my father having been removed from the hidden treasury and placed in safety i fled disguised with the old wife atoua up the nile till we came to tápé and here in this great city i lay a while till a place could be found where i should hide myself        thebeseditor  and such a place i found for to the north of the great city are brown and rugged hills and desert valley blasted of the sun and in this place of desolation the divine pharaohs my forefathers hollowed out their tombs in the solid rock the most part of which are lost to this day so cunningly have they been hidden but some are open for the accursed persians and other thieves broke into them in search of treasure and one nightfor by night only did i leave my hidingplacejust as the dawn was breaking on the mountain tops i wandered alone in this sad valley of death like to which there is no other and presently came to the mouth of a tomb hidden amid great rocks which afterwards i knew for the place of the burying of the divine rameses the third of that name now long gathered to osiris and by the faint light of the dawn creeping through the entrance i saw that it was spacious and that within were chambers  on the following night therefore i returned bearing lights with atoua my nurse who ever ministered faithfully to me as when i was little and without discretion and we searched the mighty tomb and came to the great hall of the sarcophagus of granite in which the divine rameses sleeps and saw the mystic paintings on the walls the symbol of the snake unending the symbol of ra resting upon the scarabæus the symbol of ra resting upon nout the symbol of the headless men and many others whereof being initiated well i read the mysteries and opening from the long descending passage i found chambers in which were paintings beautiful to behold and of all manner of things for beneath each chamber is entombed the master of the craft of which the paintings tell he who was the chief of the servants of that craft in the house of this divine rameses and on the walls of the last chamberon the lefthand side looking toward the hall of the sarcophagusare paintings exceedingly beautiful and two blind harpers playing upon their bent harps before the god mou and beneath the flooring these harpers who harp no more are soft at sleep here then in this gloomy place even in the tomb of the harpers and the company of the dead i took up my abode and here for eight long years i worked out my penance and made atonement for my sin but atoua because she loved to be near the light abode in the chamber of the boatsthat is the first chamber on the righthand side of the gallery looking toward the hall of the sarcophagus  and this was the manner of my life on every second day the old wife atoua went forth and brought water from the city and such food as is necessary to keep the life from failing and also tapers made from fat and one hour at the time of sunrise and one hour at the time of sunset i did go forth also to wander in the valley for my healths sake and to save my sight from failing in the great darkness of the tomb but the other hours of the day and night except when i climbed the mountain to watch the course of the stars i spent in prayer and meditation and sleep till the cloud of sin lifted from my heart and once more i drew near to the gods though with isis my heavenly mother i might speak no more and i grew exceedingly wise also pondering on all those mysteries to which i held the key for abstinence and prayer and sorrowful solitude wore away the grossness of my flesh and with the eyes of the spirit i learned to look deep into the heart of things till the joy of wisdom fell like dew upon my soul  soon the rumour was wafted about the city that a certain holy man named olympus abode in solitude in the tombs of the awful valley of the dead and hither came people bearing sick that i might cure them and i gave my mind to the study of simples in which atoua instructed me and by lore and the weight of my thought i gained great skill in medicine and healed many sick and thus ever as time went on my fame was noised abroad for it was said that i was also a magician and that in the tombs i had commune with the spirits of the dead and this indeed i didthough it is not lawful for me to speak of these matters thus then it came to pass that no more need atoua go forth to seek food and water for the people brought itmore than was needful for i would receive no fee now at first fearing lest some in the hermit olympus might know the lost harmachis i would only meet those who came in the darkness of the tomb but afterwards when i learned how it was held through all the land that harmachis was certainly no more i came forth and sat in the mouth of the tomb and ministered to the sick and at times calculated nativities for the great and thus my fame grew continually till at length folk journeyed even from memphis and alexandria to visit me and from them i learned how antony had left cleopatra for a while and fulvia being dead had married octavia the sister of cæsar many other things i learned also  and in the second year i did this i despatched the old wife atoua disguised as a seller of simples to alexandria bidding her seek out charmion and if yet she found her faithful reveal to her the secret of my way of life so she went and in the fifth month from her sailing returned bearing charmions greetings and a token and she told me that she had found means to see charmion and in talk had let fall the name of harmachis speaking of me as one dead at which charmion unable to control her grief wept aloud then reading her heartfor the old wife was very clever and held the key of knowledgeshe told her that harmachis yet lived and sent her greetings thereon charmion wept yet more with joy and kissed the old wife and made her gifts bidding her tell me that she had kept her vow and waited for my coming and the hour of vengeance so having learned many secrets atoua returned again to tápé  and in the following year messengers came to me from cleopatra bearing a sealed roll and great gifts i opened the roll and read this in it  cleopatra to olympus the learned egyptian who dwells in the valley of death by tápé  the fame of thy renown o learned olympus hath reached our ears tell thou then this to us and if thou tellest aright greater honour and wealth shalt thou have than any in egypt how shall we win back the love of noble antony who is bewitched of cunning octavia and tarries long from us  now in this i saw the hand of charmion who had made my renown known to cleopatra  all that night i took counsel with my wisdom and on the morrow wrote my answer as it was put into my heart to the destruction of cleopatra and antony and thus i wrote  olympus the egyptian to cleopatra the queen  go forth into syria with one who shall be sent to lead thee thus shalt thou win antony to thy arms again and with him gifts more great than thou canst dream  and with this letter i dismissed the messengers bidding them share the presents sent by cleopatra among their company  so they went wondering  but cleopatra seizing on the advice to which her passion prompted her departed straightway with fonteius capito into syria and there the thing came about as i had foretold for antony was subdued of her and gave her the greater part of cilicia the ocean shore of arabia nabathæa the balmbearing provinces of judæa the province of phoenicia the province of coelesyria the rich isle of cyprus and all the library of pergamus and to the twin children that with the son ptolemy cleopatra had borne to antony he impiously gave the names of kings the children of kingsof alexander helios as the greeks name the sun and of cleopatra selene the moon the longwinged  these things then came to pass  now on her return to alexandria cleopatra sent me great gifts of which i would have none and prayed me the learned olympus to come to her at alexandria but it was not yet time and i would not but thereafter she and antony sent many times to me for counsel and i ever counselled them to their ruin nor did my prophecies fail    thus the long years rolled away and i the hermit olympus the dweller in a tomb the eater of bread and the drinker of water by strength of the wisdom that was given me of the avenging power became once more great in khem for i grew ever wiser as i trampled the desires of the flesh beneath my feet and turned my eyes to heaven  at length eight full years were accomplished the war with the parthians had come and gone and artavasdes king of armenia had been led in triumph through the streets of alexandria cleopatra had visited samos and athens and by her counselling the noble octavia had been driven like some discarded concubine from the house of antony at rome and now at the last the measure of the folly of antony was full even to the brim for this master of the world had no longer the good gift of reason he was lost in cleopatra as i had been lost therefore in the event octavianus declared war against him  and as i slept upon a certain day in the chamber of the harpers in the tomb of pharaoh that is by tápé there came to me a vision of my father the aged amenemhat and he stood over me leaning on his staff and spoke saying  look forth my son  then i looked forth and with the eyes of my spirit saw the sea and two great fleets grappling in war hard by a rocky coast and the emblems were those of octavian and of the other those of cleopatra and antony the ships of antony and cleopatra bore down upon the ships of cæsar and drove them on for victory inclined to antony  i looked again there sat cleopatra in a golddecked galley watching the fight with eager eyes then i cast my spirit on her so that she seemed to hear the voice of dead harmachis crying in her ear  fly cleopatra it seemed to say fly or perish  she looked up wildly and again she heard my spirits cry now a mighty fear took hold of her she called aloud to the sailors to hoist the sails and make signal to her fleet to put about this they did wondering but little loath and fled in haste from the battle  then a great roar went up from friend and foe  cleopatra is fled cleopatra is fled and i saw wreck and red ruin fall upon the fleet of antony and awoke from my trance  the days passed and again a vision of my father came to me and spoke saying  arise my sonthe hour of vengeance is at hand thy plots have not failed thy prayers have been heard by the bidding of the gods as she sat in her galley at the fight of actium the heart of cleopatra was filled with fears so that deeming she heard thy voice bidding her fly or perish she fled with all her fleet now the strength of actium is broken on the sea go forth and as it shall be put into thy mind so do thou  in the morning i awoke wondering and went to the mouth of the tomb and there coming up the valley i saw the messengers of cleopatra and with them a roman guard  what will ye with me now i asked sternly  this is the message of the queen and of great antony answered the captain bowing low before me for i was much feared by all men the queen commands thy presence at alexandria many times has she sent and thou wouldst not come now she bids thee to come and that swiftly for she has need of thy counsel  and if i say nay soldier what then  these are my orders most holy olympus that i bring thee by force  i laughed aloud by force thou fool use not such talk to me lest i smite thee where thou art know then that i can kill as well as cure  pardon i beseech thee he answered shrinking i say but those things that i am bid  well i know it captain fear not i come  so on that very day i departed together with the aged atoua ay i went as secretly as i had come and the tomb of the divine rameses knew me no more and with me i took all the treasures of my father amenemhat for i was not minded to go to alexandria emptyhanded and as a suppliant but rather as a man of much wealth and condition now as i went i learned that antony following cleopatra had indeed fled from actium and knew that the end drew nigh for this and many other things had i foreseen in the darkness of the tomb of tápé and planned to bring about    thus then i came to alexandria and entered into a house which had been made ready for me at the palace gates  and that very night charmion came to mecharmion whom i had not seen for nine long years    chapter iv  of the meeting of charmion with the learned olympus of her speech with him of the coming of olympus into the presence of cleopatra and of the commands of cleopatra  clad in my plain black robe i sat in the guestchamber of the house that had been made ready for me i sat in a carven lionfooted chair and looked upon the swinging lamps of scented oil the pictured tapestries the rich syrian rugsand amidst all this luxury bethought me of that tomb of the harpers which is at tápé and of the nine long years of dark loneliness and preparation i sat and crouched upon a rug near to the door lay the aged atoua her hair was white as snow and shrivelled with age was the wrinkled countenance of the woman who when all deserted me had yet clung to me in her great love forgetting my great sins nine years nine long years and now once again i set my foot in alexandria once again in the appointed circle of things i came forth from the solitude of preparation to be a fate to cleopatra and this second time i came not forth to fail  and yet how changed the circumstance i was out of the story my part now was but the part of the sword in the hands of justice i might no more hope to make egypt free and great and sit upon my lawful throne khem was lost and lost was i harmachis in the rush and turmoil of events the great plot of which i had been the pivot was covered up and forgotten scarce a memory of it remained the curtain of dark night was closing in upon the history of my ancient race its very gods were tottering to their fall i could already in the spirit hear the shriek of the roman eagles as they flapped their wings above the furthest banks of sihor  presently i roused myself and bade atoua go seek a mirror and bring it to me that i might look therein  and i saw this a face shrunken and pallid on which no smile came great eyes grown wan with gazing into darkness looking out beneath the shaven head emptily as the hollow eyepits of a skull a wizened halting form wasted by abstinence sorrow and prayer a long wild beard of iron grey thin blueveined hands that ever trembled like a leaf bowed shoulders and lessened limbs time and grief had done their work indeed scarce could i think myself the same as when the royal harmachisin all the splendour of my strength and youthful beautyi first had looked upon the womans loveliness that did destroy me and yet within me burned the same fire as of yore yet i was not changed for time and grief have no power to alter the immortal spirit of man seasons may come and go hope like a bird may fly away passion may break its wings against the iron bars of fate illusions may crumble as the cloudy towers of sunset flame faith as running water may slip from beneath our feet solitude may stretch itself around us like the measureless desert sand old age may creep as the gathering night over our bowed heads grown hoary in their shameyea bound to fortunes wheel we may taste of every turn of chancenow rule as kings now serve as slaves now love now hate now prosper and now perish but still through all we are the same for this is the marvel of identity    and as i sat and thought these things in bitterness of heart there came a knocking at the door  open atoua i said  she rose and did my bidding and a woman entered clad in grecian robes it was charmion still beautiful as of old but sad faced now and very sweet to see with a patient fire slumbering in her downcast eyes  she entered unattended and speaking no word the old wife pointed to where i sat and went  old man she said addressing me lead me to the learned olympus i come upon the queens business  i rose and lifting my head looked upon her  she gazed and gave a little cry  surely she whispered glancing round surely thou art not that and she paused  that harmachis whom once thy foolish heart did love o charmion yes i am he and what thou seest most fair lady yet is harmachis dead whom thou didst love but olympus the skilled egyptian waits upon thy words  cease she said and of the past but one word and thenwhy let it lie not well with all thy wisdom canst thou know a true womans heart if thou dost believe harmachis that it can change with the changes of the outer form for then assuredly could no love follow its beloved to that last place of changethe grave know thou learned physician i am of that sort who loving once love always and being not beloved again go virgin to the death  she ceased and having naught to say i bowed my head in answer yet though i said nothing and though this womans passionate folly had been the cause of all our ruin to speak truth in secret i was thankful to her who wooed of all and living in this shameless court had still through the long years poured out her unreturned love upon an outcast and who when that poor broken slave of fortune came back in such unlovely guise held him yet dear at heart for what man is there who does not prize that gift most rare and beautiful that one perfect thing which no gold can buya womans unfeigned love  i thank thee that thou dost not answer she said for the bitter words which thou didst pour upon me in those days that long are dead and far away in tarsus have not lost their poisonous sting and in my heart is no more place for the arrows of thy scorn new venomed through thy solitary years so let it be behold i put it from me that wild passion of my soul and she looked up and stretched out her hands as though to press some unseen presence back i put it from methough forget it i may not there tis done harmachis no more shall my love trouble thee enough for me that once more my eyes behold thee before sleep seals thee from their sight dost remember how when i would have died by thy dear hand thou wouldst not slay but didst bid me live to pluck the bitter fruit of crime and be accursed by visions of the evil i had wrought and memories of thee whom i have ruined  ay charmion i remember well  surely the cup of punishment has been filled oh couldst thou see into the record of my heart and read in it the suffering that i have borneborne with a smiling facethy justice would be satisfied indeed  and yet if report be true charmion thou art the first of all the court and therein the most powerful and beloved does not octavianus give it out that he makes war not on antony nor even on his mistress cleopatra but on charmion and iras  yes harmachis and think that it has been to me thus because of my oath to thee to be forced to eat the bread and do the tasks of one whom so bitterly i hateone who robbed me of thee and who through the workings of my jealousy brought me to be that which i am brought thee to shame and all egypt to its ruin can jewels and riches and the flattery of princes and nobles bring happiness to such a one as i who am more wretched than the meanest scullion wench oh i have often wept till i was blind and then when the hour came i must arise and tire me and with a smile go do the bidding of the queen and that heavy antony may the gods grant me to see them deaday the twain of themthen myself i shall be content to die thy lot has been hard harmachis but at least thou have been free and many is the time that i have envied thee the quiet of thy haunted cave  i do perceive o charmion that thou art mindful of thy oaths and it is well for the hour of vengeance is at hand  i am mindful and in all things i have worked for thee in secretfor thee and for the utter ruin of cleopatra and the roman i have fanned his passion and her jealousy i have egged her on to wickedness and him to folly and of all have i caused report to be brought to cæsar listen thus stands the matter thou knowest how went the fight at actium thither went cleopatra with her fleet sorely against the will of antony but as thou sentest me word i entreated him for the queen vowing to him with tears that did he leave her she would die of grief and he poor slave believed me and so she went and in the thick of the fight for what cause i know not though perchance thou knowest harmachis she made signal to her squadron and putting about fled from the battle sailing for peloponnesus and now mark the end when antony saw that she was gone he in his madness took a galley and deserting all followed hard after her leaving his fleet to be shattered and sunk and his great army in greece of twenty legions and twelve thousand horse without a leader and all this no man would believe that antony the smitten of the gods had fallen so deep in shame therefore for a while the army tarried and but now tonight comes news brought by canidius the general that worn with doubt and being at length sure that antony had deserted them the whole of his great force has yielded to cæsar  and where then is antony  he has built him a habitation on a little isle in the great harbour and named it timonium because forsooth like timon he cries out at the ingratitude of mankind that has forsaken him and there he lies smitten by a fever of the mind and thither thou must go at dawn so wills the queen to cure him of his ills and draw him to her arms for he will not see her nor knows he yet the full measure of his woe but first my bidding is to lead thee instantly to cleopatra who would ask thy counsel  i come i answered rising lead thou on  and so we passed the palace gates and along the alabaster hall and presently once again i stood before the door of cleopatras chamber and once again charmion left me to warn her of my coming  presently she came back and beckoned to me make strong thy heart she whispered and see that thou dost not betray thyself for still are the eyes of cleopatra keen enter  keen indeed must they be to find harmachis in the learned olympus had i not willed it thyself thou hadst not known me charmion i made answer  then i entered that remembered place and listened once more to the plash of the fountain the song of the nightingale and the murmur of the summer sea with bowed head and halting gait i came till at length i stood before the couch of cleopatrathat same golden couch on which she had sat the night she overcame me then i gathered my strength and looked up there before me was cleopatra glorious as of old but oh how changed since that night when i saw antony clasp her in his arms at tarsus her beauty still clothed her like a garment the eyes were yet deep and unfathomable as the blue sea the face still splendid in its great loveliness and yet all was changed time that could not touch her charms had stamped upon her presence such a look of weary grief as may not be written passion beating ever in that fierce heart of hers had written his record on her brow and in her eyes shone the sad lights of sorrow  i bowed low before this most royal woman who once had been my love and destruction and yet knew me not  she looked up wearily and spoke in her slow well remembered voice  so thou art come at length physician how callest thou thyselfolympus tis a name of promise for surely now that the gods of egypt have deserted us we do need aid from olympus well thou hast a learned air for learning does not with beauty strange too there is that about thee which recalls what i know not say olympus have we met before  never o queen have my eyes fallen on thee in the body i answered in a feigned voice never till this hour when i come forth from my solitude to do thy bidding and cure thee of thy ills  strange and even in the voicepshaw tis some memory that i cannot catch in the body thou sayest then perchance i knew thee in a dream  ay o queen we have met in dreams  thou art a strange man who talkest thus but if what i hear be true one well learned and indeed i mind me of thy counsel when thou didst bid me join my lord antony in syria and how things befell according to thy word skilled must thou be in the casting of nativities and in the law of auguries of which these alexandrian fools have little knowledge once i knew such another man one harmachis and she sighed but he is long deadas i would i were alsoand at times i sorrow for him  she paused while i sank my head upon my breast and stood silent  interpret me this olympus in the battle at that accursed actium just as the fight raged thickest and victory began to smile upon us a great terror seized my heart and thick darkness seemed to fall before my eyes while in my ears a voice ay the voice of that long dead harmachis cried fly fly or perish and i fled but from my heart the terror leapt to the heart of antony and he followed after me and thus was the battle lost say then what god brought this evil thing about  nay o queen i answered it was no godfor wherein hast thou angered the gods of egypt hast thou robbed the temples of their faith hast thou betrayed the trust of egypt having done none of these things how then can the gods of egypt be wroth with thee fear not it was nothing but some natural vapour of the mind that overcame thy gentle soul made sick with the sight and sound of slaughter and as for the noble antony where thou didst go needs must that he should follow  and as i spoke cleopatra turned white and trembled glancing at me the while to find my meaning but i well knew that the thing was of the avenging gods working through me their instrument  learned olympus she said not answering my words my lord antony is sick and crazed with grief like some poor hunted slave he hides himself in yonder seagirt tower and shuns mankindyes he shuns even me who for his sake endure so many woes now this is my bidding to thee tomorrow at the coming of the light do thou led by charmion my waitinglady take boat and row thee to the tower and there crave entry saying that ye bring tidings from the army then he will cause you to be let in and thou charmion must break this heavy news that canidius bears for canidius himself i dare not send and when his grief is past do thou olympus soothe his fevered frame with thy draughts of value and his soul with honeyed words and draw him back to me and all will yet be well do thou this and thou shalt have gifts more than thou canst count for i am yet a queen and yet can pay back those who serve my will  fear not o queen i answered this thing shall be done and i ask no reward who have come hither to do thy bidding to the end  so i bowed and went and summoning atoua made ready a certain potion    chapter v  of the drawing forth of antony from the timonium back to cleopatra of the feast made by cleopatra and of the manner of the death of eudosius the steward  ere it was yet dawn charmion came again and we walked to the private harbour of the palace there taking boat we rowed to the island mount on which stands the timonium a vaulted tower strong small and round and having landed we twain came to the door and knocked till at length a grating was thrown open in the door and an aged eunuch looking forth roughly asked our business  our business is with the lord antony said charmion  then it is no business for antony my master sees neither man nor woman  yet will he see us for we bring tidings go tell him that the lady charmion brings tidings from the army  the man went and presently returned  the lord antony would know if the tidings be good or ill for if ill then will he none of it for with evil tidings he has been overfed of late  whywhy it is both good and ill open slave i will make answer to thy master and she slipped a purse of gold through the bars  well well he grumbled as he took the purse the times are hard and likely to be harder for when the lions down who will feed the jackal give thy news thyself and if it do but draw the noble antony out of this hall of groans i care not what it be now the palace door is open and theres the road to the banquetingchamber  we passed on to find ourselves in a narrow passage and leaving the eunuch to bar the door advanced till we came to a curtain through this entrance we went and found ourselves in a vaulted chamber illlighted from the roof on the further side of this rude chamber was a bed of rugs and on them crouched the figure of a man his face hidden in the folds of his toga  most noble antony said charmion drawing near unwrap thy face and hearken to me for i bring thee tidings  then he lifted up his head his face was marred by sorrow his tangled hair grizzled with years hung about his hollow eyes and white on his chin was the stubble of an unshaven beard his robe was squalid and his aspect more wretched than that of the poorest beggar at the temple gates to this then had the love of cleopatra brought the glorious and renowned antony aforetime master of half the world  what will ye with me lady he asked who would perish here alone and who is this man who comes to gaze on fallen and forsaken antony  this is olympus noble antony that wise physician the skilled in auguries of whom thou hast heard much and whom cleopatra ever mindful of thy welfare though but little thou dost think of hers has sent to minister to thee  and can thy physician minister to a grief such as my grief can his drugs give me back my galleys my honour and my peace nay away with thy physician what are thy tidingsquickout with it hath canidius perchance conquered cæsar tell me but that and thou shalt have a province for thy guerdonay and if octavianus be dead twenty thousand sestertia to fill its treasury speaknayspeak not i fear the opening of thy lips as never i feared an earthly thing surely the wheel of fortune has gone round and canidius has conquered is it not so nayout with it i can no more  o noble antony she said steel thy heart to hear that which i needs must tell thee canidius is in alexandria he has fled far and fast and this is his report for seven whole days did the legions wait the coming of antony to lead them to victory as aforetime putting aside the offers of the envoys of cæsar but antony came not and then it was rumoured that antony had fled to tænarus drawn thither by cleopatra the man who first brought that tale to the camp the legionaries cried shame onay and beat him to the death but ever it grew until at length there was no more room to doubt and then o antony thy officers slipped one by one away to cæsar and where the officers go there the men follow nor is this all the story for thy alliesbocchus of africa tarcondimotus of cilicia mithridates of commagene adallas of thrace philadelphus of paphlagonia archelaus of cappadocia herod of judæa amyntas of galatia polemon of pontus and malchus of arabiaall all have fled or bid their generals fly back to whence they came and already their ambassadors crave cold cæsars clemency  hast done thy croakings thou raven in a peacocks dress or is there more to come asked the smitten man lifting his white and trembling face from the shelter of his hands tell me more say that egypts dead in all her beauty say that octavianus lowers at the canopic gate and that headed by dead cicero all the ghosts of hell do audibly shriek out the fall of antony yea gather up every woe that can oerwhelm those who once were great and loose them on the hoary head of him whomin thy gentlenessthou art still pleased to name the noble antony  nay my lord i have done  ay and so have i donedone quite done it is altogether finished and thus i seal the end and snatching a sword from the couch he would indeed have slain himself had i not sprung forward and grasped his hand for it was not my purpose that he should die as yet since had he died at that hour cleopatra had made her peace with cæsar who rather wished the death of antony than the ruin of egypt  art mad antony art indeed a coward cried charmion that thou wouldst thus escape thy woes and leave thy partner to face the sorrow out alone  why not woman why not she would not be long alone theres cæsar to keep her company octavianus loves a fair woman in his cold way and still is cleopatra fair come now thou olympus thou hast held my hand from dealing death upon myself advise me of thy wisdom shall i then submit myself to cæsar and i triumvir twice consul and aforetime absolute monarch of all the east endure to follow in his triumph along those roman ways where i myself have passed in triumph  nay sire i answered if thou dost yield then art thou doomed all last night i questioned of the fates concerning thee and i saw this when thy star draws near to cæsars it pales and is swallowed up but when it passes from his radiance then bright and big it shines equal in glory to his own all is not lost and while some part remains everything may be regained egypt can yet be held armies can still be raised cæsar has withdrawn himself he is not yet at the gates of alexandria and perchance may be appeased thy mind in its fever has fired thy body thou art sick and canst not judge aright see here i have a potion that shall make thee whole for i am well skilled in the art of medicine and i held out the phial  a potion thou sayest man he cried more like it is a poison and thou a murderer sent by false egypt who would fain be rid of me now that i may no more be of service to her the head of antony is the peace offering she would send to cæsarshe for whom i have lost all give me thy draught by bacchus i will drink it though it be the very elixir of death  nay noble antony it is no poison and i am no murderer see i will taste it if thou wilt and i held forth the subtle drink that has the power to fire the veins of men  give it me physician desperate men are brave men therewhy what is this yours is a magic draught my sorrows seem to roll away like thunderclouds before the southern gale and the spring of hope blooms fresh upon the desert of my heart once more i am antony and once again i see my legions spears asparkle in the sun and hear the thunderous shout of welcome as antonybeloved antonyrides in pomp of war along his deepformed lines theres hope theres hope i may yet see the cold brows of cæsarthat cæsar who never errs except from policyrobbed of their victor bays and crowned with shameful dust  ay cried charmion there still is hope if thou wilt but play the man o my lord come back with us come back to the loving arms of cleopatra all night she lies upon her golden bed and fills the hollow darkness with her groans for antony who enamoured now of grief forgets his duty and his love  i come i come shame upon me that i dared to doubt her slave bring water and a purple robe not thus can i be seen of cleopatra even now i come    in this fashion then did we draw antony back to cleopatra that the ruin of the twain might be made sure    we led him up the alabaster hall and into cleopatras chamber where she lay her cloudy hair about her face and breast and tears flowing from her deep eyes  o egypt he cried behold me at thy feet  she sprang from the couch and art thou here my love she murmured then once again are all things well come near and in these arms forget thy sorrows and turn my grief to joy oh antony while love is left to us still have we all  and she fell upon his breast and kissed him wildly    that same day charmion came to me and bade me prepare a poison of the most deadly power and this at first i would not do fearing that cleopatra would therewith make an end of antony before his time but charmion showed me that this was not so and told me also for what purpose was the poison therefore i summoned atoua the skilled in simples and all that afternoon we laboured at the deadly work and when it was done charmion came once more bearing with her a chaplet of fresh roses that she bade me steep in the poison  this then i did  that night at the great feast of cleopatra i sat near antony who was at her side and wore the poisoned wreath now as the feast went on the wine flowed fast till antony and the queen grew merry and she told him of her plans and of how even now her galleys were being drawn by the canal that leads from bubastis on the pelusiac branch of the nile to clysma at the head of the bay of heroopolis for it was her design should cæsar prove stubborn to fly with antony and her treasure down the arabian gulf where cæsar had no fleet and seek some new home in india whither her foes might not follow but indeed this plan came to nothing for the arabs of petra burnt the galleys incited thereto by a message sent by the jews of alexandria who hated cleopatra and were hated of her for i caused the jews to be warned of what was being done  now when she had made an end of telling him the queen called on him to drink a cup with her to the success of this new scheme bidding him as she did so steep his wreath of roses in the wine and make the draught more sweet this then he did and it being done she pledged him but when he was about to pledge her back she caught his hand crying hold whereat he paused wondering  now among the servants of cleopatra was one eudosius a steward and this eudosius seeing that the fortunes of cleopatra were at an end had laid a plan to fly that very night to cæsar as many of his betters had done taking with him all the treasure in the palace that he could steal but this design being discovered to cleopatra she determined to be avenged upon eudosius  eudosius she cried for the man stood near come hither thou faithful servant seest thou this man most noble antony through all our troubles he has clung to us and been of comfort to us now therefore he shall be rewarded according to his deserts and the measure of his faithfulness and that from thine own hand give him thy golden cup of wine and let him drink a pledge to our success the cup shall be his guerdon  and still wondering antony gave it to the man who stricken in his guilty mind took it and stood trembling but he drank not  drink thou slave drink cried cleopatra half rising from her seat and flashing a fierce look on his white face by serapis so surely as i yet shall sit in the capitol at rome if thou dost thus flout the lord antony ill have thee scourged to the bones and the red wine poured upon thy open wounds to heal them ah at length thou drinkest why what is it good eudosius art sick surely then this wine must be as the water of jealousy of those jews that has power to slay the false and strengthen the honest only go some of you search this mans room methinks he is a traitor  meanwhile the man stood his hands to his head presently he began to tremble and then fell clutching at his bosom as though to tear out the fire in his heart he staggered with livid twisted face and foaming lips to where cleopatra lay watching him with a slow and cruel smile  ah traitor thou hast it now she said prithee is death sweet  thou wanton yelled the dying man thou hast poisoned me thus mayst thou also perish and with one shriek he flung himself upon her she saw his purpose and swift and supple as a tiger sprang to one side so that he did but grasp her royal cloak tearing it from its emerald clasp down he fell upon the ground rolling over and over in the purple chiton till presently he lay still and dead his tormented face and frozen eyes peering ghastly from its folds  ah said the queen with a hard laugh the slave died wondrous hard and fain would have drawn me with him see he has borrowed my garment for a pall take him away and bury him in his livery  what means cleopatra said antony as the guards dragged the corpse away the man drank of my cup what is the purpose of this most sorry jest  it serves a double end noble antony this very night that man would have fled to octavianus bearing of our treasure with him well i have lent him wings for the dead fly fast also this thou didst fear that i should poison thee my lord nay i know it see now antony how easy it were that i should slay thee if i had the will that wreath of roses which thou didst steep within the cup is dewed with deadly bane had i then a mind to make an end of thee i had not stayed thy hand o antony henceforth trust me sooner would i slay myself than harm one hair of thy beloved head see here come my messengers speak what did ye find  royal egypt we found this all things in the chamber of eudosius are made ready for flight and in his baggage is much treasure  thou hearest she said smiling darkly think ye my loyal servants all that cleopatra is one with whom it is well to play the traitor be warned by this romans fate    then a great silence of fear fell upon the company and antony sat also silent    chapter vi  of the workings of the learned olympus at memphis of the poisonings of cleopatra of the speech of antony to his captains and of the passing of isis from the land of khem  now i harmachis must make speed with my task setting down that which is permitted as shortly as may be and leaving much untold for of this i am warned that doom draws on and my days are wellnigh sped after the drawing forth of antony from the timonium came that time of heavy quiet which heralds the rising of the desert wind antony and cleopatra once again gave themselves up to luxury and night by night feasted in splendour at the palace they sent ambassadors to cæsar but cæsar would have none of them and this hope being gone they turned their minds to the defence of alexandria men were gathered ships were built and a great force was made ready against the coming of cæsar  and now aided by charmion i began my last work of hate and vengeance i wormed myself deep into the secrets of the palace counselling all things for evil i bade cleopatra keep antony gay lest he should brood upon his sorrows and thus she sapped his strength and energy with luxury and wine i gave him of my draughtsdraughts that sank his soul in dreams of happiness and power leaving him to wake to a heavier misery soon without my healing medicine he could not sleep and thus being ever at his side i bound his weakened will to mine till at last he would do little if i said not it is well cleopatra also grown very superstitious leaned much upon me for i prophesied falsely to her in secret  moreover i wove other webs my fame was great throughout egypt for during the long years that i had dwelt in tápé it had spread through all the land therefore many men of note came to me both for their healths sake and because it was known that i had the ear of antony and the queen and in these days of doubt and trouble they were fain to learn the truth all these men i worked upon with doubtful words sapping their loyalty and i caused many to fall away and yet none could bear an evil report of what i had said also cleopatra sent me to memphis there to move the priests and governors that they should gather men in upper egypt for the defence of alexandria and i went and spoke to the priests with such a double meaning and with so much wisdom that they knew me to be one of the initiated in the deeper mysteries but how i olympus the physician came thus to be initiated none might say and afterwards they sought me secretly and i gave them the holy sign of brotherhood and thereunder bade them not to ask who i might be but send no aid to cleopatra rather i said must they make peace with cæsar for by cæsars grace only could the worship of the gods endure in khem so having taken counsel of the holy apis they promised in public to give help to cleopatra but in secret sent an embassy to cæsar  thus then it came to pass that egypt gave but little aid to its hated macedonian queen thence from memphis i came once more to alexandria and having made favourable report continued my secret work and indeed the alexandrians could not easily be stirred for as they say in the marketplace the ass looks at its burden and is blind to its master cleopatra had oppressed them so long that the roman was like a welcome friend  thus the time passed on and every night found cleopatra with fewer friends than that which had gone before for in evil days friends fly like swallows before the frost yet she would not give up antony whom she loved though to my knowledge cæsar by his freedman thyreus made promise to her of her dominions for herself and for her children if she would but slay antony or even betray him bound but to this her womans heartfor still she had a heartwould not consent and moreover we counselled her against it for of necessity we must hold him to her lest antony escaping or being slain cleopatra might ride out the storm and yet be queen of egypt and this grieved me because antony though weak was still a brave man and a great and moreover in my own heart i read the lesson of his woes for were we not akin in wretchedness had not the same woman robbed us of empire friends and honour but pity has no place in politics nor could it turn my feet from the path of vengeance it was ordained that i should tread cæsar drew nigh pelusium fell the end was at hand it was charmion who brought the tidings to the queen and antony as they slept in the heat of the day and i came with her  awake she cried awake this is no time for sleep seleucus hath surrendered pelusium to cæsar who marches straight on alexandria  with a great oath antony sprang up and clutched cleopatra by the arm  thou hast betrayed meby the gods i swear it now thou shalt pay the price and snatching up his sword he drew it  stay thy hand antony she cried it is falsei know naught of this and she sprang upon him and clung about his neck weeping i know naught my lord take thou the wife of seleucus and his little children whom i hold in guard and avenge thyself o antony antony why dost thou doubt me  then antony threw down his sword upon the marble and casting himself upon the couch hid his face and groaned in bitterness of spirit  but charmion smiled for it was she who had sent secretly to seleucus her friend counselling him to surrender forthwith saying that no fight would be made at alexandria and that very night cleopatra took all her great store of pearls and emeraldsthose that remained of the treasure of menkauraall her wealth of gold ebony ivory and cinnamon treasure without price and placed it in the mausoleum of granite which after our egyptian fashion she had built upon the hill that is by the temple of the holy isis these riches she piled up upon a bed of flax that when she fired it all might perish in the flame and escape the greed of moneyloving octavianus and she slept henceforth in this tomb away from antony but in the daytime she still saw him at the palace  but a little while after when cæsar with all his great force had already crossed the caponic mouth of the nile and was hard on alexandria i came to the palace whither cleopatra had summoned me there i found her in the alabaster hall royally clad a wild light in her eyes and with her iras and charmion and before her guards and stretched here and there upon the marble bodies of dead men among whom lay one yet dying  greeting thou olympus she cried here is a sight to glad a physicians heartmen dead and men sick unto death  what doest thou o queen i said affrighted  what do i i wreak justice on these criminals and traitors and olympus i learn the ways of death i have caused six different poisons to be given to these slaves and with an attentive eye have watched their working that man and she pointed to a nubian he went mad and raved of his native deserts and his mother he thought himself a child again poor fool and bade her hold him close to her breast and save him from the darkness which drew near and that greek he shrieked and shrieking died and this he wept and prayed for pity and in the end like a coward breathed his last now note the egyptian yonder he who still lives and groans first he took the draughtthe deadliest draught of all they sworeand yet the slave so dearly loves his life he will not leave it see he yet strives to throw the poison from him twice have i given him the cup and yet he is athirst what a drunkard we have here man man knowest thou not that in death only can peace be found struggle no more but enter into rest and even as she spoke the man with a great cry gave up the spirit  there she cried at length the farce is playedaway with those slaves whom i have forced through the difficult gates of joy and she clapped her hands but when they had borne the bodies thence she drew me to her and spoke thus  olympus for all thy prophecies the end is at hand cæsar must conquer and i and my lord antony be lost now therefore the play being wellnigh done i must make ready to leave this stage of earth in such fashion as becomes a queen for this cause then i do make trial of these poisons seeing that in my person i must soon endure those agonies of death that today i give to others these drugs please me not some wrench out the soul with cruel pains and some too slowly work their end but thou art skilled in the medicines of death now do thou prepare me such a draught as shall pangless steal my life away  and as i listened the sense of triumph filled my bitter heart for i knew now that by my own hand should this ruined woman die and the justice of the gods be done  spoken like a queen o cleopatra i said death shall cure thy ills and i will brew such a wine as shall draw him down a sudden friend and sink thee in a sea of slumber whence upon this earth thou shalt never wake again oh fear not death death is thy hope and surely thou shalt pass sinless and pure of heart into the dreadful presence of the gods  she trembled and if the heart be not altogether pure tell methou dark manwhat then nay i fear not the gods for if the gods of hell be men there i shall queen it also at the least having once been royal royal i shall ever be  and as she spoke suddenly from the palace gates came a great clamour and the noise of joyful shouting  why what is this she said springing from her couch  antony antony rose the cry antony hath conquered  she turned swiftly and ran her long hair streaming on the wind i followed her more slowly down the great hall across the courtyards to the palace gates and here she met antony riding through them radiant with smiles and clad in his roman armour when he saw her he leapt to the ground and all armed as he was clasped her to his breast  what is it she cried is cæsar fallen  nay not altogether fallen egypt but we have beat his horsemen back to their trenches and like the beginning so shall be the end for as they say here where the head goes the tail will follow moreover cæsar has my challenge and if he will but meet me hand to hand the world shall soon see which is the better man antony or octavian and even as he spoke and the people cheered there came the cry of a messenger from cæsar  the herald entered and bowing low gave a writing to antony bowed again and went cleopatra snatched it from his hand broke the silk and read aloud  cæsar to antony greeting  this answer to thy challenge can antony find no better way of death than beneath the sword of cæsar farewell  and thereafter they cheered no more    the darkness came and before it was midnight having feasted with his friends who tonight went over his woes and tomorrow should betray him antony went forth to the gathering of the captains of the landforces and of the fleet attended by many among whom was i  when all were come together he spoke to them standing bareheaded in their midst beneath the radiance of the moon and thus he most nobly spoke  friends and companions in arms who yet cling to me and whom many a time i have led to victory hearken to me now who tomorrow may lie in the dumb dust disempired and dishonoured this is our design no longer will we hang on poised wings above the flood of war but will straightway plunge perchance thence to snatch the victors diadem or failing there to drown be now but true to me and to your honours sake and you may still sit the most proud of men at my right hand in the capitol of rome fail me now and the cause of antony is lost and so are ye tomorrows battle must be hazardous indeed but we have stood many a time and faced a fiercer peril and ere the sun had sunk once more have driven armies like desert sands before our gale of valour and counted the spoil of hostile kings what have we to fear though allies be fled still is our array as strong as cæsars and show we but as high a heart why i swear to you upon my princely word tomorrow night i shall deck yonder canopic gate with the heads of octavian and his captains  ay cheer and cheer again i love that martial music which swells not as from the indifferent lips of clarions now neath the breath of antony and now of cæsar but rather out of the single hearts of men who love me yetand now i will speak low as we do speak oer the bier of some beloved deadyet if fortune should rise against me and if borne down by the weight of arms antony the soldier dies a soldiers death leaving you to mourn him who ever was your friend this is my will that after our rough fashion of the camp i here declare to you you know where all my treasure lies take it most dear friends and in the memory of antony make just division then go to cæsar and speak thus antony the dead to cæsar the living sends greeting and in the name of ancient fellowship and of many a peril dared craves this boon the safety of those who clung to him and that which he hath given them  nay let not my tearsfor i must weepoverflow your eyes why it is not manly tis most womanish all men must die and death were welcome were it not so lone should i fall i leave my children to your tender careif perchance it may avail to save them from the fate of helplessness soldiers enough tomorrow at the dawn we spring on cæsars throat both by land and sea swear that ye will cling to me even to the last issue  we swear they cried noble antony we swear  it is well once more my star grows bright tomorrow set in the highest heaven it yet may shine the lamp of cæsar down till then farewell  he turned to go as he went they caught his hand and kissed it and so deeply were they moved that many wept like children nor could antony master his grief for in the moonlight i saw tears roll down his furrowed cheeks and fall upon that mighty breast  and seeing all this i was much troubled for i well knew that if these men held firm to antony all might yet go well for cleopatra and though i bore no illwill against antony yet he must fall and in that fall drag down the woman who like some poisonous plant had twined herself about his giant strength till it choked and mouldered in her embrace  therefore when antony went i went not but stood back in the shadow watching the faces of the lords and captains as they spoke together  then it is agreed said he who should lead the fleet and this we swear to one and all that we will cling to noble antony to the last extremity of fortune  ay ay they answered  ay ay i said speaking from the shadow cling and die  they turned fiercely and seized me  who is he quoth one  tis that darkfaced dog olympus cried another olympus the magician  olympus the traitor growled another put an end to him and his magic and he drew his sword  ay slay him he would betray the lord antony whom he is paid to doctor  hold a while i said in a slow and solemn voice and beware how ye try to murder the servant of the gods i am no traitor for myself i abide the event here in alexandria but to you i say flee flee to cæsar i serve antony and the queeni serve them truly but above all i serve the holy gods and what they make known to me that lords i do know and i know this that antony is doomed and cleopatra is doomed for cæsar conquers therefore because i honour you noble gentlemen and think with pity on your wives left widowed and your little fatherless children that shall if ye hold to antony be sold as slavestherefore i say cling to antony if ye will and die or flee to cæsar and be saved and this i say because it is so ordained of the gods  the gods they growled what gods slit the traitors throat and stop his illomened talk  let him show us a sign from his gods or let him die i do mistrust this man said another  stand back ye fools i cried stand backfree mine armsand i will show you a sign and there was that in my face which frightened them for they freed me and stood back then i lifted up my hands and putting out all my strength of soul searched the depths of space till my spirit communed with the spirit of my mother isis only the word of power i uttered not as i had been bidden and the holy mystery of the goddess answered to my spirits cry falling in awful silence upon the face of the earth deeper and deeper grew the terrible silence even the dogs ceased to howl and in the city men stood still afeared then from far away there came the ghostly music of the sistra faint it was at first but ever as it came it grew more loud till the air shivered with the unearthly sound of terror i said naught but pointed with my hand toward the sky and behold bosomed upon the air floated a vast veiled shape that heralded by the swelling music of the sistra drew slowly near till its shadow lay upon us it came it passed it went toward the camp of cæsar till at length the music died away and the awful shape was swallowed in the night  it is bacchus cried one bacchus who leaves lost antony and as he spoke there rose a groan of terror from all the camp  but i knew that it was not bacchus the false god but the divine isis who deserted khem and passing over the edge of the world sought her home in space to be no more known of men for though her worship is still upheld though still she is here and in all earths isis manifests herself no more in egypt i hid my face and prayed but when i lifted it from my robe lo all had fled and i was alone    chapter vii  of the surrender of the troops and fleet of antony before the canopic gate of the end of antony and of the brewing of the draught of death  on the morrow at dawn antony came forth and gave command that his fleet should advance against the fleet of cæsar and that his cavalry should open the landbattle with the cavalry of cæsar accordingly the fleet advanced in a triple line and the fleet of cæsar came out to meet it but when they met the galleys of antony lifted their oars in greeting and passed over to the galleys of cæsar and they sailed away together and the cavalry of antony rode forth beyond the hippodrome to charge the cavalry of cæsar but when they met they lowered their swords and passed over to the camp of cæsar deserting antony then antony grew mad with rage and terrible to see he shouted to his legions to stand firm and wait attack and for a little while they stood one man howeverthat same officer who would have slain me on the yesternightstrove to fly but antony seized him with his own hand threw him to the earth and springing from his horse drew his sword to slay him he held his sword on high while the man covering his face awaited death but antony dropped his sword and bade him rise  go he said go to cæsar and prosper i did love thee once why then among so many traitors should i single thee out for death  the man rose and looked upon him sorrowfully then shame overwhelming him with a great cry he tore open his shirt of mail plunged his sword into his own heart and fell down dead antony stood and gazed at him but he said never a word meanwhile the ranks of cæsars legions drew near and so soon as they crossed spears the legions of antony turned and fled then the soldiers of cæsar stood still mocking them but scarce a man was slain for they pursued not  fly lord antony fly cried eros his servant who alone with me stayed by him fly ere thou art dragged a prisoner to cæsar  so he turned and fled groaning heavily i went with him and as we rode through the canopic gate where many folk stood wondering antony spoke to me  go thou olympus go to the queen and say antony sends greeting to cleopatra who hath betrayed him to cleopatra he sends greeting and farewell  and so i went to the tomb but antony fled to the palace when i came to the tomb i knocked upon the door and charmion looked forth from the window  open i cried and she opened  what news harmachis she whispered  charmion i said the end is at hand antony is fled  it is well she answered i am aweary  and there on her golden bed sat cleopatra  speak man she cried  antony has fled his forces are fled cæsar draws near to cleopatra the great antony sends greeting and farewell greeting to cleopatra who betrayed him and farewell  it is a lie she screamed i betrayed him not thou olympus go swiftly to antony and answer thus to antony cleopatra who hath not betrayed him sends greeting and farewell cleopatra is no more  and so i went following out my purpose in the alabaster hall i found antony pacing to and fro tossing his hands toward heaven and with him eros for of all his servants eros alone remained by this fallen man  lord antony i said egypt bids thee farewell egypt is dead by her own hand  dead dead he whispered and is egypt dead and is that form of glory now food for worms oh what a woman was this een now my heart goes out towards her and shall she outdo me at the last i who have been so great shall i become so small that a woman can overtop my courage and pass where i fear to follow eros thou hast loved me from a boymindest thou how i found thee starving in the desert and made thee rich giving thee place and wealth come now pay me back draw that sword thou wearest and make an end of the woes of antony  oh sire cried the greek i cannot how can i take away the life of godlike antony  answer me not eros but in the last extreme of fate this i charge thee do thou my bidding or begone and leave me quite alone no more will i see thy face thou unfaithful servant  then eros drew his sword and antony knelt before him and bared his breast turning his eyes to heaven but eros crying i cannot oh i cannot plunged the sword to his own heart and fell dead  antony rose and gazed upon him why eros that was nobly done he said thou art greater than i yet i have learned thy lesson and he knelt down and kissed him  then rising of a sudden he drew the sword from the heart of eros plunged it into his bowels and fell groaning on the couch  o thou olympus he cried this pain is more than i can bear make an end of me olympus  but pity stirred me and i could not do this thing  therefore i drew the sword from his vitals staunched the flow of blood and calling to those who came crowding in to see antony die i bade them summon atoua from my house at the palace gates presently she came bringing with her simples and lifegiving draughts these i gave to antony and bade atoua go with such speed as her old limbs might to cleopatra in the tomb and tell her of the state of antony  so she went and after a while returned saying that the queen yet lived and summoned antony to die in her arms and with her came diomedes when antony heard his ebbing strength came back for he was fain to look upon cleopatras face again so i called to the slaveswho peeped and peered through curtains and from behind pillars to see this great man dieand together with much toil we bore him thence till we came to the foot of the mausoleum  but cleopatra being afraid of treachery would no more throw wide the door so she let down a rope from the window and we made it fast beneath the arms of antony then did cleopatra who the while wept most bitterly together with charmion and iras the greek pull on the rope with all their strength while we lifted from below till the dying antony swung in the air groaning heavily and the blood dropped from his gaping wound twice he nearly fell to earth but cleopatra striving with the strength of love and of despair held him till at length she drew him through the windowplace while all who saw the dreadful sight wept bitterly and beat their breastsall save myself and charmion  when he was in once more the rope was let down and with some aid from charmion i climbed into the tomb drawing up the rope after me there i found antony laid upon the golden bed of cleopatra and she her breast bare her face stained with tears and her hair streaming wildly about him knelt at his side and kissed him wiping the blood from his wounds with her robes and hair and let all my shame be written as i stood and watched her the old love awoke once more within me and mad jealousy raged in my heart becausethough i could destroy these twaini could not destroy their love  o antony my sweet my husband and my god she moaned cruel antony hast thou the heart to die and leave me to my lonely shame i will follow thee swiftly to the grave antony awake awake  he lifted up his head and called for wine which i gave him mixing therein a draught that might allay his pain for it was great and when he had drunk he bade cleopatra lie down on the bed beside him and put her arms about him and this she did then was antony once more a man for forgetting his own misery and pain he counselled her as to her own safety but to this talk she would not listen  the hour is short she said let us speak of this great love of ours that hath been so long and may yet endure beyond the coasts of death mindest thou that night when first thou didst put thine arms about me and call me love oh happy happy night having known that night it is well to have livedeven to this bitter end  ay egypt i mind it well and dwell upon its memory though from that hour fortune has fled from melost in my depth of love for thee thou beautiful i mind it he gasped then didst thou drink the pearl in wanton play and then did that astrologer of thine call out his hourthe hour of the coming of the curse of menkaura through all the afterdays those words have haunted me and now at the last they ring in my ears  he is long dead my love she whispered  if he be dead then i am near him what meant he  he is dead the accursed manno more of him oh turn and kiss me for thy face grows white the end is near  he kissed her on the lips and for a little while so they stayed to the moment of death babbling their passion in each others ears like lovers newly wed even to my jealous heart it was a strange and awful thing to see    presently i saw the change of death gather on his face his head fell back  farewell egypt farewelli die  cleopatra lifted herself upon her hands gazed wildly on his ashen face and then with a great cry she sank back swooning    but antony yet lived though the power of speech had left him then i drew near and kneeling made pretence to minister to him and as i ministered i whispered in his ear  antony i whispered cleopatra was my love before she passed from me to thee i am harmachis that astrologer who stood behind thy couch at tarsus and i have been the chief minister of thy ruin  die antonythe curse of menkaura hath fallen  he raised himself and stared upon my face he could not speak but gibbering he pointed at me then with a groan his spirit fled  thus did i accomplish my revenge upon roman antony the worldloser    thereafter we recovered cleopatra from her swoon for not yet was i minded that she should die and taking the body of antony cæsar permitting i and atoua caused it to be most skilfully embalmed after our egyptian fashion covering the face with a mask of gold fashioned like to the features of antony also i wrote upon his breast his name and titles and painted his name and the name of his father within his inner coffin and drew the form of the holy nout folding her wings about him  then with great pomp cleopatra laid him in that sepulchre which had been made ready and in a sarcophagus of alabaster now this sarcophagus was fashioned so large that place was left in it for a second coffin for cleopatra would lie by antony at the last  these things then happened and but a little while after i learned tidings from one cornelius dolabella a noble roman who waited upon cæsar and moved by the beauty that swayed the souls of all who looked upon her had pity for the woes of cleopatra he bade me warn herfor as her physician it was allowed me to pass in and out of the tomb where she dweltthat in three days she would be sent away to rome together with her children save cæsarion whom octavian had already slain that she might walk in the triumph of cæsar accordingly i went in and found her sitting as now she always sat plunged in a half stupor and before her that bloodstained robe with which she had staunched the wounds of antony for on this she would continually feast her eyes  see how faint they grow olympus she said lifting her sad face and pointing to the rusty stains and he so lately dead why gratitude could not fade more fast what is now thy news evil tidings is writ large in those dark eyes of thine which ever bring back to me something that still slips my mind  the news is ill o queen i answered i have this from the lips of dolabella who has it straight from cæsars secretary on the third day from now cæsar will send thee and the princes ptolemy and alexander and the princess cleopatra to rome there to feast the eyes of the roman mob and be led in triumph to that capitol where thou didst swear to set thy throne  never never she cried springing to her feet never will i walk in chains in cæsars triumph what must i do charmion tell me what i can do  and charmion rising stood before her looking at her through the long lashes of her downcast eyes  lady thou canst die she said quietly  ay of a truth i had forgotten i can die olympus hast thou the drug  nay but if the queen wills it by tomorrow morn it shall be breweda drug so swift and strong that not the gods themselves can hold him who drinks it back from sleep  let it be made ready thou master of death  i bowed and withdrew myself and all that night i and old atoua laboured at the distilling of the deadly draught at length it was done and atoua poured it into a crystal phial and held it to the light of the fire for it was white as the purest water  la la she sang in her shrill voice a drink for a queen when fifty drops of that water of my brewing have passed those red lips of hers thou wilt indeed be avenged of cleopatra o harmachis ah that i could be there to see thy ruin ruined la la it would be sweet to see  vengeance is an arrow that ofttimes falls upon the archers head i answered bethinking me of charmions saying    chapter viii  of the last supper of cleopatra of the song of charmion of the drinking of the draught of death of the revealing of harmachis of the summoning of the spirits by harmachis and of the death of cleopatra  on the morrow cleopatra having sought leave of cæsar visited the tomb of antony crying that the gods of egypt had deserted her and when she had kissed the coffin and covered it with lotusflowers she came back bathed anointed herself put on her most splendid robes and together with iras charmion and myself she supped now as she supped her spirit flared up wildly even as the sky lights up at sunset and once more she laughed and sparkled as in bygone years telling us tales of feasts which she and antony had eaten of never indeed did i see her look more beauteous than on that last fatal night of vengeance and thus her mind drew on to that supper at tarsus when she drank the pearl  strange she said strange that at the last the mind of antony should have turned back to that night among all the nights and to the saying of harmachis charmion dost thou remember harmachis the egyptian  surely o queen she answered slowly  and who then was harmachis i asked for i would learn if she sorrowed oer my memory  i will tell thee it is a strange tale and now that all is done it may well be told this harmachis was of the ancient race of the pharaohs and having indeed been crowned in secret at abydus was sent hither to alexandria to carry out a great plot that had been formed against the rule of us royal lagidæ he came and gained entry to the palace as my astrologer for he was very learned in all magicmuch as thou art olympusand a man beautiful to see now this was his plotthat he should slay me and be named pharaoh in truth it was a strong one for he had many friends in egypt and i had few and on that very night when he should carry out his purpose yea at the very hour came charmion yonder and told the plot to me saying that she had chanced upon its clue but in after daysthough i have said little thereon to thee charmioni misdoubted me much of that tale of thine for by the gods to this hour i believe that thou didst love harmachis and because he scorned thee thou didst betray him and for that cause also hast all thy days remained a maid which is a thing unnatural come charmion tell us for naught matters now at the end  charmion shivered and made answer it is true o queen i also was of the plot and because harmachis scorned me i betrayed him and because of my great love for him i have remained unwed and she glanced up at me and caught my eyes then let the modest lashes veil her own  so i thought it strange are the ways of women but little cause methinks had that harmachis to thank thee for thy love what sayest thou olympus ah and so thou also wast a traitor charmion how dangerous are the paths which monarchs tread well i forgive thee for thou hast served me faithfully since that hour  but to my tale harmachis i dared not slay lest his great party should rise in fury and cast me from the throne and now mark the issue though he must murder me in secret this harmachis loved me and something thereof i guessed i had striven a little to draw him to me for the sake of his beauty and his wit and for the love of man cleopatra never strove in vain therefore when with the dagger in his robe he came to slay me i matched my charms against his will and need i tell you being man and woman how i won oh never can i forget the look in the eyes of that fallen prince that forsworn priest that discrowned pharaoh when lost in the poppied draught i saw him sink into a shameful sleep whence he might no more wake with honour and thereaftertill in the end i wearied of him and his sad learned mind for his guilty soul forbade him to be gaya little i came to care for him though not to love but hehe who loved meclung to me as a drunkard to the cup which ruins him deeming that i should wed him he betrayed to me the secret of the hidden wealth of the pyramid of herfor at the time i much needed treasureand together we dared the terrors of the tomb and drew it forth even from dead pharaohs breast see this emerald was a part thereofand she pointed to the great scarabæus that she had drawn from the holy heart of menkaura  and because of what was written in the tomb and of that thing which we saw in the tombah pest upon it why does its memory haunt me nowand also because of policy for i would fain have won the love of the egyptians i was minded to marry this harmachis and declare his place and lineage to the worlday and by his aid hold egypt from the roman for dellius had then come to call me to antony and after much thought i determined to send him back with sharp words but on that very morning as i tired me for the court came charmion yonder and i told her this for i would see how the matter fell upon her mind now mark olympus the power of jealousy that little wedge which yet has strength to rend the tree of empire that secret sword which can carve the fate of kings this she could in no wise beardeny it charmion if thou canst for now it is clear to methat the man she loved should be given to me as husbandme whom he loved and therefore with more skill and wit than i can tell she reasoned with me showing that i should by no means do this thing but journey to antony and for that charmion i thank thee now that all is come and gone and by a very little her words weighed down my scale of judgment against harmachis and i went to antony thus it is through the jealous spleen of yonder fair charmion and the passion of a man on which i played as on a lyre that all these things have come to pass for this cause octavian sits a king in alexandria for this cause antony is discrowned and dead and for this cause i too must die tonight ah charmion charmion thou hast much to answer for thou hast changed the story of the world and yet even nowi would not have it otherwise  she paused awhile covering her eyes with her hand and looking i saw great tears upon the cheek of charmion  and of this harmachis i asked where is he now o queen  where is he in amenti forsoothmaking his peace with isis perchance at tarsus i saw antony and loved him and from that moment i loathed the sight of the egyptian and swore to make an end of him for a lover done with should be a lover dead and being jealous he spoke some words of evil omen even at that feast of the pearl and on the same night i would have slain him but before the deed was done he was gone  and whither was he gone  nay that know not i brennushe who led my guard and last year sailed north to join his own peoplebrennus swore he saw him float to the skies but in this matter i misdoubted me of brennus for methinks he loved the man nay he sank off cyprus and was drowned perchance charmion can tell us how  i can tell thee nothing o queen harmachis is lost  and well lost charmion for he was an evil man to play withay although i bettered him i say it well he served my purpose but i loved him not and even now i fear him for it seemed to me that i heard his voice summoning me to fly through the din of the fight at actium thanks be to the gods as thou sayest he is lost and can no more be found    but i listening put forth my strength and by the arts i have cast the shadow of my spirit upon the spirit of cleopatra so that she felt the presence of the lost harmachis  nay what is it she said by serapis i grow afraid it seems to me that i feel harmachis here his memory overwhelms me like a flood of waters and he these ten years dead oh at such a time it is unholy  nay o queen i answered if he be dead then he is everywhere and well at such a timethe time of thy own deathmay his spirit draw near to welcome thine at its going  speak not thus olympus i would see harmachis no more the count between us is too heavy and in another world than this more evenly perchance should we be matched ah the terror passes i was but unnerved well the fools story hath served to wile away the heaviest of our hours the hour which ends in death sing to me charmion sing for thy voice is very sweet and i would soothe my soul to sleep the memory of that harmachis has wrung me strangely sing then the last song i shall hear from those tuneful lips of thine the last of so many songs  it is a sad hour for song o queen said charmion but nevertheless she took her harp and sang and thus she sang very soft and low the dirge of the sweettongued syrian meleager       tears for my lady dead      heliodore      salt tears and strange to shed      over and oer      go tears and low lament      fare from her tomb      wend where my lady went      down through the gloom      sighs for my lady dead      tears do i send      long love remembered      mistress and friend      sad are the songs we sing      tears that we shed      empty the gifts we bring      gifts to the dead      ah for my flower my love      hades hath taken      ah for the dust above      scattered and shaken      mother of blade and grass      earth in thy breast      lull her that gentlest was      gently to rest  the music of her voice died away and it was so sweet and sad that iras began to weep and the bright tears stood in cleopatras stormy eyes only i wept not my tears were dry  tis a heavy song of thine charmion said the queen well as thou saidst it is a sad hour for song and thy dirge is fitted to the hour sing it over me once again when i lie dead charmion and now farewell to music and on to the end olympus take yonder parchment and write what i shall say  i took the parchment and the reed and wrote thus in the roman tongue  cleopatra to octavianus greeting  this is the state of life at length there comes an hour when rather than endure those burdens that overwhelm us putting off the body we would take wing into forgetfulness cæsar thou hast conquered take thou the spoils of victory but in thy triumph cleopatra cannot walk when all is lost then we must go to seek the lost thus in the desert of despair the brave do harvest resolution cleopatra hath been great as antony was great nor shall her fame be minished in the manner of her end slaves live to endure their wrong but princes treading with a firmer step pass through the gates of wrong into the royal dwellings of the dead this only doth egypt ask of cæsarthat he suffer her to lie in the tomb of antony farewell  this i wrote and having sealed the writing cleopatra bade me go find a messenger despatch it to cæsar and then return so i went and at the door of the tomb i called a soldier who was not on duty and giving him money bade him take the letter to cæsar then i went back and there in the chamber the three women stood in silence cleopatra clinging to the arm of iras and charmion a little apart watching the twain  if indeed thou art minded to make an end o queen i said the time is short for presently cæsar will send his servants in answer to thy letter and i drew forth the phial of white and deadly bane and set it upon the board  she took it in her hand and gazed thereon how innocent it seems she said and yet therein lies my death tis strange  ay queen and the death of ten other folk no need to take so long a draught  i fear she gaspedhow know i that it will slay outright i have seen so many die by poison and scarce one has died outright and someah i cannot think on them  fear not i said i am a master of my craft or if thou dost fear cast this poison forth and live in rome thou mayst still find happiness ay in rome where thou shalt walk in cæsars triumph while the laughter of the hardeyed latin women shall chime down the music of thy golden chains  nay i will die olympus oh if one would but show the path  then iras loosed her hand and stepped forward give me the draught physician she said i go to make ready for my queen  it is well i answered on thy own head be it and i poured from the phial into a little golden goblet  she raised it curtsied low to cleopatra then coming forward kissed her on the brow and charmion she also kissed this done tarrying not and making no prayer for iras was a greek she drank and putting her hand to her head instantly fell down and died  thou seest i said breaking in upon the silence it is swift  ay olympus thine is a master drug come now i thirst fill me the bowl lest iras weary in waiting at the gates  so i poured afresh into the goblet but this time making pretence to rinse the cup i mixed a little water with the bane for i was not minded that she should die before she knew me  then did the royal cleopatra taking the goblet in her hand turn her lovely eyes to heaven and cry aloud  o ye gods of egypt who have deserted me to you no longer will i pray for your ears are shut unto my crying and your eyes blind to my griefs therefore i make entreaty of that last friend whom the gods departing leave to helpless man sweep hither death whose winnowing wings enshadow all the world and give me ear draw nigh thou king of kings who with an equal hand bringest the fortunate head of one pillow with the slave and by thy spiritual breath dost waft the bubble of our life far from this hell of earth hide me where winds blow not and waters cease to roll where wars are done and cæsars legions cannot march take me to a new dominion and crown me queen of peace thou art my lord o death and in thy kiss i have conceived i am in labour of a soul seeit stands newborn upon the edge of time nownowgo life come sleep come antony  and with one glance to heaven she drank and cast the goblet to the ground    then at last came the moment of my pentup vengeance and of the vengeance of egypts outraged gods and of the falling of the curse of menkaura  whats this she cried i grow cold but i die not thou dark physician thou hast betrayed me  peace cleopatra presently shalt thou die and know the fury of the gods the curse of menkaura hath fallen it is finished look upon me woman look upon this marred face this twisted form this living mass of sorrow look look who am i  she stared upon me wildly  oh oh she shrieked throwing up her arms at last i know thee by the gods thou art harmachisharmachis risen from the dead  ay harmachis risen from the dead to drag thee down to death and agony eternal see thou cleopatra i have ruined thee as thou didst ruin me i working in the dark and helped of the angry gods have been thy secret spring of woe i filled thy heart with fear at actium i held the egyptians from thy aid i sapped the strength of antony i showed the portent of the gods unto thy captains by my hand at length thou diest for i am the instrument of vengeance ruin i pay thee back for ruin treachery for treachery death for death come hither charmion partner of my plots who betrayed me but repenting art the sharer of my triumph come watch this fallen wanton die  cleopatra heard and sank back upon the golden bed groaning and thou too charmion  a moment so she sat then her imperial spirit burnt up glorious before she died  she staggered from the bed and with arms outstretched she cursed me  oh for one hour of life she criedone short hour that therein i might make thee die in such fashion as thou canst not dream thou and that false paramour of thine who betrayed both me and thee and thou didst love me ah there i have thee still see thou subtle plotting priestand with both hands she rent back the royal robes from her bosomsee on this fair breast once night by night thy head was pillowed and thou didst sleep wrapped in these same arms now put away their memory if thou canst i read it in thine eyesthat mayst thou not no torture which i bear can in its sum draw nigh to the rage of that deep soul of thine rent with longings never never to be reached harmachis thou slave of slaves from thy triumphdepths i snatch a deeper triumph and conquered yet i conquer i spit upon theei defy theeand dying doom thee to the torment of thy deathless love o antony i come my antonyi come to thy own dear arms soon i shall find thee and wrapped in a love undying and divine together we will float through all the depths of space and lips to lips and eyes to eyes drink of desires grown more sweet with every draught or if i find thee not then i shall sink in peace down the poppied ways of sleep and for me the breast of night whereon i shall be softly cradled will yet seem thy bosom antony oh i diecome antonyand give me peace  even in my fury i had quailed beneath her scorn for home flew the arrows of her winged words alas and alas it was truethe shaft of my vengeance fell upon my own head never had i loved her as i loved her now my soul was rent with jealous torture and thus i swore she should not die  peace i cried what peace is there for thee oh ye holy three hear now my prayer osiris loosen thou the bonds of hell and send forth those whom i shall summon come ptolemy poisoned of thy sister cleopatra come arsinoë murdered in the sanctuary by thy sister cleopatra come sepa tortured to death of cleopatra come divine menkaura whose body cleopatra tore and whose curse she braved for greed come one come all who have died at the hands of cleopatra rush from the breast of nout and greet her who murdered you by the link of mystic union by the symbol of the life spirits i summon you  thus i spoke the spell while charmion affrighted clung to my robe and the dying cleopatra resting on her hands swung slowly to and fro gazing with vacant eyes  then the answer came the casement burst asunder and on flittering wings that great bat entered which last i had seen hanging to the eunuchs chin in the womb of the pyramid of her thrice it circled round once it hovered oer dead iras then flew to where the dying woman stood to her it flew on her breast it settled clinging to that emerald which was dragged from the dead heart of menkaura thrice the grey horror screamed aloud thrice it beat its bony wings and lo it was gone  then suddenly within that chamber sprang up the shapes of death there was arsinoë the beautiful even as she had shrunk beneath the butchers knife there was young ptolemy his features twisted by the poisoned cup there was the majesty of menkaura crowned with the uræus crown there was grave sepa his flesh all torn by the torturers hooks there were those poisoned slaves and there were others without number shadowy and dreadful to behold who thronging that narrow chamber stood silently fixing their glassy eyes upon the face of her who slew them    behold cleopatra i said behold thy peace and die  ay said charmion behold and die thou who didst rob me of my honour and egypt of her king    she looked she saw the awful shapesher spirit hurrying from the flesh mayhap could hear words to which my ears were deaf then her face sank in with terror her great eyes grew pale and shrieking cleopatra fell and died passing with that dread company to her appointed place    thus then i harmachis fed my soul with vengeance fulfilling the justice of the gods and yet knew myself empty of all joy therein for though that thing we worship doth bring us ruin and love being more pitiless than death we in turn do pay all our sorrow back yet we must worship on yet stretch out our arms towards our lost desire and pour our hearts blood upon the shrine of our discrowned god  for love is of the spirit and knows not death    chapter ix  of the farewell of charmion of the death of charmion of the death of the old wife atoua of the coming of harmachis to abouthis of his confession in the hall of sixandthirty pillars and of the declaring of the doom of harmachis  charmion unclasped my arm to which she had clung in terror  thy vengeance thou dark harmachis she said in a hoarse voice is a thing hideous to behold o lost egypt with all thy sins thou wast indeed a queen  come aid me prince let us stretch this poor clay upon the bed and deck it royally so that it may give its dumb audience to the messengers of cæsar as becomes the last of egypts queens  i spoke no word in answer for my heart was very heavy and now that all was done i was weary together then we lifted up the body and laid it on the golden bed charmion placed the uræus crown upon the ivory brow and combed the nightdark hair that showed never a thread of silver and for the last time shut those eyes wherein had shone all the changing glories of the sea she folded the chill hands upon the breast whence passions breath had fled and straightened the bent knees beneath the broidered robe and by the head set flowers and there at length cleopatra lay more splendid now in her cold majesty of death than in her richest hour of breathing beauty  we drew back and looked on her and on dead iras at her feet  it is done quoth charmion we are avenged and now harmachis dost follow by this same road and she nodded towards the phial on the board  nay charmion i flyi fly to a heavier death not thus easily may i end my space of earthly penance  so be it harmachis and i harmachisi fly also but with swifter wings my game is played i too have made atonement oh what a bitter fate is mine to have brought misery on all i love and in the end to die unloved to thee i have atoned to my angered gods i have atoned and now i go to find a way whereby i may atone to cleopatra in that hell where she is and which i must share for she loved me well harmachis and now that she is dead methinks that after thee i loved her best of all so of her cup and the cup of iras i will surely drink and she took the phial and with a steady hand poured what was left of the poison into the goblet  bethink thee charmion i said yet mayst thou live for many years hiding these sorrows beneath the withered days  yet i may but i will not to live the prey of so many memories the fount of an undying shame that night by night as i lie sleepless shall well afresh from my sorrowstricken heartto live torn by a love i cannot loseto stand alone like some stormtwisted tree and sighing day by day to the winds of heaven gaze upon the desert of my life while i wait the lingering lightnings strokenay that will not i harmachis i had died long since but i lived on to serve thee now no more thou needest me and i go oh fare thee wellfor ever fare thee well for not again shall i look again upon thy face and there i go thou goest not for thou dost not love me who still dost love that queenly woman thou hast hounded to the death her thou shalt never win and i thee shall never win and this is the bitter end of fate see harmachis i ask one boon before i go and for all time become naught to thee but a memory of shame tell me that thou dost forgive me so far as thine is to forgive and in token thereof kiss mewith no lovers kiss but kiss me on the brow and bid me pass in peace  and she drew near to me with arms outstretched and pitiful trembling lips and gazed upon my face  charmion i answered we are free to act for good or evil and yet methinks there is a fate above our fate that blowing from some strange shore compels our little sails of purpose set them as we will and drives us to destruction i forgive thee charmion as i trust in turn to be forgiven and by this kiss the first and the last i seal our peace and with my lips i touched her brow  she spoke no more only for a little while she stood gazing on me with sad eyes then she lifted the goblet and said  royal harmachis in this deadly cup i pledge thee would that i had drunk of it ere ever i looked upon thy face pharaoh who thy sins outworn yet shalt rule in perfect peace oer worlds i may not tread who yet shalt sway a kinglier sceptre than that i robbed thee of for ever fare thee well  she drank cast down the cup and for a moment stood with the wide eyes of one who looks for death then he came and charmion the egyptian fell prone upon the floor dead and for a moment more i stood alone with the dead  i crept to the side of cleopatra and now that none were left to see i sat down on the bed and laid her head upon my knee as once before it had been laid in that night of sacrilege beneath the shadow of the everlasting pyramid then i kissed her chill brow and went from the house of deathavenged but sorely smitten with despair    physician said the officer of the guard as i went through the gates what passes yonder in the monument methought i heard the sounds of death  naught passesall hath passed i made reply and went  and as i went in the darkness i heard the sound of voices and the running of the feet of cæsars messengers  flying swiftly to my house i found atoua waiting at the gates she drew me into a quiet chamber and closed the doors  is it done she asked and turned her wrinkled face to mine while the lamplight streamed white upon her snowy hair nay why ask ii know that it is done  ay it is done and well done old wife all are dead cleopatra iras charmionall save myself  the aged woman drew up her bent form and cried now let me go in peace for i have seen my desire upon thy foes and the foes of khem la lanot in vain have i lived on beyond the years of man i have seen my desire upon thy enemiesi have gathered the dews of death and thy foe hath drunk thereof fallen is the brow of pride the shame of khem is level with the dust ah would that i might have seen that wanton die  cease woman cease the dead are gathered to the dead osiris holds them fast and everlasting silence seals their lips pursue not the fallen great with insults uplet us fly to abouthis that all may be accomplished  fly thou harmachisharmachis flybut i fly not to this end only i have lingered on the earth now i untie the knot of life and let my spirit free fare thee well prince the pilgrimage is done harmachis from a babe have i loved thee and love thee yetbut no more in this world may i share thy griefsi am spent osiris take thou my spirit and her trembling knees gave way and she sank to the ground  i ran to her side and looked upon her she was already dead and i was alone upon the earth without a friend to comfort me  then i turned and went no man hindering me for all was confusion in the city and departed from alexandria in a vessel i had made ready on the eighth day i landed and in the carrying out of my purpose travelled on foot across the fields to the holy shrine of abouthis and here as i knew the worship of the gods had been lately set up again in the temple of the divine sethi for charmion had caused cleopatra to repent of her decree of vengeance and to restore the lands that she had seized though the treasure she restored not and the temple having been purified now at the season of the feast of isis all the high priests of the ancient temples of egypt were gathered together to celebrate the coming home of the gods into their holy place  i gained the city it was on the seventh day of the feast of isis even as i came the long array wended through the wellremembered streets i joined in the multitude that followed and with my voice swelled the chorus of the solemn chant as we passed through the pylons into the imperishable halls how well known were the holy words       softly we tread our measured footsteps falling      within the sanctuary sevenfold      soft on the dead that liveth are we calling      return osiris from thy kingdom cold      return to them that worship thee of old  and then when the sacred music ceased as aforetime on the setting of the majesty of ra the high priest raised the statue of the living god and held it on high before the multitude  with a joyful shout of  osiris our hope osiris osiris  the people tore the black wrappings from their dress showing the white robes beneath and as one man bowed before the god  then they went to feast each at his home but i stayed in the court of the temple  presently a priest of the temple drew near and asked me of my business and i answered him that i came from alexandria and would be led before the council of the high priests for i knew that the holy priests were gathered together debating the tidings from alexandria  thereon the man left and the high priests hearing that i was from alexandria ordered that i should be led into their presence in the hall of columnsand so i was led in it was already dark and between the great pillars lights were set as on that night when i was crowned pharaoh of the upper and the lower land there too was the long line of dignitaries seated in their carven chairs and taking counsel together all was the same the same cold images of kings and gods gazed with the same empty eyes from the everlasting walls ay more among those gathered there were five of the very men who as leaders of the great plot had sat here to see me crowned being the only conspirators who had escaped the vengeance of cleopatra and the clutching hand of time  i took my stand on the spot where once i had been crowned and made me ready for the last act of shame with such bitterness of heart as cannot be written  why it is the physician olympus said one he who lived a hermit in the tombs of tápé and who but lately was of the household of cleopatra is it then true that the queen is dead by her own hand physician  yea holy sirs i am that physician also cleopatra is dead by my hand  by thy hand why how comes thisthough well is she dead forsooth the wicked wanton  your pardon sirs and i will tell you all for i am come hither to that end perchance among you there may be somemethinks i see somewho nigh eleven years ago were gathered in this hall to secretly crown one harmachis pharaoh of khem  it is true they said but how knowest thou these things thou olympus  of the rest of those sevenandthirty nobles i went on making no answer are twoandthirty missing some are dead as amenemhat is dead some are slain as sepa is slain and some perchance yet labour as slaves within the mines or live afar fearing vengeance  it is so they said alas it is so harmachis the accursed betrayed the plot and sold himself to the wanton cleopatra  it is so i went on lifting up my head harmachis betrayed the plot and sold himself to cleopatra and holy sirsi am that harmachis  the priests and dignitaries gazed astonished some rose and spoke some said naught  i am that harmachis i am that traitor trebly steeped in crimea traitor to my gods a traitor to my country a traitor to my oath i come hither to say that i have done this i have executed the divine vengeance on her who ruined me and gave egypt to the roman and now that after years of toil and patient waiting this is accomplished by my wisdom and the help of the angry gods behold i come with all my shame upon my head to declare the thing i am and take the traitors guerdon  mindest thou of the doom of him who hath broke the oath that may not be broke asked he who first had spoken in heavy tones  i know it well i answered i court that awful doom  tell us more of this matter thou who wast harmachis  so in cold clear words i laid bare all my shame keeping back nothing and ever as i spoke i saw their faces grow more hard and knew that for me there was no mercy nor did i ask it nor had i asked could it have been granted  when at last i had done they put me aside while they took counsel then they drew me forth again and the eldest among them a man very old and venerable the priest of the temple of the divine hatshepu at tápé spoke in icy accents  thou harmachis we have considered this matter thou hast sinned the threefold deadly sin on thy head lies the burden of the woe of khem this day enthralled of rome to isis the mother mystery thou hast offered the deadly insult and thou hast broken thy holy oath for all of these sins there is as well thou knowest but one reward and that reward is thine naught can it weigh in the balance of our justice that thou hast slain her who was thy cause of stumbling naught that thou comest to name thyself the vilest thing who ever stood within these walls on thee also must fall the curse of menkaura thou false priest thou forsworn patriot thou pharaoh shameful and discrowned here where we set the double crown upon thy head we doom thee to the doom go to thy dungeon and await the falling of its stroke go remembering what thou mightest have been and what thou art and may those gods who through thy evil doing shall perchance ere long cease to be worshipped within these holy temples give to thee that mercy which we deny lead him forth    so they took me and led me forth with bowed head i went looking not up and yet i felt their eyes burn upon my face  oh surely of all my shames this is the heaviest    chapter x  of the last writing of harmachis the royal egyptian  they led me to the prison chamber that is high in the pylon tower and here i wait my doom i know not when the sword of fate shall fall week grows to week and month to month and still it is delayed still it quivers unseen above my head i know that it will fall but when i know not perchance i shall wake in some dead hour of midnight to hear the stealthy steps of the slayers and be hurried forth perchance they are now at hand then will come the secret cell the horror the nameless coffin and at last it will be done oh let it come let it come swiftly   all is written i have held back nothingmy sin is sinnedmy vengeance is finished now all things end in darkness and in ashes and i prepare to face the terrors that are to come in other worlds than this i go but not without hope i go for though i see her not though no more she answers to my prayers still i am aware of the holy isis who is with me for evermore and whom i shall yet again behold face to face and then at last in that far day i shall find forgiveness then the burden of my guilt will roll from me and innocency come back and wrap me round bringing me holy peace   oh dear land of khem as in a dream i see thee i see nation after nation set its standard on thy shores and its yoke upon thy neck i see new religions without end calling out their truths upon the banks of sihor and summoning thy people to their worship i see thy templesthy holy templescrumbling in the dust a wonder to the sight of men unborn who shall peer into thy tombs and desecrate the great ones of thy glory i see thy mysteries a mockery to the unlearned and thy wisdom wasted like waters on the desert sands i see the roman eagles stoop and perish their beaks yet red with the blood of men and the long lights dancing down the barbarian spears that follow in their wake and then at last i see thee once more great once more free and having once more a knowledge of thy godsay thy gods with a changed countenance and called by other names but still thy gods   the sun sinks over abouthis the red rays of ra flame on temple roofs upon green fields and the wide waters of father sihor so as a child i watched him sink just so his last kiss touched the further pylons frowning brow just that same shadow lay upon the tombs all is unchanged ii only am changedso changed and yet the same   oh cleopatra cleopatra thou destroyer if i might but tear thy vision from my heart of all my griefs this is the heaviest griefstill must i love thee still must i hug this serpent to my heart still in my ears must ring that low laugh of triumphthe murmur of the falling fountainthe song of the nightinga  here the writing on the third roll of papyrus abruptly ends it would almost seem that the writer was at this moment broken in upon by those who came to lead him to his doom
