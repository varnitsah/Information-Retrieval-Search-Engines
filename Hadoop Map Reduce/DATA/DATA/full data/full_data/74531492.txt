74531492	the dolliver romance  by  nathaniel hawthorne     contents  introductory note to the dolliver romance  a scene from the dolliver romance  another scene from the dolliver romance  another fragment of the dolliver romance     introductory note  the dolliver romance   in the dolliver romance only three chapters of which the author lived to complete we get an intimation as to what would have been the ultimate form given to that romance founded on the elixir of life for which septimius felton was the preliminary study having abandoned this study and apparently forsaken the whole scheme in 1862 hawthorne was moved to renew his meditation upon it in the following year and as the plan of the romance had now seemingly developed to his satisfaction he listened to the publishers proposal that it should begin its course as a serial story in the atlantic monthly for january 1864the first instance in which he had attempted such a mode of publication  but the change from england to massachusetts had been marked by and had perhaps in part caused a decline in his health illness in his family the depressing and harrowing effect of the civil war upon his sensibilities and anxiety with regard to pecuniary affairs all combined to make still further inroads upon his vitality and so early as the autumn of 1862 mrs hawthorne noted in her private diary that her husband was looking miserably ill at no time since boyhood had he suffered any serious sickness and his strong constitution enabled him to rally from this first attack but the gradual decline continued after sending forth our old home he had little strength for any employment more arduous than reading or than walking his accustomed path among the pines and sweetfern on the hill behind the wayside known to his family as the mount of vision the projected work therefore advanced but slowly he wrote to mr fields  i dont see much probability of my having the first chapter of the romance ready so soon as you want it there are two or three chapters ready to be written but i am not yet robust enough to begin and i feel as if i should never carry it through  the presentiment proved to be only too well founded he had previously written  there is something preternatural in my reluctance to begin i linger at the threshold and have a perception of very disagreeable phantasms to be encountered if i enter i wish god had given me the faculty of writing a sunshiny book  and again in november he says i foresee that there is little probability of my getting the first chapter ready by the 15th although i have a resolute purpose to write it by the end of the month he did indeed send it by that time but it began to be apparent in january that he could not go on  seriously he says in one letter my mind has for the present lost its temper and its fine edge and i have an instinct that i had better keep quiet perhaps i shall have a new spirit of vigor if i wait quietly for it perhaps not in another i hardly know what to say to the public about this abortive romance though i know pretty well what the case will be i shall never finish it i cannot finish it unless a great change comes over me and if i make too great an effort to do so it will be my death  finally work had to be given over indefinitely in april he went southward with mr ticknor the senior partner of his publishing house but mr ticknor died suddenly in philadelphia and hawthorne returned to the wayside more feeble than ever he lingered there a little while then early in may came the last effort to recover tone by means of a carriagejourney with his friend expresident pierce through the southern part of new hampshire a week passed and all was ended at the hotel in plymouth new hampshire where he and his companion had stopped to rest he died in the night between the 18th and the 19th of may 1864 like thackeray and dickens he was touched by deaths petrific mace before he had had time to do more than lay the groundwork and begin the main structure of the fiction he had in hand and as in the case of thackeray the suddenness of his decease has never been clearly accounted for the precise nature of his malady was not known since with quiet hopelessness he had refused to take medical advice his friend dr oliver wendell holmes was the only physician who had an opportunity to take even a cursory view of his case which he did in the course of a brief walk and conversation in boston before hawthorne started with mr pierce but he was unable with that slight opportunity to reach any definite conclusion dr holmes prescribed and had put up for him a remedy to palliate some of the poignant symptoms and this hawthorne carried with him but i feared dr holmes writes to the editor that there was some internal organicperhaps malignantdisease for he looked wasted and as if stricken with a mortal illness  the manuscript of the unfinished dolliver romance lay upon his coffin during the funeral services at concord but contrary to the impression sometimes entertained on this point was not buried with him it is preserved in the concord public library the first chapter was published in the atlantic as an isolated portion soon after his death and subsequently the second chapter which he had been unable to revise appeared in the same periodical between this and the third fragment there is a gap for bridging which no material was found among his papers but after hesitating for several years mrs hawthorne copied and placed in the publishers hands that final portion which with the two parts previously printed constitutes the whole of what hawthorne had put into tangible form  hawthorne had purposed prefixing a sketch of thoreau because from a tradition which he told me about this house of mine i got the idea of a deathless man which is now taking a shape very different from the original one this refers to the tradition mentioned in the editors note to septimius felton and forms a link in the interesting chain of evidence connecting that romance with the dolliver romance with the plan respecting thoreau he combined the idea of writing an autobiographical preface wherein the wayside was to be described after the manner of his introduction to the mosses from an old manse but so far as is known nothing of this was ever actually committed to paper  beginning with the idea of producing an english romance fragments of which remain to us in the ancestral footstep and the incomplete work known as doctor grimshawes secret he replaced these by another design of which septimius felton represents the partial execution but that elaborate study yielded in its turn to the dolliver romance the last named work had the author lived to carry it out would doubtless have become the vehicle of a profound and pathetic drama based on the instinctive yearning of man for an immortal existence the attempted gratification of which would have been set forth in a variety of ways first through the selfish old sensualist colonel dabney who greedily seized the mysterious elixir and took such a draught of it that he perished on the spot then through the simple old grandsir anxious to live for pansies sake and perhaps through pansie herself who coming into the enjoyment of some ennobling love would wish to defeat death so that she might always keep the perfection of her mundane happinessall these forms of striving to be made the adumbration of a higher one the shadowplay that should direct our minds to the true immortality beyond this world  g p l     the dolliver romance  a scene from the dolliver romance   dr dolliver a worthy personage of extreme antiquity was aroused rather prematurely one summer morning by the shouts of the child pansie in an adjoining chamber summoning old martha who performed the duties of nurse housekeeper and kitchenmaid in the doctors establishment to take up her little ladyship and dress her the old gentleman woke with more than his customary alacrity and after taking a moment to gather his wits about him pulled aside the faded moreen curtains of his ancient bed and thrust his head into a beam of sunshine that caused him to wink and withdraw it again this transitory glimpse of good dr dolliver showed a flannel nightcap fringed round with stray locks of silvery white hair and surmounting a meagre and duskily yellow visage which was crossed and crisscrossed with a record of his long life in wrinkles faithfully written no doubt but with such cramped chirography of father time that the purport was illegible it seemed hardly worth while for the patriarch to get out of bed any more and bring his forlorn shadow into the summer day that was made for younger folks the doctor however was by no means of that opinion being considerably encouraged towards the toil of living twentyfour hours longer by the comparative ease with which he found himself going through the usually painful process of bestirring his rusty joints stiffened by the very rest and sleep that should have made them pliable and putting them in a condition to bear his weight upon the floor nor was he absolutely disheartened by the idea of those tonsorial ablutionary and personally decorative labors which are apt to become so intolerably irksome to an old gentleman after performing them daily and daily for fifty sixty or seventy years and finding them still as immitigably recurrent as at first dr dolliver could nowise account for this happy condition of his spirits and physical energies until he remembered taking an experimental sip of a certain cordial which was long ago prepared by his grandson and carefully sealed up in a bottle and had been reposited in a dark closet among a parcel of effete medicines ever since that gifted young mans death  it may have wrought effect upon me thought the doctor shaking his head as he lifted it again from the pillow it may be so for poor edward oftentimes instilled a strange efficacy into his perilous drugs but i will rather believe it to be the operation of gods mercy which may have temporarily invigorated my feeble age for little pansies sake  a twinge of his familiar rheumatism as he put his foot out of bed taught him that he must not reckon too confidently upon even a days respite from the intrusive family of aches and infirmities which with their proverbial fidelity to attachments once formed had long been the closest acquaintances that the poor old gentleman had in the world nevertheless he fancied the twinge a little less poignant than those of yesterday and moreover after stinging him pretty smartly it passed gradually off with a thrill which in its latter stages grew to be almost agreeable pain is but pleasure too strongly emphasized with cautious movements and only a groan or two the good doctor transferred himself from the bed to the floor where he stood awhile gazing from one piece of quaint furniture to another such as stiffbacked mayflower chairs an oaken chestofdrawers carved cunningly with shapes of animals and wreaths of foliage a table with multitudinous legs a family record in faded embroidery a shelf of blackbound books a dirty heap of gallipots and phials in a dim cornergazing at these things and steadying himself by the bedpost while his inert brain still partially benumbed with sleep came slowly into accordance with the realities about him the object which most helped to bring dr dolliver completely to his waking perceptions was one that common observers might suppose to have been snatched bodily out of his dreams the same sunbeam that had dazzled the doctor between the bed curtains gleamed on the weatherbeaten gilding which had once adorned this mysterious symbol and showed it to be an enormous serpent twining round a wooden post and reaching quite from the floor of the chamber to its ceiling  it was evidently a thing that could boast of considerable antiquity the dryrot having eaten out its eyes and gnawed away the tip of its tail and it must have stood long exposed to the atmosphere for a kind of gray moss had partially overspread its tarnished gilt surface and a swallow or other familiar little bird in some bygone summer seemed to have built its nest in the yawning and exaggerated mouth it looked like a kind of manichean idol which might have been elevated on a pedestal for a century or so enjoying the worship of its votaries in the open air until the impious sect perished from among menall save old dr dolliver who had set up the monster in his bedchamber for the convenience of private devotion but we are unpardonable in suggesting such a fantasy to the prejudice of our venerable friend knowing him to have been as pious and upright a christian and with as little of the serpent in his character as ever came of puritan lineage not to make a further mystery about a very simple matter this bedimmed and rotten reptile was once the medical emblem or apothecarys sign of the famous dr swinnerton who practised physic in the earlier days of new england when a head of aesculapius or hippocrates would have vexed the souls of the righteous as savoring of heathendom the ancient dispenser of drugs had therefore set up an image of the brazen serpent and followed his business for many years with great credit under this scriptural device and dr dolliver being the apprentice pupil and humble friend of the learned swinnertons old age had inherited the symbolic snake and much other valuable property by his bequest  while the patriarch was putting on his smallclothes he took care to stand in the parallelogram of bright sunshine that fell upon the uncarpeted floor the summer warmth was very genial to his system and yet made him shiver his wintry veins rejoiced at it though the reviving blood tingled through them with a halfpainful and only halfpleasurable titillation for the first few moments after creeping out of bed he kept his back to the sunny window and seemed mysteriously shy of glancing thitherward but as the june fervor pervaded him more and more thoroughly he turned bravely about and looked forth at a burialground on the corner of which he dwelt there lay many an old acquaintance who had gone to sleep with the flavor of dr dollivers tinctures and powders upon his tongue it was the patients final bitter taste of this world and perhaps doomed to be a recollected nauseousness in the next yesterday in the chill of his forlorn old age the doctor expected soon to stretch out his weary bones among that quiet community and might scarcely have shrunk from the prospect on his own account except indeed that he dreamily mixed up the infirmities of his present condition with the repose of the approaching one being haunted by a notion that the damp earth under the grass and dandelions must needs be pernicious for his cough and his rheumatism but this morning the cheerful sunbeams or the mere taste of his grandsons cordial that he had taken at bedtime or the fitful vigor that often sports irreverently with aged people had caused an unfrozen drop of youthfulness somewhere within him to expand  hem ahem quoth the doctor hoping with one effort to clear his throat of the dregs of a tenyears cough matters are not so far gone with me as i thought i have known mighty sensible men when only a little age stricken or otherwise out of sorts to die of mere faintheartedness a great deal sooner than they need  he shook his silvery head at his own image in the lookingglass as if to impress the apothegm on that shadowy representative of himself and for his part he determined to pluck up a spirit and live as long as he possibly could if it were only for the sake of little pansie who stood as close to one extremity of human life as her greatgrandfather to the other this child of three years old occupied all the unfossilized portion of dr dollivers heart every other interest that he formerly had and the entire confraternity of persons whom he once loved had long ago departed and the poor doctor could not follow them because the grasp of pansies babyfingers held him back  so he crammed a great silver watch into his fob and drew on a patchwork morninggown of an ancient fashion its original material was said to have been the embroidered front of his own weddingwaistcoat and the silken skirt of his wifes bridal attire which his eldest granddaughter had taken from the carved chestofdrawers after poor bessie the beloved of his youth had been half a century in the grave throughout many of the intervening years as the garment got ragged the spinsters of the old mans family had quilted their duty and affection into it in the shape of patches upon patches rosecolor crimson blue violet and green and then as their hopes faded and their life kept growing shadier and their attire took a sombre hue sober gray and great fragments of funereal black until the doctor could revive the memory of most things that had befallen him by looking at his patchworkgown as it hung upon a chair and now it was ragged again and all the fingers that should have mended it were cold it had an eastern fragrance too a smell of drugs strong scented herbs and spicy gums gathered from the many potent infusions that had from time to time been spilt over it so that snuffing him afar off you might have taken dr dolliver for a mummy and could hardly have been undeceived by his shrunken and torpid aspect as he crept nearer  wrapt in his odorous and manycolored robe he took staff in hand and moved pretty vigorously to the head of the staircase as it was somewhat steep and but dimly lighted he began cautiously to descend putting his left hand on the banister and poking down his long stick to assist him in making sure of the successive steps and thus he became a living illustration of the accuracy of scripture where it describes the aged as being afraid of that which is higha truth that is often found to have a sadder purport than its external one halfway to the bottom however the doctor heard the impatient and authoritative tones of little pansie queen pansie as she might fairly have been styled in reference to her position in the householdcalling amain for grandpapa and breakfast he was startled into such perilous activity by the summons that his heels slid on the stairs the slippers were shuffled off his feet and he saved himself from a tumble only by quickening his pace and coming down at almost a run  mercy on my poor old bones mentally exclaimed the doctor fancying himself fractured in fifty places some of them are broken surely and methinks my heart has leaped out of my mouth what all right well well but providence is kinder to me than i deserve prancing down this steep staircase like a kid of three months old  he bent stiffly to gather up his slippers and fallen staff and meanwhile pansie had heard the tumult of her greatgrandfathers descent and was pounding against the door of the breakfastroom in her haste to come at him the doctor opened it and there she stood a rather pale and large eyed little thing quaint in her aspect as might well be the case with a motherless child dwelling in an uncheerful house with no other playmates than a decrepit old man and a kitten and no better atmosphere within doors than the odor of decayed apothecarys stuff nor gayer neighborhood than that of the adjacent burialground where all her relatives from her greatgrandmother downward lay calling to her pansie pansie it is bedtime even in the prime of the summer morning for those dead women folk especially her mother and the whole row of maiden aunts and grand aunts could not but be anxious about the child knowing that little pansie would be far safer under a tuft of dandelions than if left alone as she soon must be in this difficult and deceitful world  yet in spite of the lack of damask roses in her cheeks she seemed a healthy child and certainly showed great capacity of energetic movement in the impulsive capers with which she welcomed her venerable progenitor she shouted out her satisfaction moreover as her custom was having never had any oversensitive auditors about her to tame down her voice till even the doctors dull ears were full of the clamor  pansie darling said dr dolliver cheerily patting her brown hair with his tremulous fingers thou hast put some of thine own friskiness into poor old grandfather this fine morning dost know child that he came near breaking his neck downstairs at the sound of thy voice what wouldst thou have done then little pansie  kiss poor grandpapa and make him well answered the child remembering the doctors own mode of cure in similar mishaps to herself it shall do poor grandpapa good she added putting up her mouth to apply the remedy  ah little one thou hast greater faith in thy medicines than ever i had in my drugs replied the patriarch with a giggle surprised and delighted at his own readiness of response but the kiss is good for my feeble old heart pansie though it might do little to mend a broken neck so give grandpapa another dose and let us to breakfast  in this merry humor they sat down to the table greatgrandpapa and pansie side by side and the kitten as soon appeared making a third in the party first she showed her mottled head out of pansies lap delicately sipping milk from the childs basin without rebuke then she took post on the old gentlemans shoulder purring like a spinningwheel trying her claws in the wadding of his dressinggown and still more impressively reminding him of her presence by putting out a paw to intercept a warmed over morsel of yesterdays chicken on its way to the doctors mouth after skilfully achieving this feat she scrambled down upon the breakfasttable and began to wash her face and hands evidently these companions were all three on intimate terms as was natural enough since a great many childish impulses were softly creeping back on the simpleminded old man insomuch that if no worldly necessities nor painful infirmity had disturbed him his remnant of life might have been as cheaply and cheerily enjoyed as the early playtime of the kitten and the child old dr dolliver and his greatgranddaughter a ponderous title which seemed quite to overwhelm the tiny figure of pansie had met one another at the two extremities of the lifecircle her sunrise served him for a sunset illuminating his locks of silver and hers of golden brown with a homogeneous shimmer of twinkling light  little pansie was the one earthly creature that inherited a drop of the dolliver blood the doctors only child poor bessies offspring had died the better part of a hundred years before and his grandchildren a numerous and dimly remembered brood had vanished along his weary track in their youth maturity or incipient age till hardly knowing how it had all happened he found himself tottering onward with an infants small fingers in his nerveless grasp so mistily did his dead progeny come and go in the patriarchs decayed recollection that this solitary child represented for him the successive babyhoods of the many that had gone before the emotions of his early paternity came back to him she seemed the baby of a past age oftener than she seemed pansie a whole family of grandaunts one of whom had perished in her cradle never so mature as pansie now another in her virgin bloom another in autumnal maidenhood yellow and shrivelled with vinegar in her blood and still another a forlorn widow whose grief outlasted even its vitality and grew to be merely a torpid habit and was saddest thenall their hitherto forgotten features peeped through the face of the greatgrandchild and their longinaudible voices sobbed shouted or laughed in her familiar tones but it often happened to dr dolliver while frolicking amid this throng of ghosts where the one reality looked no more vivid than its shadowy sistersit often happened that his eyes filled with tears at a sudden perception of what a sad and povertystricken old man he was already remote from his own generation and bound to stray further onward as the sole playmate and protector of a child  as dr dolliver in spite of his advanced epoch of life is likely to remain a considerable time longer upon our hands we deem it expedient to give a brief sketch of his position in order that the story may get onward with the greater freedom when he rises from the breakfasttable deeming it a matter of courtesy we have allowed him the honorary title of doctor as did all his townspeople and contemporaries except perhaps one or two formal old physicians stingy of civil phrases and overjealous of their own professional dignity nevertheless these crusty graduates were technically right in excluding dr dolliver from their fraternity he had never received the degree of any medical school nor save it might be for the cure of a toothache or a childs rash or a whitlow on a seamstresss finger or some such trifling malady had he ever been even a practitioner of the awful science with which his popular designation connected him our old friend in short even at his highest social elevation claimed to be nothing more than an apothecary and in these later and far less prosperous days scarcely so much since the death of his last surviving grandson pansies father whom he had instructed in all the mysteries of his science and who being distinguished by an experimental and inventive tendency was generally believed to have poisoned himself with an infallible panacea of his own distillation since that final bereavement dr dollivers once pretty flourishing business had lamentably declined after a few months of unavailing struggle he found it expedient to take down the brazen serpent from the position to which dr swinnerton had originally elevated it in front of his shop in the main street and to retire to his private dwelling situated in a bylane and on the edge of a burialground  this house as well as the brazen serpent some old medical books and a drawer full of manuscripts had come to him by the legacy of dr swinnerton the dreariness of the locality had been of small importance to our friend in his young manhood when he first led his fair wife over the threshold and so long as neither of them had any kinship with the human dust that rose into little hillocks and still kept accumulating beneath their window but too soon afterwards when poor bessie herself had gone early to rest there it is probable that an influence from her grave may have prematurely calmed and depressed her widowed husband taking away much of the energy from what should have been the most active portion of his life thus he never grew rich his thrifty townsmen used to tell him that in any other mans hands dr swinnertons brazen serpent meaning i presume the inherited credit and goodwill of that old worthys trade would need but ten years time to transmute its brass into gold in dr dollivers keeping as we have seen the inauspicious symbol lost the greater part of what superficial gilding it originally had matters had not mended with him in more advanced life after he had deposited a further and further portion of his heart and its affections in each successive one of a long row of kindred graves and as he stood over the last of them holding pansie by the hand and looking down upon the coffin of his grandson it is no wonder that the old man wept partly for those gone before but not so bitterly as for the little one that stayed behind why had not god taken her with the rest and then so hopeless as he was so destitute of possibilities of good his weary frame his decrepit bones his driedup heart might have crumbled into dust at once and have been scattered by the next wind over all the heaps of earth that were akin to him  this intensity of desolation however was of too positive a character to be long sustained by a person of dr dollivers original gentleness and simplicity and now so completely tamed by age and misfortune even before he turned away from the grave he grew conscious of a slightly cheering and invigorating effect from the tight grasp of the childs warm little hand feeble as he was she seemed to adopt him willingly for her protector and the doctor never afterwards shrank from his duty nor quailed beneath it but bore himself like a man striving amid the sloth of age and the breakingup of intellect to earn the competency which he had failed to accumulate even in his most vigorous days  to the extent of securing a present subsistence for pansie and himself he was successful after his sons death when the brazen serpent fell into popular disrepute a small share of tenacious patronage followed the old man into his retirement in his prime he had been allowed to possess more skill than usually fell to the share of a colonial apothecary having been regularly apprenticed to dr swinnerton who throughout his long practice was accustomed personally to concoct the medicines which he prescribed and dispensed it was believed indeed that the ancient physician had learned the art at the worldfamous drugmanufactory of apothecarys hall in london and as some people halfmalignly whispered had perfected himself under masters more subtle than were to be found even there unquestionably in many critical cases he was known to have employed remedies of mysterious composition and dangerous potency which in less skilful hands would have been more likely to kill than cure he would willingly it is said have taught his apprentice the secrets of these prescriptions but the latter being of a timid character and delicate conscience had shrunk from acquaintance with them it was probably as the result of the same scrupulosity that dr dolliver had always declined to enter the medical profession in which his old instructor had set him such heroic examples of adventurous dealing with matters of life and death nevertheless the aromatic fragrance so to speak of the learned swinnertons reputation had clung to our friend through life and there were elaborate preparations in the pharmacopia of that day requiring such minute skill and conscientious fidelity in the concocter that the physicians were still glad to confide them to one in whom these qualities were so evident  moreover the grandmothers of the community were kind to him and mindful of his perfumes his rosewater his cosmetics toothpowders pomanders and pomades the scented memory of which lingered about their toilet tables or came faintly back from the days when they were beautiful among this class of customers there was still a demand for certain comfortable little nostrums delicately sweet and pungent to the taste cheering to the spirits and fragrant in the breath the proper distillation of which was the airiest secret that the mystic swinnerton had left behind him and besides these old ladies had always liked the manners of dr dolliver and used to speak of his gentle courtesy behind the counter as having positively been something to admire though of later years an unrefined and almost rustic simplicity such as belonged to his humble ancestors appeared to have taken possession of him as it often does of prettily mannered men in their late decay  but it resulted from all these favorable circumstances that the doctors marble mortar though worn with long service and considerably damaged by a crack that pervaded it continued to keep up an occasional intimacy with the pestle and he still weighed drachms and scruples in his delicate scales though it seemed impossible dealing with such minute quantities that his tremulous fingers should not put in too little or too much leaving out life with the deficiency or spilling in death with the surplus to say the truth his stanchest friends were beginning to think that dr dollivers fits of absence when his mind appeared absolutely to depart from him while his frail old body worked on mechanically rendered him not quite trustworthy without a close supervision of his proceedings it was impossible however to convince the aged apothecary of the necessity for such vigilance and if anything could stir up his gentle temper to wrath or as oftener happened to tears it was the attempt which he was marvellously quick to detect thus to interfere with his longfamiliar business  the public meanwhile ceasing to regard dr dolliver in his professional aspect had begun to take an interest in him as perhaps their oldest fellowcitizen it was he that remembered the great fire and the great snow and that had been a grownup stripling at the terrible epoch of witchtimes and a child just breeched at the breaking out of king philips indian war he too in his schoolboy days had received a benediction from the patriarchal governor bradstreet and thus could boast somewhat as bishops do of their unbroken succession from the apostles of a transmitted blessing from the whole company of sainted pilgrims among whom the venerable magistrate had been an honored companion viewing their townsman in this aspect the people revoked the courteous doctorate with which they had heretofore decorated him and now knew him most familiarly as grandsir dolliver his white head his puritan band his threadbare garb the fashion of which he had ceased to change half a century ago his goldheaded staff that had been dr swinnertons his shrunken frosty figure and its feeble movementall these characteristics had a wholeness and permanence in the public recognition like the meetinghouse steeple or the townpump all the younger portion of the inhabitants unconsciously ascribed a sort of aged immortality to grandsir dollivers infirm and reverend presence they fancied that he had been born old at least i remember entertaining some such notions about agestricken people when i myself was young and that he could the better tolerate his aches and incommodities his dull ears and dim eyes his remoteness from human intercourse within the crust of indurated years the cold temperature that kept him always shivering and sad the heavy burden that invisibly bent down his shouldersthat all these intolerable things might bring a kind of enjoyment to grandsir dolliver as the lifelong conditions of his peculiar existence  but alas it was a terrible mistake this weight of years had a perennial novelty for the poor sufferer he never grew accustomed to it but long as he had now borne the fretful torpor of his waning life and patient as he seemed he still retained an inward consciousness that these stiffened shoulders these quailing knees this cloudiness of sight and brain this confused forgetfulness of men and affairs were troublesome accidents that did not really belong to him he possibly cherished a halfrecognized idea that they might pass away youth however eclipsed for a season is undoubtedly the proper permanent and genuine condition of man and if we look closely into this dreary delusion of growing old we shall find that it never absolutely succeeds in laying hold of our innermost convictions a sombre garment woven of lifes unrealities has muffled us from our true self but within it smiles the young man whom we knew the ashes of many perishable things have fallen upon our youthful fire but beneath them lurk the seeds of inextinguishable flame so powerful is this instinctive faith that men of simple modes of character are prone to antedate its consummation and thus it happened with poor grandsir dolliver who often awoke from an old mans fitful sleep with a sense that his senile predicament was but a dream of the past night and hobbling hastily across the cold floor to the lookingglass he would be grievously disappointed at beholding the white hair the wrinkles and furrows the ashen visage and bent form the melancholy mask of age in which as he now remembered some strange and sad enchantment had involved him for years gone by  to other eyes than his own however the shrivelled old gentleman looked as if there were little hope of his throwing off this too artfully wrought disguise until at no distant day his stooping figure should be straightened out his hoary locks be smoothed over his brows and his muchenduring bones be laid safely away with a green coverlet spread over them beside his bessie who doubtless would recognize her youthful companion in spite of his ugly garniture of decay he longed to be gazed at by the loving eyes now closed he shrank from the hard stare of them that loved him not walking the streets seldom and reluctantly he felt a dreary impulse to elude the peoples observation as if with a sense that he had gone irrevocably out of fashion and broken his connecting links with the network of human life or else it was that nightmarefeeling which we sometimes have in dreams when we seem to find ourselves wandering through a crowded avenue with the noonday sun upon us in some wild extravagance of dress or nudity he was conscious of estrangement from his townspeople but did not always know how nor wherefore nor why he should be thus groping through the twilight mist in solitude if they spoke loudly to him with cheery voices the greeting translated itself faintly and mournfully to his ears if they shook him by the hand it was as if a thick insensible glove absorbed the kindly pressure and the warmth when little pansie was the companion of his walk her childish gayety and freedom did not avail to bring him into closer relationship with men but seemed to follow him into that region of indefinable remoteness that dismal fairyland of aged fancy into which old grandsir dolliver had so strangely crept away  yet there were moments as many persons had noticed when the great grandpapa would suddenly take stronger hues of life it was as if his faded figure had been colored over anew or at least as he and pansie moved along the street as if a sunbeam had fallen across him instead of the gray gloom of an instant before his chilled sensibilities had probably been touched and quickened by the warm contiguity of his little companion through the medium of her hand as it stirred within his own or some inflection of her voice that set his memory ringing and chiming with forgotten sounds while that music lasted the old man was alive and happy and there were seasons it might be happier than even these when pansie had been kissed and put to bed and grandsir dolliver sat by his fireside gazing in among the massive coals and absorbing their glow into those cavernous abysses with which all men communicate hence come angels or fiends into our twilight musings according as we may have peopled them in bygone years over our friends face in the rosy flicker of the fire gleam stole an expression of repose and perfect trust that made him as beautiful to look at in his highbacked chair as the child pansie on her pillow and sometimes the spirits that were watching him beheld a calm surprise draw slowly over his features and brighten into joy yet not so vividly as to break his evening quietude the gate of heaven had been kindly left ajar that this forlorn old creature might catch a glimpse within all the night afterwards he would be semiconscious of an intangible bliss diffused through the fitful lapses of an old mans slumber and would awake at early dawn with a faint thrilling of the heartstrings as if there had been music just now wandering over them     another scene from the dolliver romance   footnote this scene was not revised by the author but is printed from his first draught  we may now suppose grandsir dolliver to have finished his breakfast with a better appetite and sharper perception of the qualities of his food than he has generally felt of late years whether it were due to old marthas cookery or to the cordial of the night before little pansie had also made an end of her bread and milk with entire satisfaction and afterwards nibbled a crust greatly enjoying its resistance to her little white teeth  how this child came by the odd name of pansie and whether it was really her baptismal name i have not ascertained more probably it was one of those pet appellations that grow out of a childs character or out of some keen thrill of affection in the parents an unsoughtfor and unconscious felicity a kind of revelation teaching them the true name by which the childs guardian angel would know ita name with playfulness and love in it that we often observe to supersede in the practice of those who love the child best the name that they carefully selected and caused the clergyman to plaster indelibly on the poor little forehead at the fontthe lovename whereby if the child lives the parents know it in their hearts or by which if it dies god seems to have called it away leaving the sound lingering faintly and sweetly through the house in pansies case it may have been a certain pensiveness which was sometimes seen under her childish frolic and so translated itself into french pensée her mother having been of acadian kin or quite as probably it alluded merely to the color of her eyes which in some lights were very like the dark petals of a tuft of pansies in the doctors garden it might well be indeed on account of the suggested pensiveness for the childs gayety had no example to sustain it no sympathy of other children or grown peopleand her melancholy had it been so dark a feeling was but the shadow of the house and of the old man if brighter sunshine came she would brighten with it this morning surely as the three companions pansie puss and grandsir dolliver emerged from the shadow of the house into the small adjoining enclosure they seemed all frolicsome alike  the doctor however was intent over something that had reference to his lifelong business of drugs this little spot was the place where he was wont to cultivate a variety of herbs supposed to be endowed with medicinal virtue some of them had been long known in the pharmacopia of the old world and others in the early days of the country had been adopted by the first settlers from the indian medicinemen though with fear and even contrition because these wild doctors were supposed to draw their pharmaceutic knowledge from no gracious source the black man himself being the principal professor in their medical school from his own experience however dr dolliver had long since doubted though he was not bold enough quite to come to the conclusion that indian shrubs and the remedies prepared from them were much less perilous than those so freely used in european practice and singularly apt to be followed by results quite as propitious into such heterodoxy our friend was the more liable to fall because it had been taught him early in life by his old master dr swinnerton who at those not infrequent times when he indulged a certain unhappy predilection for strong waters had been accustomed to inveigh in terms of the most cynical contempt and coarsest ridicule against the practice by which he lived and as he affirmed inflicted death on his fellowmen our old apothecary though too loyal to the learned profession with which he was connected fully to believe this bitter judgment even when pronounced by his revered master was still so far influenced that his conscience was possibly a little easier when making a preparation from forest herbs and roots than in the concoction of half a score of nauseous poisons into a single elaborate drug as the fashion of that day was  but there were shrubs in the garden of which he had never ventured to make a medical use nor indeed did he know their virtue although from year to year he had tended and fertilized weeded and pruned them with something like religious care they were of the rarest character and had been planted by the learned and famous dr swinnerton who on his death bed when he left his dwelling and all his abstruse manuscripts to his favorite pupil had particularly directed his attention to this row of shrubs they had been collected by himself from remote countries and had the poignancy of torrid climes in them and he told him that properly used they would be worth all the rest of the legacy a hundredfold as the apothecary however found the manuscripts in which he conjectured there was a treatise on the subject of these shrubs mostly illegible and quite beyond his comprehension in such passages as he succeeded in puzzling out partly perhaps owing to his very imperfect knowledge of latin in which language they were written he had never derived from them any of the promised benefit and to say the truth remembering that dr swinnerton himself never appeared to triturate or decoct or do anything else with the mysterious herbs our old friend was inclined to imagine the weighty commendation of their virtues to have been the idly solemn utterance of mental aberration at the hour of death so with the integrity that belonged to his character he had nurtured them as tenderly as was possible in the ungenial climate and soil of new england putting some of them into pots for the winter but they had rather dwindled than flourished and he had reaped no harvests from them nor observed them with any degree of scientific interest  his grandson however while yet a schoolboy had listened to the old mans legend of the miraculous virtues of these plants and it took so firm a hold of his mind that the row of outlandish vegetables seemed rooted in it and certainly flourished there with richer luxuriance than in the soil where they actually grew the story acting thus early upon his imagination may be said to have influenced his brief career in life and perchance brought about its early close the young man in the opinion of competent judges was endowed with remarkable abilities and according to the rumor of the people had wonderful gifts which were proved by the cures he had wrought with remedies of his own invention his talents lay in the direction of scientific analysis and inventive combination of chemical powers while under the pupilage of his grandfather his progress had rapidly gone quite beyond his instructors hopeleaving him even to tremble at the audacity with which he overturned and invented theories and to wonder at the depth at which he wrought beneath the superficialness and mockmystery of the medical science of those days like a miner sinking his shaft and running a hideous peril of the earth caving in above him especially did he devote himself to these plants and under his care they had thriven beyond all former precedent bursting into luxuriance of bloom and most of them bearing beautiful flowers which however in two or three instances had the sort of natural repulsiveness that the serpent has in its beauty compelled against its will as it were to warn the beholder of an unrevealed danger the young man had long ago it must be added demanded of his grandfather the documents included in the legacy of professor swinnerton and had spent days and nights upon them growing pale over their mystic lore which seemed the fruit not merely of the professors own labors but of those of more ancient sages than he and often a whole volume seemed to be compressed within the limits of a few lines of crabbed manuscript judging from the time which it cost even the quickminded student to decipher them  meantime these abstruse investigations had not wrought such disastrous effects as might have been feared in causing edward dolliver to neglect the humble trade the conduct of which his grandfather had now relinquished almost entirely into his hands on the contrary with the mere side results of his study or what may be called the chips and shavings of his real work he created a prosperity quite beyond anything that his simpleminded predecessor had ever hoped for even at the most sanguine epoch of his life the young mans adventurous endowments were miraculously alive and connecting themselves with his remarkable ability for solid research and perhaps his conscience being as yet imperfectly developed as it sometimes lies dormant in the young he spared not to produce compounds which if the names were anywise to be trusted would supersede all other remedies and speedily render any medicine a needless thing making the trade of apothecary an untenable one and the title of doctor obsolete whether there was real efficacy in these nostrums and whether their author himself had faith in them is more than can safely be said but at all events the public believed in them and thronged to the old and dim sign of the brazen serpent which though hitherto familiar to them and their forefathers now seemed to shine with auspicious lustre as if its old scriptural virtues were renewed if any faith was to be put in human testimony many marvellous cures were really performed the fame of which spread far and wide and caused demands for these medicines to come in from places far beyond the precincts of the little town our old apothecary now degraded by the overshadowing influence of his grandsons character to a position not much above that of a shopboy stood behind the counter with a face sad and distrustful and yet with an odd kind of fitful excitement in it as if he would have liked to enjoy this new prosperity had he dared then his venerable figure was to be seen dispensing these questionable compounds by the single bottle and by the dozen wronging his simple conscience as he dealt out what he feared was trash or worse shrinking from the reproachful eyes of every ancient physician who might chance to be passing by but withal examining closely the silver or the new england coarsely printed bills which he took in payment as if apprehensive that the delusive character of the commodity which he sold might be balanced by equal counterfeiting in the money received or as if his faith in all things were shaken  is it not possible that this gifted young man had indeed found out those remedies which nature has provided and laid away for the cure of every ill  the disastrous termination of the most brilliant epoch that ever came to the brazen serpent must be told in a few words one night edward dollivers young wife awoke and seeing the gray dawn creeping into the chamber while her husband it should seem was still engaged in his laboratory arose in her nightdress and went to the door of the room to put in her gentle remonstrance against such labor there she found him deadsunk down out of his chair upon the hearth where were some ashes apparently of burnt manuscripts which appeared to comprise most of those included in dr swinnertons legacy though one or two had fallen near the heap and lay merely scorched beside it it seemed as if he had thrown them into the fire under a sudden impulse in a great hurry and passion it may be that he had come to the perception of something fatally false and deceptive in the successes which he had appeared to win and was too proud and too conscientious to survive it doctors were called in but had no power to revive him an inquest was held at which the jury under the instruction perhaps of those same revengeful doctors expressed the opinion that the poor young man being given to strange contrivances with poisonous drugs had died by incautiously tasting them himself this verdict and the terrible event itself at once deprived the medicines of all their popularity and the poor old apothecary was no longer under any necessity of disturbing his conscience by selling them they at once lost their repute and ceased to be in any demand in the few instances in which they were tried the experiment was followed by no good results and even those individuals who had fancied themselves cured and had been loudest in spreading the praises of these beneficent compounds now as if for the utter demolition of the poor youths credit suffered under a recurrence of the worst symptoms and in more than one case perished miserably insomuch for the days of witchcraft were still within the memory of living men and women it was the general opinion that satan had been personally concerned in this affliction and that the brazen serpent so long honored among them was really the type of his subtle malevolence and perfect iniquity it was rumored even that all preparations that came from the shop were harmful that teeth decayed that had been made pearly white by the use of the young chemists dentifrice that cheeks were freckled that had been changed to damask roses by his cosmetics that hair turned gray or fell off that had become black glossy and luxuriant from the application of his mixtures that breath which his drugs had sweetened had now a sulphurous smell moreover all the money heretofore amassed by the sale of them had been exhausted by edward dolliver in his lavish expenditure for the processes of his study and nothing was left for pansie except a few valueless and unsalable bottles of medicine and one or two others perhaps more recondite than their inventor had seen fit to offer to the public  little pansies mother lived but a short time after the shock of the terrible catastrophe and as we began our story with saying she was left with no better guardianship or support than might be found in the efforts of a long superannuated man  nothing short of the simplicity integrity and piety of grandsir dollivers character known and acknowledged as far back as the oldest inhabitants remembered anything and inevitably discoverable by the dullest and most prejudiced observers in all its natural manifestations could have protected him in still creeping about the streets so far as he was personally concerned however all bitterness and suspicion had speedily passed away and there remained still the careless and neglectful goodwill and the prescriptive reverence not altogether reverential which the world heedlessly awards to the unfortunate individual who outlives his generation  and now that we have shown the reader sufficiently or at least to the best of our knowledge and perhaps at tedious length what was the present position of grandsir dolliver we may let our story pass onward though at such a pace as suits the feeble gait of an old man  the peculiarly brisk sensation of this morning to which we have more than once alluded enabled the doctor to toil pretty vigorously at his medicinal herbshis catnip his vervain and the like but he did not turn his attention to the row of mystic plants with which so much of trouble and sorrow either was or appeared to be connected in truth his old soul was sick of them and their very fragrance which the warm sunshine made strongly perceptible was odious to his nostrils but the spicy homelike scent of his other herbs the english simples was grateful to him and so was the earthsmell as he turned up the soil about their roots and eagerly snuffed it in little pansie on the other hand perhaps scandalized at greatgrandpapas neglect of the prettiest plants in his garden resolved to do her small utmost towards balancing his injustice so with an old shingle fallen from the roof which she had appropriated as her agricultural tool she began to dig about them pulling up the weeds as she saw grandpapa doing the kitten too with a look of elfish sagacity lent her assistance plying her paws with vast haste and efficiency at the roots of one of the shrubs this particular one was much smaller than the rest perhaps because it was a native of the torrid zone and required greater care than the others to make it flourish so that shrivelled cankered and scarcely showing a green leaf both pansie and the kitten probably mistook it for a weed after their joint efforts had made a pretty big trench about it the little girl seized the shrub with both hands bestriding it with her plump little legs and giving so vigorous a pull that long accustomed to be transplanted annually it came up by the roots and little pansie came down in a sitting posture making a broad impress on the soft earth see see doctor cries pansie comically enough giving him his title of courtesylook grandpapa the big naughty weed  now the doctor had at once a peculiar dread and a peculiar value for this identical shrub both because his grandsons investigations had been applied more ardently to it than to all the rest and because it was associated in his mind with an ancient and sad recollection for he had never forgotten that his wife the early lost had once taken a fancy to wear its flowers day after day through the whole season of their bloom in her bosom where they glowed like a gem and deepened her somewhat pallid beauty with a richness never before seen in it at least such was the effect which this tropical flower imparted to the beloved form in his memory and thus it somehow both brightened and wronged her this had happened not long before her death and whenever in the subsequent years this plant had brought its annual flower it had proved a kind of talisman to bring up the image of bessie radiant with this glow that did not really belong to her naturally passive beauty quickly interchanging with another image of her form with the snow of death on cheek and forehead this reminiscence had remained among the things of which the doctor was always conscious but had never breathed a word through the whole of his long lifea sprig of sensibility that perhaps helped to keep him tenderer and purer than other men who entertain no such follies and the sight of the shrub often brought back the faint golden gleam of her hair as if her spirit were in the sunlights of the garden quivering into view and out of it and therefore when he saw what pansie had done he sent forth a strange inarticulate hoarse tremulous exclamation a sort of aged and decrepit cry of mingled emotion naughty pansie to pull up grandpapas flower said he as soon as he could speak poison pansie poison fling it away child  and dropping his spade the old gentleman scrambled towards the little girl as quickly as his rusty joints would let himwhile pansie as apprehensive and quick of motion as a fawn started up with a shriek of mirth and fear to escape him it so happened that the gardengate was ajar and a puff of wind blowing it wide open she escaped through this fortuitous avenue followed by greatgrandpapa and the kitten  stop naughty pansie stop shouted our old friend you will tumble into the grave the kitten with the singular sensitiveness that seems to affect it at every kind of excitement was now on her back  and indeed this portentous warning was better grounded and had a more literal meaning than might be supposed for the swinging gate communicated with the burialground and almost directly in little pansies track there was a newly dug grave ready to receive its tenant that afternoon pansie however fled onward with outstretched arms half in fear half in fun plying her round little legs with wonderful promptitude as if to escape time or death in the person of grandsir dolliver and happily avoiding the ominous pitfall that lies in every persons path till hearing a groan from her pursuer she looked over her shoulder and saw that poor grandpapa had stumbled over one of the many hillocks she then suddenly wrinkled up her little visage and sent forth a fullbreathed roar of sympathy and alarm  grandpapa has broken his neck now cried little pansie amid her sobs  kiss grandpapa and make it well then said the old gentleman recollecting her remedy and scrambling up more readily than could be expected well he murmured to himself a hairsbreadth more and i should have been tumbled into yonder grave poor little pansie what wouldst thou have done then  make the grass grow over grandpapa answered pansie laughing up in his face  poh poh child that is not a pretty thing to say said grandpapa pettishly and disappointed as people are apt to be when they try to calculate on the fitful sympathies of childhood come you must go in to old martha now  the poor old gentleman was in the more haste to leave the spot because he found himself standing right in front of his own peculiar row of gravestones consisting of eight or nine slabs of slate adorned with carved borders rather rudely cut and the earliest one that of his bessie bending aslant because the frost of so many winters had slowly undermined it over one grave of the row that of his gifted grandson there was no memorial he felt a strange repugnance stronger than he had ever felt before to linger by these graves and had none of the tender sorrow mingled with high and tender hopes that had sometimes made it seem good to him to be there such moods perhaps often come to the aged when the hardened earthcrust over their souls shuts them out from spiritual influences  taking the child by the handher little effervescence of infantile fun having passed into a downcast humor though not well knowing as yet what a dusky cloud of disheartening fancies arose from these green hillockshe went heavily toward the gardengate close to its threshold so that one who was issuing forth or entering must needs step upon it or over it lay a small flat stone deeply imbedded in the ground and partly covered with grass inscribed with the name of dr john swinnerton physician  ay said the old man as the wellremembered figure of his ancient instructor seemed to rise before him in his graveapparel with beard and goldheaded cane black velvet doublet and cloak here lies a man who as people have thought had it in his power to avoid the grave he had no little grandchild to tease him he had the choice to die and chose it  so the old gentleman led pansie over the stone and carefully closed the gate and as it happened he forgot the uprooted shrub which pansie as she ran had flung away and which had fallen into the open grave and when the funeral came that afternoon the coffin was let down upon it so that its bright inauspicious flower never bloomed again     another fragment of the dolliver romance   be secret and he kept his stern eye fixed upon him as the coach began to move  be secret repeated the apothecary i know not any secret that he has confided to me thus far and as for his nonsense as i will be bold to style it now he is gone about a medicine of long life it is a thing i forget in spite of myself so very empty and trashy it is i wonder by the by that it never came into my head to give the colonel a dose of the cordial whereof i partook last night i have no faith that it is a valuable medicinelittle or noneand yet there has been an unwonted briskness in me all the morning  then a simple joy broke over his facea flickering sunbeam among his wrinklesas he heard the laughter of the little girl who was running rampant with a kitten in the kitchen  pansie pansie cackled he grandpapa has sent away the ugly man now come let us have a frolic in the garden  and he whispered to himself again that is a cordial yonder and i will take it according to the prescription knowing all the ingredients then after a moments thought he added all save one  so as he had declared to himself his intention that night when little pansie had long been asleep and his small household was in bed and most of the quiet oldfashioned townsfolk likewise this good apothecary went into his laboratory and took out of a cupboard in the wall a certain ancientlooking bottle which was cased over with a network of what seemed to be woven silver like the wickerwoven bottles of our days he had previously provided a goblet of pure water before opening the bottle however he seemed to hesitate and pondered and babbled to himself having long since come to that period of life when the bodily frame having lost much of its value is more tenderly cared for than when it was a perfect and inestimable machine  i triturated i infused i distilled it myself in these very rooms and know itknow it allall the ingredients save one they are common things enoughcomfortable thingssome of them a little queerone or two that folks have a prejudice againstand then there is that one thing that i dont know it is foolish in me to be dallying with such a mess which i thought was a piece of quackery while that strange visitor bade me do itand yet what a strength has come from it he said it was a rare cordial and methinks it has brightened up my weary life all day so that pansie has found me the fitter playmate and then the doseit is so absurdly small i will try it again  he took the silver stopple from the bottle and with a practised hand tremulous as it was with age so that one would have thought it must have shaken the liquor into a perfect shower of misapplied drops he droppedi have heard it saidonly one single drop into the goblet of water it fell into it with a dazzling brightness like a spark of ruby flame and subtly diffusing itself through the whole body of water turned it to a rosy hue of great brilliancy he held it up between his eyes and the light and seemed to admire and wonder at it  it is very odd said he that such a pure bright liquor should have come out of a parcel of weeds that mingled their juices here the thing is a follyit is one of those compositions in which the chemiststhe cabalists perhapsused to combine what they thought the virtues of many plants thinking that something would result in the whole which was not in either of them and a new efficacy be created whereas it has been the teaching of my experience that one virtue counteracts another and is the enemy of it i never believed the former theory even when that strange madman bade me do it and what a thick turbid matter it was until that last ingredientthat powder which he put in with his own hand had he let me see it i would first have analyzed it and discovered its component parts the man was mad undoubtedly and this may have been poison but its effect is good poh i will taste again because of this weak agued miserable state of mine though it is a shame in me a man of decent skill in my way to believe in a quacks nostrum but it is a comfortable kind of thing  meantime that single drop for good dr dolliver had immediately put a stopper into the bottle diffused a sweet odor through the chamber so that the ordinary fragrances and scents of apothecaries stuff seemed to be controlled and influenced by it and its bright potency also dispelled a certain dimness of the antiquated room  the doctor at the pressure of a great need had given incredible pains to the manufacture of this medicine so that reckoning the pains rather than the ingredients all except one of which he was not able to estimate the cost nor value it was really worth its weight in gold and as it happened he had bestowed upon it the hard labor of his poor life and the time that was necessary for the support of his family without return for the customers after playing off this cruel joke upon the old man had never come back and now for seven years the bottle had stood in a corner of the cupboard to be sure the silvercased bottle was worth a trifle for its silver and still more perhaps as an antiquarian knick knack but all things considered the honest and simple apothecary thought that he might make free with the liquid to such small extent as was necessary for himself and there had been something in the concoction that had struck him and he had been fast breaking lately and so in the dreary fantasy and lonely recklessness of his old age he had suddenly bethought himself of this medicine cordialas the strange man called it which had come to him by long inheritance in his family and he had determined to try it and again as the night before he took out the receipta roll of antique parchment out of which provokingly one fold had been lostand put on his spectacles to puzzle out the passage  guttam unicam in aquam puram two gills if the colonel should hear of this said dr dolliver he might fancy it his nostrum of long life and insist on having the bottle for his own use the foolish fierce old gentleman he has grown very earthly of late else he would not desire such a thing and a strong desire it must be to make him feel it desirable for my part i only wish for something that for a short time may clear my eyes so that i may see little pansies beauty and quicken my ears that i may hear her sweet voice and give me nerve while god keeps me here that i may live longer to earn bread for dear pansie she provided for i would gladly lie down yonder with bessie and our children ah the vanity of desiring lengthened daystherei have drunk it and methinks its final subtle flavor hath strange potency in it  the old man shivered a little as those shiver who have just swallowed good liquor while it is permeating their vitals yet he seemed to be in a pleasant state of feeling and as was frequently the case with this simple soul in a devout frame of mind he read a chapter in the bible and said his prayers for pansie and himself before he went to bed and had much better sleep than usually comes to people of his advanced age for at that period sleep is diffused through their wakefulness and a dim and tiresome halfperception through their sleep so that the only result is weariness  nothing very extraordinary happened to dr dolliver or his small household for some time afterwards he was favored with a comfortable winter and thanked heaven for it and put it to a good use at least he intended it so by concocting drugs which perhaps did a little towards peopling the graveyard into which his windows looked but that was neither his purpose nor his fault none of the sleepers at all events interrupted their slumbers to upbraid him he had done according to his own artless conscience and the recipes of licensed physicians and he looked no further but pounded triturated infused made electuaries boluses juleps or whatever he termed his productions with skill and diligence thanking heaven that he was spared to do so when his contemporaries generally were getting incapable of similar efforts it struck him with some surprise but much gratitude to providence that his sight seemed to be growing rather better than worse he certainly could read the crabbed handwriting and hieroglyphics of the physicians with more readiness than he could a year earlier but he had been originally nearsighted with large projecting eyes and nearsighted eyes always seem to get a new lease of light as the years go on one thing was perceptible about the doctors eyes not only to himself in the glass but to everybody else namely that they had an unaccustomed gleaming brightness in them not so very bright either but yet so much so that little pansie noticed it and sometimes in her playful roguish way climbed up into his lap and put both her small palms over them telling grandpapa that he had stolen somebody elses eyes and given away his own and that she liked his old ones better the poor old doctor did his best to smile through his eyes and so to reconcile pansie to their brightness but still she continually made the same silly remonstrance so that he was fain to put on a pair of green spectacles when he was going to play with pansie or took her on his knee nay if he looked at her as had always been his custom after she was asleep in order to see that all was well with her the little child would put up her hands as if he held a light that was flashing on her eyeballs and unless he turned away his gaze quickly she would wake up in a fit of crying  on the whole the apothecary had as comfortable a time as a man of his years could expect the air of the house and of the old graveyard seemed to suit him what so seldom happens in mans advancing age his nights rest did him good whereas generally an old man wakes up ten times as nervous and dispirited as he went to bed just as if during his sleep he had been working harder than ever he did in the daytime it had been so with the doctor himself till within a few months to be sure he had latterly begun to practise various rules of diet and exercise which commended themselves to his approbation he sawed some of his own fire wood and fancied that as was reasonable it fatigued him less day by day he took walks with pansie and though of course her little footsteps treading on the elastic air of childhood far outstripped his own still the old man knew that he was not beyond the recuperative period of life and that exercise out of doors and proper food can do somewhat towards retarding the approach of age he was inclined also to impute much good effect to a daily dose of santa cruz rum a liquor much in vogue in that day which he was now in the habit of quaffing at the meridian hour all through the doctors life he had eschewed strong spirits but after seventy quoth old dr dolliver a man is all the better in head and stomach for a little stimulus and it certainly seemed so in his case likewise i know not precisely how often but complying punctiliously with the recipe as an apothecary naturally would he took his drop of the mysterious cordial  he was inclined however to impute little or no efficacy to this and to laugh at himself for having ever thought otherwise the dose was so very minute and he had never been sensible of any remarkable effect on taking it after all a genial warmth he sometimes fancied diffused itself throughout him and perhaps continued during the next day a quiet and refreshing nights rest followed and alacritous waking in the morning but all this was far more probably owing as has been already hinted to excellent and wellconsidered habits of diet and exercise nevertheless he still continued the cordial with tolerable regularitythe more because on one or two occasions happening to omit it it so chanced that he slept wretchedly and awoke in strange aches and pains torpors nervousness shaking of the hands blearedness of sight lowness of spirits and other ills as is the misfortune of some old menwho are often threatened by a thousand evil symptoms that come to nothing foreboding no particular disorder and passing away as unsatisfactorily as they come at another time he took two or three drops at once and was alarmingly feverish in consequence yet it was very true that the feverish symptoms were pretty sure to disappear on his renewal of the medicine still it could not be that thought the old man a hater of empiricism in which however is contained all hope for man and disinclined to believe in anything that was not according to rule and art and then as aforesaid the dose was so ridiculously small  sometimes however he took half laughingly another view of it and felt disposed to think that chance might really have thrown in his way a very remarkable mixture by which if it had happened to him earlier in life he might have amassed a larger fortune and might even have raked together such a competency as would have prevented his feeling much uneasiness about the future of little pansie feeling as strong as he did nowadays he might reasonably count upon ten years more of life and in that time the precious liquor might be exchanged for much gold let us see quoth he by what attractive name shall it be advertised the old mans cordial that promises too little poh poh i would stain my honesty my fair reputation the accumulation of a lifetime and befool my neighbor and the public by any name that would make them imagine i had found that ridiculous talisman that the alchemists have sought the old mans cordialthat is best and five shillings sterling the bottle that surely were not too costly and would give the medicine a better reputation and higher vogue so foolish is the world than if i were to put it lower i will think further of this but pshaw pshaw  what is the matter grandpapa said little pansie who had stood by him wishing to speak to him at least a minute but had been deterred by his absorption why do you say pshaw  pshaw repeated grandpapa there is one ingredient that i dont know  so this very hopeful design was necessarily given up but that it had occurred to dr dolliver was perhaps a token that his mind was in a very vigorous state for it had been noted of him through life that he had little enterprise little activity and that for the want of these things his very considerable skill in his art had been almost thrown away as regarded his private affairs when it might easily have led him to fortune whereas here in his extreme age he had first bethought himself of a way to grow rich sometimes this latter spring causesas blossoms come on the autumnal treea spurt of vigor or untimely greenness when nature laughs at her old child half in kindness and half in scorn it is observable however i fancy that after such a spurt age comes on with redoubled speed and that the old man has only run forward with a show of force in order to fall into his grave the sooner  sometimes as he was walking briskly along the street with little pansie clasping his hand and perhaps frisking rather more than became a person of his venerable years he had met the grim old wreck of colonel dabney moving goutily and gathering wrath anew with every touch of his painful foot to the ground or driving by in his carriage showing an ashen angry wrinkled face at the window and frowning at himthe apothecary thoughtwith a peculiar fury as if he took umbrage at his audacity in being less broken by age than a gentleman like himself the apothecary could not help feeling as if there were some unsettled quarrel or dispute between himself and the colonel he could not tell what or why the colonel always gave him a haughty nod of halfrecognition and the people in the street to whom he was a familiar object would say the worshipful colonel begins to find himself mortal like the rest of us he feels his years hed be glad i warrant said one to change with you doctor it shows what difference a good life makes in men to look at him and you you are half a score of years his elder methinks and yet look what temperance can do for a man by my credit neighbor seeing how brisk you have been lately i told my wife you seemed to be growing younger it does me good to see it we are about of an age i think and i like to notice how we old men keep young and keep one another in heart i myselfahemahemfeel younger this season than for these five years past  it rejoices me that you feel so quoth the apothecary who had just been thinking that this neighbor of his had lost a great deal both in mind and body within a short period and rather scorned him for it indeed i find old age less uncomfortable than i supposed little pansie and i make excellent companions for one another  and then dragged along by pansies little hand and also impelled by a certain alacrity that rose with him in the morning and lasted till his healthy rest at night he bade farewell to his contemporary and hastened on while the latter left behind was somewhat irritated as he looked at the vigorous movement of the apothecarys legs  he need not make such a show of briskness neither muttered he to himself this touch of rheumatism troubles me a bit just now but try it on a good day and id walk with him for a shilling pshaw ill walk to his funeral yet  one day while the doctor with the activity that bestirred itself in him nowadays was mixing and manufacturing certain medicaments that came in frequent demand a carriage stopped at his door and he recognized the voice of colonel dabney talking in his customary stern tone to the woman who served him and a moment afterwards the coach drove away and he actually heard the old dignitary lumbering up stairs and bestowing a curse upon each particular step as if that were the method to make them soften and become easier when he should come down again pray your worship said the doctor from above let me attend you below stairs  no growled the colonel ill meet you on your own ground i can climb a stair yet and be hanged to you  so saying he painfully finished the ascent and came into the laboratory where he let himself fall into the doctors easychair with an anathema on the chair the doctor and himself and staring round through the dusk he met the wideopen startled eyes of little pansie who had been reading a gilt picturebook in the corner  send away that child dolliver cried the colonel angrily confound her she makes my bones ache i hate everything young  lord colonel the poor apothecary ventured to say there must be young people in the world as well as old ones t is my mind a mans grandchildren keep him warm round about him  i have none and want none sharply responded the colonel and as for young people let me be one of them and they may exist otherwise not it is a cursed bad arrangement of the world that there are young and old here together  when pansie had gone away which she did with anything but reluctance having a natural antipathy to this monster of a colonel the latter personage tapped with his crutchhandled cane on a chair that stood near and nodded in an authoritative way to the apothecary to sit down in it dr dolliver complied submissively and the colonel with dull unkindly eyes looked at him sternly and with a kind of intelligence amid the aged stolidity of his aspect that somewhat puzzled the doctor in this way he surveyed him all over like a judge when he means to hang a man and for some reason or none the apothecary felt his nerves shake beneath this steadfast look  aha doctor said the colonel at last with a doltish sneer you bear your years well  decently well colonel i thank providence for it answered the meek apothecary  i should say quoth the colonel you are younger at this moment than when we spoke together two or three years ago i noted then that your eyebrows were a handsome snowwhite such as befits a man who has passed beyond his threescore years and ten and five years more why they are getting dark again mr apothecary  nay your worship must needs be mistaken there said the doctor with a timorous chuckle it is many a year since i have taken a deliberate note of my wretched old visage in a glass but i remember they were white when i looked last  come doctor i know a thing or two said the colonel with a bitter scoff and whats this you old rogue why youve rubbed away a wrinkle since we met take off those infernal spectacles and look me in the face ha i see the devil in your eye how dare you let it shine upon me so  on my conscience colonel said the apothecary strangely struck with the coincidence of this accusation with little pansies complaint i know not what you mean my sight is pretty well for a man of my age we near sighted people begin to know our best eyesight when other people have lost theirs  ah ah old rogue repeated the insufferable colonel gnashing his ruined teeth at him as if for some incomprehensible reason he wished to tear him to pieces and devour him i know you you are taking the life away from me villain and i told you it was my inheritance and i told you there was a bloody footstep bearing its track down through my race  i remember nothing of it said the doctor in a quake sure that the colonel was in one of his mad fits and on the word of an honest man i never wronged you in my life colonel  we shall see said the colonel whose wrinkled visage grew absolutely terrible with its hardness and his dull eyes without losing their dulness seemed to look through him  listen to me sir some ten years ago there came to you a man on a secret business he had an old musty bit of parchment on which were written some words hardly legible in an antique handan old deed it might have beensome family document and here and there the letters were faded away but this man had spent his life over it and he had made out the meaning and he interpreted it to you and left it with you only there was one gapone torn or obliterated place well sirand he bade you with your poor little skill at the mortar and for a certain sum ample repayment for such a serviceto manufacture this medicinethis cordial it was an affair of months and just when you thought it finished the man came again and stood over your cursed beverage and shook a powder or dropped a lump into it or put in some ingredient in which was all the hidden virtueor at least it drew out all the hidden virtue of the mean and common herbs and married them into a wondrous efficacy this done the man bade you do certain other things with the potation and went awaythe colonel hesitated a momentand never came back again  surely colonel you are correct said the apothecary much startled however at the colonels showing himself so well acquainted with an incident which he had supposed a secret with himself alone yet he had a little reluctance in owning it although he did not exactly understand why since the colonel had apparently no rightful claim to it at all events  that medicine that receipt continued his visitor is my hereditary property and i challenge you on your peril to give it up  but what if the original owner should call upon me for it objected dr dolliver  ill warrant you against that said the colonel and the apothecary thought there was something ghastly in his look and tone why t is ten year you old fool and do you think a man with a treasure like that in his possession would have waited so long  seven years it was ago said the apothecary septem annis passatis so says the latin  curse your latin answers the colonel produce the stuff you have been violating the first rule of your tradetaking your own drugsyour own in one sense mine by the right of three hundred years bring it forth i say  pray excuse me worthy colonel pleaded the apothecary for though convinced that the old gentleman was only in one of his insane fits when he talked of the value of this concoction yet he really did not like to give up the cordial which perhaps had wrought him some benefit besides he had at least a claim upon it for much trouble and skill expended in its composition this he suggested to the colonel who scornfully took out of his pocket a network purse with more golden guineas in it than the apothecary had seen in the whole seven years and was rude enough to fling it in his face take that thundered he and give up the thing or i will have you in prison before you are an hour older nay he continued growing pale which was his mode of showing terrible wrath since all through life till extreme age quenched it his ordinary face had been a blazingred ill put you to death you villain as ive a right and thrusting his hand into his waistcoat pocket lo the madman took a small pistol from it which he cocked and presented at the poor apothecary the old fellow quaked and cowered in his chair and would indeed have given his whole shopful of better concocted medicines than this to be out of this danger besides there were the guineas the colonel had paid him a princely sum for what was probably worth nothing  hold hold cried he as the colonel with stern eye pointed the pistol at his head you shall have it  so he rose all trembling and crept to that secret cupboard where the precious bottlesince precious it seemed to bewas reposited in all his life long as it had been the apothecary had never before been threatened by a deadly weapon though many as deadly a thing had he seen poured into a glass without winking and so it seemed to take his heart and life away and he brought the cordial forth feebly and stood tremulously before the colonel ashy pale and looking ten years older than his real age instead of five years younger as he had seemed just before this disastrous interview with the colonel  you look as if you needed a drop of it yourself said colonel dabney with great scorn but not a drop shall you have already have you stolen too much said he lifting up the bottle and marking the space to which the liquor had subsided in it in consequence of the minute doses with which the apothecary had made free fool had you taken your glass like a man you might have been young again now creep on the few months you have left poor torpid knave and die comea goblet quick  he clutched the bottle meanwhile voraciously miserly eagerly furiously as if it were his life that he held in his grasp angry impatient as if something long sought were within his reach and not yet securewith longing thirst and desire suspicious of the world and of fate feeling as if an iron hand were over him and a crowd of violent robbers round about him struggling for it at last unable to wait longer just as the apothecary was tottering away in quest of a drinkingglass the colonel took out the stopple and lifted the flask itself to his lips  for heavens sake no cried the doctor the dose is one single drop one drop colonel one drop  not a drop to save your wretched old soul responded the colonel probably thinking that the apothecary was pleading for a small share of the precious liquor he put it to his lips and as if quenching a lifelong thirst swallowed deep draughts sucking it in with desperation till void of breath he set it down upon the table the rich poignant perfume spread itself through the air  the apothecary with an instinctive carefulness that was rather ludicrous under the circumstances caught up the stopper which the colonel had let fall and forced it into the bottle to prevent any farther escape of virtue he then fearfully watched the result of the madmans potation  the colonel sat a moment in his chair panting for breath then started to his feet with a prompt vigor that contrasted widely with the infirm and rheumatic movements that had heretofore characterized him he struck his forehead violently with one hand and smote his chest with the other he stamped his foot thunderously on the ground then he leaped up to the ceiling and came down with an elastic bound then he laughed a wild exulting ha ha with a strange triumphant roar that filled the house and reechoed through it a sound full of fierce animal raptureenjoyment of sensual life mixed up with a sort of horror after all real as it was it was like the sounds a man makes in a dream and this while the potent draught seemed still to be making its way through his system and the frightened apothecary thought that he intended a revengeful onslaught upon himself finally he uttered a loud unearthly screech in the midst of which his voice broke as if some unseen hand were throttling him and starting forward he fought frantically as if he would clutch the life that was being rent awayand fell forward with a dead thump upon the floor  colonel colonel cried the terrified doctor  the feeble old man with difficulty turned over the heavy frame and saw at once with practised eye that he was dead he set him up and the corpse looked at him with angry reproach he was so startled that his subsequent recollections of the moment were neither distinct nor steadfast but he fancied though he told the strange impression to no one that on his first glimpse of the face with a dark flush of what looked like rage still upon it it was a young mans face that he sawa face with all the passionate energy of early manhoodthe capacity for furious anger which the man had lost half a century ago crammed to the brim with vigor till it became agony but the next moment if it were so which it could not have been the face grew ashen withered shrunken more aged than in life though still the murderous fierceness remained and seemed to be petrified forever upon it  after a moments bewilderment dolliver ran to the window looking to the street threw it open and called loudly for assistance he opened also another window for the air to blow through for he was almost stifled with the rich odor of the cordial which filled the room and was now exuded from the corpse  he heard the voice of pansie crying at the door which was locked and turning the key he caught her in his arms and hastened with her below stairs to give her into the charge of martha who seemed half stupefied with a sense of something awful that had occurred  meanwhile there was a rattling and a banging at the street portal to which several people had been attracted both by the doctors outcry from the window and by the awful screech in which the colonels spirit if indeed he had that divine part had just previously taken its flight  he let them in and pale and shivering ushered them up to the death chamber where one or two with a more delicate sense of smelling than the rest snuffed the atmosphere as if sensible of an unknown fragrance yet appeared afraid to breathe when they saw the terrific countenance leaning back against the chair and eying them so truculently  i would fain quit the scene and have done with the colonel who i am glad has happened to die at so early a period of the narrative i therefore hasten to say that a coroners inquest was held on the spot though everybody felt that it was merely ceremonial and that the testimony of their good and ancient townsman dr dolliver was amply sufficient to settle the matter the verdict was death by the visitation of god  the apothecary gave evidence that the colonel without asking leave and positively against his advice had drunk a quantity of distilled spirits and one or two servants or members of the colonels family testified that he had been in a very uncomfortable state of mind for some days past so that they fancied he was insane therefore nobody thought of blaming dr dolliver for what had happened and if the plain truth must be told everybody who saw the wretch was too well content to be rid of him to trouble themselves more than was quite necessary about the way in which the incumbrance had been removed  the corpse was taken to the mansion in order to receive a magnificent funeral and dr dolliver was left outwardly in quiet but much disturbed and indeed almost overwhelmed inwardly by what had happened  yet it is to be observed that he had accounted for the death with a singular dexterity of expression when he attributed it to a dose of distilled spirits what kind of distilled spirits were those doctor and will you venture to take any more of them
