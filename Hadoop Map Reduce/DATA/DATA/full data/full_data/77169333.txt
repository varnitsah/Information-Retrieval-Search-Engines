77169333	the white feather  by p g wodehouse     to  my brother  dick    the time of this story is a year and a term later than   that of the gold bat the history of wrykyn in   between these two books is dealt with in a number of   short stories some of them brainy in the extreme which   have appeared in various magazines i wanted messrs black   to publish these but they were light on their

xxiii   a surprise for seymours  xxiv    bruce explains     i  expert opinions   with apologies to gent opposite said clowes i must say i dont think much of the team  dont apologise to me said allardyce disgustedly as he filled the teapot i think theyre rotten  they ought to have got into form by now too said trevor its not as if this was the first game of the term  first game allardyce laughed shortly why weve only got a couple of club matches and the return match with ripton to end the season it is about time they got into form as you say  clowes stared pensively into the fire  they struck me he said as the sort of team whod get into form somewhere in the middle of the cricket season  thats about it said allardyce try those biscuits trevor theyre about the only good thing left in the place  school isnt what it was inquired trevor plunging a hand into the tin that stood on the floor beside him  no said allardyce not only in footer but in everything the place seems absolutely rotten its bad enough losing all our matches or nearly all did you hear that ripton took thirtyseven points off us last term and we only just managed to beat greenburgh by a try to nil  we got thirty points last year he went on thirtythree and fortytwo the year before why weve always simply walked them its an understood thing that we smash them and this year they held us all the time and it was only a fluke that we scored at all their back miskicked and let barry in  barry struck me as the best of the outsides today said clowes hes heavier than he was and faster  hes all right agreed allardyce if only the centres would feed him we might do something occasionally but did you ever see such a pair of rotters  the man who was marking me certainly didnt seem particularly brilliant i dont even know his name he didnt do anything at footer in my time said trevor  hes a chap called attell he wasnt here with you he came after the summer holidays i believe he was sacked from somewhere hes no good but theres nobody else colours have been simply a gift this year to anyone who can do a thing only barry and myself left from last years team i never saw such a clearance as there was after the summer term  where are the boys of the old brigade sighed clowes  i dont know i wish they were here said allardyce  trevor and clowes had come down after the easter term had been in progress for a fortnight to play for an oxford a team against the school the match had resulted in an absurdly easy victory for the visitors by over forty points clowes had scored five tries off his own bat and trevor if he had not fed his wing so conscientiously would probably have scored an equal number as it was he had got through twice and also dropped a goal the two were now having a late tea with allardyce in his study allardyce had succeeded trevor as captain of football at wrykyn and had found the post anything but a sinecure  for wrykyn had fallen for the time being on evil days it was experiencing the reaction which so often takes place in a school in the year following a season of exceptional athletic prosperity with trevor as captain of football both the ripton matches had been won and also three out of the four other school matches in cricket the eleven had had an even finer record winning all their school matches and likewise beating the mcc and old wrykinians it was too early to prophesy concerning the fortunes of next terms cricket team but if they were going to resemble the fifteen wrykyn was doomed to the worst athletic year it had experienced for a decade  its a bit of a comedown after last season isnt it resumed allardyce returning to his sorrows it was a relief to him to discuss his painful case without restraint  we were a fine team last year agreed clowes and especially strong on the left wing by the way i see youve moved barry across  yes attell cant pass much but he passes better from right to left than from left to right so barry being our scoring man i shifted him across the chap on the other wing stanning isnt bad at times do you remember him hes in applebys then drummonds useful at half  jolly useful said trevor i thought he would be i recommended you last year to keep your eye on him  decent chap drummond said clowes  about the only one there is left in the place observed allardyce gloomily  our genial host said clowes sawing at the cake appears to have that tired feeling he seems to have lost that joie de vivre of his what  it must be pretty sickening said trevor sympathetically im glad i wasnt captain in a bad year  the rummy thing is that the worse they are the more side they stick on you see chaps who wouldnt have been in the third in a good year walking about in first fifteen blazers and first fifteen scarves and first fifteen stockings and sweaters with first fifteen colours round the edges i wonder they dont tattoo their faces with first fifteen colours  it would improve some of them said clowes  allardyce resumed his melancholy remarks but as i was saying its not only that the footers rotten that you cant help i suppose its the general beastliness of things that i bar rows with the town for instance weve been having them on and off ever since you left and itll be worse now because theres an election coming off soon are you fellows stopping for the night in the town if so i should advise you to look out for yourselves  thanks said clowes i shouldnt like to see trevor sandbagged nor indeed should ifor choicecare to be sandbagged myself but as it happens the good donaldson is putting us up so we escape the perils of the town  everybody seems so beastly slack now continued allardyce its considered the thing youre looked on as an awful blood if you say you havent done a stroke of work for a week i shouldnt mind that so much if they were some good at anything but they cant do a thing the footers rotten the gymnasium six is made up of kids an inch highwe shall probably be about ninetieth at the public schools competitionand there isnt any one who can play racquets for nuts the only thing that wrykynll do this year is to get the lightweights at aldershot drummond ought to manage that he won the feathers last time hes nearly a stone heavier now and awfully good but hes the only man we shall send up i expect now that ohara and moriarty are both gone hes the only chap we have whos up to aldershot form and nobody elsell take the trouble to practice theyre all too slack  in fact said clowes getting up as was only to be expected the school started going to the dogs directly i left we shall have to be pushing on now allardyce we promised to look in on seymour before we went to bed friend let us away  good night said allardyce  what you want said clowes solemnly is a liver pill you are looking on life too gloomily take a pill let there be no stint take two then we shall hear your merry laugh ringing through the old cloisters once more buck up and be a bright and happy lad allardyce  take more than a pill to make me that growled that soured footballer  mr seymours views on the school resembled those of allardyce wrykyn in his opinion was suffering from a reaction  its always the same he said after a very good year boys leave and its hard to fill their places i must say i did not expect quite such a clearing out after the summer we have had bad luck in that way maurice for instance and robinson both ought to have had another year at school it was quite unexpected their leaving they would have made all the difference to the forwards you must have somebody to lead the pack who has had a little experience of first fifteen matches  but even then said clowes they oughtnt to be so rank as they were this afternoon they seemed such slackers  im afraid thats the failing of the school just now agreed mr seymour they dont play themselves out they dont put just that last ounce into their work which makes all the difference  clowes thought of saying that to judge by appearances they did not put in even the first ounce but refrained however low an opinion a games master may haveand even expressof his team he does not like people to agree too cordially with his criticisms  allardyce seems rather sick about it said trevor  i am sorry for allardyce it is always unpleasant to be the only survivor of an exceptionally good team he cant forget last years matches and suffers continual disappointments because the present team does not play up to the same form  he was saying something about rows with the town said trevor after a pause  yes there has certainly been some unpleasantness lately it is the penalty we pay for being on the outskirts of a town four years out of five nothing happens but in the fifth when the school has got a little out of hand  oh then it really has got out of hand asked clowes  between ourselves yes admitted mr seymour  what sort of rows asked trevor  mr seymour couldnt explain exactly nothing as it were definiteas yet no actual complaints so far but stillwell troubleyes trouble  for instance he said a boy in my house lintonyou remember himis moving in society at this moment with a swollen lip and minus a front tooth of course i know nothing about it but i fancy he got into trouble in the town that is merely a straw which shows how the wind is blowing but if you lived on the spot you would see more what i mean there is trouble in the air and now that this election is coming on i should not wonder if things came to a head i cant remember a single election in wrykyn when there was not disorder in the town and if the school is going to join in as it probably will i shall not be sorry when the holidays come i know the headmaster is only waiting for an excuse to put the town out of bounds  but the kids have always had a few rows on with that school in the high streetwhats its namest something said clowes  judes supplied trevor  st judes said mr seymour have they i didnt know that  oh yes i dont know how it started but its been going on for two or three years now its a school house feud really but dexters are mixed up in it somehow if a school house fag goes down town he runs like an antelope along the high street unless hes got one or two friends with him i saved dozens of kids from destruction when i was at school the st judes fellows lie in wait and dash out on them i used to find school house fags fighting for their lives in back alleys the enemy fled on my approach my air of majesty overawed them  but a junior school feud matters very little said mr seymour you say it has been going on for three years and i have never heard of it till now it is when the bigger fellows get mixed up with the town that we have to interfere i wish the headmaster would put the place out of bounds entirely until the election is over except at election time the town seems to go to sleep  thats what we ought to be doing said clowes to trevor i think we had better be off now sir we promised mr donaldson to be in some time tonight  its later than i thought said mr seymour good night clowes how many tries was it that you scored this afternoon five i wish you were still here to score them for instead of against us good night trevor i was glad to see they tried you for oxford though you didnt get your blue youll be in next year all right good night  the two old wrykinians walked along the road towards donaldsons it was a fine night but misty  jove im quite tired said clowes hullo  whats up  they were opposite applebys at the moment clowes drew him into the shadow of the fence  theres a chap breaking out i saw him shinning down a rope lets wait and see who it is  a moment later somebody ran softly through the gateway and disappeared down the road that led to the town  who was it said trevor i couldnt see  i spotted him all right it was that chap who was marking me today stanning wonder what hes after perhaps hes gone to tar the statue like ohara rather a sportsman  rather a silly idiot said trevor i hope he gets caught  you always were one of those kind sympathetic chaps said clowes come on or donaldsonll be locking us out     ii  sheen at home   on the afternoon following the oxford a match sheen of seymours was sitting over the gasstove in his study with a thucydides he had been staying in that day with a cold he was always staying in everyone has his hobby that was sheens  nobody at wrykyn even at seymours seemed to know sheen very well with the exception of drummond and those who troubled to think about the matter at all rather wondered what drummond saw in him to the superficial observer the two had nothing in common drummond was good at gameshe was in the first fifteen and the second eleven and had won the feather weights at aldershotand seemed to have no interests outside them sheen on the other hand played fives for the house and that was all he was bad at cricket and had given up football by special arrangement with allardyce on the plea that he wanted all his time for work he was in for an inschool scholarship the gotford allardyce though professing small sympathy with such a degraded ambition had given him a special dispensation and since then sheen had retired from public life even more than he had done hitherto the examination for the gotford was to come off towards the end of the term  the only other wrykinians with whom sheen was known to be friendly were stanning and attell of applebys and here those who troubled to think about it wondered still more for sheen whatever his other demerits was not of the type of stanning and attell there are certain members of every public school just as there are certain members of every college at the universities who are marked men they have never been detected in any glaring breach of the rules and their manner towards the powers that be is as a rule suave even deferential yet it is one of the things which everybody knows that they are in the black books of the authorities and that sooner or later in the picturesque phrase of the new yorker they will get it in the neck to this class stanning and attell belonged it was plain to all that the former was the leading member of the firm a glance at the latter was enough to show that whatever ambitions he may have had in the direction of villainy he had not the brains necessary for really satisfactory evildoing as for stanning he pursued an even course of life always rigidly obeying the eleventh commandment thou shalt not be found out this kept him from collisions with the authorities while a ready tongue and an excellent knowledge of the art of boxinghe was after drummond the best lightweight in the placesecured him at least tolerance at the hand of the school and as a matter of fact though most of those who knew him disliked him and particularly those who like drummond were what clowes had called the old brigade he had nevertheless a tolerably large following a first fifteen man even in a bad year can generally find boys anxious to be seen about with him  that sheen should have been amongst these surprised one or two people notably mr seymour who being games master had come a good deal into contact with stanning and had not been favourably impressed the fact was that the keynote of sheens character was a fear of giving offence within limits this is not a reprehensible trait in a persons character but sheen overdid it and it frequently complicated his affairs there come times when one has to choose which of two people one shall offend by acting in one way we offend a by acting in the opposite way we annoy b sheen had found himself faced by this problem when he began to be friendly with drummond their acquaintance begun over a game of fives had progressed sheen admired drummond as the type of what he would have liked to have been if he could have managed it and drummond felt interested in sheen because nobody knew much about him he was in a way mysterious also he played the piano really well and drummond at that time would have courted anybody who could play for his benefit mumblin mose and didnt mind obliging with unlimited encores  so the two struck up an alliance and as drummond hated stanning only a shade less than stanning hated him sheen was under the painful necessity of choosing between them he chose drummond whereby he undoubtedly did wisely  sheen sat with his thucydides over the gasstove and tried to interest himself in the doings of the athenian expedition at syracuse his brain felt heavy and flabby he realised dimly that this was because he took too little exercise and he made a resolution to diminish his hours of work per diem by one and to devote that one to fives he would mention it to drummond when he came in he would probably come in to tea the board was spread in anticipation of a visit from him herbert the bootboy had been despatched to the town earlier in the afternoon and had returned with certain foodstuffs which were now stacked in an appetising heap on the table  sheen was just making something more or less like sense out of an involved passage of nikias speech in which that eminent general himself seemed to have only a hazy idea of what he was talking about when the door opened  he looked up expecting to see drummond but it was stanning he felt instantly that warm shooting sensation from which david copperfield suffered in moments of embarrassment since the advent of drummond he had avoided stanning and he could not see him without feeling uncomfortable as they were both in the sixth form and sat within a couple of yards of one another every day it will be realised that he was frequently uncomfortable  great scott said stanning swotting  sheen glanced almost guiltily at his thucydides still it was something of a relief that the other had not opened the conversation with an indictment of drummond  you see he said apologetically im in for the gotford  so am i whats the good of swotting though im not going to do a stroke  as stanning was the only one of his rivals of whom he had any real fear sheen might have replied with justice that if that was the case the more he swotted the better but he said nothing he looked at the stove and dogseared the thucydides  what a worm you are always staying in said stanning  i caught a cold watching the match yesterday  youre as flabby as stanning looked round for a simile as a doughnut why dont you take some exercise  im going to play fives i think i do need some exercise  fives why dont you play footer  i havent time i want to work  what rot im not doing a stroke  stanning seemed to derive a spiritual pride from this admission  tell you what then said stanning ill play you tomorrow after school  sheen looked a shade more uncomfortable but he made an effort and declined the invitation  i shall probably be playing drummond he said  oh all right said stanning i dont care play whom you like  there was a pause  as a matter of fact resumed stanning what i came here for was to tell you about last night i got out and went to mitchells why didnt you come didnt you get my note i sent a kid with it  mitchell was a young gentleman of rich but honest parents who had left the school at christmas he was in his fathers office and lived in his fathers house on the outskirts of the town from time to time his father went up to london on matters connected with business leaving him alone in the house on these occasions mitchell the younger would write to stanning with whom when at school he had been on friendly terms and stanning breaking out of his house after everybody had gone to bed would make his way to the mitchell residence and spend a pleasant hour or so there mitchell senior owned turkish cigarettes and a billiard table stanning appreciated both there was also a piano and stanning had brought sheen with him one night to play it the gettingout and the subsequent gettingin had nearly whitened sheens hair and it was only by a series of miracles that he had escaped detection once he felt was more than enough and when a fag from applebys had brought him stannings note containing an invitation to a second jaunt of the kind he had refused to be lured into the business again  yes i got the note he said  then why didnt you come mitchell was asking where you were  its so beastly risky  risky rot  we should get sacked if we were caught  well dont get caught then  sheen registered an internal vow that he would not  he wanted us to go again on monday will you come  idont think i will stanning said sheen it isnt worth it  you mean you funk it thats whats the matter with you  yes i do admitted sheen  as a rulein storiesthe person who owns that he is afraid gets unlimited applause and adulation and feels a glow of conscious merit but with sheen it was otherwise the admission made him if possible more uncomfortable than he had been before  mitchell will be sick said stanning  sheen said nothing  stanning changed the subject  well at anyrate he said give us some tea you seem to have been victualling for a siege  im awfully sorry said sheen turning a deeper shade of red and experiencing a redoubled attack of the warm shooting but the fact is im waiting for drummond  stanning got up and expressed his candid opinion of drummond in a few words  he said more he described sheen too in unflattering terms  look here he said you may think it jolly fine to drop me just because youve got to know drummond a bit but youll be sick enough that youve done it before youve finished  it isnt that began sheen  i dont care what it is you slink about trying to avoid me all day and you wont do a thing i ask you to do  but you see  oh shut up said stanning     iii  sheen receives visitors and advice   while sheen had been interviewing stanning in study twelve farther down the passage linton and his friend dunstable who was in days house were discussing ways and means like stanning dunstable had demanded tea and had been informed that there was none for him  well you are a bright specimen arent you said dunstable seating himself on the table which should have been groaning under the weight of cake and biscuits i should like to know where you expect to go to you lure me in here and then have the cheek to tell me you havent got anything to eat what have you done with it all  there was half a cake  bring it on  young menzies bagged it after the match yesterday his brother came down with the oxford a team and he had to give him tea in his study then there were some biscuits  whats the matter with biscuits theyre all right bring them on biscuits forward show biscuits  menzies took them as well  dunstable eyed him sorrowfully  you always were a bit of a maniac he said but i never thought you were quite such a complete gibberer as to let menzies get away with all your grub well the only thing to do is to touch him for tea he owes us one come on  they proceeded down the passage and stopped at the door of study three  hullo said menzies as they entered  weve come to tea said dunstable cut the satisfying sandwich lets see a little more of that hissing urn of yours menzies bustle about and be the dashing host  i wasnt expecting you  i cant help your troubles said dunstable  ive not got anything i was thinking of coming to you linton  wheres that cake  finished my brother simply walked into it  greed said dunstable unkindly seems to be the besetting sin of the menzies well what are you going to do about it i dont wish to threaten but im a demon when im roused being done out of my tea is sure to rouse me and owing to unfortunate accident of being stonily broken i cant go to the shop youre responsible for the slump in provisions menzies and you must see us through this what are you going to do about it  do either of you chaps know sheen at all  i dont said linton not to speak to  you cant expect us to know all your shady friends said dunstable why  hes got a tea on this evening if you knew him well enough you might borrow something from him i met herbert in the dinnerhour carrying in all sorts of things to his study still if you dont know him  dont let a trifle of that sort stand in the way said dunstable which is his study  come on linton said dunstable be a man and lead the way go in as if hed invited us ten to one hell think he did if you dont spoil the thing by laughing  what invite ourselves to tea asked linton beginning to grasp the idea  thats it sheens the sort of ass who wont do a thing anyhow its worth trying smith in our house got a tea out of him that way last term coming menzies  not much i hope he kicks you out  come on then linton if menzies cares to chuck away a square meal let him  thus no sooner had the door of sheens study closed upon stanning than it was opened again to admit linton and dunstable  well said linton affably here we are  hope were not late said dunstable you said somewhere about five its just struck shall we start  he stooped and took the kettle from the stove  dont you bother he said to sheen who had watched this manoeuvre with an air of amazement ill do all the dirty work  but began sheen  thats all right said dunstable soothingly i like it  the intellectual pressure of the affair was too much for sheen he could not recollect having invited linton with whom he had exchanged only about a dozen words that term much less dunstable whom he merely knew by sight yet here they were behaving like honoured guests it was plain that there was a misunderstanding somewhere but he shrank from grappling with it he did not want to hurt their feelings it would be awkward enough if they discovered their mistake for themselves  so he exerted himself nervously to play the host and the first twinge of remorse which linton felt came when sheen pressed upon him a bag of biscuits which he knew could not have cost less than one and sixpence a pound his heart warmed to one who could do the thing in such style  dunstable apparently was worried by no scruples he leaned back easily in his chair and kept up a bright flow of conversation  youre not looking well sheen he said you ought to take more exercise why dont you come down town with us one of these days and do a bit of canvassing its a rag linton lost a tooth at it the other day were going down on saturday to do a bit more  oh said sheen politely  we shall get one or two more chaps to help next time it isnt good enough only us two we had four great beefy hooligans on to us when linton got his tooth knocked out we had to run theres a regular gang of them going about the town now that the elections on a redheaded fellow who looks like a butcher seems to boss the show they call him albert hell have to be slain one of these days for the credit of the school i should like to get drummond on to him  i was expecting drummond to tea said sheen  hes running and passing with the fifteen said linton he ought to be in soon why here he is hullo drummond  hullo said the newcomer looking at his two fellowvisitors as if he were surprised to see them there  how were the first asked dunstable  oh rotten any tea left  conversation flagged from this point and shortly afterwards dunstable and linton went  come and tea with me some time said linton  oh thanks said sheen thanks awfully  it was rather a shame said linton to dunstable as they went back to their study rushing him like that i shouldnt wonder if hes quite a good sort when one gets to know him  he must be a rotter to let himself be rushed by jove i should like to see someone try that game on with me  in the study they had left drummond was engaged in pointing this out to sheen  the first are rank bad he said the outsides were passing rottenly today we shall have another forty points taken off us when we play ripton by the way i didnt know you were a pal of lintons  im not said sheen  well he seemed pretty much at home just now  i cant understand it im certain i never asked him to tea or dunstable either yet they came in as if i had i didnt like to hurt their feelings by telling them  drummond stared  what they came without being asked heavens man you must buck up a bit and keep awake or youll have an awful time of course those two chaps were simply trying it on i had an idea it might be that when i came in why did you let them why didnt you scrag them  oh i dont know said sheen uncomfortably  but look here its rot you must keep your end up in a place like this or everybody in the housell be ragging you chaps will naturally play the goat if you let them has this ever happened before  sheen admitted reluctantly that it had he was beginning to see things it is never pleasant to feel one has been bluffed  once last term he said smith a chap in days came to tea like that i couldnt very well do anything  and dunstable is in days they compared notes i wonder you havent had the whole school dropping in on you lining up in long queues down the passage look here sheen you really must pull yourself together im not ragging youll have a beastly time if youre so feeble i hope you wont be sick with me for saying it but i cant help that its all for your own good and its really pure slackness thats the cause of it all  i hate hurting peoples feelings said sheen  oh rot as if anybody here had any feelings besides it doesnt hurt a chaps feelings being told to get out when he knows hes no business in a place  oh all right said sheen shortly  glad you see it said drummond well im off wonder if theres anybody in that bath  he reappeared a few moments later during his absence sheen overheard certain shrill protestations which were apparently being uttered in the neighbourhood of the bathroom door  there was he said putting his head into the study and grinning cheerfully at sheen there was young renford who had no earthly business to be there ive just looked in to point the moral suppose youd have let him bag all the hot water which ought to have come to his elders and betters for fear of hurting his feelings and gone without your bath i went on my theory that nobody at wrykyn least of all a fag has any feelings i turfed him out without a touch of remorse you get much the best results my way so long  and the head disappeared and shortly afterwards there came from across the passage muffled but cheerful sounds of splashing     iv  the better part of valour   the borough of wrykyn had been a little unfortunateor fortunate according to the point of viewin the matter of elections the latter point of view was that of the younger and more irresponsible section of the community which liked elections because they were exciting the former was that of the tradespeople who disliked them because they got their windows broken  wrykyn had passed through an election and its attendant festivities in the previous year when sir eustace briggs the mayor of the town had been returned by a comfortable majority since then illhealth had caused that gentleman to resign his seat and the place was once more in a state of unrest this time the school was deeply interested in the matter the previous election had not stirred them they did not care whether sir eustace briggs defeated mr saul pedder or whether mr saul pedder wiped the political floor with sir eustace briggs mr pedder was an energetic radical but owing to the fact that wrykyn had always returned a conservative member and did not see its way to a change as yet his energy had done him very little good the school had looked on him as a sportsman and read his speeches in the local paper with amusement but they were not interested now however things were changed the conservative candidate sir william bruce was one of themselvesan old wrykinian a governor of the school a man who always watched schoolmatches and the donor of the bruce challenge cup for the school mile in fine one of the best he was also the father of jack bruce a dayboy on the engineering side the school would have liked to have made a popular hero of jack bruce if he had liked he could have gone about with quite a suite of retainers but he was a quiet selfsufficing youth and was rarely to be seen in public the engineering side of a public school has workshops and other weirdnesses which keep it occupied after the ordinary school hours it was generally understood that bruce was a good sort of chap if you knew him but you had got to know him first brilliant at his work and devoted to it a useful slow bowler known to be able to drive and repair the family motorcar one who seldom spoke unless spoken to but who when he did speak generally had something sensible to say beyond that report said little  as he refused to allow the school to work off its enthusiasm on him they were obliged to work it off elsewhere hence the disturbances which had become frequent between school and town the inflammatory speeches of mr saul pedder had caused a swashbuckling spirit to spread among the rowdy element of the town gangs of youths to adopt the policecourt term had developed a habit of parading the streets arminarm shouting good old pedder when these met some person or persons who did not consider mr pedder good and old there was generally what the local policeforce described as a frakkus  it was in one of these frakkuses that linton had lost a valuable tooth  two days had elapsed since dunstable and linton had looked in on sheen for tea it was a saturday afternoon and rollcall was just over there was no first fifteen match only a rather uninteresting housematch templars versus donaldsons and existence in the school grounds showed signs of becoming tame  what a beastly term the easter term is said linton yawning there wont be a thing to do till the housematches begin properly  seymours had won their first match as had days they would not be called upon to perform for another week or more  lets get a boat out suggested dunstable  such a beastly day  lets have tea at the shop  rather slow how about going to cooks  all right toss you who pays  cooks was a shop in the town to which the school most resorted when in need of refreshment  wonder if we shall meet albert  linton licked the place where his tooth should have been and said he hoped so  sergeant cook the sixfoot proprietor of the shop was examining a broken window when they arrived and muttering to himself  hullo said dunstable whats this new idea for ventilation golly massa who frew dat brick  done it at arparse six last night he did said sergeant cook the redeaded young scallywag ketch imill give im  sounds like dear old albert said linton who did it sergeant  redheaded young mongrel good old pedder he says ill give you pedder i says then bang it comes right on top of the muffins and when i doubled out after im ed gone  mrs cook appeared and corroborated witnesss evidence dunstable ordered tea  we may meet him on our way home said linton if we do ill give him something from you with your love i owe him a lot for myself  mrs cook clicked her tongue compassionately at the sight of the obvious void in the speakers mouth  youll ave to ave a forlse one mr linton said sergeant cook with gloomy relish  the back shop was empty dunstable and linton sat down and began tea sergeant cook came to the door from time to time and dilated further on his grievances  gentlemen from the school they come in ere and says aint it all a joke and exciting and what not but i says to them you avent got to live in it i says thats what it is you avent got to live in it i says glad when its all over thats what ill be  nother jug of hot water please said linton  the sergeant shouted the order over his shoulder as if he were addressing a halfcompany on parade and returned to his woes  you avent got to live in it i says thats what it is its this everlasting worry and flurry day in and day out and not knowing whats going to appen next and one man coming in and saying vote for bruce and another vote for pedder and another saying how its the poor mans loaf hes fighting forif hed only buy a loaf nowullo ullo wots this  there was a confused noise without as shakespeare would put it and into the shop came clattering barry and mctodd of seymours closely followed by stanning and attell  this is getting a bit too thick said barry collapsing into a chair  from the outer shop came the voice of sergeant cook  let me jest come to you you redeaded  roars of derision from the road  thats albert said linton jumping up  yes i heard them call him that said barry mctodd and i were coming down here to tea when they started going for us so we nipped in here hoping to find reinforcements  we were just behind you said stanning i got one of them a beauty he went down like a shot  albert inquired linton  no a little chap  lets go out and smash them up suggested linton excitedly  dunstable treated the situation more coolly  wait a bit he said no hurry lets finish tea at any rate youd better eat as much as you can now linton you may have no teeth left to do it with afterwards he added cheerfully  lets chuck things at them said mctodd  dont be an ass said barry what on earths the good of that  well it would be something said mctodd vaguely  hit em with a muffin suggested stanning dash i barked my knuckles on that man but i bet he felt it  look here im going out said linton come on dunstable  dunstable continued his meal without hurry  whats the excitement he said theres plenty of time dear old alberts not the sort of chap to go away when hes got us cornered here the first principle of warfare is to get a good feed before you start  and anyhow said barry i came here for tea and im going to have it  sergeant cook was recalled from the door and received the orders  theyve just gone round the corner he said and that redeaded one e says hes goin to wait if he as to wait all night  quite right said dunstable approvingly sensible chap albert if you see him you might tell him we shant be long will you  a quarter of an hour passed  kerm out shouted a voice from the street  dunstable looked at the others  perhaps we might be moving now he said getting up ready  we must keep together said barry  you goin out mr dunstable inquired sergeant cook  yes good bye youll see that were decently buried wont you  the garrison made its sortie                                       it happened that drummond and sheen were also among those whom it had struck that afternoon that tea at cooks would be pleasant and they came upon the combatants some five minutes after battle had been joined the town contingent were filling the air with strange cries alberts voice being easily heard above the din while the wrykinians as publicschool men should were fighting quietly and without unseemly tumult  by jove said drummond heres a row on  sheen stopped dead with a queer sinking feeling within him he gulped drummond did not notice these portents he was observing the battle  suddenly he uttered an exclamation  why its some of our chaps theres a seymours cap isnt that mctodd and great scott theres barry come on man  sheen did not move  ought weto getmixed up he began  drummond looked at him with open eyes sheen babbled on  the old man might not likesixth form you seeoughtnt we to  there was a yell of triumph from the town army as the redhaired albert plunging through the fray sent barry staggering against the wall sheen caught a glimpse of alberts grinning face as he turned he had a cut over one eye it bled  come on said drummond beginning to run to the scene of action  sheen paused for a moment irresolutely then he walked rapidly in the opposite direction     v  the white feather   it was not until he had reached his study that sheen thoroughly realised what he had done all the way home he had been defending himself eloquently against an imaginary accuser and he had built up a very sound thoughtful and logical series of arguments to show that he was not only not to blame for what he had done but had acted in highly statesmanlike and praiseworthy manner after all he was in the sixth not a prefect it was true but still practically a prefect the headmaster disliked unpleasantness between school and town much more so between the sixth form of the school and the town therefore he had done his duty in refusing to be drawn into a fight with albert and friends besides why should he be expected to join in whenever he saw a couple of fellows fighting it wasnt reasonable it was no business of his why it was absurd he had no quarrel with those fellows it wasnt cowardice it was simply that he had kept his head better than drummond and seen further into the matter besides  but when he sat down in his chair this mood changed there is a vast difference between the view one takes of things when one is walking briskly and that which comes when one thinks the thing over coldly as he sat there the wall of defence which he had built up slipped away brick by brick and there was the fact staring at him without covering or disguise  it was no good arguing against himself no amount of argument could wipe away the truth he had been afraid and had shown it and he had shown it when in a sense he was representing the school when wrykyn looked to him to help it keep its end up against the town  the more he reflected the more he saw how farreaching were the consequences of that failure in the hour of need he had disgraced himself he had disgraced seymours he had disgraced the school he was an outcast  this mood the natural reaction from his first glow of almost jaunty selfrighteousness lasted till the lockup bell rang when it was succeeded by another this time he took a more reasonable view of the affair it occurred to him that there was a chance that his defection had passed unnoticed nothing could make his case seem better in his own eyes but it might be that the thing would end there the house might not have lost credit  an overwhelming curiosity seized him to find out how it had all ended the ten minutes of grace which followed the ringing of the lockup bell had passed drummond and the rest must be back by now  he went down the passage to drummonds study somebody was inside he could hear him  he knocked at the door  drummond was sitting at the table reading he looked up and there was a silence sheens mouth felt dry he could not think how to begin he noticed that drummonds face was unmarked looking down he saw that one of the knuckles of the hand that held the book was swollen and cut  drummond i  drummond lowered the book  get out he said he spoke without heat calmly as if he were making some conventional remark by way of starting a conversation  i only came to ask  get out said drummond again  there was another pause drummond raised his book and went on reading  sheen left the room  outside he ran into linton unlike drummond linton bore marks of the encounter as in the case of the hero of calverleys poem one of his speaking eyes was sable the swelling of his lip was increased there was a deep red bruise on his forehead in spite of these injuries however he was cheerful he was whistling when sheen collided with him  sorry said linton and went on into the study  well he said how are you feeling drummond lucky beggar you havent got a mark i wish i could duck like you well we have fought the good fight exit albertsweep him up you gave him enough to last him for the rest of the term i couldnt tackle the brute hes as strong as a horse my word it was lucky you happened to come up albert was making hay of us still alls well that ends well we have smitten the philistines this day by the way  whats up now  who was that chap with you when you came up  which chap  i thought i saw some one  you shouldnt eat so much tea you saw double  there wasnt anybody  no said drummond  not sheen  no said drummond irritably how many more times do you want me to say it  all right said linton i only asked i met him outside  who  sheen  oh  you might be sociable  i know i might but i want to read  lucky man wish i could i can hardly see well good bye then im off  good grunted drummond you know your way out dont you  linton went back to his own study  its all very well he said to himself for drummond to deny it but ill swear i saw sheen with him so did dunstable ill cut out and ask him about it after prep if he really was there and cut off something ought to be done about it the chap ought to be kicked hes a disgrace to the house  dunstable questioned after preparation refused to commit himself  i thought i saw somebody with drummond he said and i had a sort of idea it was sheen still i was pretty busy at the time and wasnt paying much attention to anything except that long thin bargee with the bowler i wish those men would hit straight its beastly difficult to guard a roundarm swing my right ear feels like a cauliflower does it look rum  beastly but what about this you cant swear to sheen then  no better give him the benefit of the doubt what does drummond say you ought to ask him  i have he says he was alone  well that settles it what an ass you are if drummond doesnt know who does  i believe hes simply hushing it up  well let us hush it up too its no good bothering about it we licked them all right  but its such a beastly thing for the house  then why the dickens do you want it to get about surely the best thing you can do is to dry up and say nothing about it  but something ought to be done  whats the good of troubling about a man like sheen he never was any good and this doesnt make him very much worse besides hell probably be sick enough on his own account i know i should if id done it and anyway we dont know that he did do it  im certain he did i could swear it was him  anyhow for goodness sake let the thing drop  all right but i shall cut him  well that would be punishment enough for anybody whatever hed done fancy existence without your bright conversation it doesnt bear thinking of you do look a freak with that eye and that lump on your forehead you ought to wear a mask  that ear of yours said linton with satisfaction will be about three times its ordinary size tomorrow and it always was too large good night  on his way back to seymours mason of applebys who was standing at his house gate imbibing fresh air preparatory to going to bed accosted him  i say linton he said hullo you look a wreck dont youi say whats all this about your house  what about my house  funking and all that sheen you know stanning has just been telling me  then he saw him too exclaimed linton involuntarily  oh its true then did he really cut off like that stanning said he did but i wouldnt believe him at first you arent going good night  so the thing was out linton had not counted on stanning having seen what he and dunstable had seen it was impossible to hush it up now the scutcheon of seymours was definitely blotted the name of the house was being held up to scorn in applebys probably everywhere else as well it was a nuisance thought linton but it could not be helped after all it was a judgment on the house for harbouring such a specimen as sheen  in seymours there was tumult and an impromptu indignation meeting stanning had gone to work scientifically from the moment that ducking under the guard of a sturdy town youth he had caught sight of sheen retreating from the fray he had grasped the fact that here readymade was his chance of working off his grudge against him all he had to do was to spread the news abroad and the school would do the rest on his return from the town he had mentioned the facts of the case to one or two of the more garrulous members of his house and they had passed it on to everybody they met during the interval in the middle of preparation by the end of preparation half the school knew what had happened  seymours was furious the senior dayroom to a man condemned sheen the junior dayroom was crimson in the face and incoherent the demeanour of a junior in moments of excitement generally lacks that repose which marks the philosopher  he ought to be kicked shrilled renford  we shall get rotted by those kids in dexters moaned harvey  disgracing the house thundered watson  lets go and chuck things at his door suggested renford  a move was made to the passage in which sheens study was situated and with divers groans and howls the junior dayroom hove football boots and cricket stumps at the door  the success of the meeting however was entirely neutralised by the fact that in the same passage stood the study of rigby the head of the house also rigby was trying at the moment to turn into idiomatic greek verse the words the days of peace and slumberous calm have fled and this corroboration of the statement annoyed him to the extent of causing him to dash out and sow lines among the revellers like some monarch scattering largesse the junior dayroom retired to its lair to inveigh against the brutal ways of those in authority and begin working off the commission it had received  the howls in the passage were the first official intimation sheen had received that his shortcomings were public property the word funk shouted through his keyhole had not unnaturally given him an inkling as to the state of affairs  so drummond had given him away he thought probably he had told linton the whole story the moment after he sheen had met the latter at the door of the study and perhaps he was now telling it to the rest of the house of all the mixed sensations from which he suffered as he went to his dormitory that night one of resentment against drummond was the keenest  sheen was in the fourth dormitory where the majority of the dayroom slept he was in the position of a sort of extra house prefect as far as the dormitory was concerned it was a large dormitory and mr seymour had fancied that it might perhaps be something of a handful for a single prefect as a matter of fact however drummond who was in charge had shown early in the term that he was more than capable of managing the place single handed he was popular and determined the dormitory was orderly partly because it liked him principally because it had to be  he had an opportunity of exhibiting his powers of control that night when sheen came in the room was full drummond was in bed reading his novel the other ornaments of the dormitory were in various stages of undress  as sheen appeared a sudden hissing broke out from the farther corner of the room sheen flushed and walked to his bed the hissing increased in volume and richness  shut up that noise said drummond without looking up from his book  the hissing diminished only two or three of the more reckless kept it up  drummond looked across the room at them  stop that noise and get into bed he said quietly  the hissing ceased he went on with his book again  silence reigned in dormitory four     vi  albert redivivus   by murdering in cold blood a large and respected family and afterwards depositing their bodies in a reservoir one may gain we are told much unpopularity in the neighbourhood of ones crime while robbing a church will get one cordially disliked especially by the vicar but to be really an outcast to feel that one has no friend in the world one must break an important publicschool commandment  sheen had always been something of a hermit in his most sociable moments he had never had more than one or two friends but he had never before known what it meant to be completely isolated it was like living in a world of ghosts or rather like being a ghost in a living world that disagreeable experience of being looked through as if one were invisible comes to the average person it may be half a dozen times in his life sheen had to put up with it a hundred times a day people who were talking to one another stopped when he appeared and waited until he had passed on before beginning again altogether he was made to feel that he had done for himself that as far as the life of the school was concerned he did not exist  there had been some talk particularly in the senior dayroom of more active measures it was thought that nothing less than a courtmartial could meet the case but the house prefects had been against it sheen was in the sixth and however monstrous and unspeakable might have been his acts it would hardly do to treat him as if he were a junior and the scheme had been definitely discouraged by drummond who had stated without wrapping the gist of his remarks in elusive phrases that in the event of a courtmartial being held he would interview the president of the same and knock his head off so seymours had fallen back on the punishment which from their earliest beginnings the public schools have meted out to their criminals they had cut sheen dead  in a way sheen benefited from this excommunication now that he could not even play fives for want of an opponent there was nothing left for him to do but work fortunately he had an object the gotford would be coming on in a few weeks and the more work he could do for it the better though stanning was the only one of his rivals whom he feared and though he was known to be taking very little trouble over the matter it was best to run as few risks as possible stanning was one of those people who produce great results in their work without seeming to do anything for them  so sheen shut himself up in his study and ground grimly away at his books and for exercise went for crosscountry walks it was a monotonous kind of existence for the space of a week the only wrykinian who spoke a single word to him was bruce the son of the conservative candidate for wrykyn and bruces conversation had been limited to two remarks he had said you might play that again will you and later thanks he had come into the musicroom while sheen was practising one afternoon and had sat down without speaking on a chair by the door when sheen had played for the second time the piece which had won his approval bruce thanked him and left the room as the solitary break in the monotony of the week sheen remembered the incident rather vividly  since the great rout of albert and his minions outside cooks things as far as the seniors were concerned had been quiet between school and town linton and dunstable had gone to and from cooks two days in succession without let or hindrance it was generally believed that owing to the unerring way in which he had put his head in front of drummonds left on that memorable occasion the scarlethaired one was at present drydocked for repairs the story in the schoolit had grown with the dayswas that drummond had laid the enemy out on the pavement with a sickening crash and that he had still been there at so to speak the close of play as a matter of fact albert was in excellent shape and only an unfortunate previous engagement prevented him from ranging the streets near cooks as before sir william bruce was addressing a meeting in another part of the town and albert thought it his duty to be on hand to boo  in the junior portion of the school the feud with the town was brisk mention has been made of a certain st judes between which seat of learning and the fags of dexters and the school house there was a spirited vendetta  jackson of dexters was one of the pillars of the movement jackson was                     a calmbrowd lad     yet mad at moments as a hatter  and he derived a great deal of pleasure from warring against st judes it helped him to enjoy his meals he slept the better for it after a little turn up with a judy he was fuller of that spirit of manly fortitude and forbearance so necessary to those whom fate brought frequently into contact with mr dexter the judies wore mortarboards and it was an enjoyable pastime sending these spinning into space during one of the usual rencontres in the high street from the fact that he and his friends were invariably outnumbered there was a sporting element in these affairs though occasionally this inferiority of numbers was the cause of his executing a scientific retreat with the enemy harassing his men up to the very edge of the town this had happened on the last occasion there had been casualties no fewer than six housecaps had fallen into the enemys hands and he himself had been tripped up and rolled in a puddle  he burned to avenge this disaster  coming down to cooks he said to his ally painter it was just a week since the sheen episode  all right said painter  suppose we go by the high street suggested jackson casually  then wed better get a few more chaps said painter  a few more chaps were collected and the party numbering eight set off for the town there were present such stalwarts as borwick and crowle both of dexters and tomlin of the school house a useful man to have by you in an emergency it was tomlin who on one occasion attacked by two terrific champions of st judes in a narrow passage had vanquished them both and sent their mortarboards miles into the empyrean so that they were never the same mortarboards again but wore ever after a bruised and draggled look  the expedition passed down the high street without adventure until by common consent it stopped at the lofty wall which bounded the playground of st judes  from the other side of the wall came sounds of revelry shrill squealings and shoutings the judies were disporting themselves at one of their weird games it was known that they played touchlast and scandal said that another of their favourite recreations was marbles the juniors at wrykyn believed that it was to hide these excesses from the gaze of the public that the playground wall had been made so high eyewitnesses who had peeped through the door in the said wall reported that what the judies seemed to do mostly was to chase one another about the playground shrieking at the top of their voices but they added this was probably a mere ruse to divert suspicion  they had almost certainly got the marbles in their pockets all the time  the expedition stopped and looked itself in the face  how about buzzing something at them said jackson earnestly  you can get oranges over the road said tomlin in his helpful way  jackson vanished into the shop indicated and reappeared a few moments later with a brown paper bag  it seems a beastly waste suggested the economical painter  thats all right said jackson theyre all bad the man thought i was rotting him when i asked if hed got any bad oranges but i got them at last give us a leg up some one  willing hands urged him to the top of the wall he drew out a green orange and threw it  there was a sudden silence on the other side of the wall then a howl of wrath went up to the heavens jackson rapidly emptied his bag  got him he exclaimed as the last orange sped on its way look out theyre coming  the expedition had begun to move off with quiet dignity when from the doorway in the wall there poured forth a stream of mortarboarded warriors shrieking defiance the expedition advanced to meet them  as usual the judies had the advantage in numbers and filled to the brim with righteous indignation they were proceeding to make things uncommonly warm for the invaderspainter had lost his cap and tomlin three waistcoat buttonswhen the eye of jackson roving up and down the street was caught by a seymours cap he was about to shout for assistance when he perceived that the newcomer was sheen and refrained it was no use he felt asking sheen for help  but just as sheen arrived and the ranks of the expedition were beginning to give way before the strenuous onslaught of the judies the latter almost with one accord turned and bolted into their playground again looking round tomlin that first of generals saw the reason and uttered a warning  a mutual foe had appeared from a passage on the left of the road there had debouched on to the field of action albert himself and two of his band  the expedition flew without false shame it is to be doubted whether one of alberts calibre would have troubled to attack such small game but it was the firm opinion of the wrykyn fags and the judies that he and his men were to be avoided  the newcomers did not pursue them they contented themselves with shouting at them one of the band threw a stone  then they caught sight of sheen  albert said oo er and advanced at the double his companions followed him  sheen watched them come and backed against the wall his heart was thumping furiously he was in for it now he felt he had come down to the town with this very situation in his mind a wild idea of doing something to restore his selfrespect and his credit in the eyes of the house had driven him to the high street but now that the crisis had actually arrived he would have given much to have been in his study again  albert was quite close now sheen could see the marks which had resulted from his interview with drummond with all his force sheen hit out and experienced a curious thrill as his fist went home it was a poor blow from a scientific point of view but sheens fives had given him muscle and it checked albert that youth however recovered rapidly and the next few moments passed in a whirl for sheen he received a stinging blow on his left ear and another which deprived him of his whole stock of breath and then he was on the ground conscious only of a wish to stay there for ever     vii  mr joe bevan   almost involuntarily he staggered up to receive another blow which sent him down again  thatll do said a voice  sheen got up panting between him and his assailant stood a short sturdy man in a tweed suit he was waving albert back and albert appeared to be dissatisfied he was arguing hotly with the newcomer  now you go away said that worthy mildly just you go away  albert gave it as his opinion that the speaker would do well not to come interfering in what didnt concern him what he wanted asserted albert was a thick ear  coming pushing yourself in added albert querulously  you go away repeated the stranger you go away i dont want to have trouble with you  alberts reply was to hit out with his left hand in the direction of the speakers face the stranger without fuss touched the back of alberts wrist gently with the palm of his right hand and albert turning round in a circle ended the manoeuvre with his back towards his opponent he faced round again irresolutely the thing had surprised him  you go away said the other as if he were making the observation for the first time  its joe bevan said one of alberts friends excitedly  alberts jaw fell his freckled face paled  you go away repeated the man in the tweed suit whose conversation seemed inclined to run in a groove  this time albert took the advice his friends had already taken it  thanks said sheen  beware said mr bevan oracularly of entrance to a quarrel but being in beart that th opposed may beware of thee always counter back when you guard when a man shows you his right like that always push out your hand straight the straight left rules the boxing world feeling better sir  yes thanks  he got that right in just on the spot i was watching when you see a man coming to hit you with his right like that dont you draw back get on top of him he cant hit you then  that feeling of utter collapse which is the immediate result of a blow in the parts about the waistcoat was beginning to pass away and sheen now felt capable of taking an interest in sublunary matters once more his ear smarted horribly and when he put up a hand and felt it the pain was so great that he could barely refrain from uttering a cry but however physically battered he might be he was feeling happier and more satisfied with himself than he had felt for years he had been beaten but he had fought his best and not given in some portion of his selfrespect came back to him as he reviewed the late encounter  mr bevan regarded him approvingly  he was too heavy for you he said hes a good twelve stone i make it i should put you at ten stonesay ten stone three call it nine stone twelve in condition but youve got pluck sir  sheen opened his eyes at this surprising statement  some ive met would have laid down after getting that first hit but you got up again thats the secret of fighting always keep going on never give in you know what shakespeare says about the one who first cries hold enough do you read shakespeare sir  yes said sheen  ah now he knew his business said mr bevan enthusiastically there was ringcraft as you may say he wasnt a novice  sheen agreed that shakespeare had written some good things in his time  thats what you want to remember always keep going on as the saying is i was fighting dick roberts at the nationalan american he was from san francisco he come at me with his right stretched out and i think hes going to hit me with it when blessed if his left dont come out instead and my golly it nearly knocked a passage through me just where that fellow hit you sir he hit me it was just at the end of the round and i went back to my corner jim blake was seconding me whats this jim i says is the man mad or what why he says hes lefthanded thats whats the matter get on top of him get on top of him i says my golly ill get on top of the roof if hes going to hit me another of those but i kept on and got close to him and he couldnt get in another of them and he give in after the seventh round  what competition was that asked sheen  mr bevan laughed it was a twentyround contest sir for sevenfifty aside and the light weight championship of the world  sheen looked at him in astonishment he had always imagined professional pugilists to be bulletheaded and beetlebrowed to a man he was not prepared for one of mr joe bevans description for all the marks of his profession that he bore on his face in the shape of lumps and scars he might have been a curate his face looked tough and his eyes harboured always a curiously alert questioning expression as if he were perpetually sizing up the person he was addressing but otherwise he was like other men he seemed also to have a pretty taste in literature this combined with his strong and capable air attracted sheen usually he was shy and ill at ease with strangers joe bevan he felt he had known all his life  do you still fight he asked  no said mr bevan i gave it up a man finds hes getting on as the saying is and it dont do to keep at it too long i teach and i train but i dont fight now  a sudden idea flashed across sheens mind he was still glowing with that pride which those who are accustomed to work with their brains feel when they have gone honestly through some labour of the hands at that moment he felt himself capable of fighting the world and beating it the small point that albert had knocked him out of time in less than a minute did not damp him at all he had started on the right road he had done something he had stood up to his man till he could stand no longer an unlimited vista of action stretched before him he had tasted the pleasure of the fight and he wanted more  why he thought should he not avail himself of joe bevans services to help him put himself right in the eyes of the house at the end of the term shortly before the public schools competitions at aldershot interhouse boxing cups were competed for at wrykyn it would be a dramatic act of reparation to the house if he could win the lightweight cup for it his imagination jumping wide gaps did not admit the possibility of his not being good enough to win it in the scene which he conjured up in his mind he was an easy victor after all there was the greater part of the term to learn in and he would have a champion of the world to teach him  mr bevan cut in on his reflections as if he had heard them by some process of wireless telegraphy  now look here sir he said you should let me give you a few lessons youre plucky but you dont know the game as yet and boxings a thing every one ought to know supposition is youre crossing a field or going down a street with your sweetheart or your wife  sheen was neither engaged nor married but he let the point pass  and up comes one of these hooligans as they call em what are you going to do if he starts his games why nothing if you cant box you may be plucky but you cant beat him and if you beat him youll get half murdered yourself what you want to do is to learn to box and then what happens why as soon as he sees you shaping he says to himself hullo this chap knows too much for me im off and off he runs or supposition is he comes for you you dont mind not you you give him one punch in the right place and then you go off to your tea leaving him lying there he wont get up  id like to learn said sheen i should be awfully obliged if youd teach me i wonder if you could make me any good by the end of the term the house competitions come off then  that all depends sir it comes easier to some than others if you know how to shoot your left out straight thats as good as six months teaching after that its all ringcraft the straight left beats the world  where shall i find you  im training a young chapeight stone seven and hes got to get down to eight stone four for a bantam weight matchat an inn up the river here i daresay you know it sir or any one would tell you where it is the blue boar its called you come there any time you like to name sir and youll find me  i should like to come every day said sheen would that be too often  oftener the better sir you cant practise too much  then ill start next week thanks very much by the way i shall have to go by boat i suppose it isnt far is it ive not been up the river for some time the school generally goes down stream  its not what youd call far said bevan but it would be easier for you to come by road  i havent a bicycle  wouldnt one of your friends lend you one  sheen flushed  no id better come by boat i think ill turn up on tuesday at about five will that suit you  yes sir that will be a good time then ill say good bye sir for the present  sheen went back to his house in a different mood from the one in which he had left it he did not care now when the other seymourites looked through him  in the passage he met linton and grinned pleasantly at him  what the dickens was that man grinning at said linton to himself i must have a smut or something on my face  but a close inspection in the dormitory lookingglass revealed no blemish on his handsome features     viii  a naval battle and its consequences   what a go is life  let us examine the case of jackson of dexters ohara who had left dexters at the end of the summer term had once complained to clowes of the manner in which his housemaster treated him and clowes had remarked in his melancholy way that it was nothing less than a breach of the law that dexter should persist in leading a fellow a dogs life without a dog licence for him  that was precisely how jackson felt on the subject  things became definitely unbearable on the day after sheens interview with mr joe bevan  twas mornto begin at the beginningand jackson sprang from his little cot to embark on the labours of the day unfortunately he sprang ten minutes too late and came down to breakfast about the time of the second slice of bread and marmalade result a hundred lines proceeding to school he had again fallen foul of his housemasterin whose form he wasover a matter of unprepared livy as a matter of fact jackson had prepared the livy or rather he had not absolutely prepared it but he had meant to but it was mr templars preparation and mr templar was shortsighted any one will understand therefore that it would have been simply chucking away the gifts of providence if he had not gone on with the novel which he had been reading up till the last moment before preptime and had brought along with him accidentally as it were it was a book called a spoiler of men by richard marsh and there was a repulsive crime on nearly every page it was hot stuff much better than livy  lunch scoretwo hundred lines  during lunch he had the misfortune to upset a glass of water pure accident of course but there it was dont you know all over the table  mr dexter had called him      a clumsy     b a pig  and had given him      1 adviceyou had better be careful jackson     2 a presenttwo hundred lines jackson  on the match being resumed at two oclock with four hundred lines on the scoresheet he had played a fine free game during afternoon school and mr dexter who objected to fine free gamesor indeed any gamesduring school hours had increased the total to six hundred when stumps were drawn for the day  so on a bright sunny saturday afternoon when he should have been out in the field cheering the houseteam on to victory against the school house jackson sat in the junior dayroom at dexters copying out portions of virgil aeneid two  to him later on in the afternoon when he had finished half his task entered painter with the news that dexters had taken thirty points off the school house just after halftime  mopped them up said the terse and epigrammatic painter made rings round them havent you finished yet well chuck it and come out  whats on asked jackson  were going to have a boat race  pile it on  we are really fact some of these school house kids are awfully sick about the match and challenged us that chap tomlin thinks he can row  he cant row for nuts said jackson he doesnt know which end of the oar to shove into the water ive seen cats that could row better than tomlin  thats what i told him at least i said he couldnt row for toffee so he said all right i bet i can lick you and i said i betted he couldnt and he said all right then lets try and then the other chaps wanted to join in so we made an interhouse thing of it and i want you to come and stroke us  jackson hesitated mr dexter setting the lines on friday had certainly said that they were to be shown up tomorrow evening he had said it very loud and clear still in a case like this after all by helping to beat the school house on the river he would be giving dexters a legup and what more could the man want  right ho said jackson  down at the school boathouse the enemy were already afloat when painter and jackson arrived  buck up cried the school house crew  dexters embarked five strong there was room for two on each seat jackson shared the post of stroke with painter crowle steered  ready asked tomlin from the other boat  half a sec said jackson whats the course  oh dont you know that yet up to the town round the island just below the bridgethe island with the croquet ground on it you knowand back again here ready  in a jiffy look here crowle remember about steering you pull the right line if you want to go to the right and the other if you want to go to the left  all right said the injured crowle as if i didnt know that  thought id mention it its your fault nobody could tell by looking at you that you knew anything except how to eat ready you chaps  when i say three said tomlin  it was a subject of heated discussion between the crews for weeks afterwards whether dexters boat did or did not go off at the word two opinions were divided on the topic but it was certain that jackson and his men led from the start pulling a good splashing stroke which had drenched crowle to the skin in the first thirty yards dexters boat crept slowly ahead by the time the island was reached it led by a length encouraged by success the leaders redoubled their already energetic efforts crowle sat in a showerbath he was even moved to speech about it  when youve finished said crowle  jackson intent upon repartee caught a crab and the school house drew level again the two boats passed the island abreast  just here occurred one of those unfortunate incidents both crews had quickened their stroke until the boats had practically been converted into submarines and the rival coxswains were observing bitterly to space that this was jolly well the last time they ever let themselves in for this sort of thing when round the island there hove in sight a flotilla of boats directly in the path of the racers  there were three of them and not even the spray which played over them like a fountain could prevent crowle from seeing that they were manned by judies even on the river these outcasts wore their mortarboards  look out shrieked crowle pulling hard on his right line stop rowing you chaps we shall be into them  at the same moment the school house oarsmen ceased pulling the two boats came to a halt a few yards from the enemy  whats up panted jackson crimson from his exertions hullo its the judies  tomlin was parleying with the foe  why the dickens cant you keep out of the way spoiling our race wait till we get ashore  but the judies it seemed were not prepared to wait even for that short space of time a miscreant larger than the common run of judy made a brief but popular address to his men  splash them he said  instantly amid shrieks of approval oars began to strike the water and the water began to fly over the wrykyn boats which were now surrounded the latter were not slow to join battle with the same weapons homeric laughter came from the bridge above the town bridge was a sort of loafers club to which the entrance fee was a screw of tobacco and the subscription an occasional remark upon the weather here gathered together day by day that section of the populace which resented it when they asked for employment and only got work instead from morn till eve they lounged against the balustrades surveying nature and hoping it would be kind enough to give them some excitement that day an occasional dogfight found in them an eager audience no runaway horse ever bored them a brokendown motorcar was meat and drink to them they had an appetite for every spectacle  when therefore the water began to fly from boat to boat kindhearted men fetched their friends from neighbouring public houses and craned with them over the parapet observing the sport and commenting thereon it was these comments that attracted mr dexters attention when cycling across the bridge he found the south side of it entirely congested and heard raucous voices urging certain unseen little uns now to go it and anon to vote for pedder his curiosity was aroused he dismounted and pushed his way through the crowd until he got a clear view of what was happening below  he was just in time to see the most stirring incident of the fight the biggest of the judy boats had been propelled by the current nearer and nearer to the dexter argo no sooner was it within distance than jackson dropping his oar grasped the side and pulled it towards him the two boats crashed together and rocked violently as the crews rose from their seats and grappled with one another a hurricane of laughter and applause went up from the crowd upon the bridge  the next moment both boats were bottom upwards and drifting sluggishly down towards the island while the crews swam like rats for the other boats  every wrykinian had to learn to swim before he was allowed on the river so that the peril of jackson and his crew was not extreme and it was soon speedily evident that swimming was also part of the judy curriculum for the shipwrecked ones were soon climbing drippingly on board the surviving ships where they sat and made puddles and shrieked defiance at their antagonists  this was accepted by both sides as the end of the fight and the combatants parted without further hostilities each fleet believing that the victory was with them  and mr dexter mounting his bicycle again rode home to tell the headmaster  that evening after preparation the headmaster held a reception among distinguished visitors were jackson painter tomlin crowle and six others  on the monday morning the headmaster issued a manifesto to the school after prayers he had he said for some time entertained the idea of placing the town out of bounds he would do so now no boy unless he was a prefect would be allowed till further notice to cross the town bridge as regarded the river for the future boating wrykinians must confine their attentions to the lower river nobody must take a boat upstream the school boatman would have strict orders to see that this rule was rigidly enforced any breach of these bounds would he concluded be punished with the utmost severity  the headmaster of wrykyn was not a hasty man he thought before he put his foot down but when he did he put it down heavily  sheen heard the ultimatum with dismay he was a lawabiding person and here he was faced with a dilemma that made it necessary for him to choose between breaking school rules of the most important kind or pulling down all the castles he had built in the air before the mortar had had time to harden between their stones  he wished he could talk it over with somebody but he had nobody with whom he could talk over anything he must think it out for himself  he spent the rest of the day thinking it out and by nightfall he had come to his decision  even at the expense of breaking bounds and the risk of being caught at it he must keep his appointment with joe bevan it would mean going to the town landingstage for a boat thereby breaking bounds twice over  but it would have to be done     ix  sheen begins his education   the blue boar was a picturesque inn standing on the bank of the river severn it was much frequented in the summer by fishermen who spent their days in punts and their evenings in the old oak parlour where a picture in boxing costume of mr joe bevan whose brother was the landlord of the inn gazed austerely down on them as if he disapproved of the lamentable want of truth displayed by the majority of their number artists also congregated there to paint the ivycovered porch at the back of the house were bedrooms to which the fishermen would make their way in the small hours of a summer morning arguing to the last as they stumbled upstairs one of these bedrooms larger than the others had been converted into a gymnasium for the use of mine hosts brother thither he brought pugilistic aspirants who wished to be trained for various contests and it was the boast of the blue boar that it had never turned out a loser a reputation of this kind is a valuable asset to an inn and the boxing world thought highly of it in spite of the fact that it was off the beaten track certainly the luck of the blue boar had been surprising  sheen pulled steadily up stream on the appointed day and after half an hours work found himself opposite the little landingstage at the foot of the inn lawn  his journey had not been free from adventure on his way to the town he had almost run into mr templar and but for the lucky accident of that gentlemans short sight must have been discovered he had reached the landingstage in safety but he had not felt comfortable until he was well out of sight of the town it was fortunate for him in the present case that he was being left so severely alone by the school it was an advantage that nobody took the least interest in his goings and comings  having moored his boat and proceeded to the inn he was directed upstairs by the landlord who was an enlarged and coloured edition of his brother from the other side of the gymnasium door came an unceasing and mysterious shuffling sound  he tapped at the door and went in  he found himself in a large airy room lit by two windows and a broad skylight the floor was covered with linoleum but it was the furniture that first attracted his attention in a farther corner of the room was a circular wooden ceiling supported by four narrow pillars from the centre of this hung a ball about the size of an ordinary football to the left suspended from a beam was an enormous leather bolster on the floor underneath a table bearing several pairs of boxinggloves a skippingrope and some wooden dumbbells was something that looked like a dozen association footballs rolled into one all the rest of the room a space some few yards square was bare of furniture in this space a small sweaterclad youth with a head of light hair cropped very short was darting about and ducking and hitting out with both hands at nothing with such a serious earnest expression on his face that sheen could not help smiling on a chair by one of the windows mr joe bevan was sitting with a watch in his hand  as sheen entered the room the earnest young man made a sudden dash at him the next moment he seemed to be in a sort of heavy shower of fists they whizzed past his ear flashed up from below within an inch of his nose and tapped him caressingly on the waistcoat just as the shower was at its heaviest his assailant darted away again sidestepped an imaginary blow ducked another and came at him once more none of the blows struck him but it was with more than a little pleasure that he heard joe bevan call time and saw the active young gentleman sink panting into a seat  you and your games francis said joe bevan reproachfully this is a young gentleman from the college come for tuition  gentlemanwont mindlittle joketake it in spirit which ismeant said francis jerkily  sheen hastened to assure him that he had not been offended  you take your two minutes francis said mr bevan and then have a turn with the ball come this way mr  sheen  come this way mr sheen and ill show you where to put on your things  sheen had brought his football clothes with him he had not put them on for a year  thats the lad i was speaking of getting on prime he is fit to fight for his life as the saying is  what was he doing when i came in  oh he always has three rounds like that every day it teaches you to get about quick you try it when you get back mr sheen fancy youre fighting me  are you sure im not interrupting you in the middle of your work asked sheen  not at all sir not at all i just have to rub him down and give him his showerbath and then hes finished for the day  having donned his football clothes and returned to the gymnasium sheen found francis in a chair having his left leg vigorously rubbed by mr bevan  you fon of dargs inquired francis affably looking up as he came in  sheen replied that he was and indeed was possessed of one the admission stimulated francis whose right leg was now under treatment to a flood of conversation he it appeared had always been one for dargs owned two answering to the names of tim and tom beggars for rats yes and plucked uns wellhe would like to see would francis a dog that tim or tom would not stand up to clever too why once  joe bevan cut his soliloquy short at this point by leading him off to another room for his showerbath but before he went he expressed a desire to talk further with sheen on the subject of dogs and learning that sheen would be there every day said he was glad to hear it he added that for a brother doglover he did not mind stretching a point so that if ever sheen wanted a couple of rounds any day he francis would see that he got them this offer it may be mentioned sheen accepted with gratitude and the extra practice he acquired thereby was subsequently of the utmost use to him francis as a boxer excelled in what is known in pugilistic circles as shiftiness that is to say he had a number of ingenious ways of escaping out of tight corners and these he taught sheen much to the latters profit  but this was later when the wrykinian had passed those preliminary stages on which he was now to embark  the art of teaching boxing really well is a gift and it is given to but a few it is largely a matter of personal magnetism and above all sympathy a man may be a fine boxer himself up to every move of the game and a champion of champions but for all that he may not be a good teacher if he has not the sympathy necessary for the appreciation of the difficulties experienced by the beginner he cannot produce good results a boxing instructor needs three qualitiesskill sympathy and enthusiasm joe bevan had all three particularly enthusiasm his heart was in his work and he carried sheen with him beautiful sir beautiful he kept saying as he guarded the blows and sheen though too clever to be wholly deceived by the praise for he knew perfectly well that his efforts up to the present had been anything but beautiful was nevertheless encouraged and put all he knew into his hits occasionally joe bevan would push out his left glove then if sheens guard was in the proper place and the push did not reach its destination joe would mutter a word of praise if sheen dropped his right hand so that he failed to stop the blow bevan would observe keep that guard up sir with almost a pained intonation as if he had been disappointed in a friend  the constant repetition of this maxim gradually drove it into sheens head so that towards the end of the lesson he no longer lowered his right hand when he led with his left and he felt the gentle pressure of joe bevans glove less frequently at no stage of a pupils education did joe bevan hit him really hard and in the first few lessons he could scarcely be said to hit him at all he merely rested his glove against the pupils face on the other hand he was urgent in imploring the pupil to hit him as hard as he could  dont be too kind sir he would chant i dont mind being hit let me have it dont flap put it in with some weight behind it he was also fond of mentioning that extract from polonius speech to laertes which he had quoted to sheen on their first meeting  sheen finished his first lesson feeling hotter than he had ever felt in his life  hullo sir youre out of condition commented mr bevan have a bit of a rest  once more sheen had learnt the lesson of his weakness he could hardly realise that he had only begun to despise himself in the last fortnight before then he had been on the whole satisfied with himself he was brilliant at work and would certainly get a scholarship at oxford or cambridge when the time came and he had specialised in work to the exclusion of games it is bad to specialise in games to the exclusion of work but of the two courses the latter is probably the less injurious one gains at least health by it  but sheen now understood thoroughly what he ought to have learned from his study of the classics that the happy mean was the thing at which to strive and for the future he meant to aim at it he would get the gotford if he could but also would he win the house boxing at his weight  after he had rested he discovered the use of the big ball beneath the table it was soft but solid and heavy by throwing thisthe medicineball as they call it in the professionat joe bevan and catching it sheen made himself very hot again and did the muscles of his shoulders a great deal of good  thatll do for today then sir said joe bevan have a good rub down tonight or youll find yourself very stiff in the morning  well do you think i shall be any good asked sheen  youll do fine sir but remember what shakespeare says  about vaulting ambition  no sir no i meant what hamlet says to the players nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently thats what youve got to remember in boxing sir take it easy easy and cool does it and the straight left beats the world                                       sheen paddled quietly back to the town with the stream pondering over this advice he felt that he had advanced another step he was not foolish enough to believe that he knew anything about boxing as yet but he felt that it would not be long before he did     x  sheens progress   sheen improved he took to boxing as he had taken to fives he found that his fives helped him he could get about on his feet quickly and his eye was trained to rapid work  his second lesson was not encouraging he found that he had learned just enough to make him stiff and awkward and no more but he kept on and by the end of the first week joe bevan declared definitely that he would do that he had the root of the matter in him and now required only practice  i wish you could see like i can how youre improving he said at the end of the sixth lesson as they were resting after five minutes exercise with the medicineball i get four blows in on some of the gentlemen i teach to one what i get in on you but its like riding when you can trot you look forward to when you can gallop and when you can gallop you cant see yourself getting on any further but youre improving all the time  but i cant gallop yet said sheen  well no not gallop exactly but youve only had six lessons why in another six weeks if you come regular you wont know yourself youll be making some of the young gentlemen at the college wish they had never been born youll make babies of them thats what youll do  ill bet i couldnt if id learnt with some one else said sheen sincerely i dont believe i should have learnt a thing if id gone to the school instructor  who is your school instructor sir  a man named jenkins he used to be in the army  well there you see thats what it is i know old george jenkins he used to be a pretty good boxer in his time but there boxings a thing like everything else that moves with the times we used to go about in iron trucks now we go in motorcars just the same with boxing what youre learning now is the sort of boxing that wins championship fights nowadays old george well he teaches you how to put your left out but my golly he doesnt know any tricks he hasnt studied it same as i have its the ringcraft that wins battles now sir if youre ready  they put on the gloves again when the round was over mr bevan had further comments to make  you dont hit hard enough sir he said dont flap let it come straight out with some weight behind it you want to be earnest in the ring the other mans going to do his best to hurt you and youve got to stop him one good punch is worth twenty taps you hit him and when youve hit him dont you go back you hit him again theyll only give you three rounds in any competition you go in for so you want to do the work you can while youre at it  as the days went by sheen began to imbibe some of joe bevans rugged philosophy of life he began to understand that the world is a place where every man has to look after himself and that it is the stronger hand that wins that sentence from hamlet which joe bevan was so fond of quoting practically summed up the whole duty of manand boy too one should not seek quarrels but being in one should do ones best to ensure that ones opponent thought twice in future before seeking them these afternoons at the blue boar were gradually giving sheen what he had never before possessedselfconfidence he was beginning to find that he was capable of something after all that in an emergency he would be able to keep his end up the feeling added a zest to all that he did his work in school improved he looked at the gotford no longer as a prize which he would have to struggle to win he felt that his rivals would have to struggle to win it from him  after his twelfth lesson when he had learned the groundwork of the art and had begun to develop a style of his own like some nervous batsman at cricket who does not show his true form till he has been at the wickets for several overs the dogloving francis gave him a trial this was a very different affair from his spars with joe bevan frank hunt was one of the cleverest boxers at his weight in england but he had not joe bevans gift of hitting gently he probably imagined that he was merely tapping and certainly his blows were not to be compared with those he delivered in the exercise of his professional duties but nevertheless sheen had never felt anything so painful before not even in his passage of arms with albert he came out of the encounter with a swollen lip and a feeling that one of his ribs was broken and he had not had the pleasure of landing a single blow upon his slippery antagonist who flowed about the room like quicksilver but he had not flinched and the statement of francis as they shook hands that he had done varry well was as balm boxing is one of the few sports where the loser can feel the same thrill of triumph as the winner there is no satisfaction equal to that which comes when one has forced oneself to go through an ordeal from which one would have liked to have escaped  capital sir capital said joe bevan i wanted to see whether you would lay down or not when you began to get a few punches you did capitally mr sheen  i didnt hit him much said sheen with a laugh  never mind sir you got hit which was just as good some of the gentlemen ive taught wouldnt have taken half that theyre all right when theyre on top and winning and to see them shape youd say to yourself by george heres a champion but let em get a punch or two and hullo says you whats this they dont like it they lay down but you kept on theres one thing though you want to keep that guard up when you duck you slip him that way once very well next time hes waiting for you he doesnt hit straight he hooks you and you dont want many of those  sheen enjoyed his surreptitious visits to the blue boar twice he escaped being caught in the most sensational way and once mr spence who looked after the wrykyn cricket and gymnasium and played everything equally well nearly caused complications by inviting sheen to play fives with him after school fortunately the gotford afforded an excellent excuse as the time for the examination drew near those who had entered for it were accustomed to become hermits to a great extent and to retire after school to work in their studies  you mustnt overdo it sheen said mr spence you ought to get some exercise  oh i do sir said sheen i still play fives but i play before breakfast now  he had had one or two games with harrington of the school house who did not care particularly whom he played with so long as his opponent was a useful man sheen being one of the few players in the school who were up to his form harrington ignored the cloud under which sheen rested when they met in the world outside the fivescourts harrington was polite but made no overtures of friendship that it may be mentioned was the attitude of every one who did not actually cut sheen the exception was jack bruce who had constituted himself audience to sheen when the latter was practising the piano on two further occasions but then bruce was so silent by nature that for all practical purposes he might just as well have cut sheen like the others  we might have a game before breakfast some time then said mr spence  he had noticed being a master who did notice things that sheen appeared to have few friends and had made up his mind that he would try and bring him out a little of the real facts of the case he knew of course nothing  i should like to sir said sheen  next wednesday  all right sir  ill be there at seven if youre before me you might get the second court will you  the second court from the end nearest the boardinghouse was the best of the halfdozen fivescourts at wrykyn after school sometimes you would see fags racing across the gravel to appropriate it for their masters the rule was that whoever first pinned to the door a piece of paper with his name on it was the legal owner of the courtand it was a stirring sight to see a dozen fags fighting to get at the door but before breakfast the court might be had with less trouble                                       meanwhile sheen paid his daily visits to the blue boar losing flesh and gaining toughness with every lesson the more he saw of joe bevan the more he liked him and appreciated his strong simple outlook on life shakespeare was a great bond between them sheen had always been a student of the bard and he and joe would sit on the little verandah of the inn looking over the river until it was time for him to row back to the town quoting passages at one another joe bevans knowledge of the plays especially the tragedies was wide and at first inexplicable to sheen it was strange to hear him declaiming long speeches from macbeth or hamlet and to think that he was by profession a pugilist one evening he explained his curious erudition in his youth before he took to the ring in earnest he had travelled with a shakespearean repertory company i never played a star part he confessed but i used to come on in the battle of bosworth and in macbeths castle and what not ive been first citizen sometimes i was the carpenter in julius caesar that was my biggest part truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but as you would say a cobbler but somehow the stagewellyou know what it is sir leeds one week manchester the next brighton the week after and travelling all sunday it wasnt quiet enough for me  the idea of becoming a professional pugilist for the sake of peace and quiet tickled sheen but ive always read shakespeare ever since then continued mr bevan and i always shall read him  it was on the next day that mr bevan made a suggestion which drew confidences from sheen in his turn  what you want now sir he said is to practise on someone of about your own form as the saying is isnt there some gentleman friend of yours at the college who would come here with you  they were sitting on the verandah when he asked this question it was growing dusk and the evening seemed to invite confidences sheen looking out across the river and avoiding his friends glance explained just what it was that made it so difficult for him to produce a gentleman friend at that particular time he could feel mr bevans eye upon him but he went through with it till the thing was toldboldly and with no attempt to smooth over any of the unpleasant points  never you mind sir said mr bevan consolingly as he finished we all lose our heads sometimes ive seen the way you stand up to francis and ill eatill eat the medicineball if youre not as plucky as anyone its simply a question of keeping your head you wouldnt do a thing like that again not you dont you worry yourself sir were all alike when we get bustled we dont know what were doing and by the time weve put our hands up and got into shape why its all over and there you are dont you worry yourself sir  youre an awfully good sort joe said sheen gratefully     xi  a small incident   failing a gentleman friend mr bevan was obliged to do what he could by means of local talent on sheens next visit he was introduced to a burly youth of his own age very taciturn and apparently ferocious he it seemed was the knife and boot boy at the blue boar did a bit with the gloves and was willing to spar with sheen provided mr bevan made it all right with the guvnor saw that is so say that he did not get into trouble for passing in unprofessional frivolity moments which should have been sacred to knives and boots these terms having been agreed to he put on the gloves  for the first time since he had begun his lessons sheen experienced an attack of his old shyness and dislike of hurting other peoples feelings he could not resist the thought that he had no grudge against the warden of the knives and boots he hardly liked to hit him  the other however did not share this prejudice he rushed at sheen with such determination that almost the first warning the latter had that the contest had begun was the collision of the back of his head with the wall out in the middle of the room he did better and was beginning to hold his own in spite of a rousing thump on his left eye when joe bevan called time a second round went off in much the same way his guard was more often in the right place and his leads less wild at the conclusion of the round pressure of business forced his opponent to depart and sheen wound up his lesson with a couple of minutes at the punchingball on the whole he was pleased with his first spar with someone who was really doing his best and trying to hurt him with joe bevan and francis there was always the feeling that they were playing down to him joe bevans gentle taps in particular were a little humiliating but with his late opponent all had been serious it had been a real test and he had come through it very fairly on the whole he had taken more than he had givenhis eye would look curious tomorrowbut already he had thought out a way of foiling the burly youths rushes next time he would really show his true form  the morrow on which sheen expected his eye to look curious was the day he had promised to play fives with mr spence he hoped that at the early hour at which they had arranged to play it would not have reached its worst stage but when he looked in the glass at a quarter to seven he beheld a small ridge of purple beneath it it was not large nor did it interfere with his sight but it was very visible mr spence however was a sportsman and had boxed himself in his time so there was a chance that nothing would be said  it was a raw drizzly morning there would probably be few fivesplayers before breakfast and the capture of the second court should be easy so it turned out nobody was about when sheen arrived he pinned his slip of paper to the door and after waiting for a short while for mr spence and finding the process chilly went for a trot round the gymnasium to pass the time  mr spence had not arrived during his absence but somebody else had at the door of the second court gleaming in firstfifteen blazer sweater stockings and honourcap stood attell  sheen looked at attell and attell looked through sheen  it was curious thought sheen that attell should be standing in the very doorway of court two it seemed to suggest that he claimed some sort of ownership on the other hand there was his sheens paper on the his eye happened to light on the cement flooring in front of the court there was a crumpled ball of paper there  when he had started for his run there had been no such ball of paper  sheen picked it up and straightened it out on it was written r d sheen  he looked up quickly in addition to the faraway look attells face now wore a faint smile as if he had seen something rather funny on the horizon but he spake no word  a curiously calm and contented feeling came upon sheen here was something definite at last he could do nothing however much he might resent it when fellows passed him by as if he did not exist but when it came to removing his landmark  would you mind shifting a bit he said very politely i want to pin my paper on the door again it seems to have fallen down  attells gaze shifted slowly from the horizon and gradually embraced sheen  ive got this court he said  i think not said sheen silkily i was here at ten to seven and there was no paper on the door then so i put mine up if you move a little ill put it up again  go and find another court if you want to play said attell and if youve got anybody to play with he added with a sneer this is mine  i think not said sheen  attell resumed his inspection of the horizon  attell said sheen  attell did not answer  sheen pushed him gently out of the way and tore down the paper from the door  their eyes met attell after a moments pause came forward halfmenacing half irresolute and as he came sheen hit him under the chin in the manner recommended by mr bevan  when you uppercut mr bevan was wont to say dont make it a swing just a halfarm jolts all you want  it was certainly all attell wanted he was more than surprised he was petrified the sudden shock of the blow coming as it did from so unexpected a quarter deprived him of speech which was perhaps fortunate for him for what he would have said would hardly have commended itself to mr spence who came up at this moment  well sheen said mr spence here you are i hope i havent kept you waiting what a morning youve got the court i hope  yes sir said sheen  he wondered if the master had seen the little episode which had taken place immediately before his arrival then he remembered that it had happened inside the court it must have been over by the time mr spence had come upon the scene  are you waiting for somebody attell asked mr spence stanning he will be here directly i passed him on the way  attell left the court and they began their game  youve hurt your eye sheen said mr spence at the end of the first game how did that happen  boxing sir said sheen  oh replied mr spence and to sheens relief he did not pursue his inquiries  attell had wandered out across the gravel to meet stanning  got that court inquired stanning  no  you idiot why on earth didnt you its the only court worth playing in whos got it  sheen  sheen stanning stopped dead do you mean to say you let a fool like sheen take it from you why didnt you turn him out  i couldnt said attell i was just going to when spence came up hes playing sheen this morning i couldnt very well bag the court when a master wanted it  i suppose not said stanning what did sheen say when you told him you wanted the court  this was getting near a phase of the subject which attell was not eager to discuss  oh he didnt say much he said  did you do anything persisted stanning  attell suddenly remembered having noticed that sheen was wearing a black eye this was obviously a thing to be turned to account  i hit him in the eye he said ill bet its coloured by schooltime  and sure enough when schooltune arrived there was sheen with his face in the condition described and stanning hastened to spread abroad this sequel to the story of sheens failings in the town battle by the end of preparation it had got about the school that sheen had cheeked attell that attell had hit sheen and that sheen had been afraid to hit him back at the precise moment when sheen was in the middle of a warm twominute round with francis at the blue boar an indignation meeting was being held in the senior dayroom at seymours to discuss this latest disgrace to the house  this is getting a bit too thick was the general opinion moreover it was universally agreed that something ought to be done the feeling in the house against sheen had been stirred to a dangerous pitch by this last episode seymours thought more of their reputation than any house in the school for years past the house had led on the cricket and football field and off it sometimes other houses would actually win one of the cups but when this happened seymours was always their most dangerous rival other houses had their ups and downs were very good one year and very bad the next but seymours had always managed to maintain a steady level of excellence it always had a man or two in the school eleven and fifteen generally supplied one of the school racquets pair for queens club in the easter vac and when this did not happen always had one of two of the gym six or shooting eight or a few men who had won scholarships at the varsities the pride of a house is almost keener than the pride of a school from the first minute he entered the house a new boy was made to feel that in coming to seymours he had accepted a responsibility that his reputation was not his own but belonged to the house if he did well the glory would be seymours glory if he did badly he would be sinning against the house  this second story about sheen therefore stirred seymours to the extent of giving the house a resemblance to a hornets nest into which a stone had been hurled after school that day the house literally hummed the noise of the two dayrooms talking it over could be heard in the road outside the only bar that stood between the outraged seymourites and sheen was drummond as had happened before drummond resolutely refused to allow anything in the shape of an active protest and no argument would draw him from this unreasonable attitude though why it was that he had taken it up he himself could not have said perhaps it was that rooted hatred a boxer instinctively acquires of anything in the shape of unfair play that influenced him he revolted against the idea of a whole house banding together against one of its members  so even this fresh provocation did not result in any active interference with sheen but it was decided that he must be cut even more thoroughly than before  and about the time when this was resolved sheen was receiving the congratulations of francis on having positively landed a blow upon him it was an event which marked an epoch in his career     xii  dunstable and linton go up the river   there are some proud spirited natures which resent rules and laws on principle as attempts to interfere with the rights of the citizen as the duchess in the play said of her son who had had unpleasantness with the authorities at eton because they had been trying to teach him things silwood is a sweet boy but he will not stand the bearingrein dunstable was also a sweet boy but he too objected to the bearingrein and linton was a sweet boy and he had similar prejudices and this placing of the town out of bounds struck both of them simultaneously as a distinct attempt on the part of the headmaster to apply the bearingrein  its all very well to put it out of bounds for the kids said dunstable firmly but when it comes to uswhy i never heard of such a thing  linton gave it as his opinion that such conduct was quite in a class of its own as regarded cool cheek  it fairly sneaks said linton with forced calm the garibaldi  kids proceeded dunstable judicially are idiots and cant be expected to behave themselves down town put the show out of bounds to them if you like but we  we echoed linton  the fact is said dunstable its a beastly nuisance but we shall have to go down town and up the river just to assert ourselves we cant have the thin end of the wedge coming and spoiling our liberties we may as well chuck life altogether if we arent able to go to the town whenever we like  and albert will be pining away added linton                                       hullo young gentlemen said the town boatman when they presented themselves to him what can i do for you  i know it seems strange said dunstable but we want a boat we are the downtrodden british schoolboys league for demanding liberty and seeing that we get it have you a boat  the man said he believed he had a boat in fact now that he came to think of it he rather fancied he had one or two he proceeded to get one ready and the two martyrs to the cause stepped in  dunstable settled himself in the stern and collected the rudderlines  hullo said linton arent you going to row  it may be only my foolish fancy replied dunstable but i rather think youre going to do that ill steer  beastly slacker said linton anyhow how far are we going im not going to pull all night  if you row for about half an hour without exerting yourselfand i can trust you not to do thatand then look to your left youll see a certain hostelry if it hasnt moved since i was last there its called the blue boar we will have tea there and then ill pull gently back and that will end the programme  except being caught in the town by half the masters said linton still im not grumbling this had to be done ready  not just yet said dunstable looking past linton and up the landingstage wait just one second here are some friends of ours  linton looked over his shoulder  albert he cried  and the who struck me divers blows in sundry places ah theyve sighted us  what are you going to do we cant have another scrap with them  far from it said dunstable gently hullo albert and my friend in the motheaten bowler this is well met  you come out here said albert pausing on the brink  why asked dunstable  you see what youll get  but we dont want to see what well get youve got such a narrow mind albertmay i call you bertie you seem to think that nobody has any pleasures except vulgar brawls we are going to row up river and think beautiful thoughts  albert was measuring with his eye the distance between the boat and landingstage it was not far a sudden spring  if you want a fight go up to the school and ask for mr drummond hes the gentlemen who sent you to hospital last time any time youre passing im sure hed  albert leaped  but linton had had him under observation and as he sprung pushed vigorously with his oar the gap between boat and shore widened in an instant and albert failing to obtain a foothold on the boat fell back with a splash that sent a cascade over his friend and the boatman into three feet of muddy water by the time he had scrambled out his enemies were moving pensively upstream  the boatman was annoyed  makin me wet and spoilin my paintwhat yer mean by it  me and my friend here we want a boat said albert ignoring the main issue  want a boat then youll not get a boat spoil my cushions too would you what next i wonder you go to smith and ask him for a boat perhaps he aint so particular about having his cushions  orl right said albert orl right  mr smith proved more complaisant and a quarter of an hour after dunstable and linton had disappeared albert and his friend were on the water moist outside albert burned with a desire for revenge he meant to follow his men till he found them it almost seemed as if there would be a repetition of the naval battle which had caused the town to be put out of bounds albert was a quicktempered youth and he had swallowed fully a pint of severn water                                       dunstable and linton sat for some time in the oak parlour of the blue boar it was late when they went out as they reached the waters edge linton uttered a cry of consternation  whats up asked dunstable i wish you wouldnt do that so suddenly it gives me a start do you feel bad  great scott its gone  the pain  our boat i tied it up to this post  you cant have done whats that boat over there that looks like ours  no it isnt that was there when we came i noticed it i tied ours up here to this post  this is a shade awkward said dunstable thoughtfully you must have tied it up jolly rottenly it must have slipped away and gone downstream this is where we find ourselves in the cart right among the ribstons by jove i feel like that frenchman in the story who lost his glasses just as he got to the top of the mountain and missed the view altogezzer i do not vish i ad kom  im certain i tied it up all right andwhy look heres the rope still on the pole just as i left it  for the first time dunstable seemed interested  this is getting mysterious did we hire a rowingboat or a submarine theres something on the end of this rope give it a tug and see there didnt you feel it  i do believe said linton in an awed voice the things sunk  they pulled at the rope together the waters heaved and broke and up came the nose of the boat to sink back with a splash as they loosened their hold  there are more things in heaven and earth said dunstable wiping his hands if you ask me i should say an enemy hath done this a boat doesnt sink of its own accord  albert said linton the blackguard must have followed us up and done it while we were at tea  thats about it said dunstable and nowhow about getting home  i suppose wed better walk we shall be hours late for lockup  you said dunstable may walk if you are fond of exercise and arent in a hurry personally im going back by river  but  that looks a good enough boat over there anyhow we must make it do one mustnt be particular for once  but it belongswhat will the other fellow do  i cant help his troubles said dunstable mildly having enough of my own coming                                       it was about ten minutes later that sheen approaching the waterside in quest of his boat found no boat there the time was a quarter to six and lockup was at sixthirty     xiii  deus ex machina   it did not occur to sheen immediately that his boat had actually gone the full beauty of the situation was some moments in coming home to him at first he merely thought that somebody had moved it to another part of the bank as the authorities at the inn had done once or twice in the past to make room for the boats of fresh visitors walking along the lawn in search of it he came upon the stake to which dunstables submerged craft was attached he gave the rope a tentative pull and was surprised to find that there was a heavy drag on the end of it  then suddenly the truth flashed across him heavens he cried its sunk  joe bevan and other allies lent their aid to the pulling the lost boat came out of the river like some huge fish and finally rested on the bank oozing water and drenching the grass in all directions  joe bevan stooped down and examined it in the dim light  whats happened here sir he said is that theres a plank gone from the bottom smashed clean out it is not started it isnt smashed clean out thats what it is some one must have been here and done it  sheen looked at the boat and saw that he was right a plank in the middle had been splintered it looked as if somebody had driven some heavy instrument into it as a matter of fact albert had effected the job with the buttend of an oar  the damage was not ruinous a carpenter could put the thing right at no great expense but it would take time and meanwhile the minutes were flying and lockup was now little more than half an hour away  whatll you do sir asked bevan  that was just what sheen was asking himself what could he do the road to the school twisted and turned to such an extent that though the distance from the blue boar to seymours was only a couple of miles as the crow flies he would have to cover double that distance unless he took a short cut across the fields and if he took a short cut in the dark he was certain to lose himself it was a choice of evils the blue boar possessed but one horse and trap and he had seen that driven away to the station in charge of a fishermans luggage half an hour before  i shall have to walk he said  its a long way youll be late wont you said mr bevan  it cant be helped i suppose i shall i wonder who smashed that boat he added after a pause  passing through the inn on his way to the road he made inquiries it appeared that two young gentlemen from the school had been there to tea they had arrived in a boat and gone away in a boat nobody else had come into the inn suspicion obviously rested upon them  do you remember anything about them asked sheen  further details came out one of the pair had worn a cap like sheens the others headgear minutely described showed him that its owner was a member of the school second eleven  sheen pursued the inquiry he would be so late in any case that a minute or so more or less would make no material difference and he was very anxious to find out if possible who it was that had placed him in this difficulty he knew that he was unpopular in the school but he had not looked for this sort of thing  then somebody suddenly remembered having heard one of the pair address the other by name  what name asked sheen  his informant was not sure would it be lindon  linton said sheen  that was it  sheen thanked him and departed still puzzled linton as he knew him was not the sort of fellow to do a thing like that and the other the second eleven man must be dunstable they were always about together he did not know much about dunstable but he could hardly believe that this sort of thing was his form either well he would have to think of that later he must concentrate himself now on covering the distance to the school in the minimum of time he looked at his watch twenty minutes more if he hurried he might not be so very late he wished that somebody would come by in a cart and give him a lift  he stopped and listened no sound of horses hoof broke the silence he walked on again  then faint at first but growing stronger every instant there came from some point in the road far behind him a steady droning sound he almost shouted with joy a motor even now he might do it  but could he stop it would the motorist pay any attention to him or would he flash past and leave him in the dust from the rate at which the drone increased the car seemed to be travelling at a rare speed  he moved to one side of the road and waited he could see the lights now flying towards him  then as the car hummed past he recognised its driver and put all he knew into a shout  bruce he cried  for a moment it seemed as if he had not been heard the driver paid not the smallest attention as far as he could see he looked neither to the left nor to right then the car slowed down and backing came slowly to where he stood  hullo said the driver whos that  jack bruce was alone in the car muffled to the eyes in an overcoat it was more by his general appearance than his face that sheen had recognised him  its me sheen i say bruce i wish youd give me a lift to seymours will you  there was never any waste of words about jack bruce of all the six hundred and thirtyfour boys at wrykyn he was probably the only one whose next remark in such circumstances would not have been a question bruce seldom asked questionsnever if they wasted time  hop in he said  sheen consulted his watch again  lockups in a quarter of an hour he said but they give us ten minutes grace that allows us plenty of time doesnt it  do it in seven minutes if you like  dont hurry said sheen ive never been in a motor before and i dont want to cut the experience short its awfully good of you to give me a lift  thats all right said bruce  were you going anywhere am i taking you out of your way  no i was just trying the car its a new one the paters just got it  do you do much of this said sheen  good bit im going in for the motor business when i leave school  so all this is training  thats it  there was a pause  you seemed to be going at a good pace just now said sheen  about thirty miles an hour she can move all right  thats faster than youre allowed to go isnt it  yes  youve never been caught have you  not yet i want to see how much pace i can get out of her because shell be useful when the election really comes on bringing voters to the poll you know thats why the pater bought this new car its a beauty his others only a little runabout  doesnt your father mind your motoring  likes it said jack bruce  it seemed to sheen that it was about time that he volunteered some information about himself instead of plying his companion with questions it was pleasant talking to a wrykinian again and jack bruce had apparently either not heard of the albert incident or else he was not influenced by it in any way  youve got me out of an awful hole bruce he began  thats all right been out for a walk  id been to the blue boar  oh said bruce he did not seem to wish to know why sheen had been there  sheen proceeded to explain  i suppose youve heard all about me he said uncomfortably about the town you know that fight not joining in  heard something about it said bruce  i went down town again after that said sheen and met the same fellows who were fighting linton and the others they came for me and i was getting awfully mauled when joe bevan turned up  oh is joe back again  do you know him asked sheen in surprise  oh yes i used to go to the blue boar to learn boxing from him all last summer holidays  did you really why thats what im doing now  good man said bruce  isnt he a splendid teacher  ripping  but i didnt know you boxed bruce you never went in for any of the school competitions  im rather a rotten weight ten six too heavy for the lightweights and not heavy enough for the middles besides the competitions here are really interhouse they dont want dayboys going in for them are you going to box for seymours  thats what i want to do you see it would be rather a score wouldnt it after whats happened you know  i suppose it would  i should like to do something its not very pleasant he added with a forced laugh being considered a disgrace to the house and cut by everyone  suppose not  the difficulty is drummond you see we are both the same weight and hes much better than i am im hoping that hell go in for the middles and let me take the lightweights theres nobody he couldnt beat in the middles though he would be giving away a stone  have you asked him  not yet i want to keep it dark that im learning to box just at present  spring it on them suddenly  yes of course i cant let it get about that i go to joe bevan because i have to break bounds every time i do it  the upper rivers out of bounds now for boarders isnt it  yes  jack bruce sat in silence for a while his gaze concentrated on the road in front of him  why go by river at all he said at last if you like ill run you to the blue boar in the motor every day  oh i say thats awfully decent of you said sheen  i should like to see old joe again i think ill come and spar too if youre learning what you want more than anything is somebody your own size to box with  thats just what joe was saying will you really i should be awfully glad if you would boxing with joe is all right but you feel all the time hes fooling with you i should like to try how i got on with somebody else  youd better meet me here then as soon after school as you can  as he spoke the car stopped  where are we asked sheen  just at the corner of the road behind the houses  oh i know hullo there goes the lockup bell i shall do it comfortably  he jumped down  i say bruce he said i really am most awfully obliged for the lift something went wrong with my boat and i couldnt get back in it i should have been frightfully in the cart if you hadnt come by  thats all right said jack bruce i say sheen  hullo  are you going to practise in the musicroom after morning school tomorrow  yes why  i think ill turn up  i wish you would  whats that thing that goes like this i forget most of it  he whistled a few bars  thats a thing of greigs said sheen  you might play it tomorrow said bruce  rather of course i will  thanks said jack bruce good night  he turned the car and vanished down the road from the sound sheen judged that he was once more travelling at a higher rate of speed than the local police would have approved     xiv  a skirmish   upon consideration sheen determined to see linton about that small matter of the boat without delay after prayers that night he went to his study  can i speak to you for a minute linton he said  linton was surprised he disapproved of this intrusion when a fellow is being cut by the house he ought by all the laws of school etiquette to behave as such and not speak till he is spoken to  what do you want asked linton  i shant keep you long do you think you could put away that book for a minute and listen  linton hesitated then shut the book  hurry up then he said  i was going to said sheen i simply came in to tell you that i know perfectly well who sunk my boat this afternoon  he felt at once that he had now got lintons undivided attention  your boat said linton you dont mean to say that was yours what on earth were you doing at the place  i dont think thats any business of yours is it linton  how did you get back  i dont think thats any business of yours either i daresay youre disappointed but i did manage to get back in time for lockup too  but i dont understand do you mean to say that that was your boat we took  sunk corrected sheen  dont be a fool sheen what the dickens should we want to sink your boat for what happened was this albertyou remember albertfollowed us up to the inn and smashed our boat while we were having tea when we got out and found it sunk we bagged the only other one we could see we hadnt a notion it was yours we thought it belonged to some fisherman chap  then you didnt sink my boat  of course we didnt what do you take us for  sorry said sheen i thought it was a queer thing for you to have done im glad it wasnt you good night  but look here said linton dont go it must have landed you in a frightful hole didnt it  a little but it doesnt matter good night  but half a second sheen  sheen had disappeared  linton sat on till lights were turned off ruminating he had a very tender conscience where other members of the school were concerned though it was tougher as regarded masters and he was full of remorse at the thought of how nearly he had got sheen into trouble by borrowing his boat that afternoon it seemed to him that it was his duty to make it up to him in some way  it was characteristic of linton that the episode did not in any way alter his attitude towards sheen another boy in a similar position might have become effusively friendly linton looked on the affair in a calm judicial spirit he had done sheen a bad turn but that was no reason why he should fling himself on his neck and swear eternal friendship his demeanour on the occasions when they came in contact with each other remained the same he did not speak to him and he did not seem to see him but all the while he was remembering that somehow or other he must do him a good turn of some sort by way of levelling things up again when that good turn had been done he might dismiss him from his thoughts altogether  sheen for his part made no attempt to trade on the matter of the boat he seemed as little anxious to be friendly with linton as linton was to be friendly with him for this linton was grateful and continued to keep his eyes open in the hope of finding some opportunity of squaring up matters between them  his chance was not long in coming the feeling in the house against sheen caused by the story of his encounter with attell had not diminished stanning had fostered it in various little ways it was not difficult when a house of the standing in the school which seymours possessed exhibits a weak spot the rest of the school do not require a great deal of encouragement to go on prodding that weak spot in short the school rotted seymours about sheen and seymours raged impotently fags of other houses expended much crude satire on seymours fags and even the seniors of the house came in for their share of the baiting most of the houses at wrykyn were jealous of seymours and this struck them as an admirable opportunity of getting something of their own back  one afternoon not long after sheens conversation with linton stanning came into seymours senior dayroom and sat down on the table the senior dayroom objected to members of other houses coming and sitting on their table as if they had bought that rickety piece of furniture but stannings reputation as a bruiser kept their resentment within bounds  hullo you chaps said stanning  the members of the senior dayroom made no reply but continued as mr kipling has it to persecute their vocations most of them were brewing they went on brewing with the earnest concentration of chefs  youre a cheery lot said stanning but i dont wonder youve got the hump i should be a bit sick if wed got a skunk like that in our house heard the latest  some lunatic said no what thereby delivering the dayroom bound into the hands of the enemy  sheens apologised to attell  there was a sensation in the senior dayroom as stanning had expected he knew his men he was perfectly aware that any story which centred round sheens cowardice would be believed by them so he had not troubled to invent a lie which it would be difficult to disprove he knew that in the present state of feeling in the house sheen would not be given a hearing  no shouted the senior dayroom  this was the last straw the fellow seemed to go out of his way to lower the prestige of the house  fact said stanning i thought you knew  he continued to sit on the table swinging his legs while the full horror of his story sunk into the senior dayroom mind  i wonder you dont do something about it why dont you touch him up hes not a prefect  but they were not prepared to go to that length the senior dayroom had a great respect both for drummonds word and his skill with his hands he had said he would slay any one who touched sheen and they were of opinion that he would do it  he isnt in said one of the brewers looking up from his toastingfork his study door was open when i passed  i say why not rag his study suggested another thickly through a mouthful of toast  stanning smiled  good idea he said  it struck him that some small upheaval of sheens study furniture coupled with the burning of one or two books might check to some extent that students work for the gotford and if sheen could be stopped working for the gotford he stanning would romp home in the matter of brilliance there was no comparison between them it was sheens painful habit of work which made him dangerous  linton had been listening to this conversation in silence he had come to the senior dayroom to borrow a book he now slipped out and made his way to drummonds study  drummond was in linton proceeded to business  i say drummond  hullo  that man stanning has come in hes getting the senior dayroom to rag sheens study  what  linton repeated his statement  does the man think he owns the house said drummond where is he  coming up now i hear them what are you going to do stop them  what do you think of course i am im not going to have any of applebys crew coming into seymours and ragging studies  this ought to be worth seeing said linton look on me as charles his friend ill help if you want me but its your scene  drummond opened his door just as stanning and his myrmidons were passing it  hullo stanning he said  stanning turned the punitive expedition stopped  do you want anything inquired drummond politely  the members of the senior dayroom who were with stanning rallied round silent and interested this dramatic situation appealed to them they had a passion for rows and this looked distinctly promising  there was a pause stanning looked carefully at drummond drummond looked carefully at stanning  i was going to see sheen said stanning at length  he isnt in  oh  another pause  was it anything special inquired drummond pleasantly  the expedition edged a little forward  no oh no nothing special said stanning  the expedition looked disappointed  any message i can give him asked drummond  no thanks said stanning  sure  quite thanks  i dont think its worth while your waiting he may not be in for some time  no perhaps not thanks so long  so long  stanning turned on his heel and walked away down the passage drummond went back into his study and shut the door  the expedition deprived of its commanderinchief paused irresolutely outside then it followed its leaders example  there was peace in the passage     xv  the rout at ripton   on the saturday following this episode the first fifteen travelled to ripton to play the return match with that school on its own ground of the two ripton matches the one played at wrykyn was always the big event of the football year but the other came next in importance and the telegram which was despatched to the school shop at the close of the game was always awaited with anxiety this year wrykyn looked forward to the return match with a certain amount of apathy due partly to the fact that the school was in a slack unpatriotic state and partly to the hammering the team had received in the previous term when the ripton centre threequarters had run through and scored with monotonous regularity were bound to get sat on was the general verdict of the school  allardyce while thoroughly agreeing with this opinion did his best to conceal the fact from the rest of the team he had certainly done his duty by them every day for the past fortnight the forwards and outsides had turned out to run and pass and on the saturdays there had been matches with corpus oxford and the cambridge old wrykinians in both games the school had been beaten in fact it seemed as if they could only perform really well when they had no opponents to see the threequarters racing down the field at practice and scoring innumerable imaginary tries one was apt to be misled into considering them a fine quartette but when there was a match all the beautiful dash and precision of the passing faded away and the last thing they did was to run straight barry was the only one of the four who played the game properly  but as regarded condition there was nothing wrong with the team even trevor could not have made them train harder and allardyce in his more sanguine moments had a shadowy hope that the ripton score might with care be kept in the teens  barry had bought a sportsman at the station and he unfolded it as the train began to move searching the lefthand column of the middle page as we all do when we buy the sportsman on saturdayto see how our names look in print and what sort of a team the enemy has gothe made a remarkable discovery at the same moment drummond on the other side of the carriage did the same  i say he said they must have had a big clearout at ripton have you seen the team theyve got out today  i was just looking at it said barry  whats up with it inquired allardyce lets have a look  theyve only got about half their proper team theyve got a different backgrey isnt playing  both their centres are though said drummond  more fun for us drum old chap said attell im going home again stop the train  drummond said nothing he hated attell most when he tried to be facetious  dunn isnt playing nor is waite said barry so they havent got either of their proper halves i say we might have a chance of doing something today  of course we shall said allardyce youve only got to buck up and weve got them on toast  the atmosphere in the carriage became charged with optimism it seemed a simple thing to defeat a side which was practically a ripton a team the centre threequarters were there still it was true but allardyce and drummond ought to be able to prevent the halves ever getting the ball out to them the team looked on those two unknown halves as timid novices who would lose their heads at the kickoff as a matter of fact the system of football teaching at ripton was so perfect and the keenness so great that the second fifteen was nearly as good as the first every year but the wrykyn team did not know this with the exception of allardyce who kept his knowledge to himself and they arrived at ripton jaunty and confident  keith the ripton captain who was one of the centre threequarters who had made so many holes in the wrykyn defence in the previous term met the team at the station and walked up to the school with them carrying allardyces bag  you seem to have lost a good many men at christmas said allardyce we were reading the sportsman in the train apparently youve only got ten of your last terms lot have they all left  the ripton captain grinned ruefully  not much he replied theyre all here all except dunn you remember dunn little thickset chap who played half he always had his hair quite tidy and parted exactly in the middle all through the game  oh yes i remember dunn whats he doing now  gone to coopers hill rot his not going to the varsity hed have walked into his blue  allardyce agreed he had marked dunn in the match of the previous term and that immaculate sportsman had made things not a little warm for him  where are all the others then he asked wheres that other half of yours and the rest of the forwards  mumps said keith  what  its a fact rot isnt it weve had a regular bout of it twenty fellows got it altogether naturally four of those were in the team thats the way things happen i only wonder the whole scrum didnt have it  what beastly luck said allardyce we had measles like that a couple of years ago in the summer term and had to play the incogs and zingari with a sort of second eleven we got mopped  thats what we shall get this afternoon im afraid said keith  oh no said allardyce of course you wont  and as events turned out that was one of the truest remarks he had ever made in his life                                       one of the drawbacks to playing ripton on its own ground was the crowd another was the fact that one generally got beaten but your sportsman can put up with defeat what he does not like is a crowd that regards him as a subtle blend of incompetent idiot and malicious scoundrel and says so very loud and clear it was not of course the school that did this they spent their time blushing for the shouters it was the patriotic inhabitants of ripton town who made the school wish that they could be saved from their friends the football ground at ripton was at the edge of the school fields separated from the road by narrow iron railings and along these railings the choicest spirits of the town would line up and smoke and yell and spit and yell again as wordsworth wrote there are two voices they were on something like the following lines  inside the railings schooooooool buck up schooooooool get it out schooooooool  outside the railings gow it ripton thats the way ripton twist his goodoldenglishadjectived neck ripton sit on his forcibly described head ripton gow it ripton haw haw haw they aint no use ripton kick im in the eye ripton haw haw haw  the bursts of merriment signalised the violent downfall of some dangerous opponent  the school loathed these humble supporters and occasionally fastidious juniors would go the length of throwing chunks of mud at them through the railings but nothing discouraged them or abated their fervid desire to see the school win every year they seemed to increase in zeal and they were always in great form at the wrykyn match  it would be charitable to ascribe to this reason the gruesome happenings of that afternoon they needed some explaining away                                       allardyce won the toss and chose to start downhill with the wind in his favour it is always best to get these advantages at the beginning of the game if one starts against the wind it usually changes ends at halftime amidst a roar from both touchlines and a volley of howls from the road a ripton forward kicked off the ball flew in the direction of stanning on the right wing a storm of laughter arose from the road as he dropped it the first scrum was formed on the wrykyn twentyfive line  the ripton forwards got the ball and heeled with their usual neatness the ripton half who was taking the scrum gathered it cleanly and passed to his colleague he was a sturdy youth with a dark rather forbidding face in which the acute observer might have read signs of the savage he was of the breed which is vaguely described at public schools as nigger a term covering every variety of shade from ebony to light lemon as a matter of fact he was a halfcaste sent home to england to be educated drummond recognised him as he dived forward to tackle him the last place where they had met had been the roped ring at aldershot it was his opponent in the final of the feathers  he reached him as he swerved and they fell together the ball bounded forward  hullo peteiro he said thought youd left  the other grinned recognition  hullo drummond  going up to aldershot this year  yes lightweight  so am i  the scrum had formed by now and further conversation was impossible drummond looked a little thoughtful as he put the ball in he had been told that peteiro was leaving ripton at christmas it was a nuisance his being still at school drummond was not afraid of himhe would have fought a champion of the world if the school had expected him tobut he could not help remembering that it was only by the very narrowest margin and after a terrific three rounds that he had beaten him in the feathers the year before it would be too awful for words if the decision were to be reversed in the coming competition  but he was not allowed much leisure for pondering on the future the present was too full of incident and excitement the withdrawal of the four invalids and the departure of dunn had not reduced the ripton team to that wreck of its former self which the wrykyn fifteen had looked for on the contrary their play seemed if anything a shade better than it had been in the former match there was all the old aggressiveness and peteiro and his partner so far from being timid novices and losing their heads eclipsed the exhibition given at wrykyn by waite and dunn play had only been in progress six minutes when keith taking a pass on the twentyfive line slipped past attell ran round the back and scored between the posts three minutes later the other ripton centre scored at the end of twenty minutes the wrykyn line had been crossed five times and each of the tries had been converted  cant you fellows get that ball in the scrum demanded allardyce plaintively as the team began for the fifth time the old familiar walk to the halfway line pack tight and get the first shove  the result of this address was to increase the ripton lead by four points in his anxiety to get the ball one of the wrykyn forwards started heeling before it was in and the referee promptly gave a free kick to ripton for foot up as this event took place within easy reach of the wrykyn goal and immediately in front of the same keith had no difficulty in bringing off the penalty  by halftime the crowd in the road hoarse with laughter had exhausted all their adjectives and were repeating themselves the ripton score was six goals a penalty goal and two tries to nil and the wrykyn team was a demoralised rabble  the fact that the rate of scoring slackened somewhat after the interval may be attributed to the disinclination of the riptonians to exert themselves unduly they ceased playing in the stern and scientific spirit in which they had started and instead of adhering to an orthodox game began to enjoy themselves the forwards no longer heeled like a machine they broke through ambitiously and tried to score on their own account when the outsides got as far as the back they did not pass they tried to drop goals in this way only twentytwo points were scored after halftime allardyce and drummond battled on nobly but with their pack hopelessly outclassed it was impossible for them to do anything of material use barry on the wing tackled his man whenever the latter got the ball but as a rule the centres did not pass but attacked by themselves at last by way of a fitting conclusion to the rout the ripton back catching a high punt ran instead of kicking and to the huge delight of the town contingent scored with this incident the visiting team drained the last dregs of the bitter cup humiliation could go no further almost immediately afterwards the referee blew his whistle for no side  three cheers for wrykyn said keith  to the fifteen victims it sounded ironical     xvi  drummond goes into retirement   the return journey of a school team after a crushing defeat in a foreign match is never a very exhilarating business those members of the side who have not yet received their colours are wondering which of them is to be sacrificed to popular indignation and chucked the rest who have managed to get their caps are feeling that even now twothirds of the school will be saying that they are not worth a place in the third fifteen while the captain brooding apart is becoming soured at the thought that posterity will forget what little good he may have done and remember only that it was in his year that the school got so many points taken off them by soandso conversation does not ripple and sparkle during these homecomings the wrykyn team made the journey in almost unbroken silence they were all stiff and sore and their feelings were such as to unfit them for talking to people  the school took the thing very philosophicallya bad sign when a school is in a healthy normal condition it should be stirred up by a bad defeat by another school like a disturbed wasps nest wrykyn made one or two remarks about people who could not play footer for toffee and then let the thing drop  sheen was too busy with his work and his boxing to have much leisure for mourning over this latest example of the present inefficiency of the school the examination for the gotford was to come off in two days and the interhouse boxing was fixed for the following wednesday in five days therefore he would get his chance of retrieving his lost place in the school he was certain that he could at any rate make a very good show against anyone in the school even drummond joe bevan was delighted with his progress and quoted shakespeare volubly in his admiration jack bruce and francis added their tribute and the knife and boot boy paid him the neatest compliment of all by refusing pointblank to have any more dealings with him whatsoever his professional duties explained the knife and boot boy did not include being punched in the heye by blokes and he did not intend to be put upon  youll do all right said jack bruce as they were motoring home if theyll let you go in for it all but how do you know they will have they chosen the men yet  not yet they dont do it till the day before but there wont be any difficulty about that drummond will let me have a shot if he thinks im good enough  oh youre good enough said bruce  and when on monday evening francis on receipt of no fewer than four blows in a single rounda record shook him by the hand and said that if ever he happened to want a leetle darg that was a perfect bag of tricks and had got a pedigree mind you he francis would be proud to supply that animal sheen felt that the moment had come to approach drummond on the subject of the house boxing it would be a little awkward at first and conversation would probably run somewhat stiffly but all would be well once he had explained himself  but things had been happening in his absence which complicated the situation allardyce was having tea with drummond who had been stopping in with a sore throat he had come principally to make arrangements for the match between his house and seymours in the semifinal round of the competition  youre looking bad he said taking a seat  im feeling bad said drummond for the past few days he had been very much out of sorts he put it down to a chill caught after the ripton match he had never mustered up sufficient courage to sponge himself with cold water after soaking in a hot bath and he occasionally suffered for it  whats up inquired allardyce  oh i dont know sort of beastly feeling sore throat nothing much only it makes you feel rather rotten  allardyce looked interested  i say he said it looks as ifi wonder i hope you havent  what  mumps it sounds jolly like it  mumps of course ive not why should i  allardyce produced a letter from his pocket i got this from keith the ripton captain this morning you know theyve had a lot of the thing there oh didnt you that was why they had such a bad team out  bad team murmured drummond  well i mean not their best team they had four of their men down with mumps heres what keith says listen bit about hoping we got back all right and so on first then he sayshere it is another of our fellows has got the mumps one of the forwards rather a long man who was good out of touch he developed it a couple of days after the match its lucky that all our card games are over we beat johns oxford last wednesday and that finished the card but itll rather rot up the house matches we should have walked the cup but theres no knowing what will happen now i hope none of your lot caught the mumps from browning during the game its quite likely of course browning ought not to have been playing but i had no notion that there was anything wrong with him he never said he felt bad youve got it drummond thats whats the matter with you  oh rot said drummond its only a chill  but the school doctor who had looked in at the house to dose a small seymourite who had indulged too heartily in the pleasures of the table had other views and before lockup drummond was hurried off to the infirmary  sheen went to drummonds study after preparation had begun and was surprised to find him out not being on speaking terms with a single member of the house he was always outofdate as regarded items of school news as a rule he had to wait until jack bruce told him before learning of any occurrence of interest he had no notion that mumps was the cause of drummonds absence and he sat and waited patiently for him in his study till the bell rang for prayers the only possible explanation that occurred to him was that drummond was in somebody elses study and he could not put his theory to the test by going and looking it was only when drummond did not put in an appearance at prayers that sheen began to suspect that something might have happened  it was maddening not to be able to make inquiries he had almost decided to go and ask linton and risk whatever might be the consequences of such a step when he remembered that the matron must know he went to her and was told that drummond was in the infirmary  he could not help seeing that this made his position a great deal more difficult in ten minutes he could have explained matters to drummond if he had found him in his study but it would be a more difficult task to put the thing clearly in a letter  meanwhile it was bedtime and he soon found his hands too full with his dormitory to enable him to think out the phrasing of that letter the dormitory which was recruited entirely from the junior dayroom had heard of drummonds departure with rejoicings they liked drummond but he was a good deal too fond of the iron hand for their tastes a night with sheen in charge should prove a welcome change  a deafening uproar was going on when sheen arrived and as he came into the room somebody turned the gas out he found some matches on the chest of drawers and lit it again just in time to see a sportive youth tearing the clothes off his bed and piling them on the floor a month before he would not have known how to grapple with such a situation but his evenings with joe bevan had given him the habit of making up his mind and acting rapidly drummond was wont to keep a swaggerstick by his bedside for the better observance of law and order sheen possessed himself of this swaggerstick and reasoned with the sportive youth the rest of the dormitory looked on in interested silence it was a critical moment and on his handling of it depended sheens victory or defeat if he did not keep his head he was lost a dormitory is merciless to a prefect whose weakness they have discovered  sheen kept his head in a quiet pleasant voice fingering the swaggerstick as he spoke in an absent manner he requested his young friend to remake the bedrapidly and completely for the space of five minutes no sound broke the silence except the rustle of sheets and blankets at the end of that period the bed looked as good as new  thanks said sheen gratefully thats very kind of you  he turned to the rest of the dormitory  dont let me detain you he said politely get into bed as soon as you like  the dormitory got into bed sooner than they liked for some reason the colossal rag they had planned had fizzled out they were thoughtful as they crept between the sheets could these things be                                       after much deliberation sheen sent his letter to drummond on the following day it was not a long letter but it was carefully worded it explained that he had taken up boxing of late and ended with a request that he might be allowed to act as drummonds understudy in the house competitions  it was late that evening when the infirmary attendant came over with the answer  like the original letter the answer was brief  dear sheen wrote drummond thanks for the offer i am afraid i cant accept it we must have the best man linton is going to box for the house in the lightweights     xvii  seymours one success   this polite epistle it may be mentioned was a revised version of the one which drummond originally wrote in reply to sheens request his first impulse had been to answer in the four brief words dont be a fool for sheens letter had struck him as nothing more than a contemptible piece of posing and he had all the hatred for poses which is a characteristic of the plain and straightforward type of mind it seemed to him that sheen as he expressed it to himself was trying to do the boy hero in the school library which had been stocked during the dark ages when that type of story was popular there were numerous school stories in which the hero retrieved a rocky reputation by thrashing the bully displaying in the encounter an intuitive but overwhelming skill with his fists drummond could not help feeling that sheen must have been reading one of these stories it was all very fine and noble of him to want to show that he was no coward after all like leo cholmondeley or whatever his beastly name was in the lads of st ethelbertas or some such piffling book but thought drummond in his cold practical way what about the house if sheen thought that seymours was going to chuck away all chance of winning one of the interhouse events simply in order to give him an opportunity of doing the young hero the sooner he got rid of that sort of idea the better if he wanted to do the leo cholmondeley business let him go and chuck a kid into the river and jump in and save him but he wasnt going to have the house let in for twenty sheens  such were the meditations of drummond when the infirmary attendant brought sheens letter to him and he seized pencil and paper and wrote dont be a fool but pity succeeded contempt and he tore up the writing after all however much he had deserved it the man had had a bad time it was no use jumping on him and at one time they had been pals might as well do the thing politely  all of which reflections would have been prevented had sheen thought of mentioning the simple fact that it was joe bevan who had given him the lessons to which he referred in his letter but he had decided not to do so wishing to avoid long explanations and there was he felt a chance that the letter might come into other hands than those of drummond so he had preserved silence on that point thereby wrecking his entire scheme  it struck him that he might go to linton explain his position and ask him to withdraw in his favour but there were difficulties in the way of that course there is a great deal of red tape about the athletic arrangements of a house at a public school when once an order has gone forth it is difficult to get it repealed linton had been chosen to represent the house in the lightweights and he would carry out orders only illness would prevent him appearing in the ring  sheen made up his mind not to try to take his place and went through the days a victim to gloom which was caused by other things besides his disappointment respecting the boxing competition the gotford examination was over now and he was not satisfied with his performance though he did not know it his dissatisfaction was due principally to the fact that owing to his isolation he had been unable to compare notes after the examinations with the others doing an examination without comparing notes subsequently with ones rivals is like playing golf against a bogey the imaginary rival against whom one pits oneself never makes a mistake our own howlers stand out in all their horrid nakedness but we do not realise that our rivals have probably made others far worse in this way sheen plumbed the depths of depression the gotford was a purely classical examination with the exception of one paper a general knowledge paper and it was in this that sheen fancied he had failed so miserably his greek and latin verse were always good his prose he felt was not altogether beyond the pale but in the general knowledge paper he had come down heavily as a matter of fact if he had only known the paper was an exceptionally hard one and there was not a single candidate for the scholarship who felt satisfied with his treatment of it it was to questions ten eleven and thirteen of this paper that cardew of the school house who had entered for the scholarship for the sole reason that competitors got excused two clear days of ordinary schoolwork wrote the following answer      see encylopaedia britannica times edition  if they really wanted to know he said subsequently that was the authority to go to he himself would probably misinform them altogether  in addition to the gotford and the house boxing the house fives now came on and the authorities of seymours were in no small perplexity they met together in rigbys study to discuss the matter their difficulty was this there was only one inmate of seymours who had a chance of carrying off the house fives cup and that was sheen the house was asking itself what was to be done about it  you see said rigby you can look at it in two ways whichever you like we ought certainly to send in our best man for the pot whatever sort of chap he is but then come to think of it sheen cant very well be said to belong to the house at all when a mans been cut dead during the whole term he cant be looked on as one of the house very well see what i mean  of course he cant said mill who was second in command at seymours mills attitude towards his fellow men was one of incessant hostility he seemed to bear a grudge against the entire race  rigby resumed he was a pacific person and hated anything resembling rows in the house he had been sorry for sheen and would have been glad to give him a chance of setting himself on his legs again  you see he said this is what i mean we either recognise sheens existence or we dont follow we cant get him to win this cup for us and then when he has done it go on cutting him and treating him as if he didnt belong to the house at all i know he let the house down awfully badly in that business but still if he lifts the fives cup thatll square the thing if he does anything to give the house a legup he must be treated as if hed never let it down at all  of course said barry i vote we send him in for the fives  what rot said mill it isnt as if none of the rest of us played fives  we arent as good as sheen said barry  i dont care i call it rot letting a chap like him represent the house at anything if he were the best fivesplayer in the world i wouldnt let him play for the house  rigby was impressed by his vehemence he hesitated  after all barry he said i dont know perhaps it mightyou see he didwell i really think wed better have somebody else the house has got its knife into sheen too much just at present to want him as a representative thered only be sickness dont you think who else is there  so it came about that menzies was chosen to uphold the house in the fives courts sheen was not surprised but it was not pleasant he was certainly having bad luck in his attempts to do something for the house perhaps if he won the gotford they might show a little enthusiasm the gotford always caused a good deal of interest in the school it was the best thing of its kind in existence at wrykyn and even the most abandoned loafers liked to feel that their house had won it it was just possible thought sheen that a brilliant win might change the feelings of seymours towards him he did not care for the applause of the multitude more than a boy should but he preferred it very decidedly to the cut direct  things went badly for seymours never in the history of the house or at any rate in the comparatively recent history of the house had there been such a slump in athletic trophies to begin with they were soundly beaten in the semifinal for the house football cup by allardyces lot with drummond away there was none to mark the captain of the school team at half and allardyce had raced through in a manner that must have compensated him to a certain extent for the poor time he had had in first fifteen matches the game had ended in a seymourite defeat by nineteen points to five  nor had the boxing left the house in a better position linton fought pluckily in the lightweights but went down before stanning after beating a representative of templars mill did not show up well in the heavyweights and was defeated in his first bout seymours were reduced to telling themselves how different it all would have been if drummond had been there  sheen watched the lightweight contests and nearly danced with irritation he felt that he could have eaten stanning the man was quick with his left but he couldnt box he hadnt a notion of sidestepping and the uppercut appeared to be entirely outside his range he would like to see him tackle francis  sheen thought bitterly of drummond why on earth couldnt he have given him a chance it was maddening  the fives carried on the story menzies was swamped by a days man he might just as well have stayed away altogether the star of seymours was very low on the horizon  and then the house scored its one success the headmaster announced it in the hall after prayers in his dry unemotional way  i have received the list of marks he said from the examiners for the gotford scholarship he paused sheen felt a sudden calm triumph flood over him somehow intuitively he knew that he had won he waited without excitement for the next words  out of a possible thousand marks sheen who wins the scholarship obtained seven hundred and one stanning six hundred and four wilson  sheen walked out of the hall in the unique position of a gotford winner with only one friend to congratulate him jack bruce was the one the other six hundred and thirtythree members of the school made no demonstration  there was a pleasant custom at seymours of applauding at tea any seymourite who had won distinction and so shed a reflected glory on the house the head of the house would observe well played soandso and the rest of the house would express their emotion in the way that seemed best to them to the subsequent exultation of the local crockery merchant who had generally to supply at least a dozen fresh cups and plates to the house after one of these occasions when it was for getting his first eleven or first fifteen cap that the lucky man was being cheered the total of breakages sometimes ran into the twenties  rigby good easy man was a little doubtful as to what course to pursue in the circumstances should he give the signal after all the fellow had won the gotford it was a score for the house and they wanted all the scores they could get in these lean years perhaps then he had better  well played sheen said he  there was a dead silence a giggle from the fags table showed that the comedy of the situation was not lost on the young mind  the head of the house looked troubled this was awfully awkward  well played sheen he said again  dont mention it rigby said the winner of the gotford politely looking up from his plate     xviii  mr bevan makes a suggestion   when one has been working hard with a single end in view the arrival and departure of the supreme moment is apt to leave a feeling of emptiness as if life had been drained of all its interest and left nothing sufficiently exciting to make it worth doing horatius as he followed his plough on a warm day over the corn land which his gratified country bestowed on him for his masterly handling of the traffic on the bridge must sometimes have felt it was a little tame the feeling is far more acute when one has been unexpectedly baulked in ones desire for action sheen for the first few days after he received drummonds brief note felt that it was useless for him to try to do anything the fates were against him in stories as mr anstey has pointed out the hero is never long without his chance of retrieving his reputation a mad bull comes into the school grounds and he alone the hero not the bull is calm or there is a fire and whose is that pale and gesticulating form at the upper window the bullys of course and who is that climbing nimbly up the virginia creeper why the hero who else three hearty cheers for the plucky hero  but in real life opportunities of distinguishing oneself are less frequent  sheen continued his visits to the blue boar but more because he shrank from telling joe bevan that all his trouble had been for nothing than because he had any definite object in view it was bitter to listen to the eulogies of the pugilist when all the while he knew that as far as any immediate results were concerned it did not really matter whether he boxed well or feebly some day perhaps as mr bevan was fond of pointing out when he approached the subject of disadvantages of boxing he might meet a hooligan when he was crossing a field with his sister but he found that but small consolation he was in the position of one who wants a small sum of ready money and is told that in a few years he may come into a fortune by the time he got a chance of proving himself a man with his hands he would be an old wrykinian he was leaving at the end of the summer term  jack bruce was sympathetic and talked more freely than was his wont  i cant understand it he said drummond always seemed a good sort i should have thought he would have sent you in for the house like a shot are you sure you put it plainly in your letter what did you say  sheen repeated the main points of his letter  did you tell him who had been teaching you  no i just said id been boxing lately  pity said jack bruce if youd mentioned that it was joe whod been training you he would probably have been much more for it you see he couldnt know whether you were any good or not from your letter but if youd told him that joe bevan and hunt both thought you good hed have seen there was something in it  it never occurred to me like a fool i was counting on the thing so much that it didnt strike me there would be any real difficulty in getting him to see my point especially when he got mumps and couldnt go in himself well it cant be helped now  and the conversation turned to the prospects of jack bruces father in the forthcoming election the polling for which had just begun  im busy now said bruce im not sure that i shall be able to do much sparring with you for a bit  my dear chap dont let me  oh its all right really taking you to the blue boar doesnt land me out of my way at all most of the work lies round in this direction i call at cottages and lug oldest inhabitants to the poll its rare sport  does your pater know  oh yes he rots me about it like anything but all the same i believe hes really rather bucked because ive roped in quite a dozen voters who wouldnt have stirred a yard if i hadnt turned up thats where were scoring pedder hasnt got a car yet and these old rotters round here arent going to move out of their chairs to go for a ride in an ordinary cart but they chuck away their crutches and hop into a motor like one oclock  it must be rather a rag said sheen  the car drew up at the door of the blue boar sheen got out and ran upstairs to the gymnasium joe bevan was sparring a round with francis he watched them while he changed but without the enthusiasm of which he had been conscious on previous occasions the solid cleverness of joe bevan and the quickness and cunning of the bantamweight were as much in evidence as before but somehow the glamour and romance which had surrounded them were gone he no longer watched eagerly to pick up the slightest hint from these experts he felt no more interest than he would have felt in watching a game of lawn tennis he had been keen since his disappointment with regard to the house boxing he had become indifferent  joe bevan noticed this before he had been boxing with him a minute  hullo sir he said whats this tired today not feeling well you arent boxing like yourself not at all you arent theres no weight behind em youre tapping whats the matter with your feet too you arent getting about as quickly as i should like to see what have you been doing to yourself  nothing that i know of said sheen im sorry im so rotten lets have another try  the second try proved as unsatisfactory as the first he was listless and his leads and counters lacked conviction  joe bevan who identified himself with his pupils with that thoroughness which is the hallmark of the firstclass boxing instructor looked so pained at his sudden loss of form that sheen could not resist the temptation to confide in him after all he must tell him some time  the fact is he said as they sat on the balcony overlooking the river waiting for jack bruce to return with his car ive had a bit of a sickener  i thought youd got sick of it said mr bevan well have a bit of a rest  i dont mean that im tired of boxing sheen hastened to explain after all the trouble youve taken with me it would be a bit thick if i chucked it just as i was beginning to get on it isnt that but you know how keen i was on boxing for the house  joe bevan nodded  did you get beat  they wouldnt let me go in said sheen  but bless me youd have made babies of them what was the instructor doing couldnt he see that you were good  i didnt get a chance of showing what i could do he explained the difficulties of the situation  mr bevan nodded his head thoughtfully  so naturally concluded sheen the thing has put me out a bit its beastly having nothing to work for im at a loose end up till now ive always had the thought of the house competition to keep me going but nowwell you see how it is its like running to catch a train and then finding suddenly that youve got plenty of time there doesnt seem any point in going on running  why not aldershot sir said mr bevan  what cried sheen  the absolute novelty of the idea and the gorgeous possibilities of it made him tingle from head to foot aldershot why hadnt he thought of it before the house competition suddenly lost its importance in his eyes it was a trivial affair after all compared with aldershot that mecca of the publicschool boxer  then the glow began to fade doubts crept in he might have learned a good deal from joe bevan but had he learned enough to be able to hold his own with the best boxers of all the public schools in the country and if he had the skill to win had he the heart joe bevan had said that he would not disgrace himself again and he felt that the chances were against his doing so but there was the terrible possibility he had stood up to francis and the others and he had taken their blows without flinching but in these encounters there was always at the back of his mind the comforting feeling that there was a limit to the amount of punishment he would receive if francis happened to drive him into a corner where he could neither attack nor defend himself against attack he did not use his advantage to the full he indicated rather than used it a couple of blows and he moved out into the open again but in the public schools competition at aldershot there would be no quarter there would be nothing but deadly earnest if he allowed himself to be manoeuvred into an awkward position only his own skill or the call of time could extricate him from it  in a word at the blue boar he sparred at aldershot he would have to fight was he capable of fighting  then there was another difficulty how was he to get himself appointed as the wrykyn lightweight representative now that drummond was unable to box stanning would go down as the winner of the school competition these things were worked by an automatic process sheen felt that he could beat stanning but he had no means of publishing this fact to the school he could not challenge him to a trial of skill that sort of thing was not done  he explained this to joe bevan  well its a pity said joe regretfully its a pity  at this moment jack bruce appeared  whats a pity joe he asked  joe wants me to go to aldershot as a lightweight explained sheen and i was just saying that i couldnt because of stanning  what about stanning  he won the school competition you see so theyre bound to send him down  half a minute said jack bruce i never thought of aldershot for you before its a jolly good idea i believe youd have a chance and its all right about stanning hes not going down havent you heard  i dont hear anything why isnt he going down  hes knocked up one of his wrists so he says  how do you meanso he says asked sheen  i believe he funks it  why what makes you think that  oh i dont know its only my opinion still its a little queer stanning says he crocked his left wrist in the final of the house competition  well whats wrong with that why shouldnt he have done so  sheen objected strongly to stanning but he had the elements of justice in him and he was not going to condemn him on insufficient evidence particularly of a crime of which he himself had been guilty  of course he may have done said bruce but its a bit fishy that he should have been playing fives all right two days running just after the competition  he might have crocked himself then  then why didnt he say so  a question which sheen found himself unable to answer  then theres nothing to prevent you fighting sir said joe bevan who had been listening attentively to the conversation  do you really think ive got a chance  i do sir  of course you have said jack bruce youre quite as good as drummond was last time i saw him box  then ill have a shot at it said sheen  good for you sir cried joe bevan  though itll be a bit of a job getting leave said sheen how would you start about it bruce  youd better ask spence hes the man to go to  thats all right im rather a pal of spences  ask him tonight after prep suggested bruce  and then you can come here regular said joe bevan and well train you till youre that fit you could eat bricks and youll make babies of them up at aldershot     xix  paving the way   bruce had been perfectly correct in his suspicions stannings wrist was no more sprained than his ankle the advisability of manufacturing an injury had come home to him very vividly on the saturday morning following the ripton match when he had read the brief report of that painful episode in that weeks number of the field in the school library in the list of the ripton team appeared the name r peteiro he had heard a great deal about the dusky riptonian when drummond had beaten him in the featherweights the year before drummond had returned from aldershot on that occasion cheerful but in an extremely battered condition his appearance as he limped about the field on sports day had been heroic and in addition a fine advertisement for the punishing powers of the ripton champion it is true that at least one of his injuries had been the work of a pauline whom he had met in the opening bout but the great majority were presents from ripton and drummond had described the dusky one in no uncertain terms as a holy terror  these things had sunk into stannings mind it had been generally understood at wrykyn that peteiro had left school at christmas when stanning through his study of the field discovered that the redoubtable boxer had been one of the team against which he had played at ripton and realised that owing to drummonds illness it would fall to him if he won the house competition to meet this man of wrath at aldershot he resolved on the instant that the most persuasive of wild horses should not draw him to that military centre on the day of the public schools competition the difficulty was that he particularly wished to win the house cup then it occurred to him that he could combine the two thingswin the competition and get injured while doing so  accordingly two days after the house boxing he was observed to issue from applebys with his left arm slung in a first fifteen scarf he was too astute to injure his right wrist what happens to ones left wrist at school is ones own private business when one injures ones right arm and so incapacitates oneself for form work the authorities begin to make awkward investigations  mr spence who looked after the schools efforts to win medals at aldershot was the most disappointed person in the place he was an enthusiastic boxerhe had represented cambridge in the middleweights in his dayand with no small trouble had succeeded in making boxing a going concern at wrykyn years of failure had ended the easter before in a huge triumph when ohara of dexters and drummond had won silver medals and moriarty of dexters a bronze if only somebody could win a medal this year the tradition would be established and would not soon die out unfortunately there was not a great deal of boxing talent in the school just now the rule that the winner at his weight in the house competitions should represent the school at aldershot only applied if the winner were fairly proficient mr spence exercised his discretion it was no use sending down novices to be massacred this year drummond and stanning were the only wrykinians up to aldershot form drummond would have been almost a certainty for a silver medal and stanning would probably have been a runnerup and here they were both injured wrykyn would not have a single representative at the queens avenue gymnasium it would be a setback to the cult of boxing at the school  mr spence was pondering over this unfortunate state of things when sheen was shown in  can i speak to you for a minute sir said sheen  certainly sheen take one of those cigi mean sit down what is it  sheen had decided how to open the interview before knocking at the door he came to the point at once  do you think i could go down to aldershot sir he asked  mr spence looked surprised  go down you mean do you want to watch the competition really i dont know if the headmaster  i mean can i box  mr spences look of surprise became more marked  box he said but surelyi didnt know you were a boxer sheen  ive only taken it up lately  but you didnt enter for the house competitions did you what weight are you  just under ten stone  a lightweight why linton boxed for your house in the lightweights surely  yes sir they wouldnt let me go in  you hurt yourself  no sir  then why wouldnt they let you go in  drummond thought linton was better he didnt know i boxed  butthis is very curious i dont understand it at all you see if you were not up to house form you would hardlyat aldershot you see you would meet the best boxers of all the public schools  yes sir  there was a pause  it was like this sir said sheen nervously at the beginning of the term there was a bit of a row down in the town and i got mixed up in it and i didnti was afraid to join in i funked it  mr spence nodded he was deeply interested now the office of confessor is always interesting  go on sheen what happened then  i was cut by everybody the fellows thought i had let the house down and it got about and the other houses scored off them so i had rather a rotten time  here it occurred to him that he was telling his story without that attention to polite phraseology which a master expects from a boy so he amended the last sentence  i didnt have a very pleasant time sir was his correction  well said mr spence  so i was a bit sick continued sheen relapsing once more into the vernacular and i wanted to do something to put things right again and i metanyhow i took up boxing i wanted to box for the house if i was good enough i practised every day and stuck to it and after a bit i did become pretty good  well  then drummond got mumps and i wrote to him asking if i might represent the house instead of him and i suppose he didnt believe i was any good at any rate he wouldnt let me go in then joea man who knows something about boxingsuggested i should go down to aldershot  joe said mr spence inquiringly  sheen had let the name slip out unintentionally but it was too late now to recall it  joe bevan sir he said he used to be champion of england lightweight  joe bevan cried mr spence really why he trained me when i boxed for cambridge hes one of the best of fellows ive never seen any one who took such trouble with his man i wish we could get him here so it was joe who suggested that you should go down to aldershot well he ought to know did he say you would have a good chance  yes sir  my position is this you see sheen there is nothing i should like more than to see the school represented at aldershot but i cannot let anyone go down irrespective of his abilities aldershot is not childs play and in the lightweights you get the hardest fighting of all it wouldnt do for me to let you go down if you are not up to the proper form you would be half killed  i should like to have a shot sir said sheen  then this year as you probably know ripton are sending down peteiro for the lightweights he was the fellow whom drummond only just beat last year and you saw the state in which drummond came back if drummond could hardly hold him what would you do  i believe i could beat drummond sir said sheen  mr spences eyes opened wider here were brave words this youth evidently meant business the thing puzzled him on the one hand sheen had been cut by his house for cowardice on the other joe bevan who of all men was best able to judge had told him that he was good enough to box at aldershot  let me think it over sheen he said this is a matter which i cannot decide in a moment i will tell you tomorrow what i think about it  i hope you will let me go down sir said sheen its my one chance  yes yes i see that i see that said mr spence but all the samewell i will think it over  all the rest of that evening he pondered over the matter deeply perplexed it would be nothing less than cruel to let sheen enter the ring at aldershot if he were incompetent boxing in the public schools boxing competition is not a pastime for the incompetent but he wished very much that wrykyn should be represented and also he sympathised with sheens eagerness to wipe out the stain on his honour and the honour of the house but like drummond he could not help harbouring a suspicion that this was a pose he felt that sheen was intoxicated by his imagination every one likes to picture himself doing dashing things in the limelight with an appreciative multitude to applaud would this mood stand the test of action  against this there was the evidence of joe bevan joe had said that sheen was worthy to fight for his school and joe knew  mr spence went to bed still in a state of doubt  next morning he hit upon a solution of the difficulty wandering in the grounds before school he came upon ohara who as has been stated before had won the lightweights at aldershot in the previous year he had come to wrykyn for the sports here was the man to help him ohara should put on the gloves with sheen and report  im in rather a difficulty ohara he said and you can help me  whats that inquired ohara  you know both our lightweights are on the sick list i had just resigned myself to going down to aldershot without any one to box when a boy in seymours volunteered for the vacant place i dont know if you knew him at school sheen do you remember him  sheen cried ohara in amazement not sheen  his recollections of sheen were not conducive to a picture of him as a publicschool boxer  yes i had never heard of him as a boxer still he seems very anxious to go down and he certainly has one remarkable testimonial and as theres no one else  and what shall i do asked ohara  i want you if you will to give him a trial in the dinnerhour just see if hes any good at all if he isnt of course dont hit him about a great deal but if he shows signs of being a useful man extend him see what he can do  very well sir said ohara  and you might look in at my house at teatime if you have nothing better to do and tell me what you think of him  at five oclock when he entered mr spences study oharas face wore the awestruck look of one who had seen visions  well said mr spence did you find him any good  good said ohara hell beat them all hes a champion theres no stopping him  what an extraordinary thing said mr spence     xx  sheen goes to aldershot   at sheens request mr spence made no announcement of the fact that wrykyn would be represented in the lightweights it would be time enough sheen felt for the school to know that he was a boxer when he had been down and shown what he could do his appearance in his new role would be the most surprising thing that had happened in the place for years and it would be a painful anticlimax if after all the excitement which would be caused by the discovery that he could use his hands he were to be defeated in his first bout whereas if he happened to win the announcement of his victory would be all the more impressive coming unexpectedly to himself he did not admit the possibility of defeat he had braced himself up for the ordeal and he refused to acknowledge to himself that he might not come out of it well besides joe bevan continued to express hopeful opinions  just you keep your head sir he said and youll win lots of these gentlemen theyre champions when theyre practising and youd think nothing wouldnt stop them when they get into the ring but they get wild directly they begin and forget everything theyve been taught and where are they then why on the floor waiting for the referee to count them out  this picture might have encouraged sheen more if he had not reflected that he was just as likely to fall into this error as were his opponents  what you want to remember is to keep that guard up nothing can beat that and push out your left straight the straight left rules the boxing world and be earnest about it be as friendly as you like afterwards but while youre in the ring say to yourself well its you or me and dont be too kind  i wish you could come down to second me joe said sheen  ill have a jolly good try sir said joe bevan let me see youll be going down the night beforei cant come down then but ill try and manage it by an early train on the day  how about francis  oh francis can look after himself for one day hes not the sort of boy to run wild if hes left alone for a few hours  then you think you can manage it  yes sir if im not there for your first fight i shall come in time to second you in the final  if i get there said sheen  good secondings half the battle these soldiers they give you at aldershotwell they dont know the business as the saying is they dont look after their man not like i could i saw young whatshisname of rugbystevens he was beaten in the final by a gentleman from harrowi saw him fight there a couple of years ago after the first round he was leadingnot by much but still he was a point or two ahead well he went to his corner and his seconds sent him up for the next round in the same state hed got there in they hadnt done a thing to him why if id been in his corner id have taken him and sponged him and sent him up again as fresh as he could be you must have a good second if youre to win when youre all on top of your man i dont say but you get a young gentleman of your own class just about as quick and strong as you are and then youll know where the seconding comes in  then for goodness sake dont make any mistake about coming down said sheen  ill be there sir said joe bevan                                       the queens avenue gymnasium at aldershot is a roomy place but it is always crowded on the public schools day sisters and cousins and aunts of competitors flock there to see tommy or bobby perform under the impression it is to be supposed that he is about to take part in a pleasant frolic a sort of merry parlour game what their opinion is after he emerges from a warm three rounds is not known then there are soldiers in scores their views on boxing as a sport are crisp and easily defined what they want is gore others of the spectators are old boys come to see how the school can behave in an emergency and to find out whether there are still experts like jones who won the middles in 96 or robinson who was runnerup in the feathers in the same year or whether as they have darkly suspected for some time the school has gone to the dogs since they left  the usual crowd was gathered in the seats round the ring when sheen came out of the dressingroom and sat down in an obscure corner at the end of the barrier which divides the gymnasium into two parts on these occasions he felt very lonely mr spence and the school instructor were watching the gymnastics which had just started upon their lengthy course the wrykyn pair were not expected to figure high on the list this year he could have joined mr spence but at the moment he felt disinclined for conversation if he had been a more enthusiastic cricketer he would have recognised the feeling as that which attacks a batsman before he goes to the wicket it is not precisely funk it is rather a desire to accelerate the flight of time and get to business quickly all things come to him who waits and among them is that unpleasant sensation of a cold hand upon the portion of the body which lies behind the third waistcoat button  the boxing had begun with a bout between two featherweights both obviously suffering from stagefright they were fighting in a scrambling and unscientific manner which bore out mr bevans statements on the subject of losing ones head sheen felt that both were capable of better things in the second and third rounds this proved to be the case and the contest came to an end amidst applause  the next pair were lightweights and sheen settled himself to watch more attentively from these he would gather some indication of what he might expect to find when he entered the ring he would not have to fight for some time yet in the drawing for numbers which had taken place in the dressingroom he had picked a three there would be another lightweight battle before he was called upon his opponent was a tonbridgian who from the glimpse sheen caught of him seemed muscular but he sheen had the advantage in reach and built on that  after opening tamely the lightweight bout had become vigorous in the second round and both men had apparently forgotten that their right arms had been given them by nature for the purpose of guarding they were going at it in hurricane fashion all over the ring sheen was horrified to feel symptoms of a return of that old sensation of panic which had caused him on that dark day early in the term to flee albert and his wicked works he set his teeth and fought it down and after a bad minute he was able to argue himself into a proper frame of mind again after all that sort of thing looked much worse than it really was half those blows which seemed as if they must do tremendous damage were probably hardly felt by their recipient he told himself that francis and even the knifeandboot boy hit fully as hard or harder and he had never minded them at the end of the contest he was once more looking forward to his entrance to the ring with proper fortitude  the fighting was going briskly forward now sometimes good sometimes moderate but always earnest and he found himself contemplating without undue excitement the fact that at the end of the bout which had just begun between middleweights from st pauls and wellington it would be his turn to perform as luck would have it he had not so long to wait as he had expected for the pauline taking the lead after the first few exchanges outfought his man so completely that the referee stopped the contest in the second round sheen got up from his corner and went to the dressingroom the tonbridgian was already there he took off his coat somebody crammed his hands into the gloves and from that moment the last trace of nervousness left him he trembled with the excitement of the thing and hoped sincerely that no one would notice it and think that he was afraid  then amidst a clapping of hands which sounded faint and faroff he followed his opponent to the ring and ducked under the ropes  the referee consulted a paper which he held and announced the names  r d sheen wrykyn college  sheen wriggled his fingers right into the gloves and thought of joe bevan what had joe said keep that guard up the straight left keep that guardthe straight left keep that  a w bird tonbridge school  there was a fresh outburst of applause the tonbridgian had shown up well in the competition of the previous year and the crowd welcomed him as an old friend  keep that guard upstraight left straight leftguard up  seconds out of the ring  guard up not too high straight left it beats the world what an age that man was calling time guard up straight  time said the referee  sheen filled with a great calm walked out of his corner and shook hands with his opponent     xxi  a good start   it was all over in half a minute  the tonbridgian was a twohanded fighter of the rushing type almost immediately after he had shaken hands sheen found himself against the ropes blinking from a heavy hit between the eyes through the mist he saw his opponent sparring up to him and as he hit he sidestepped the next moment he was out in the middle again with his man pressing him hard there was a quick rally and then sheen swung his right at a venture the blow had no conscious aim it was purely speculative but it succeeded the tonbridgian fell with a thud  sheen drew back the thing seemed pathetic he had braced himself up for a long fight and it had ended in half a minute his sensations were mixed the fighting half of him was praying that his man would get up and start again the prudent half realised that it was best that he should stay down he had other fights before him before he could call that silver medal his own and this would give him an invaluable start in the race his rivals had all had to battle hard in their opening bouts  the tonbridgians rigidity had given place to spasmodic efforts to rise he got on one knee and his gloved hand roamed feebly about in search of a hold it was plain that he had shot his bolt the referee signed to his seconds who ducked into the ring and carried him to his corner sheen walked back to his own corner and sat down presently the referee called out his name as the winner and he went across the ring and shook hands with his opponent who was now himself again  he overheard snatches of conversation as he made his way through the crowd to the dressingroom  useful boxer that wrykyn boy  shortest fight ive seen here since hopley won the heavyweights  fluke do you think  dont know came to the same thing in the end anyhow caught him fair  hard luck on that tonbridge man hes a good boxer really did well here last year  then an outburst of handclaps drowned the speakers voices a swarthy youth with the ripton pink and green on his vest had pushed past him and was entering the ring as he entered the dressingroom he heard the referee announcing the names so that was the famous peteiro sheen admitted to himself that he looked tough and hurried into his coat and out of the dressingroom again so as to be in time to see how the ripton terror shaped  it was plainly not a onesided encounter peteiros opponent hailed from st pauls a school that has a habit of turning out boxers at the end of the first round it seemed that honours were even the great peteiro had taken as much as he had given and once had been uncompromisingly floored by the paulines left but in the second round he began to gain points for a boy of his weight he had a terrific hit with the right and three applications of this to the ribs early in the round took much of the sting out of the paulines blows he fought on with undiminished pluck but the riptonian was too strong for him and the third round was a rout to quote the sportsman of the following day peteiro crowded in a lot of work with both hands and scored a popular victory  sheen looked thoughtful at the conclusion of the fight there was no doubt that drummonds antagonist of the previous year was formidable yet sheen believed himself to be the cleverer of the two at any rate peteiro had given no signs of possessing much cunning to all appearances he was a tough goahead fighter with a right which would drill a hole in a steel plate had he sufficient skill to baffle his sheens strong tactics if only joe bevan would come with joe in his corner to direct him he would feel safe  but of joe up to the present there were no signs  mr spence came and sat down beside him  well sheen he said so you won your first fight keep it up  ill try sir said sheen  what do you think of peteiro  i was just wondering sir he hits very hard  very hard indeed  but he doesnt look as if he was very clever  not a bit just a plain slogger thats all thats why drummond beat him last year in the featherweights in strength there was no comparison but drummond was just too clever for him you will be the same sheen  i hope so sir said sheen                                       after lunch the second act of the performance began sheen had to meet a boxer from harrow who had drawn a bye in the first round of the competition this proved a harder fight than his first encounter but by virtue of a stout heart and a straight left he came through it successfully and there was no doubt as to what the decision would be both judges voted for him  peteiro demolished a radleian in his next fight  by the middle of the afternoon there were three lightweights in the runningsheen peteiro and a boy from clifton sheen drew the bye and sparred in an outer room with a soldier who was inclined to take the thing easily sheen with the thought of the final in his mind was only too ready to oblige him they sparred an innocuous three rounds and the man of war was kind enough to whisper in his ear as they left the room that he hoped he would win the final and that he himself had a matter of oneandsixpence with old spud smith on his success  for im a man said the amiable warrior confidentially as knows class when he sees it youre class sir thats what you are  this taken in conjunction with the fact that if the worst came to the worst he had at any rate won a medal by having got into the final cheered sheen if only joe bevan had appeared he would have been perfectly contented  but there were no signs of joe     xxii  a good finish   final lightweights shouted the referee  a murmur of interest from the ringside chairs  r d sheen wrykyn college  sheen got his full measure of applause this time his victories in the preliminary bouts had won him favour with the spectators  j peteiro ripton school  go it ripton cried a voice from near the door the referee frowned in the direction of this audacious partisan and expressed a hope that the audience would kindly refrain from comment during the rounds  then he turned to the ring again and announced the names a second time  sheenpeteiro  the ripton man was sitting with a hand on each knee listening to the advice of his school instructor who had thrust head and shoulders through the ropes and was busy impressing some point upon him sheen found himself noticing the most trivial things with extraordinary clearness in the front row of the spectators sat a man with a particoloured tie he wondered idly what tie it was it was rather like one worn by members of templars house at wrykyn why were the ropes of the ring red he rather liked the colour there was a man lighting a pipe would he blow out the match or extinguish it with a wave of the hand what a beast peteiro looked he really was a nigger he must look out for that right of his the straight left push it out straight left ruled the boxing world where was joe he must have missed the train or perhaps he hadnt been able to get away why did he want to yawn he wondered  time  the ripton man became suddenly active he almost ran across the ring a brief handshake and he had penned sheen up in his corner before he had time to leave it it was evident what advice his instructor had been giving him he meant to force the pace from the start  the suddenness of it threw sheen momentarily off his balance he seemed to be in a whirl of blows a sharp shock from behind he had run up against the post despite everything he remembered to keep his guard up and stopped a lashing hit from his antagonists left but he was too late to keep out his right in it came full on the weakest spot on his left side the pain of it caused him to double up for an instant and as he did so his opponent uppercut him there was no rest for him nothing that he had ever experienced with the gloves on approached this if only he could get out of this corner  then almost unconsciously he recalled joe bevans advice  if a mans got you in a corner joe had said fall on him  peteiro made another savage swing sheen dodged it and hurled himself forward  break away said a dispassionate official voice  sheen broke away but now he was out of the corner with the whole good open ring to manoeuvre in  he could just see the ripton instructor signalling violently to his opponent and in reply to the signals peteiro came on again with another fierce rush  but sheen in the open was a different person from sheen cooped up in a corner francis hunt had taught him to use his feet he sidestepped and turning quickly found his man staggering past him overbalanced by the force of his wasted blow and now it was sheen who attacked and peteiro who tried to escape two swift hits he got in before his opponent could face round and another as he turned and rushed then for a while the battle raged without science all over the ring gradually with a cold feeling of dismay sheen realised that his strength was going the pace was too hot he could not keep it up his left counters were losing their force now he was merely pushing his glove into the ripton mans face it was not enough the other was getting to close quarters and that right of his seemed stronger than ever  he was against the ropes now gasping for breath and peteiros right was thudding against his ribs it could not last he gathered all his strength and put it into a straight left it took the ripton man in the throat and drove him back a step he came on again again sheen stopped him  it was his last effort he could do no more everything seemed black to him he leaned against the ropes and drank in the air in great gulps  time said the referee  the word was lost in the shouts that rose from the packed seats  sheen tottered to his corner and sat down  keep it up sir keep it up said a voice beart that the opposed may beware of thee dont forget the guard and the straight left beats the world  it was joeat the eleventh hour  with a delicious feeling of content sheen leaned back in his chair it would be all right now he felt that the matter had been taken out of his hands a more experienced brain than his would look after the generalship of the fight  as the moments of the halfminutes rest slid away he discovered the truth of joes remarks on the value of a good second in his other fights the napping of the towel had hardly stirred the hair on his forehead joes energetic arms set a perfect gale blowing the cool air revived him he opened his mouth and drank it in a spongeful of cold water completed the cure long before the call of time he was ready for the next round  keep away from him sir said joe and score with that left of yours dont try the right yet keep it for guarding box clever dont let him corner you slip him when he rushes cool and steady does it dont aim at his face too much go down below thats the department and use your feet get about quick and youll find he dont like that hullo says he i cant touch him then when hes tired go in  the pupil nodded with closed eyes  while these words of wisdom were proceeding from the mouth of mr bevan another conversation was taking place which would have interested sheen if he could have heard it mr spence and the school instructor were watching the final from the seats under the side windows  its extraordinary said mr spence the boys wonderfully good for the short time he has been learning you ought to be proud of your pupil  sir  i was saying that sheen does you credit  not me sir  what he told me he had been taking lessons didnt you teach him  never set eyes on him till this moment wish i had sir hes the sort of pupil i could wish for  mr spence bent forward and scanned the features of the man who was attending the wrykinian  why he said surely thats bevanjoe bevan i knew him at cambridge  yes sir thats bevan replied the instructor he teaches boxing at wrykyn now sir  at wrykynwhere  up the riverat the blue boar sir said the instructor quite innocentlyfor it did not occur to him that this simple little bit of information was just so much incriminating evidence against sheen  mr spence said nothing but he opened his eyes very wide recalling his recent conversation with sheen he remembered that the boy had told him he had been taking lessons and also that joe bevan the expugilist had expressed a high opinion of his work mr spence had imagined that bevan had been a chance spectator of the boys skill but it would now seem that bevan himself had taught sheen this matter decided mr spence must be looked into for it was palpable that sheen had broken bounds in order to attend bevans boxingsaloon up the river  for the present however mr spence was content to say nothing                                       sheen came up for the second round fresh and confident his head was clear and his breath no longer came in gasps there was to be no rallying this time he had had the worst of the first round and meant to make up his lost points  peteiro losing no time dashed in sheen met him with a left in the face and gave way a foot again peteiro rushed and again he was stopped as he bored in for the third time sheen slipped him the ripton man paused and dropped his guard for a moment  sheens left shot out once more and found its mark peteiro swung his right viciously but without effect another swift counter added one more point to sheens score  sheen nearly chuckled it was all so beautifully simple what a fool he had been to mix it up in the first round if he only kept his head and stuck to outfighting he could win with ease the man couldnt box he was nothing more than a slogger here he came as usual with the old familiar rush out went his left but it missed its billet peteiro had checked his rush after the first movement and now he came in with both hands it was the first time during the round that he had got to close quarters and he made the most of it sheens blows were as frequent but his were harder he drove at the body right and left and once again the call of time extricated sheen from an awkward position as far as points were concerned he had had the best of the round but he was very sore and bruised his left side was one dull ache  keep away from him sir said joe bevan you were ahead on that round keep away all the time unless he gets tired but if you see me signalling then go in all you can and have a fight  there was a suspicion of weariness about the look of the ripton champion as he shook hands for the last round he was beginning to feel the effects of his hurricane fighting in the opening rounds he began quietly sparring for an opening sheen led with his left peteiro was too late with his guard sheen tried againa double lead his opponent guarded the first blow but the second went home heavily on the body and he gave way a step  then from the corner of his eye sheen saw bevan gesticulating wildly so taking his life in his hands he abandoned his waiting game dropped his guard and dashed in to fight peteiro met him doggedly for a few moments the exchanges were even then suddenly the riptonians blows began to weaken he got home his right on the head and sheen hardly felt it and in a flash there came to him the glorious certainty that the game was his  he was winningwinningwinning                                       thats enough said the referee  the ripton man was leaning against the ropes utterly spent at almost the same spot where sheen had leaned at the end of the first round the last attack had finished him his seconds helped him to his corner  the referee waved his hand  sheen wins he said  and that was the greatest moment of his life     xxiii  a surprise for seymours   seymours house took in one copy of the sportsman daily on the morning after the aldershot competition linton met the paperboy at the door on his return from the fives courts where he had been playing a couple of beforebreakfast games with dunstable he relieved him of the house copy and opened it to see how the wrykyn pair had performed in the gymnastics he did not expect anything great having a rooted contempt for both experts who were small and except in the gymnasium obscure indeed he had gone so far on the previous day as to express a hope that biddle the more despicable of the two would fall off the horizontal bar and break his neck still he might as well see where they had come out after all with all their faults they were human beings like himself and wrykinians  the competition was reported in the boxing column the first thing that caught his eye was the name of the school among the headlines honours said the headline for st pauls harrow and wrykyn  hullo said linton whats all this  then the thing came on him with nothing to soften the shock he had folded the paper and the last words on the half uppermost were final sheen beat peteiro  linton had often read novels in which some important document swam before the eyes of the hero or the heroine but he had never understood the full meaning of the phrase until he read those words sheen beat peteiro  there was no mistake about it there the thing was it was impossible for the sportsman to have been hoaxed no the incredible outrageous fact must be faced sheen had been down to aldershot and won a silver medal sheen sheen sheen who hadwho waswell who in a word was sheen  linton read on like one in a dream  the lightweights fell said the writer to a newcomer sheen of wrykyn sheen a clever youngster with a strong defence and a beautiful straight left doubtless the result of tuition from the middleweight exchampion joe bevan who was in his corner for the final bout none of his opponents gave him much trouble except peteiro of ripton whom he met in the final a very game and determined fight was seen when these two met but sheens skill and condition discounted the rushing tactics of his adversary and in the last minute of the third round the referee stopped the encounter game and determined sheen sympathy was freely expressed for peteiro who has thus been runnerup two years in succession he however met a better man and paid the penalty the admirable pluck with which sheen bore his punishment and gradually wore his man down made his victory the most popular of the days programme  well  details of the fighting described sheen as cutting out the work popping in several nice lefts swinging his right for the point and executing numerous other incredible manoeuvres  sheen  you caught the name correctly sheen ill trouble you  linton stared blankly across the school grounds then he burst into a sudden yell of laughter  on that very morning the senior dayroom was going to courtmartial sheen for disgracing the house the resolution had been passed on the previous afternoon probably just as he was putting the finishing touches to the most popular victory of the days programme this said linton is rich  he grubbed a little hole in one of mr seymours flowerbeds and laid the sportsman to rest in it the news would be about the school at nine oclock but if he could keep it from the senior dayroom till the brief interval between breakfast and school all would be well and he would have the pure pleasure of seeing that backbone of the house make a complete ass of itself a thought struck him he unearthed the sportsman and put it in his pocket  he strolled into the senior dayroom after breakfast  any one seen the sporter this morning he inquired  no one had seen it  the thing hasnt come said some one  good said linton to himself  at this point stanning strolled into the room im a witness he said in answer to lintons look of inquiry were doing this thing in style i depose that i saw the prisoner cutting off on thewhatever day it was when he ought to have been saving our lives from the fury of the mob hadnt somebody better bring the prisoner into the dock  ill go said linton promptly i may be a little time but dont get worried ill bring him all right  he went upstairs to sheens study feeling like an impresario about to produce a new play which is sure to create a sensation  sheen was in there was a ridge of purple under his left eye but he was otherwise intact  gratulate you sheen said linton  for an instant sheen hesitated he had rehearsed this kind of scene in his mind and sometimes he saw himself playing a genial forgiving letssaynomoreaboutitweallmakemistakesbutinfuture role sometimes being cold haughty and distant and repelling friendly advances with icy disdain if anybody but linton had been the first to congratulate him he might have decided on this second line of action but he liked linton and wanted to be friendly with him  thanks he said  linton sat down on the table and burst into a torrent of speech  you are a man what did you want to do it for where the dickens did you learn to box and why on earth if you can win silver medals at aldershot didnt you box for the house and smash up that sidey ass stanning i say look here i suppose we havent been making idiots of ourselves all the time have we  i shouldnt wonder said sheen how  i mean you didwhat i mean to say isoh hang it you know you did cut off when we had that row in the town didnt you  yes said sheen i did  with that medal in his pocket it cost him no effort to make the confession  im glad of that i mean im glad we havent been such fools as we might have been you see we only had stannings word to go on  sheen started  stanning he said what do you mean  he was the chap who started the story didnt you know he told everybody  i thought it was drummond said sheen blankly you remember meeting me outside his study the day after i thought he told you then  drummond not a bit of it he swore you hadnt been with him at all he was as sick as anything when i said i thought id seen you with him  i sheen stopped i wish id known he concluded then after a pause so it was stanning  yesconceited beast oh i say  um  i see it all now joe bevan taught you to box  yes  then thats how you came to be at the blue boar that day hes the bevan who runs it  thats his brother hes got a gymnasium up at the top i used to go there every day  but i say great scott what are you going to do about that  how do you mean  why spence is sure to ask you who taught you to box he must know you didnt learn with the instructor then itll all come out and youll get dropped on for going up the river and going to the pub  perhaps he wont ask said sheen  hope not oh by the way  whats up  just remembered what i came up for its an awful rag the senior dayroom are going to courtmartial you  courtmartial me  for funking they dont know about aldershot not a word i bagged the sportsman early and hid it they are going to get the surprise of their lifetime i said id come up and fetch you  i shant go said sheen  linton looked alarmed  oh but i say you must dont spoil the thing cant you see what a rag itll be  im not going to sweat downstairs for the benefit of the senior dayroom  i say said linton stannings there  what  hes a witness said linton grinning  sheen got up  come on he said  linton came on                                       down in the senior dayroom the court was patiently awaiting the prisoner eager anticipation was stamped on its expressive features  beastly time he is said clayton clayton was acting as president  we shall have to buck up said stanning hullo here he is at last come in linton  i was going to said linton but thanks all the same come along sheen  shut that door linton said stanning from his seat on the table  all right stanning said linton anything to oblige shall i bring up a chair for you to rest your feet on  forge ahead clayton said stanning to the president  the president opened the courtmartial in unofficial phraseology  look here sheen he said weve come to the conclusion that this has got a bit too thick  you mustnt talk in that chatty way clayton interrupted linton prisoner at the bars the right expression to use why dont you let somebody else have a look in youre the rottenest president of a courtmartial i ever saw  dont rag linton said clayton with an austere frown this is serious  glad you told me said linton go on  cant you sit down linton said stanning  i was only waiting for leave thanks you were saying something clayton it sounded pretty average rot but youd better unburden your soul  the president resumed  we want to know if youve anything to say  you dont give him a chance said linton you bag the conversation so  about disgracing the house  by getting the gotford you know sheen explained linton clayton thinks that works a bad habit and ought to be discouraged  clayton glared and looked at stanning he was not equal to the task of tackling linton himself  stanning interposed  dont rot linton we havent much time as it is  sorry said linton  youve let the house down awfully said clayton  yes said sheen  linton took the paper out of his pocket and smoothed it out  seen the sporter he asked casually his neighbour grabbed at it  i thought it hadnt come he said  good account of aldershot said linton  he leaned back in his chair as two or three of the senior dayroom collected round the sportsman  hullo we won the gym  rot lets have a look  this tremendous announcement quite eclipsed the courtmartial as an object of popular interest the senior dayroom surged round the holder of the paper  give us a chance he protested  we cant have where is it biddle and smith are simply hopeless how the dickens can they have got the shield  what a goat you are said a voice reproachfully to the possessor of the paper look at this it says cheltenham got it and here we areseventeenth fat lot of shield weve won  then what the deuce does this mean honours for st pauls harrow and wrykyn  perhaps it refers to the boxing suggested linton  but we didnt send any one up look here harrow won the heavies st pauls got the middles hullo  great scott said the senior dayroom  there was a blank silence linton whistled softly to himself  the gaze of the senior dayroom was concentrated on that ridge of purple beneath sheens left eye  clayton was the first to speak for some time he had been waiting for sufficient silence to enable him to proceed with his presidential duties he addressed himself to sheen  look here sheen he said we want to know what youve got to say for yourself you go disgracing the house  the stunned senior dayroom were roused to speech  oh chuck it clayton  dont be a fool clayton  silly idiot  clayton looked round in pained surprise at this sudden withdrawal of popular support  youd better be polite to sheen said linton he won the lightweights at aldershot yesterday  the silence once more became strained  well said sheen werent you going to courtmartial me or something clayton werent you saying something  clayton started he had not yet grasped the situation entirely but he realised dimly that by some miracle sheen had turned in an instant into a most formidable person  erno he said no nothing  the thing seems to have fallen through sheen said linton great pity started so well too clayton always makes a mess of things  then id just like to say one thing said sheen  respectful attention from the senior dayroom  i only want to know why you cant manage things of this sort by yourselves without dragging in men from other houses  especially men like stanning said linton the same thing occurred to me its lucky drummond wasnt here remember the last time you chaps  the chaps did stanning became an object of critical interest after all who was stanning what right had he to come and sit on tables in seymours and interfere with the affairs of the house  the allusion to last time was lost upon sheen but he saw that it had not improved stannings position with the spectators  he opened the door  good bye stanning he said  if i hadnt hurt my wrist stanning began  hurt your wrist said sheen you got a bad attack of peteiro that was what was the matter with you  you think that every ones a funk like yourself said stanning  pity they arent said linton we should do rather well down at aldershot and he wasnt such a terror after all sheen was he you beat him in two and a half rounds didnt you think what stanning might have done if only he hadnt sprained his poor wrist just in time  look here linton  some are born with sprained wrists continued the speaker some achieve sprained wristslike stanning  stanning took a step towards him  dont forget youve a sprained wrist said linton  come on stanning said sheen who was still holding the door open youll be much more comfortable in your own house ill show you out  i suppose said stanning in the passage you think youve scored off me  that said sheen pleasantly is rather the idea good bye     xxiv  bruce explains   mr spence was a master with a great deal of sympathy and a highly developed sense of duty it was the combination of these two qualities which made it so difficult for him to determine on a suitable course of action in relation to sheens outofbounds exploits as a private individual he had nothing but admiration for the sporting way in which sheen had fought his uphill fight he felt that he himself in similar circumstances would have broken any number of school rules but as a master it was his duty he considered to report him if a master ignored a breach of rules in one case with which he happened to sympathise he would in common fairness be compelled to overlook a similar breach of rules in other cases even if he did not sympathise with them in which event he would be of small use as a master  on the other hand sheens case was so exceptional that he might very well compromise to a certain extent between the claims of sympathy and those of duty if he were to go to the headmaster and state baldly that sheen had been in the habit for the last halfterm of visiting an upriver publichouse the headmaster would get an entirely wrong idea of the matter and suspect all sorts of things which had no existence in fact when a boy is accused of frequenting a publichouse the headmagisterial mind leaps naturally to stale fumes and the drunken stagger  so mr spence decided on a compromise he sent for sheen and having congratulated him warmly on his victory in the lightweights proceeded as follows  you have given me to understand sheen that you were taught boxing by bevan  yes sir  at the blue boar  yes sir  this puts me in a rather difficult position sheen much as i dislike doing it i am afraid i shall have to report this matter to the headmaster  sheen said he supposed so he saw mr spences point  but i shall not mention the blue boar if i did the headmaster might get quite the wrong impression he would not understand all the circumstances so i shall simply mention that you broke bounds by going up the river i shall tell him the whole story you understand and its quite possible that you will hear no more of the affair im sure i hope so but you understand my position  yes sir  thats all then sheen oh by the way you wouldnt care for a game of fives before breakfast tomorrow i suppose  i should like it sir  not too stiff  no sir  very well then ill be there by a quarterpast seven                                       jack bruce was waiting to see the headmaster in his study at the end of afternoon school  well bruce said the headmaster coming into the room and laying down some books on the table do you want to speak to me will you give your father my congratulations on his victory i shall be writing to him tonight i see from the paper that the polling was very even apparently one or two voters arrived at the last moment and turned the scale  yes sir  it is a most gratifying result i am sure that apart from our political views we should all have been disappointed if your father had not won please congratulate him sincerely  yes sir  well bruce and what was it that you wished to see me about  bruce was about to reply when the door opened and mr spence came in  one moment bruce said the headmaster yes spence  mr spence made his report clearly and concisely bruce listened with interest he thought it hardly playing the game for the gymnasium master to hand sheen over to be executed at the very moment when the school was shaking hands with itself over the one decent thing that had been done for it in the course of the athletic year but he told himself philosophically that he supposed masters had to do these things then he noticed with some surprise that mr spence was putting the matter in a very favourable light for the accused he was avoiding with some care any mention of the blue boar when he had occasion to refer to the scene of sheens training he mentioned it vaguely as a house  this man bevan who is an excellent fellow and a personal friend of my own has a house some way up the river  of course a publichouse is a house  up the river said the headmaster meditatively  it seemed that that was all that was wrong the prosecution centred round that point and no other jack bruce as he listened saw his way of coping with the situation  thank you spence said the headmaster at the conclusion of the narrative i quite understand that sheens conduct was very excusable buti distinctly saidi placed the upper river out of bounds well i will see sheen and speak to him i will speak to him  mr spence left the room  please sir said jack bruce  ah bruce i am afraid i have kept you some little time yes  i couldnt help hearing what mr spence was saying to you about sheen sir i dont think he knows quite what really happened  you mean  sheen went there by road i used to take him in my motor  your what did you say bruce  my motorcar sir thats to say my fathers we used to go together every day  i am glad to hear it i am glad then i need say nothing to sheen after all i am glad buterbruce proceeded the headmaster after a pause  yes sir  do youare you in the habit of driving a motorcar frequently  every day sir you see i am going to take up motors when i leave school so its all education  the headmaster was silent to him the word education meant classics there was a modern side at wrykyn and an engineering side and also a science side but in his heart he recognised but one educationthe classics nothing that he had heard nothing that he had read in the papers and the monthly reviews had brought home to him the spirit of the age and the fact that things were not as they used to be so clearly as this one remark of jack bruces for here was bruce admitting that in his spare time he drove motors and stranger still that he did it not as a wild frolic but seriously with a view to his future career  the old order changeth thought the headmaster a little sadly  then he brought himself back from his mental plunge into the future  well well bruce he said we need not discuss the merits and demerits of driving motorcars need we what did you wish to see me about  i came to ask if i might get off morning school tomorrow sir those voters who got to the poll just in time and settled the electioni brought them down in the car and the policemanhes a radical and voted for peddermr pedderhas swornsays i was exceeding the speedlimit  the headmaster pressed a hand to his forehead and his mind swam into the future  well bruce he said at length in the voice of one whom nothing can surprise now  he says i was going twentyeight miles an hour and if i can get to the court tomorrow morning i can prove that i wasnt i brought them to the poll in the little runabout  and theerlittle runabout said the headmaster does not travel at twentyeight miles an hour  no sir it cant go more than twenty at the outside  very well bruce you need not come to school tomorrow morning  thank you sir  the headmaster stood thinking the new order  bruce he said  yes sir  tell me do i look very old  bruce stared  do i look three hundred years old  no sir said bruce with the stolid wariness of the boy who fears that a master is subtly chaffing him  i feel more bruce said the headmaster with a smile i feel more you will remember to congratulate your father for me wont you                                       outside the door jack bruce paused in deep reflection rum he said to himself jolly rum                                       on the senior gravel he met sheen  hullo sheen he said what are you going to do  drummond wants me to tea with him in the infirmary  its all right then  yes i got a note from him during afternoon school you coming  all right i say sheen the old mans rather rum sometimes isnt he  whats he been doing now  ohnothing how do you feel after aldershot tell us all about it ive not heard a word yet
