15074173	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle     book xxfriedrich is not to be overwhelmed the sevenyears war gradually ends25th april 176015th february 1763     chapter ififth campaign opens  there were yet to the worlds surprise and regret three campaigns of this war but the campaign 1760 which we are now upon was what produced or rendered possible the other twowas the crisis of them and is now the only one that can require much narrative from us here illluck which friedrich complains had followed him like his shadow in a strange and fateful manner from the day of kunersdorf and earlier does not yet cease its sad company but on the contrary for long months to come is more constant than ever baffling every effort of his own and from the distance sending him news of mere disaster and discomfiture it is in this campaign though not till far on in it that the long lane does prove to have a turning and the fortune of war recovers its old impartial form after which things visibly languish and the hope of ruining such a friedrich becomes problematic the effort to do it slackens also the very will abating on the austrian part year by year as of course the strength of their resources is still more steadily doing to the last friedrich the weaker in material resources needs all his talentall his luck too but as the strength on both sides is fast abatinghard to say on which side faster friedrichs talent being always a fixed quantity while all else is fluctuating and vanishingwhat remains of the once terrible affair through campaigns sixth and seventh is like a race between spent horses little to be said of it in comparison campaign 1760 is the last of any outward eminence or greatness of event let us diligently follow that and be compendious with the remainder  friedrich was always famed for his marches but this year they exceeded all calculation and example and are still the admiration of military men can there by no method be some distant notion afforded of them to the general reader they were the one resource friedrich had left against such overwhelming superiority in numbers and they came out like surprises in a theatreunpleasantly surprising to daun done with such dexterity rapidity and inexhaustible contrivance and ingenuity as overset the schemes of his enemies again and again and made his one army equivalent in effect to their three  evening of april 25th friedrich rose from his freyberg cantonments moved back that is northward a good march then encamped himself between elbe and the hillcountry with freer prospect and more elbowroom for work coming his left is on meissen and the elbe his right at a village called the katzenhauser an uncommonly strong camp of which one often hears afterwards his centre camp is at schlettau which also is strong though not to such a degree this line extends from meissen southward about 10 miles commanding the reichward passes of the metal mountains and is defensive of leipzig torgau and the towns thereabouts tempelhof iv 16 et seq katzenhauser is but a mile or two from krogisthat unfortunate village where finck got his maxen order er weissyou know i cant stand having difficulties raised manage to do it  friedrichs task this year is to defend saxony prince henri having undertaken the russiansprince henri and fouquet the russians and silesia clearly on very uphill terms both of them so that friedrich finds he will have a great many things to assist in besides defending saxony he lies here expectant till the middle of june above seven weeks daun also for the last two weeks having taken the field in a sort in a sortbut comes no nearer merely posting himself astride of the elbe half in dresden half on the opposite or northern bank of the river with lacy thrown out ahead in good force on that vacant side and so waiting the course of other peoples enterprises  well to eastward and rearward of daun where we have seen loudon about to be very busy prince henri and fouquet have spun themselves out into a long chain of posts in length 300 miles or more from landshut along the bober along the queiss and oder through the neumark abutting on stettin and colberg to the baltic sea tempelhof iv 2124 on that side in aid of loudon or otherwise daun can attempt nothing still less on the katzenhauserschlettau side can he dream of an attempt only towards brandenburg and berlinthe country on that side 50 or 60 miles of it to eastward of meissen being vacant of troopsis dauns road open were he enterprising as friedrich hopes he is not for some two weeks friedrichnot ready otherwise it being difficult to cross the river if lacy with his 30000 should think of interferencehad to leave the cunctatory feldmarschall this chance or unlikely possibility at the end of the second week june 14th as we shall mark by and by the chance was withdrawn  daun and his lacy are but one and that by no means the most harassing of the many cares and anxieties which friedrich has upon him in those seven weeks while waiting at schlettau reading the omens never hitherto was the augury of any campaign more indecipherable to him or so continually fluctuating with wild hopes which proved visionary and with huge practical fears of what he knew to be the real likelihood peace coming it is strange how long friedrich clings to that fond hope my edelsheim is in the bastille or packed home in disgrace but will not the english and choiseul make peace it is choiseuls one rational course bankrupt as he is and reduced to spoons and kettles in which case what a beautiful effect might duke ferdinand produce if he marched to eger say to eger with his 50000 germans britannic majesty and pitt so gracious and twitched daun by the skirt whirling daun home to bohemia in a hurry then the turks the danesmight not the danes send us a trifle of fleet to colberg since the english never will and keep our russians at bayat lowest these hopes are consolatory says he once suspecting them all as no doubt he often enough does and give us courage to look calmly for the opening of this campaign the very idea of which has made me shudder to prince henri in schoning ii 246 3d april 1760 ib 263 of the danish outlook c c  meanwhile by the end of may the russians are come across the weichsel again lie in four camps on the hither side start about june 1sthenri waiting for them in sagan country his headquarter and on both hands of that fouquet and he spread out since the middle of may in their long thin chain of posts from landshut to colberg again like a thin wall of 300 miles to friedrich the russian movements are and have been full of enigma going upon colberg going upon glogau upon breslau that is a heavyfooted certainty audibly tramping forward on us amid these fond visions of the air certain too and visible to a duller eye than friedrichs loudon in silesia is meditating mischief the inevitable russians the inevitable loudon and nothing but fouquet and henri on guard there with their long thin chain of posts infinitely too thin to do any execution thinks the king to whom their modes of operating are but little satisfactory as seen at schlettau from the distance condense yourself urges he always on henri go forward on the russians attack sharply this corps that corps while they are still separate and on march henri did condense himself took post between sagan and sprottau post at frankfurtpoor frankfurt is it to have a kunersdorf or zorndorf every year then no the cautious henri never could see his way into these adventures and did not attack any corps of the russians took post at landsberg ultimatelythe russians as usual having posen as placeofarmsand vigilantly watched the russians without coming to strokes at all a spectacle growing gradually intolerable to the king though he tries to veil his feelings  neither was fouquets plan of procedure well seen by friedrich in the distance ever since that of regiment manteuffel which was a bit of disappointment loudon has been quietly industrious on a bigger scale privately he cherishes the hope being a swift vehement enterprising kind of man to oust fouquet and perhaps to have glatz fortress taken before his russians come in the very end of may loudon privately aiming for glatz breaks in upon silesia againa long way to eastward of fouquet and as if regardless of glatz upon which fouquet in dread for schweidnitz and perhaps breslau itself hastened down into the plain country to manoeuvre upon loudon but found no loudon moving that way and in a day or two learned that landshut so weakly guarded had been picked up by a big corps of austrians and in another day or two that loudon june 7th had blocked glatzloudons real intention now clear to fouquet as it was to friedrich from the first whose anger and astonishment at this loss of landshut were great when he heard of it in his camp of schlettau back to landshut orders he 11th june three days before leaving schlettau neither schweidnitz nor breslau are in danger it is glatz the austrians mean as fouquet and all the world now see they do watch glatz retake me landshut instantly  the tone of friedrich which is usually all friendliness to fouquet had on this occasion something in it which offended the punctual and rather peremptory spartan mind fouquet would not have neglected glatz pity he had not been left to his own methods with landshut and it deeply hurt he read this order 16th june and vowing to obey it and nothing but it used these words which were remembered afterwards to his assembled generals meine herren it appears then we must take landshut again loudon as the next thing will come on us there with his mass of force and we must then like prussians hold out as long as possible think of no surrender on open field but if even beaten defend ourselves to the last man in case of a retreat i will be one of the last that leaves the field and should i have the misfortune to survive such a day i give you my word of honor never to draw a prussian sword more stenzel v 239 this speech of fouquets june 16th was two days after friedrich got on march from schlettau june 17th fouquet got to landshut drove out the austrians more easily than he had calculated and set diligently next day to repair his works writing to friedrich your majestys order shall be executed here while a man of us lives fouquet in the old crownprince time used to be called bayard by his royal friend his royal friend now darker of face and scathed by much illweather has just quitted schlettau three days before this recovery of landshut and will not have gone far till he again hear news of fouquet  night of june 14th15th friedrich between zehren and zabel several miles down streamhis bridges now all ready out of lacys cognizancehas suddenly crossed elbe and next afternoon pitches camp at broschwitz which is straight towards lacy again to lacys astonishment who is posted at moritzburg with headquarter in that beautiful countryseat of polish majestyonly 10 miles to eastward should friedrich take that road broschwitz is short way north of meissen and lies on the road either to grossenhayn or to radeburg radeburg only four miles northward of lacy as friedrich shall see fit on the morrow for the meissen north road forks off there in those two directions straight northward is for grossenhayn right hand is for badeburg most interesting to lacy which of these forks what is quite optional friedrich will take lacy is an alert man looks well to himself warns daun and will not be caught if he can help it daun himself is encamped at reichenberg within two miles of him inexpugnably intrenched as usual and the danger surely is not great nevertheless both these generals wise by experience keep their eyes open  the first great feat of marching now follows on friedrichs part with little or no result to friedrich but worth remembering so strenuous so fruitless was itso barred by ill news from without both this and the second stand recorded for us in brief intelligent terms by mitchell who was present in both and who is perfectly exact on every point and intelligible throughoutif you will read him with a map and divine for yourself what the real names are out of the inhuman blotchings made of them not by mitchells blame at all mitchell memoirs and papers ii 160 et seq  tuesday june 17th second day of friedrichs stay at broschwitz mitchell in a very confidential dialogue they had together learned from him under seal of secrecy that it was his purpose to march for radeburg tomorrow morning and attack lacy and his 30000 who lie encamped at moritzburg out yonder for which step his majesty was pleased farther to show mitchell a little what the various inducements were one russian corps is aiming as if for berlin the austrians are about besieging glatzpressing need that fouquet were reinforced in his silesian post of difficulty then here are the reichspeople close by can be in dresden three days hence joined to daun 80000 odd there will then be of enemies in this part i must beat lacy if possible while time still isand ended by saying succeed here and all may yet be saved be beaten here i know the consequences but what can i do the risk must be run and it is now smaller than it will ever again be  mitchell whose account is a fortnight later than the dialogue itself does confess my lord these reasons though unhappily the thing seems to have failed appear to me to be solid and unanswerable much more do they to tempelhof who sees deeper into the bottom of them than mitchell did and finds that the failure is only superficial mitchell memoirs and papers ii 160 despatch june 30th 1760 tempelhof iv 44 the real success thinks tempelhof would be could the king manoeuvre himself into silesia and entice a cunctatory daun away with him thither a cunctatory daun to preside over matters there in his superstitiously cautious way leaving saxony free to the reichsfolkwhom a hulsen left with his small remnant in schlettau might easily take charge of till silesia were settled the plan was bold was new and completely worthy of friedrich votes tempelhof and it required the most consummate delicacy of execution to lure daun on always with the prospect open to him of knocking you on the head and always by your rapidity and ingenuity to take care that he never got it done this is tempelhofs notion and this sure enough was actually friedrichs mode of management in the weeks following though whether already altogether planned in his head or only gradually planning itself as is more likely nobody can say we will look a very little into the execution concerning which there is no dubiety  wednesday 18th june friedrich as predicted to mitchell the night before did start punctually in three columns at 3 am sun just rising and after a hot march got encamped on the southward side of radeburg ready to cross the rodern stream there tomorrow as if intending for the lausitz should that prove needful for alluring lacyand in the mean while very inquisitive where lacy might be one of lacys outposts those saxon light horse was fallen in with was chased home and lacys camp discovered that night at bernsdorf not three miles to southward or right of us daun only another three to south of him let us attack lacy tomorrow morning wind round to get between daun and him tempelhof iv 4749with fit arrangements rapid as light in the kings tent accordingly his generals are assembled to take their orders brief distinct and to be done with brevity and all are on the move for bernsdorf at 4 next morning when behold  thursday 19th at bernsdorf there is no lacy to be found cautions dorn has ordered him inand not for lacys sake as appears but for his own hitherward you alert lacy to cover my right flank here my hill of reichenberglest it be not impregnable enough against that feline enemy and there they have taken post say 60000 against 30000 and are palisading to a quite extraordinary degree no fight possible with lacy or daun  this is what mitchell counts the failure of friedrichs enterprise and certainly it grieved friedrich a good deal who on riding out to reconnoitre reichenberg quintus icilius and battalion quintus part of his escort if that be an interesting circumstance finds reichenberg a plainly unattackable post finds by dauns rate of palisading that there will be no attack from daun either no attack from daunand therefore that hulsens people may be sent home to schlettau again and that he friedrich will take post close by and wearisomely be content to wait for some new opportunity  which he does for a week to come daun sitting impregnable intrenched and palisaded to the teethrather wishing to be attacked you would say or hopeful sometimes of doing something of the hochkirch sort again for the country is woody and the enemy audaciousat all events very clear not to attack a man erring sometimes to a notable degree by overcaution could hardly have failed to overwhelm friedrichs small force had he at once on friedrichs crossing the elbe joined lacy and gone out against him thinks tempelhof pointing out the form of operation too tempelhof iv 42 48 caution is excellent but not quite by itself would caution alone do it an army all of druidic whinstones or innocent claysacks incapable of taking hurt would be the proper onedaun stood there friedrich looking daily into himvisibly in ill humor says mitchell and no wonder gloomy and surly words coming out of him to the distress of his generals which i took the liberty of hinting one evening to his majesty hint graciously received and of effect perceptible at least to my imagining  wednesday june 25th after nearly a week of this there rose towards sunset all over the reichenberg and far and wide an exuberant joyfiring for what in the world thinks friedrich alas your majestysince your own messenger has not arrived nor indeed ever will being picked up by pandourshere gathered from the austrian outposts or deserters are news for you fatal enough landshut is done fouquet and his valiant 13000 are trodden out there indignant fouquet has obeyed you not wisely but too well he has kept landshut six nights and five days on the morning of the sixth day here is what befell  landshut monday 23d june about a quarter to two in the morning loudon who had gathered 31000 horse and foot for the business and taken his measures fired aloft by way of signal four howitzers into the gray of the summer morning and burst loose upon fouquet in various columns on his southward front on both flanks ultimately in his rear too columns all in the height of fighting humor confident as three to oneand having brandy in them it is likewise said fouquet and his people stood to arms in the temper fouquet had vowed they would defended their hills with an energy with a steady skill which loudon himself admired but their hillworks would have needed thrice the numberfouquet by detaching and otherwise has in arms only 10680 men toughly as they strove after partial successes they began to lose one hill and then another and in the course of hours nearly all their hills landshut town loudon had taken from them landshut and its roads in the end the prussian position is becoming permeable plainly untenableaustrian force is moving to their rearward to block the retreat  seeing which latter fact fouquet throws out all his cavalry a poor 1500 to secure the passes of the bober himself formed square with the wrecks of his infantry and at a steady step cuts way for himself with bayonet and bullet with singular success for some time in spite of the odds and is clear across the bober when lo among the knolls ahead masses of austrian cavalry are seen waiting him besetting every passage even these do not break him but these with infantry and cannon coming up to help them do here for some time was the fiercest tug of alltill a bullet having killed fouquets horse and carried the general himself to the ground the spasm ended the lichnowski dragoons a famed austrian regiment who had charged and again charged with nothing but repulse on repulse now broke in all in a foam of rage cut furiously upon fouquet himself wounded fouquet thrice would have killed him had it not been for the heroism of poor trautschke his groom let us name the gallant fellow even if unpronounceable who flung himself on the body of his master and took the bloody strokes instead of him shrieking his loudest will you murder the commanding general then which brought up the colonel of lichnowski a gentleman and ritter abhorrent of such practices to him fouquet gave his swordkept his vow never to draw it again  the wrecks of fouquets infantry were many of them massacred no quarter given such the unchivalrous fury that had risen his cavalry with the loss of about 500 cut their way through they and some stragglers of foot in whole about 1500 of both kinds were what remained of those 10680 after this bloody mornings work there had been about six hours of it all over by 8 oclock hofbericht von der am

stenzelprotracts the action to halfpast 7 in the evening  fouquet has obeyed to the letter did not my king wrong me fouquet may say to himself truly herr general your kings order was a little unwise as you who were on the ground and your king not knew it to be an unwise orderperhaps not inexcusable in the sudden circumstances and perhaps a still more perfect bayard would have preferred obeying such a king in spirit rather than in letter and thereby doing him vital service against his temporary will it is not doubted but fouquet left to himself and his 13000 with the fortresses and garrisons about him would have maintained himself in silesia till help came the issue isfouquet has probably lost this fine king his silesia for the time being and beyond any question has lost him 10000 prussianspartan fighters and a fine general whom he could ill sparein a word the gate of silesia is burst open and loudon has every prospect of taking glatz which will keep it so  what a thunderbolt for friedrich one of the last pillars struck away from his tottering affairs inevitable then we are over with it then one may fancy friedrichs reflections but he showed nothing of them to anybody in a few hours had his mind composed and new plans on the anvil on the morrow of that austrian joyfiringmorrow or some day close on it ought to have been dated but is notthere went from him to magdeburg the order have me such and such quantities of siegeartillery in a state of readiness tempelhof iv 51 already meaning it is thought or contemplating as possible a certain siege which surprised everybody before long a most inventive enterprising being no end to his contrivances and unexpected outbreaks especially when you have him jammed into a corner and fancy it is all over with him  to no other general says tempelhof would such a notion of besieging dresden have occurred or if it had suggested itself the hideous difficulties would at once have banished it again or left it only as a pious wish but it is strokes of this kind that characterize the great man often enough they have succeeded been decisive of great campaigns and wars and become splendid in the eyes of all mankind sometimes as in this case they have only deserved to succeed and to be splendid in the eyes of judges how get these masses of enemies lured away so that you could try such a thing there lay the difficulty insuperable altogether except by the most fine and appropriate treatment of a truth it required a connected series of the wisest measures and most secret artifices of warand withal that you should throw over them such a veil as would lead your enemy to see in them precisely the reverse of what they meant how all this was to be set in action and how the enemys own plans intentions and moods of mind were to be used as raw material for attainment of your objectstudious readers will best see in the manoeuvres of the king in his now more than critical condition which do certainly exhibit the completest masterpiece in the art of leading armies that europe has ever seen  tempelhof is well enough aware as readers should continue to be that primarily and onward for three weeks more not dresden but the getting to silesia on good terms is friedrichs main enterprise dresden only a supplement or substitute a second string to his bow till the first fail but in effect the two enterprises or strings coincide or are one till the first of them fail and tempelhofs eulogy will apply to either the initiatory step to either is a second feat of marchingstill notabler than the former which has had this poor issue soldiers of the studious or scientific sort if there are yet any such among us will naturally go to tempelhof and fearlessly encounter the ruggedest documents and books if tempelhof leave them dubious on any point which he hardly will to ingenuous readers of other sorts who will take a little pains for understanding the thing perhaps the following intermittent faroff glimpses may suffice mitchell ii 162 et seq and tempelhof iv 5053 et seq as a scientific check on mitchell or unconscious fellowwitness with himagreeing beautifully almost always  on ascertaining the landshut disaster friedrich falls back a little northward to grossdobritz possibly daun will think us cowed by what has happened and may try something on us daun is by no means sure of this cowed phenomenon or of the retreat it has made and tries nothing on it only rides up daily to it to ascertain that it is there and diligently sends out parties to watch the northeastward parts where run the silesian roads after about a week of this and some disappointments friedrich decides to march in earnest there had one day come report of lacys being detached lacy with a strong division to block the silesian roads but that on trial proved to be false pshaw nothing for us but to go ourselves concludes friedrichand july 1st sends off his bakery and heavy baggage indicating to mitchell tomorrow morning at 3here is mitchells own account accurate in every particular as we find mitchell ii 164 tempelhof iv 54  wednesday july 2d from grossdobritz to quosdorf to quosdorf a poor hamlet there not quolsdorf as many write which is a town far enough from therethe army marched accordingly in two columns baggage bakery and artillery in a third through a country extremely covered with wood were attacked by some uhlans and hussars whom a few cannonshot sent to the road again march lasted from 3 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon twelve long hours went northeastward a space of 20 miles leaving radeburg much more leaving reichenberg moritzburg and the daun quarters well to the right and at last quite to rearward crossed the roder crossed the pulsnitz small tributaries or subtributaries of the elbe in those parts crossed the latter which divides meissen from the lausitz partly by the bridge of krakau first village in the lausitz headquarter was the poor hamlet of quosdorf a mile farther on this march had been carefully kept secret says mitchell and it was the opinion of the most experienced officers that had the enemy discovered the king of prussias design they might by placing their light troops in the roads with proper supports have rendered it extremely difficult if not impracticable  daun very early got to know of friedrichs departure and whitherward which was extremely interesting to daun aims to be in silesia before me will cut out loudon from his fine prospects on glatzand had instantly reinforced perhaps to 20000 lacys division and ordered lacy who is the nearest to friedrichs march to start instantly on the skirts of said march and endeavor diligently to trample on the same for the purpose of harassing said march lacy is to do whatever he with safety can which we see is not much a few uhlans and hussars at lowest is to keep it constantly in sight and always encamp as near it as he dare tempelhof iv 54daun himself girding up his loins and preparing by a shortcut to get ahead of it in a day or two lacy was alert enough but could not do much with safety a few uhlans and hussars that was all and he is now encamped somewhere to rearward as near as he dare  thursday 3d july a restday army resting about krakau after such a spell through the woody moors the king with small escort rides out reconnoitring hither thither on the southern side or lacy quarter to the top of the keulenberg bludgeon hill at lastwhich is ten or a dozen miles from krakau and quosdorf but commands an extensive view towns villagebelfries courses of streams a country of mossy woods and wild agricultures of bogs of shaggy moor southward 10 miles is radeberg not radeburg observe yonder is the town of pulsnitz on our stream of pulsnitz to southeast and twice as far is bischofswerda chasmy stolpen too well known to us before this behind us konigsbruck kamenz and the road from grossenhayn to bautzen these and many other places memorable to this king are discoverable from bludgeon hill but the discovery of discoveries to him is lacys campnot very far off about a mile behind pulsnitz clearly visible at lichtenberg yonder which we at once determine to attack which and the roads to which are the one object of interest just nownothing else visible as it were on the top of the keulenberg here or as we ride homeward meditating it with a practical view march at midnight that is the practical result arrived at on reaching home  friday july 4th since the stroke of midnight we are all on march again nothing but the baggages and bakeries left with quintus to watch them which i see is his common function in these marches king himself in the vanguardwho hopes to give lacy a salutation tempelhof iv 56 the march was full of defiles says mitchell and mitchell in his carriage knew little what a region it was with boggy intricacies lakelets tangly thickets stocks and stumps or what a business to pass with heavy cannon baggagewagons and columns of men such a march and again not far from twenty miles of it very hot as the morning broke in the breathless woods had lacy known what kind of ground we had to march in and been enterprising thinks tempelhof the march being so retarded lacy got notice of it and vanished quite awayto bischofswerda i believe and the protecting neighborhood of daun nothing of him left when we emerge simultaneously from this hand and from that on his front and on his rear to take him as in a vice as in the sudden snap of a foxtrapfox quite gone hardly a few hussars of him to be picked up and no chase possible after such a march  friedrich had done everything to keep himself secret but lacy has endless pandours prowling about and i suppose the countrypeople in the lausitz here who ought to have loyalty are on the lacy side friedrich has to take his disappointment he encamps here on the heights headquarter pulsnitztill quintus come up with the baggage which he does punctually but not till nightfall not till midnight the last of him  saturday july 5th to the road again at 3 am again to northward to kloster cloister marienstern a 15 miles or soheadquarter in the cloister itself daun had set off for bautzen with his 50 or 60000 in the extremest push of haste and is at bautzen this night ahead of friedrich with lacy as rearguard of him who is also ahead of friedrich and safe at bischofswerda a daun hastening as never before this news of a daun already at bautzen awakened friedrichs utmost speed never do that daun be in silesia before us indispensable to get ahead of bautzen and him or to be waiting on the flank of his next march accordingly  sunday july 6th friedrich at 3 am is again in motion in three columns streaming forward all day straight eastward daunward intends to cross the spree leaving bautzen to the right and take post somewhere to northeast of bautzen and on the flank of daun the windless day grows hotter and hotter the roads are of loose sand full of jungles and impediments this was such a march for heat and difficulty as the king never had before in front of each column went wagons with a few pontoons there being many brooks and little streams to cross the soldier for his own healths sake is strictly forbidden to drink but as the burning day rose higher in the sweltering close march thirst grew irresistible crossing any of these brooks the soldiers pounce down irrepressible whole ranks of them lift water clean or dirty drink it greedily from the brim of the hat sergeants may wag their tongues and their cudgels at discretion showers of cudgelstrokes says archenholtz sergeants going like threshers on the poor menthough the upper officers had a touch of mercy and affected not to see this disobedience to the sergeants and their cudgels which was punishable with death war is not an overfond mother but a sufficiently spartan one to her sons there dropt down in the march that day 105 prussian men who never rose again and as to intercepting daun by such velocitydaun too is on march gone to gorlitz at almost a faster pace if at a far heavierlike a carthorse on gallop faring still worse in the heat 200 of dauns men died on the road this day and 300 more were invalided for life tempelhof iv 58 archenholtz ii 68 mitchell ii 166  before reaching the spree friedrich who is in the vanguard hears of this gorlitz march and that the bird is flown for which he has therefore to devise straightway a new expedient wheel to the right cross spree farther down holding towards bautzen itself orders friedrich and settles within two miles of bautzen his left being at doberschutzon the strong ground he held after hochkirch while daun two years ago sat watching so quiescent daun knows what kind of march these prussians blocked out from relief of neisse stole on him then and saved their silesia in spite of his watching and blockingand has plunged off in the manner of a carthorse scared into galloping to avoid the like what a sabbathdays journey on both sides for those sons of war nothing in the roman times though they had less baggage comes up to such modern marching nor is this the fastest of friedrichs though of dauns it unspeakably is friedrich having missed daun is thinking now to whirl round and go into lacywhich will certainly bring daun back even better  this evening accordingly ziethen occupies bautzen sweeps out certain lacy precursors cavalry in some strength who are there lacy has come on as far as bischofswerda and his horsepeople seem to be wide ahead provokingly pert upon friedrichs outposts who determines to chastise them the first thing tomorrow tomorrow as is very needful is to be a restday otherwise for friedrichs wearied people a restday not at all for dauns who continues his heavyfooted galloping yet another day and another till he get across the queiss and actually reach silesia  monday july 7th restday accordingly in bautzen neighborhood nothing passing but a curious skirmish of horsein which friedrich who had gone westward reconnoitring seeking lacy had the main share and was notably situated for some time godau a small town or village six miles west of bautzen was the scene of this notable passage actors in it were friedrich himself on the prussian part and on the austrian by degrees lacys cavalry almost in whole lacys cavalry what friedrich does not know are all in those neighborhoods and no sooner is godau swept clear of them than they return in greater numbers needing to be again swept and in fact they gradually gather in upon him in a singular and dangerous manner after his first successes on them and before his infantry have time to get up and support  friedrich was too impatient in this provoking little haggle arresting him here he had ordered on the suitable battalion with cannon but hardly considers that the battalion itself is six miles offnot to speak of the order which is galloping on horseback not going by electricitythe impatient friedrich had slashed in at once upon godau taken above 100 prisoners but is astonished to see the slashed people return with saxondragoon regiments all manner of regiments reinforcing them and has some really dangerous fencing thereissuing in dangerous and curious pause of both parties who stand drawn up scarcely beyond pistolshot and gazing into one another for i know not how many minutes neither of them daring to move off lest on the instant of turning it be charged and overwhelmed as the impatient friedrich at last almost washad not his infantry just then got in and given their cannonsalvo he lost about 200 the lacy people hardly so many and is now out of a considerable personal jeopardy which is still celebrated in the anecdotebooks perhaps to a mythical extent two uhlans saxonpolish lighthorse with their truculent pikes are just plunging in say the anecdotebooks friedrichs page who had got unhorsed sprang to his feet bellowed in polish to them what are you doing here fellows excellenz for the page is not in prussian uniform or in uniform at all only welldressed excellenz our horses ran away with us answer the poor fellows and whirl back rapidly the story says retzow is true retzow ii 215  this is the one event of july 7thand of july 8th withal which day also on news of daun that come friedrich rests up to july 8th it is clear friedrich is shooting with what we called the first string of his bowintent namely on silesia nor on hearing that daun is forward again now hopelessly ahead does he quit that enterprise but on the contrary tomorrow morning july 9th tries it by a new method as we shall see method cunningly devised to suit the second string as well how lucky that we have a second string in case of failure  tuesday 8th july news that daun reached gorlitz yesternight and is due tonight at lauban fifty miles ahead of usno hope now of reaching daun perhaps a sudden clutch at lacy in the opposite direction might be the method of recalling daun and reaching him that is the method fallen upon  sun being set the drums in bautzen sound tattooaudible to listening croats in the environsbeat tattoo and later in the night other passages of drummusic also for croat behoof generalmarch i think it is indicating that we have started again in pursuit of daun and in short every precaution being taken to soothe the mind of lacy and the croats friedrich silently issues with his best speed in three columns by three roads towards lacys quarters which go from that village of godau westward in a loose way several miles in three columns by three routes all to converge with punctuality on lacy of the columns two are of infantry the leftmost and the rightmost on each hand hidden as much as possible one is of cavalry in the middle coming on in this mannerlike a pair of triplepincers which are to grip simultaneously on lacy and astonish him if he keep quiet but lacy is vigilant and is cautious almost in excess learning by his pandours that the king seems to be coming this way lacy gathers himself on the instant quits godau by one in the morning and retreats bodily at his fastest step to bischofswerda again nor by any means stops there tempelhof iv 6163  for the third time three is lucky friedrich may have thought and there has no precaution of drummusic of secrecy or persuasive finesse been neglected on lacy but lacy has ears that hear the grass grow our elaborately accurate triplepincers closing simultaneously on bischofswerda after eighteen miles of sweep find lacy flown again nothing to be caught of him but some 80 hussars all this day and all next night lacy is scouring through the western parts at an extraordinary rate halting for a camp twice over at different placesdurre fuchs thirsty fox durre buhle thirsty sweetheart or wherever it was then again taking wing on sound of prussian parties to rear in short hurrying towards dresden and the reichsfolk as if for life  lacys retreat i hear was ingeniously done with a minimum of disorder in the circumstances but certainly it was with a velocity as if his head had been on fire and indeed they say he escaped annihilation by being off in time he put up finally not at thirsty sweetheart still less at thirsty fox successive hamlets and public houses in the sandy wilderness which lies to north of elbe and is called dresden heath but farther on in the same tract at weisse hirsch white hart which looks close over upon dresden within two miles or so and is a kind of height and military post of advantage next morning july 10th he crosses dresden bridge comes streaming through the city and takes shelter with the reichsfolk near theretowards plauen chasm the strongest ground in the world hardly strong enough it appears in the present emergency  friedrichs first string therefore has snapt in two but on the instant he has a second fitted onmay that prove luckier     chapter ii  friedrich besieges dresden  from and after the evening of wednesday july 9th it is upon a siege of dresden that friedrich goesturning the whole wartheatre topsyturvy throwing daun loudon lacy everybody out in this strange and sudden manner one of the finest military feats ever done thinks tempelhof undoubtedly a notable result so far and notably done as the impartial reader if tempelhof be a little inconsistent sees for himself these truly are a wonderful series of marches opulent in continual promptitudes audacities contrivancesdone with shining talent certainly and also with result shining for the moment and in a fabulous epic i think dresden would certainly have fallen to friedrich and his crowd of enemies been left in a tumbled condition  but the epic of reality cares nothing for such considerations and the time allowable for capture of dresden is very brief had daun on getting warning been as prompt to return as he was to go frankly fronting at once the chances of the road he might have been at dresden again perhaps within a weekno siege possible for friedrich hardly the big guns got up from magdeburg but friedrich calculated there would be very considerable fettling and haggling on dauns part say a good fortnight of siege allowedand that by deadlift effort of all hands the thing was feasible within that limit on friedrichs part as we can fancy there was no want of effort nor on his peoples partin spite of his complainings say retzow and the opposition party who insinuate their own private belief of impossibility from the first which is not confirmed by impartial judgmentsthat of archenholtz and others better the truth is friedrich was within an inch of taking dresden by the first assaultthey say he actually could have taken it by storm the first day but shuddered at the thought of exposing poor dresden to sack and plunder and hoped to get it by capitulation  one of the rapidest and most furious sieges anywhere on record filled europe with astonishment expectancy admiration horrormust be very briefly recited here the main chronological epochs salient points of crisis and successive phases of occurrence will sufficiently indicate it to the readers fancy  it was thursday evening 10th july when lacy got to his reichsfolk and took breath behind plauen chasm maguire is governor of dresden the consternation of garrison and population was extreme to lacy himself it did not seem conceivable that friedrich could mean a siege of dresden friedrich that night is beyond the river in dauns old impregnability of reichenberg he has no siegeartillery thinks lacy no means no time  nevertheless saturday next day after tomorrowbehold there is hulsen come from schlettau to our neighborhood on our austrian side of the river and at kaditz yonder a mile below dresden are not the kings people building their pontoons in march since 2 in the morningevidently coming across if not to besiege dresden then to attack us which is perhaps worse we outnumber thembut as to trying fight in any form zweibruck leaves maguire an additional 10000every help and encouragement to maguire whose garrison is now 14000 be of courage excellenz maguire nobody is better skilled in siegematters feldmarschall and relief will be here with despatchand withdraws lacy and he to the edge of the pirna country there to be well out of harms way lacy and he it is thought would perhaps have got beaten trying to save dresden from its misery lacys orders were not on any terms to get into fighting with friedrich but only to cover dresden dresden without fighting has proved impossible to cover and lacy leaves it bare tempelhof iv 65  at kaditz says mitchell where the second bridge of boats took a great deal of time i was standing by his majesty when news to the above effect came across from general hulsen the king was highly pleased and turning to me said just what i wished they have saved me a very long march round by dippoldiswalde or so in upon the rear of them by going of will and immediately the king got on horseback ordering the army to follow as fast as it could mitchell ii 168 through preisnitz plauenward goes the army circling round the western and the southern side of dresden a dread spectacle from the walls across weistritz brook and the plauen chasm comfortably left vacant and encamps on the southeastern side of dresden at gruna behind the great garden ready to begin business on the morrow gruna about a mile to southeast of dresden walls is headquarter during this siege  through the night the prussians proceed to build batteries the best they canthere is no right siegeartillery yet a few accidental howitzers and 25pounders the rest mere fieldgunsbut tomorrow morning be as it may business shall begin prince von holstein nephew of the holstein beck or holstein silverplate whom we lost long ago from beyond the river encamped at the white hart yonder is to play upon the neustadt simultaneously  monday 14th at 6 am cannonade began diligent on holsteins part and ours but of inconsiderable effect maguire has been summoned will with such a garrison in spite of such trepidations from the court and others defend himself to the last man freecorps people not quintuss who is on the other side of the river tempelhof v 67 with regulars to rear advance on the pirna gate hurl in maguires outparties and had near got in along with themmight have done so they and their supports it is thought by some had storm seemed the recommendable method  for four days there is livelier and livelier cannonading new batteries getting opened in the moschinska garden and other points on the prussian part great longing that the magdeburg artillery were here the prussians are making diligently ready for it in the mean while refitting the old trenches old envelope dug by maguire himself in the antischmettau time these will do well enoughthe prussians reinforce holstein at the weisse hirsch throw a new bridge across to him and are busy day and night maguire too is most industrious resisting and preparing thursday shuts up the weistritz brook a dam being ready this long while back needing only to be closed and lays the whole south side of dresden under water many rumors about daun coming not comingmust for certain come but will possibly be slowish  friday 18th joy to every prussian soul here are the heavy guns from magdeburg these at any rate are come beds for them all ready and now the cannonading can begin in right earnest as it does with a vengeance to mitchell and perhaps others the king of prussia says he will now be master of the town in a few days and the disposition he has made of his troops on the other side of the river is intended not only to attack dresden on that side and defend himself from daun but also to prevent the garrison from retiring this morning friday 18th the suburb of pirna the one street left of it was set fire to by maguire and burnt out of the way as the others had been many of the wretched inhabitants had fled to our camp let them lodge in plauen no fighting there quiet artificial water expanses there instead many think the town will not be taken or that if it should it will cost very dearso determined seems maguire mitchell iii 170 171 and in effect from this day onwards the siege became altogether fierce and not only so but fiery as well and though lasting in that violent form only four or at the very utmost seven days more had near ruined dresden from the face of the world  saturday 19th maguire touched to the quick by these new artilleries of the prussians this morning found good to mount a gun or two on the leads of the kreuzkirche protestant high church where before now we have noticed friedrich attending quasidivine service more than oncethat is to say on the crown of dresden from which there is view into the bottom of friedrichs trenches and operations others say it was only two or three old saxon cannon which stand there for firing on galadays and that they hardly fired on friedrich more than once for certain this is one of the desirablest batterystationsif only friedrich will leave it alone which he will not for a moment but brings terrific howitzers to bear on it cannonballs grenadoes tears it to destruction and the poor kreuzkirche along with it kirche speedily all in flames street after street blazing up round it again and again for eightandforty hours coming hapless dresden during two days and nights a mere volcano henceforth by mistake all that and without order of mine says friedrich oncemeaning i think all that of the kreuzkirche and perhaps wishing he could mean the bombardment altogether schoning ii 361 to prince henri at giessen frankfurt country 23d july 1760who nevertheless got and gets most of the credit of the thing from a shocked outside world  this morning same saturday 19th daun is reported to have arrived vanguard of him said to be at schonfeld over in thirstysweetheart country yonder which friedrich going to reconnoitre finds tragically indisputable there for certain only five miles from holsteins post at the white hart and no river betweenas the crow flies hardly five from our own camp perhaps it will be some days yet before he do anything so that friedrich persists in his bombardment only the more by firetorture then let the bombarded royalties assail maguire and maguire give init is our one chance left and succeed we will and must cruel say youah yes cruel enough not merciful at all the soul of friedrich i perceive is not in a bright mood at this time but in a black and wrathful worn almost desperate against the slings and arrows of unjust fate ahead i say if everybody will do miracles cannot we perhaps still manage it in spite of fate mitchell is very sorry but will forget and forgive those inexorable passages of war  i cannot think of the bombardment of dresden without horror says he nor of many other things i have seen misfortunes naturally sour mens temper even royal mens and long continued without interval at last extinguish humanity we are now in a most critical and dangerous situation which cannot long last one lucky event approaching to a miracle may still save all but the extreme caution and circumspection of marshal daun mitchell ii 184 185  if daun could be swift and end the miseries of dresden surely dresden would be much obliged to him it was ten days yet after that of the kreuzkirche before dresden quite got rid of its siege daun never was a sudden man by a kind of accident he got holstein hustled across the river that first night july 19thnot annihilated as was very feasible but pushed home out of his way whereby the north side of dresden is now open and daun has free communication with maguire  maguire rose thereupon to a fine pitch of spirits tried several things and wished daun to try but with next to no result for two days after holsteins departure daun sat still on his safe northern shore stirring nothing but his own cunctations and investigations leaving the bombardment or cannonade to take its own course one attempt he did make in concert with maguire night of monday 21st and one attempt only of a serious nature which like the rest was unsuccessful and would not be worth mentioningexcept for the poor regiment bernburgs sake bernburg having got into strange case in consequence of it  this attempt night of 21st22d july was a combined sally and assaultsally by maguires people a general nugent heading them from the south or plauen side of dresden and assault by 4000 of dauns from the north sideupon friedrichs trenches which are to be burst in upon in this double way and swept well clear as may be expected friedrich however was aware of the symptoms and had people ready waitingespecially had regiment bernburg battalions 1st and 2d a regiment hitherto without stain  bernburg accordingly on general nugents entering their trenches from the south side falls altogether heartily on general nugent tumbles him back takes 200 prisoners nudent himself one of them who is considered to have been the eye of the enterprise worth many hundreds this night all this bernburg in its usually creditable manner does as expected of it but after or during all this when the dann people from the north come streaming in say four to one both south and north bernburg looked round for support and seeing none had after more or less of struggle to retire as a defeated bernburgaustrians taking the battery and ruling supreme there for some time till wedell or somebody with fresh battalions came up and rallying bernburg to him retook their battery and drove out the austrians with a heavy loss of prisoners tempelhof iv 79  i did not hear that bernburgs conduct was liable to the least fair censure but friedrichs soul is severe at this time demanding miracles from everybody you runaway bernburg shame on youand actually takes the swords from them and cuts off their hattresses there which excited such an astonishment in the prussian army as was seldom seen before and affected bernburg to the length almost of despair and breaking of heartin a way that is not ridiculous to me at all but beautiful and pathetic of which there is much talk now and long afterwards in military circles the sorrows of these poor bernburgers their desperate efforts to wash out this stigma their actual washing of it out not many weeks hence and their magnificent joy on the occasionthese are the one distinguishing point in dauns relief of dresden which was otherwise quite a cunctatory sedentary matter  daun built three bridgeshe had a broad stone one alreadybut did little or nothing with them and never himself came across at all merely shot out nocturnal pandour parties and ordered up lacy and the reichsfolk to do the like and break the nights rest of his enemy he made minatory movements one at least down the river by his own shore on friedrichs ammunitionboats from torgau and actually intercepted certain of them which was something but except this and vague flourishings of the pandour kind left friedrich to his own course  friedrich bombarded for a day or two farther cannonaded out of more or fewer batteries for eight or i think ten days more attacks from daun there were to be now on this side now on that many rumors of attack but except once only midnight pandours attempting the kings lodging a farmhouse near gruna but to their astonishment rousing the whole prussian army in the course of three minutes archenholtz ii 81 who is very vivid but does not date rodenbeck ii 24 quotes similar account by another eyewitness and guesses it to be night of july 22d23d rumor was mainly all for guarding his siegelines friedrich has to alter his position to shift slightly now fronting this way now the other way is called always at midnight against these nocturnal disturbances and never has his clothes off nevertheless continues his bombardment and then his cannonading till his own good time which i think is till the 26th his ricochetbattery which is good against maguires people innocent to dresden he continued for three days morewhile gathering his furnitures about plauen country making his arrangements at meissendid not march till the night of june 29th altogether calmly no daun or austrian molesting him in the least his very sentries walking their rounds in the trenches till daylight after which they also marched unmolested meissenward  unfortunate friedrich has made nothing of dresden then after such a june and july of it since he left the meissen country after all these intricate manoeuvrings hot fierce marchings and superhuman exertions here is he returning to meissen country poorer than if he had stayed fouquet lost glatz unrelievednay just before marching off what is this new phenomenon is this by way of happy journey to you towards sunset of the 29th exuberant joyfiring rises far and wide from the usually quiet austrian linesmeaning what once more meaning that glatz is lost your majesty that instead of a siege of many weeks as might have been expected with fouquet for commandant it has held out under fouquets second only a few hours and is gone without remedy certain though incredible imbecile commandant treacherous garrison austrian deserters mainly with stealthy jesuits acting on them no use asking what here is the sad narrative in succinct form     capture of glatz 26th july 1760  loudon is a swift man when he can get bridle but the curbhand of daun is often heavy on him loudon has had glatz blockaded since june 7th since june 23d he has had fouquet rooted away and the ground clear for a siege of glatz but had to abstain altogether in the mean time to take camp at landshut to march and manoeuvre about in support of daun and that heavyfooted gallop of dauns which then followed on the whole it was not till friedrich went for dresden that the siegeartillery from olmutz could be ordered forward upon glatz not for a fortnight more that the artillery could come and in spite of loudons utmost despatch not till break of day july 26th that the batteries could open after which such was loudons speed and fortuneand so diligent had the jesuits been in those seven weeksthe siege as they call it was over in less than seven hours  one colonel do piedmontese by nation an incompetent person known to loud trenck during his detention here was commandant of glatz and had the principal fortressfor there are two one on each side the neisse riverhis second was a colonel quadt by birth prussian seemingly not very competent he either who had command of the old fortress round which lies the town of glatz a little town abounding in jesuitsto whose virgin if readers remember friedrich once gave a new gown with small effect on her as would appear the quadtdo garrison was 2400and if tales are true it had been well bejesuited during those seven weeks oeuvres de frederic v 55 at four in the morning july 26th the battering began on quadt quadt i will believe responding what he couldespecially from a certain arrowhead redoubt or fleche he has which ought to have been important to him after four or five hours of this there was mutual pauseas if both parties had decided upon breakfast before going farther  quadts fortress is very strong mostly hewn in the rock and he has that important outwork of a fleche which is excellent for enfilading as it extends well beyond the glacis and being of rock like the rest is also abundantly defensible loudons people looking over into this fleche find it negligently guarded quadt at breakfast as would seemand directly send for harsch captain of the siege and even for loudon the generalinchief negligently guarded sure enough nothing in the fleche but a few sentries and these in the horizontal position taking their unlawful rest there after such a mornings work seize me that eagerly orders loudon hold that with firm grip which is done only to step in softly two battalions of you and lay hard hold incompetent quadt figure in what a flurry rushing out to recapture his flecheexplodes instead into mere anarchy whole companies of him flinging down their arms at their officers feet and the like so that quadt is totally driven in again austrians along with him and is obliged to beat chamadedo following the example about an hour after without even a capitulation was there ever seen such a defence major unruh one of a small minority was prussian and stanch here is unruhs personal experiencetestimony on dos trial i supposeand now pretty much the one thing worth reading on this subject  major ulzruh testifies at four in the morning 26th july 1760 the enemy began to cannonade the old fortress that of quadt and about nine i was ordered with 150 men to clear the envelope from austrians just when i had got to the dammgate halt was called i asked the commandant who was behind me which way i should march to the crownwork or to the envelope being answered to the envelope i found on coming out at the fieldgate nothing but an austrian lieutenantcolonel and some men he called to me there had been chamade beaten and i was not to run into destruction mich unglucklich machen i offered him quarter and took him in effect prisoner with 20 of his best men and sent him to the commandant with request that he would keep my rear free or send me reinforcement i shot the enemy a great many people here chased him from the fieldgate and out of both the envelope and the redoubt called the crane that is the fleche itself only that the austrians are mostly not now there but gone through into the interior therereturning to the fieldgate i found that the commandant had beaten chamade a second time there were marching in by this fieldgate two battalions of the austrian regiment andlau i had to yield myself prisoner and was taken to general loudon he asked me dont you know the rules of war then that you fire after chamade is beaten i answered in my heat i knew of no chamade what poltroonery or what treachery had been going on i knew not loudon answered you might deserve to have your head laid at your feet sir am i here to inquire which of you shows bravery which poltroonery seyfarth ii 652 a blazing loudon when the fire is up  after the peace do had courtmartial which sentenced him to death friedrich making it perpetual imprisonment perhaps not a traitor only a blockhead thought friedrich he had been recommended to his post by fouquet what trenck writes of him is otherwise mostly lies  thus is the southern key of silesia one of the two southern keys neisse being the other lost to friedrich for the first time and loudon is like to drive a trade there will absolutely nothing prosper with us then nothing seemingly your majesty heavier news friedrich scarcely ever had but there is no help this too he has to carry with him as he can into the meissen country unsuccessful altogether beaten on every hand human talent diligence endeavor is it but as lightning smiting the serbonian bog smite to the last your majesty at any rate let that be certain as it is and has been that is always something that is always a great thing  friedrich intends no pause in those meissen countries july 30th on his march northward he detaches hulsen with the old 10000 to take camp at schlettau as before and do his best for defence of saxony against the reichsfolk numerous but incompetent he himself next day passes on leaving meissen a little on his right to schieritz some miles farther downintending there to cross elbe and make for silesia without loss of an hour need enough of speed thither more need than even friedrich supposes yesterday july 30th loudons vanguard came blockading breslau and this day loudon himselfthough friedrich heard nothing anticipated nothing of that dangerous fact for a week hence or more  soltikofs and loudons united intentions on silesia he has well known this long while and has been perpetually dunning prince henri on the subject to no purposeonly hoping always there would probably be no great rapidity on the part of these discordant allies friedrichs feelings now that the contrary is visible and indeed all through the summer in regard to the soltikofloudon business and the fouquethenri method of dealing with it have been painful enough and are growing ever more so cautious henri never would make the smallest attack on soltikof but merely keep observing himthe end of which what can the end of it be urges friedrich always condense yourselves go in upon the russians while they are in separate corpsand is very illsatisfied with the languor of procedures there as is the prince with such reproaches or implied reproaches on said languor nor is his humor cheered when the kings bad predictions prove true what has it come to these letters of king and prince are worth readingif indeed you can in the confusion of schoning a somewhat exuberant man loud rather than luminousso curious is the private dialogue going on there at all times in the background of the stage between the brothers one short specimen extending through the june and july just

the fouquet disaster yesterday my heart was torn to pieces news of landshut fouquets downfall there and i felt too sad to be in a state for writing you a sensible letter but today when i have come to myself a little again i will send you my reflections after what has happened to fouquet it is certain loudon can have no other design but on breslau he designs glatz first of all it will be the grand point therefore especially if the russians too are bending thither to save that capital of silesia surely the turks must be in motionif so we are saved if not so we are lost today i have taken this camp of dobritz in order to be more collected and in condition to fight well should occasion riseand in case all this that is said and written to me about the turks is true which nothing of it was to

before setting out on those gloomy marchings and cunctatory hagglings henri writes at torgau april 26th just back from berlin and farewell of friends  i mean to march the day after tomorrow i took arrangements with general fouquet about that long finespun chain of posts where we are to do such servicethe black hussars cannot be here till tomorrow otherwise i should have marched a day sooner my brother poor little invalid ferdinand charged me to lay him at your feet i found him weak and thin more so than formerly returning hither the day before yesterday i passed through potsdam i went to sanssouci april 24th 1760all is green there the garden embellished and seemed to me excellently kept though these details cannot occupy you at present i thought it would give you pleasure to hear of them for a moment schoning ii 233 torgau 26th april 1760 ah yes all is so green and blessedly silent there sight of the lost paradise actually it visible for a moment yonder far away while one goes whirling in this manner on the illimitable wracking winds  here finally from a distant part of the wartheatre is another note which we will read while friedrich is at schieritz at no other place so properly the very date of it chief date july 31st being by accident synchronous with schieritz     duke ferdinands battle of warburg 31st july 1760  duke ferdinand has opened his difficult campaign and especiallyjust while that siege of dresden blazed and endedhas had three sharp fights which were then very loud in the gazettes along with it three once famous actions which unexpectedly had little or no result and are very much forgotten now so that bare enumeration of them is nearly all we are permitted here pitt has furnished 7000 new english this campaignthere are now 20000 english in all and a duke ferdinand raised to 70000 men surely under good omens thinks pitt and still more think the gazetteers judging by appearances yes but if broglio have 130000 what will it come to broglio is two to one and has before this proved himself a considerable captain  fight first is that of korbach july 10th of broglio namely who has got across the river ohm in hessen to ferdinands great disgust with the general imhof in command there and is streaming on to seize the diemel river and menace hanover of broglio in successive sections at a certain pass of korbach versus the hereditary prince erbprinz of brunswick who is waiting for him there in one good sectionand who beautifully hurls back one and another of the broglio sections but cannot hurl back the whole broglio army all marching by sections that way and has to retire back foremost fencing sharply still in a diligently handsome manner though with loss mauvillon ii 105 that is the battle of korbach fought july 10thwhile lacy streamed through dresden panting to be at plauen chasm safe at last  fight second july 16th was a kind of revenge on the erbprinzs part affair of emsdorf six days after in the same neighborhood beautiful too said the gazetteers but of result still more insignificant hearing of a considerable french brigade posted not far off at that village of emsdorf to guard broglios mealcarts there the indignant erbprinz shoots off for that light of footenglish horse mainly and hill scots bergschotten so called who have a fine free stride in summer weatherdashes in upon said brigade dragoons of bauffremont and other picked men who stood firmly on the defensive but were cut up in an amazing manner root and branch after a fierce struggle and as it were brought home in ones pocket to the admiration of military circlesespecially of messrooms and the junior sort elliots light horse part of the new 7000 what a regiment unparalleled for willingness and audacity of fence lost 125 killedin fact the loss chiefly fell on elliot ib ii 109 prisoners got were 2661 including general and officers 179 with all their furnitures whatsoever 400 horses 8 cannon c the bergschotten tooi think it was here that these kilted fellows who had marched with such a stride came home mostly riding poor beauffremont dragoons being entirely cut up or pocketed as prisoners and their horses ridden in this unexpected manner but we must not lingerhardly even on warburg which was the third and greatest and has still points of memorability though now so obliterated  warburg says my note on this latter is a pleasant little hessian town some twentyfive miles west of cassel standing on the north or left bank of the diemel among fruitful knolls and hollows the famous battle of warburgif you try to inquire in the town itself from your brief railwaystation it is much if some intelligent inhabitant at last remembers to have heard of it the thing went thus chevalier du muy who is broglios rearguard or reserve 30000 foot and horse with his back to the diemel and eight bridges across it in case of accident has his right flank leaning on warburg and his left on a village of ossendorf some two miles to northwest of that broglio prince xavier of saxony especially duke ferdinand are all vehemently and mysteriously moving about since that fight of korbach broglio intent to have cassel besieged du muy keeping the diemel for him ferdinand eager to have the diemel back from du muy and him  two days ago july 29th the erbprinz crossed over into these neighborhoods with a strong vanguard nearly equal to du muy and after studious reconnoitring and survey had means this morning july 31st to knock him over the diemel again if he can no time to be lost broglio near and in such force duke ferdinand too quitting broglio for a moment is on march this way crossed the diemel about midnight some ten miles farther down or eastward will thence bend southward at his best speed to support the erbprinz if necessary and beset the diemel when goterbprinz not however in any wise to wait for him such the pressure from broglio and others a most busy swiftgoing scene that morninghardly worth such describing at this date of time  the erbprinz who is still rather to northeastward that is to rightward not directly frontward of du muys lines and whose plan of attack is still dark to du muy commences about 8 am i should guess by launching his british legion so calledwhich is a composite body of freecorps nature british some of it colonel beckwiths people for example not british by much the most of it but an aggregate of wild strikers given to plunder tooby launching his british legion upon warburg town there to take charge of du muys right wing which legion with great rapidity not only pitched the french all out but clean plundered the poor town and is a sad sore on du muys right who cannot get it attended to in the ominous aspects elsewhere visible for the erbprinz who is a strategic creature comes on in the style of friedrich not straight towards du muy but sweeps out in two columns round northward privately intending upon du muys left wing and frontleft wing right wing by british legion and front all threeand is well aided by a mist which now fell and which hung on the higher ground and covered his march for an hour or more this mist had not begun when he saw on the knolltops far off on the right but indisputable as he flattered himselfsomething of ferdinand emerging saw this and pours along we can suppose with still better step and temper and bursts pretty simultaneously upon du muys right wing and left wing coercing his front the while squelches both these wings furiously together forces the coerced centre mostly horse to plunge back into the diemel and swim horse could swim but many of the foot who tried got drowned and on the whole du muy is a good deal wrecked 1600 killed 2000 prisoners not to speak of cannon and flags and but for his eight bridges would have been totally ruined  the fight was uncommonly furious especially on du muys left maxwells brigade going at it with the finest bayonetpractice musketry artillerypractice obstinate as bears on du muys right the british legion left wing british too by name had a much easier job but the fight generally was of hot and stubborn kind for hours perhaps two or moreand some say would not have ended so triumphantly had it not been for duke ferdinands vanguard lord granby and the english horse who warned by the noise ahead pushed on at the top of their speed and got in before the death granby and the blues had gone at the high trot for above five miles and i doubt not were in keen humor when they rose to the gallop and slashed in mauvillon says it was in this attack that lord granby at the head of the blues his own regiment had his hat blown off a big bald circle in his head rendering the loss more conspicuous but he never minded stormed still on bare bald head among the helmets and sabres and made it very evident that had he instead of sackville led at minden there had been a different story to tell the english by their valor adds he greatly distinguished themselves this day and accordingly they suffered by far the most their loss amounting to 590 men or as others countout of 1200 killed and wounded 800 were english mauvillon ii 114 or better in all these three cases as elsewhere tempelhofs specific chapter on ferdinand tempelhof iv 101122 ferdinands despatch to king george in knesebeck ii 9698or in the old newspapers gentlemans magazine xxx 386 387 where also is lord granbys despatch  this of granby and the bald head is mainly what now renders warburg memorable for in a year or two the excellent reynolds did a portrait of granby and by no means forgot this incident but gives him bareheaded bare and bald the oblivious british connoisseur not now knowing why as perhaps he ought the portrait i suppose may be in belvoir castle the artistic why of the baldness is this battle of warburg as above an affair otherwise of no moment ferdinand had soon to quit the diemel or to find it useless for him and to try other methodsfencing gallantly but too weak for broglio and on the whole had a difficult campaign of it against that considerable soldier with forces so superior     chapter iiibattle of liegnitz  friedrich stayed hardly one day in neissen country silesia in the jaws of destruction requiring such speed from him his new series of marches thitherward for the next two weeks especially with daun and lacy and at last with loudon too for escort are still more singular than the foregoing a fortnight of soldier history such as is hardly to be paralleled elsewhere of his inward gloom one hears nothing but the problem itself approaches to the desperate needing daily new invention new audacity with imminent destruction overhanging it throughout a march distinguished in military annalsbut of which it is not for us to pretend treating military readers will find it in tempelhof and the supplementary books from time to time cited here and for our own share we can only say that friedrichs labors strike us as abundantly herculean more alcideslike than everthe rather as hopes of any success have sunk lower than ever a modern alcides appointed to confront tartarus itself and be victorious over the threeheaded dog daun lacy loudon coming on you simultaneously openmouthed are a considerable tartarean dog soldiers judge that the kings resources of genius were extremely conspicuous on this occasion and to all men it is in evidence that seldom in the arena of this universe looked on by the idle populaces and by the eternal gods and antigods called devils did a son of adam fence better for himself now and throughout  this his third march to silesia in 1760 is judged to be the most forlorn and ominous friedrich ever made thither real peril and ruin to silesia and him more imminent than even in the old leuthen days difficulties complicacies very many friedrich can foresee a dauns army and a lacys for escort to us and such a silesia when we do arrive and there is one complicacy more which he does not yet know of that of loudon waiting ahead to welcome him on crossing the frontier and increase his escort thenceforthor rather let us say friedrich thanks to the despondent henri and others has escaped a great silesian calamityof which he will hear with mixed emotions on arriving at bunzlau on the silesian frontier six days after setting out since the loss of glatz july 26th friedrich has no news of loudon supposes him to be trying something upon neisse to be adjusting with his slow russians and in short to be out of the dismal accountcurrent just at present that is not the fact in regard to loudon that is far from the fact     loudon is trying a strokeofhand on breslau in the glatz fashion in the interim july 30thaugust 3d  hardly above six hours after taking glatz swift loudon no daun now tethering him daun standing or sitting in relief of dresden far off was on march for breslauvanguard of him marched that same evening july 26th in the liveliest hope of capturing breslau especially if soltikof to whom this of glatz ought to be a fine symbol and pledge make speed to cooperate soltikof is in no violent enthusiasm about glatz anxious rather about his own magazine at posen and how to get it carted out of henris way in case of our advancing towards some silesian siege if we were not ruined last year it was nt dauns fault growls he often and montalembert has need of all his suasive virtues which are wonderful to look at if anybody cared to look at them all flung into the sea in this manner for keeping the barbarous man in any approach to harmony the barbarous man had after haggle enough adjusted himself for besieging glogau and is surly to hear on the sudden order from petersburg reinforcing loudon that it is breslau instead excellenz it is not cunctator daun this time it is fiery loudon well breslau then answers soltikof at last after much suasion and marches thither tempelhof iv 8789 rose from posen july 26th faster than usual quickened by new temporary hopes of montalemberts raising or ones own what a placeofarms and place of victual would breslau be for us after all  and really mends his pace mends it ever more as matters grow stringent and advances upon breslau at his swiftest to rendezvous with loudon under the walls therewithin the walls very soon and ourselves chief proprietoras may be hoped breslau has a garrison of 4000 only 1000 of them stanch and there are among other bad items 9000 austrian prisoners in it a big city with weak walls another place to defend than rockhewn little glatzif there be no better than a do for commandant in it but perhaps there is  wednesday 30th july loudons vanguard arrived at breslau next day loudon himselfand besieged breslau very violently according to his means till the sunday following troops he has plenty 40000 odd which he gives out for 50 or even 60000 not to speak of soltikof with 75000 read 45000 striding on in a fierce and dreadful manner to meet him here better surrender to christian austrians had not you loudons artillery is not come up it is only struggling on from glatz soltikof of his own has no siegeartillery and loudon judges that heavyfooted soltikof waited on by an alert prince henri is a problematic quantity in this enterprise speedy oneself speedy and fiery thinks loudon by violence of speed of bullying and bombardment perhaps we can still do it and loudon tried all these things to a high stretch but found in tauentzien the wrong man  thursday 31st loudon who has two bridges over oder and the town begirt all round summons tauentzien in an awful sounding tone consider sir no defence possible a trading town you ought not to attempt defence of it surrender on fair terms or i shall which god forbid be obliged to burn you and it from the face of the world pooh pooh answers tauentzien in brief polite terms you yourselves had no doubt it was a garrison when we besieged you here on the heel of leuthen had you go tofiery loudon cannot try storm the town having oder and a wet ditch round it he gets his bombarding batteries forward as the one chance he has aided by bullying and tomorrow  friday august 1st sends half officially half in the friendly way dreadful messages again a warning to the mayor of breslau which was not signed by loudon death and destruction sir unlesswarning to the mayor and by the same private halfofficial messenger a new summons to tauentzien bombardment infallible universal massacre by croats i will not spare the child in its mothers womb i am not with child said tauentzien nor are my soldiers what is the use of such talk and about 10 that night loudon does accordingly break out into all the fire of bombardment he is master of kindles the town in various places which were quenched again by tauentziens arrangements kindles especially the kings fine dwellinghouse palace they call it and adjacent streets not quenchable till palace and they are much ruined will this make no impression far too little  next morning loudon sends a private messenger of conciliatory tone any terms your excellency likes to name only spare me the general massacre and child in the mothers womb from all which tauentzien infers that you are probably short of ammunition and that his outlooks are improving that day he gets guns brought to bear on general loudons own quarter blazes into loudons sittingroom so that loudon has to shift elsewhither no bombardment ensues that night nor next day anything but desultory cannonading and much noise and motionand at night sunday 3d everything falls quiet and to the glad amazement of

other side of the river finds henris advanced guards intrenched over there in old oder no russian able to get within five miles of breslaunor able to do more than cannonade in the distance and ask with indignation where are the siegeguns then where is general loudon instead of breslau capturable and a sure magazine for us here is henri and nothing but steel to eat and the soltikof risen into russian rages and the montalembert sunk in difficulties readers can imagine these indignant soltikof deaf to suasion with this dangerous henri in attendance is gradually edging back always rather back with an eye to his provisions and to certain bogs and woods he knows of but we will leave the soltikofhenri end of the line for the opposite end which is more interestingto friedrich till he got to

austrian disturbance all are across that morning by 5 oclock began at 2 whence we double back eastward and camp that night at dallwitzare quietly asleep there while loudons bombardment bursts out on breslau far away at dallwitz we rest next day wait for our bakeries and baggages and sunday august 3d at 2 in the morning set forth on the forlornest adventure in the world  the arrangements of the march foreseen and settled beforehand to the last item are of a perfection beyond praiseas is still visible in the general order or summary of directions given out which to this day one reads with a kind of satisfaction like that derivable from the fortyseventh of euclid clear to the meanest capacity not a word wanting in it not a word superfluous solid as geometry the army marches always in three columns left column foremost our first line of battle in case we have fighting is this foremost column second line is the second column reserve is the third all generals chaises moneywagons and regimental surgeons wagons remain with their respective battalions as do the heavy batteries with the brigades to which they belong when the march is through woody country the cavalry regiments go in between the battalions to be ready against pandour operations and accidents  with the first column the ziethen hussars and freebattalion courbiere have always the vanguard mohring hussars and freebattalion quintus speed to you learned friend the rearguard with the second column always the dragoon regiments normann and krockow have the vanguard regiment czetteritz dragoons poor czetteritz himself with his lost manuscript is captive since february last the rearguard with the third column always the dragoon regiment holstein as head and the ditto finkenstein to close the columnduring every march however there are to be of the second column 2 battalions joined with column third so that the third column consists of 10 battalions the second of 6 while on march  ahead of each column go three pontoon wagons and daily are 50 workpeople allowed them who are immediately to lay bridge where it is necessary the rearguard of each column takes up these bridges again brings them on and returns them to the head of the column when the army has got to camp in the second column are to be 500 wagons and also in the third 500 so shared that each battalion gets an equal number the battalions in tempelhof iv 125 126 the entire piece this may serve as specimen  the march proceeded through the old country a little to left of the track in june past roder water pulsnitz water kamenz neighborhood bautzen neighborhoodbunzlau on silesian ground daun at bischofswerda had foreseen this march and by his light people had spoiled the road all he could broken all the bridges halffelled the woods to render them impassable daun the instant he heard of the actual march rose from bischofswerda forward forward always to be ahead of it however rapid lacy hanging on the rear of it willing to give trouble with his pandour harpies but studious above all that it should not whirl round anywhere and get upon his lacys own throat one of the strangest marches ever seen an onlooker who had observed the march of these different armies says friedrich would have thought that they all belonged to one leader feldmarschall dauns he would have taken for the vanguard the kings for the main army and general lacys for the rearguard oeuvres de frederic v 56 tempelhof says it is given only to a friedrich to march on those terms between two hostile armies his equals in strength and a third loudons in striegau country waiting ahead  the march passed without accident of moment had not from lacy or daun any accident whatever on the second day an aidedecamp of dauns was picked up with letters from lacy back of the cards visible to friedrich onceit is the third day of the march august 6th village of rothwasser to be quarter for the nighton coming toward neisse river some careless officer trusting to peasants instead of examining for himself and building a bridge drove his artillerywagons into the socalled ford of neisse which nearly swallowed the foremost of them in quicksands nearly but not completely and caused a loss of five or six hours to that second column so that darkness came on column second in the woody intricacies and several hundreds of the deserter kind took the opportunity of disappearing altogether an unlucky evidently too languid officer though friedrich did not annihilate the poor fellow perhaps did not rebuke him at all but merely marked it in elucidation of his qualities for time coming this miserable village of rothwasser headquarters after the dangerous fording of neisse says mitchell stands in the middle of a wood almost as wild and impenetrable as those in north america there was hardly ground enough cleared about it for the encampment of the troops mitchell ii 190 tempelhof iv 131 thursday august 7th friedrichtraversing the whole country but more direct by konigsbruck and kamenz this timeis at bunzlau altogether bunzlau on the bober the silesian bunzlau not the bohemian or any of the others it is some 30 miles west of liegnitz which again lies some 40 northwest of schweidnitz and the strong places friedrich has now done 100 miles of excellent marching and he has still a good spell more to dodragging 2000 heavy wagons with him and across such impediments within and without readers that care to study him especially for the next few days will find it worth their while  tempelhof gives as usual a most clear account minute to a degree which supplemented by mitchell and a reimann map enables us as it were to accompany and to witness with our eyes hitherto a march toilsome in the extreme in spite of everything done to help it starting at 3 or at 2 in the morning resting to breakfast in some shady place while the sun is high frugally cooking under the shady woodsburschen abzukochen here as the

dashings about which lie ahead it will be by extremely nimble use of all the limbs we havehands as well as feetif any good is to come of us now friedrich is aware that daun already holds striegau as an outpost loudon thereabouts unknown to friedrich these several days and that daun personally is at schmottseifen in our own old camp there twenty or thirty miles to south of us and has his lacy to leftward of him partly even to rearward rather in advance of us both of themif we were for landshut which we are not be swift enough may not we cut through to jauer and get ahead of daun counts friedrich to jauer southeast of us from bunzlau here is 40 miles and to jauer it is above 30 east for daun possible to be there before daun jauer ours thence to the heights of striegau and hohenfriedberg country within wind of schweidnitz of breslau magazines union with prince henri all secure thereby so reckons the sanguine friedrich unaware that loudon with his corps of 35000 has been

russians who are also perhaps building bridges by way of a supplementary or fourth head  august 9th bunzlau to goldberg friedrich with his three columns and perfect arrangements makes a long march from bunzlau at 3 in the morning and at 5 afternoon arrives in sight of the katzbach valley with the little town of goldberg some miles to right katzbach river is here and jauer for tomorrow still fifteen miles ahead but on reconnoitring here all is locked and bolted lacy strong on the hills of goldberg daun visible across the katzbach daun and behind him loudon inexpugnably posted jauer an impossibility we have bread only for eight days our magazines are at schweidnitz and breslau what is to be done get through one way or other we needs must friedrich encamps for the night expecting an attack if not attacked he will make for liegnitz leftward cross the katzbach there or farther down at parchwitzparchwitz neumarkt leuthen we have been in that country before nowcourage  august 10th11th to liegnitz and back at 5 am sunday august 10th friedrich nothing of attack having come got on march again down his own left bank of the katzbach straight for liegnitz unopposed altogether not even a pandour having attacked him overnight but no sooner is he under way than daun too rises daun loudon close by on the other side of katzbach and keep step with us on our right lacys light people hovering on our rearthree truculent fellows in buckram fancy the feelings of the wayworn solitary fourth whom they are gloomily dogging in this way the solitary fourth does his fifteen miles to liegnitz unmolested by them encamps on the heights which look down on liegnitz over the south finds however that the loudondaun people have likewise been diligent that they now lie stretched out on their right bank three or four miles upstream or to rearward and what is far worse seven miles downwards or ahead that in fact they are a march nearer parchwitz than heand that there is again no possibility perhaps by jauer then still out of this and at lowest into some vicinity of bread it does behoove us to be at 11 that night friedrich gets on march again returns the way he came and  august 11th at daybreak is back to his old ground nothing now to oppose him but lacy who is gone across from goldberg to linger as rear of the daunloudon march friedrich steps across on lacy thirsting to have a stroke at lacy who vanishes fast enough leaving the ground clear could but our baggage have come as fast as we but our baggage quintus guarding and urging has to groan on for five hours yet and without it there is no stirring five mortal hoursby which time daun lacy loudon are all up again between us and jauer between us and everything helpfuland friedrich has to encamp in seichaua very poor village in the mountains writes mitchell who was painfully present there surrounded on all sides by heights on several of which in the evening the austrians took camp separated from us by a deep ravine only mitchell ii 194  outlooks are growing very questionable to mitchell and everybody only four days provisions in reality six whisper the prussian generals gloomily to mitchell and to one another shall we have to make for glogau then and leave breslau to its fate or perhaps it will be a second maxen to his majesty and us who was so indignant with poor finck my friends no a maxen like fincks it will never be a very different maxen if any but we hope better things  friedrichs situation grasped in the threelipped pincers in this manner is conceivable to readers soltikof on the other side of oder as supplementary or fourth lip is very impatient with these three why all this dodging and fidgeting to and fro you are above three to one of your enemy why dont you close on him at once if you mean it at all the end is he will be across oder and it is i that shall have the brunt to bear henri and he will enclose me between two fires and in fact henri as we know though friedrich does not or only half does has gone across oder to watch soltikof and guard breslau from any attempts of hiswhich are far from his thoughts at this momenta soltikof fuming violently at the thought of such cunctations and of being made catspaw again know however that i understand you violently fumes soltikof and that i wont i fall back into the trebnitz bogcountry on my own right bank here and look out for my own safetypatience your noble excellenz answer they always oh patience yet a little only yesterday sunday 10th the day after his arrival in this region we had decided to attack and crush him sunday very early tempelhof iv 137 148150 but he skipped away to liegnitz oh be patient yet a day or two he skips about at such a rate montalembert has to be suasive as the muses and the sirens soltikof gloomily consents to another day or two and even such his anxiety lest this swift king skip over upon him pushes out a considerable russian division 24000 ultimately under czernichef towards the kings side of things towards auras on oder namelythere to watch for oneself these interesting royal movements or even to join with loudon out there if that seem the safer course against them of czernichef at auras we shall hear farther onwere these royal movements once got completed a little  morning of august 12th friedrich has in his bad lodging at seichau laid a new plan of route towards schweidnitz let it be round by pombsen and the southeast by the hillroads make a sweep flankward of the enemyand has people out reconnoitring the hillroads hears however about 8 oclock that austrians in strength are coming between us and goldberg intending to enclose us in this bad pot of a seichau no crossing of the katzbach or other retreat to be left us at all friedrich strikes his tents ranks himself is speedily in readiness for dispute of such extremitysends out new patrols however to ascertain austrians in strength there are not on the side indicatedwhereupon he draws in again but on the other hand the hillroads are reported absolutely impassable for baggage pombsen an impossibility as the other places have been so friedrich sits down again in seichau to consider does not stir all day to mitchells horror who with great labor burns all the legationary ciphers and papers impossible to save the baggage if we be attacked in this hollow pot of a camp and feels much relieved on finishing mitchell ii 144 tempelhof iv 144  towards sunset general bulow with the second line second column of march is sent out goldbergway to take hold of the passage of the katzbach and at 8 that night we all march recrossing there about 1 in the morning thence down our left bank to liegnitz for the second timesixteen hours of it in all or till noon of the 13th mitchell had been put with the cavalry part and cannot but observe to your lordship what a chief comfort it was in this long dangerous and painful march to have burnt ones ciphers and dread secrets quite out of the way  and thus wednesday august 13th about noon we are in our old camp headquarter in the southern suburb of liegnitz a wretched little tavern which they still show there on mythical terms main part of the camp i should think is on that range of heights which reaches two miles southward and is now called siegesberg victory hill from a modern monument built on it after nearly 100 years here friedrich stays one daymore exactly 30 hoursand his shifting next time is extremely memorable     battle in the neighborhood of liegnitz does ensue friday morning 15th august 1760  daun lacy and loudon the threelipped pincers have of course followed and are again agape for friedrich all in scientific postures daun in the jauer region seven or eight miles south lacy about goldberg as far to southwest loudon between jeschkendorf and koischwitz northeastward somewhat closer on friedrich with the katzbach intervening that czernichef with an additional 24000 to rear of loudon is actually crossing oder at auras with an eye to junction friedrich does not hear till tomorrow tempelhof iv 148151 mitchell ii 197  the scene is rather pretty if one admired scenes liegnitz a square handsome brickbuilt town of old standing in good repair population then say 7000 with fine old castellated edifices and aspects pleasant meeting in level circumstances of the katzbach valley with the schwartzwasser blackwater ditto which forms the north rim of liegnitz pleasant mixture of green poplars and brick towersas seen from that victory hill more likely to be immediateruin hill where the king now is beyond liegnitz and the schwartzwasser northwestward right opposite to the kings rise other heights called of pfaffendorf which guard the two streams after their uniting kloster wahlstatt a famed place lies visible to southeast few miles off readers recollect one blucher prince of wahlstatt so named from one of his antinapoleon victories gained there wahlstatt was the scene of an older fight almost six centuries older april 9th 1241 kohler reichshistoriea then prince of liegnitz versus hideous tartar multitudes who rather beat him and has been a cloister wahlstatt ever since till thursday 14th about 8 in the evening friedrich continued in his camp of liegnitz we are now within reach of a notable passage of war  friedrichs camp extends from the village of schimmelwitz fronting the katzbach for about two miles northeastward to his headquarter in liegnitz suburb daun is on his right and rearward now come within four or five miles loudon to his left and frontward four or five the katzbach separating friedrich and him lacy lies from goldberg northeastward to within perhaps a like distance rearward that is the position on thursday 14th provisions being all but run out and three armies 90000 not to count czernichef and his 24000 as a fourth watching round our 30000 within a few miles there is no staying here beyond this day if even this day it be allowed us this day friedrich had to draw out and stand to arms for some hours while the austrians appeared extensively on the heights about apparently intending an attack till it proved to be nothing only an elaborate reconnoitring by daun and we returned to our tents again  friedrich understands well enough that daun with the facts now before him will gradually form his plan and also from the lie of matters what his plan will be many are the times daun has elaborately reconnoitred elaborately laid his plan but found on coming to execute that his friedrich was off in the interim and the plan gone to air friedrich has about 2000 wagons to drag with him in these swift marches glogau magazine his one resource should breslau and schweidnitz prove unattainable is fortyfive long miles northwestward let us lean upon glogau withal thinks friedrich and let us be out of this straightway march tonight towards parchwitz which is towards glogau too army rest till daybreak on the heights of pfaffendorf yonder to examine to wait its luck let the empty mealwagons jingle on to glogau load themselves there and jingle back to us in parchwitz neighborhood should parchwitz not have proved impossible to our manoeuvringslet us hope it may notdaun and the austrians having ceased reconnoitring and gone home friedrich rides with his generals through liegnitz across the schwartzwasser to the pfaffendorf heights here messieurs is our first haltingplace to be here we shall halt till daybreak while the mealwagons jingle on and explains to them orally where each is to take post and how to behave which done he too returns home no doubt a wearied individual and at 4 of the afternoon lies down to try for an hour or two of sleep while all hands are busy packing according to the orders given  it is a fact recorded by friedrich himself and by many other people that at this interesting juncture there appeared at the kings gate king hardly yet asleep a staggering austrian officer irish by nation who had suddenly found good to desert the austrian service for the prussiansorrow on them a pack ofwhat shall i sayirish gentleman bursting with intelligence of some kind but evidently deep in liquor withal impossible the king is asleep said the adjutant on duty but produced only louder insistence from the drunk irish gentleman as much as all your heads are worth the kings own safety and not a moment to lose what is to be done they awaken the king the man is drunk but dreadfully in earnest your majesty give him quantities of weak tea tempelhof calls it tea but friedrich merely warm water then examine him and report if it is anything something it was your majesty to be attacked for certain this night what his majesty already guessedsomething most likely little but nobody to this day knows visible only that his majesty before sunset rode out reconnoitring with this questionable irish gentleman now in a very flaccid state and altered nothing whatever in prior arrangementsand that the flaccid irish gentleman staggers out of sight into dusk into rest and darkness after this one appearance on the stage of history oeuvres de frederic v 63 tempelhof iv 154  from about 8 in the evening friedrichs people got on march in their several columns and fared punctually on one column through the streets of liegnitz others to left and to right of that to left mainly as remoter from the austrians and their listening outposts from beyond the katzbach riverwhere the campfires are burning extremely distinct tonight the prussian campfires they too are all burning uncommonly vivid country people employed to feed them and a few hussar sentries and drummers to make the customary sounds for dauns instruction till a certain hour friedrichs people are clearing the north suburb of liegnitz crossing the schwartzwasser artillery and heavy wagons all go by the stonebridge at topferberg potterhill there the lighter people by a few pontoons farther down that stream in the pfaffendorf vicinity about one in the morning all even the right wing from schimmelwitz are safely across  schwartzwasser a river of many tails boggy most of them sohnelle or swift deichsel hardly an exception gathering itself from the southward for

course is in the form of an irregular horseshoe high ground to its northern side liegnitz and hollows to its southern till in an angular way it do join katzbach and go with that northward for oder the rest of its course on the brow of these horseshoe heightswhich run parallel to schwartzwasser one part of them and nearly parallel to katzbach another though above a mile distant these latter from itfriedrich plants himself in order of battle slightly altering some points of the afternoons program and correcting his generals front rather so and so see where their fires are yonder dauns fires loudons fires vividly visible bothand singular to say there is nothing yonder either but a few sentries and deceptive drums all empty yonder too even as our own camp is all gone forth even as we are we resting here and our mealwagons jingling on glogau way  excellency mitchell under horseescort among the lighter baggage is on kuchelberg heath in scrubby country but well north behind friedrichs centre has had a dreadful march one comfort only that his ciphers are all burnt the rest of us lie down on the grassamong others young herr von archenholtz ensign or lieutenant in regiment forcade who testifies that it is one of the beautifulest nights the lamps of heaven shining down in an uncommonly tranquil manner and that almost nobody slept the soldierranks all lay horizontal musket under arm

is in the horseshoe shape or parabolic straighter than horseshoe fronting the waters ziethen commands in that smaller schwartzwasser part of the line friedrich in the katzbach part which is more in risk and now things being moderately in order friedrich has himself sat downi think towards the middle or convex part of his linesby a watchfire he has found there and wrapt in his cloak his many thoughts melting into haze has sunk ito a kind of sleep seated on a drum some say half asleep by the watchfire time halfpast 2when a hussar major who has been out by the bienowitz the pohlschildern way northward reconnoitring comes dashing up full speed the king where is the king what is it then answers the king for himself your majesty the enemy in force from bienowitz from pohlschildern coming on our left wing yonder has flung back all my vedettes is within 500 yards by this time  friedrich springs to horse has already an order speeding forth general schenkendorf and his battalion their cannon to the crown of the wolfsberg on our left yonder swift how excellent that every battalion as by order that we read has its own share of the heavy cannon always at hand ejaculate the military critics schenkendorf being nimble was able to astonish the enemy with volumes of caseshot from the wolfsberg which were very deadly at that close distance other arrangements too minute for recital here are rapidly done and our left wing is in condition to receive its early visitorsloudon or whoever they may be it is still dubious to the historybooks whether friedrich was in clear expectation of loudon here though of course he would now guess it was loudon but there is no doubt loudon had not the least expectation of friedrich and his surprise must have been intense when instead of vacant darkness and some chance of prussian baggage which he had heard of prussian musketries and caseshot opened on him  loudon had as per order quitted his camp at jeschkendorf about the time friedrich did his at schimmelwitz and leaving the lights all burning had set forward on his errand which was also identical with friedrichs to seize the heights of pfaffendorf and be ready there when day broke scouts having informed him that the prussian baggage was certainly gone through to topferbergmore his scouts did not know nor could loudon guesswe will snatch that baggage thought loudon and with such view has been speeding all he could no vanguard ahead lest he alarm the baggage escort loudon in person with the infantry of the reserve striding on ahead to devour any baggageescort there may be friedrichs reconnoitring hussar parties had confirmed this belief yes yes thought loudon and now suddenly instead of baggage to capture here out of the vacant darkness is friedrich in person on the brow of the heights where we intended to form  loudons behavior on being hurled back with his reserve in this manner everybody says was magnificent judging at once what the business was and that retreat would be impossible without ruin he hastened instantly to form himself on such ground as he hadhighly unfavorable ground uphill in part and room in it only for five battalions 5000 of frontand came on again with a great deal of impetuosity and good skill again and ever again three times in all had partial successes edged always to the right to get the flank of friedrich but could not friedrich edging conformably from his righthand or northeast part loudon poured in once and again very furious charges of cavalry on every repulse drew out new battalions from his left and centre and again stormed forward but found it always impossible had his subordinates all been loudons it is said there was once a fine chance for him by this edging always to the northeastward on his part and friedrichs there had at last a considerable gap in friedrichs line established itselfnot only ziethens line and friedrichs line now fairly fallen asunder but at the village of panten in friedrichs own line a gap where anybody might get in one of the austrian columns was just entering panten when the fight began in panten that column has stood cogitative ever since well to left of loudon and his struggles but does not till the eleventh hour resolve to push through at the eleventh hourand lo in the nick of time mollendorf our leuthenandhochkirch friend got his eye on it rushed up with infantry and cavalry set panten on fire and blocked out that possibility and the too cogitative column  loudon had no other real chance his furious horsecharges and attempts were met everywhere by corresponding counterfury bernburg poor regiment bernburg see what a figure it is making left almost alone at one time among those horsecharges spending its blood like water bayonetcharging platooning as never before and on the whole stemming invincibly that horsetorrentnot unseen by majesty it may be hoped who is here where the hottest pinch is on the third repulse which was worse than any before loudon found he had enough and tried it no farther rolled over the katzbach better or worse prussians catching 6000 of him but not following farther threw up a tine battery at bienowitz which sheltered his retreat from horseand went his ways sorely but not dishonorably beaten after an hour and half of uncommonly stiff fighting which had been very murderous to loudon loss of 10000 to him 4000 killed and wounded prisoners 6000 82 cannon 28 flags and other items the prussian loss being 1800 in whole tempelhof iv 159 by 5 oclock the battle this loudon part of it was quite over loudon 35000 wrecking himself against friedrichs left wing say half of his army some 15000 in such conclusive manner friedrichs left wing alone has been engaged hitherto and now it will be ziethens turn if daun and lacy still come on  by 11 last night dauns pandours creeping stealthily on across the katzbach about schimmelwitz had discerned with amazement that friedrichs camp appeared to consist only of watchfires and had shot off their speediest rider to daun accordingly but it was one in the morning before daun busy marching and marshalling to be ready at the katzbach by daylight heard of this strange news which probably he could not entirely believe till seen with his own eyes what a spectacle ones beautiful plan exploded into mere imbroglio of distraction become one knows not what dauns watchfires too had all been left burning universal stratagem on both sides going on producingtragically for some of usa tragedy of errors or the mistakes of a night daun sallied out again in his collapsed upset condition as soon as possible pushed on in the track of friedrich warning lacy to push on daun though within five miles all the while had heard nothing of the furious fight and cannonade southwest wind having risen so daun said and is believed by candid personsnot by the angry vienna people who counted it impossible nonsense you were not deaf but you loitered and haggled in your usual way perhaps not sorry that the brilliant loudon should get a rebuff  emerging out of liegnitz daun did see to northeastward a vast pillar or mass of smoke silently mounting but could do nothing with it cannonsmoke no doubt but fallen entirely silent and not wending hitherward at all poor loudon alas must have got beaten upon which daun really did try at least upon ziethen but could do nothing poured cavalry across the stonebridge at the topferberg who drove in ziethens picket there but were torn to pieces by ziethens cannon ziethen across the schwartzwasser is alert enough how form in order of battle here with ziethens batteries shearing your columns longitudinally as they march up daun recognizes the impossibility wends back through liegnitz to his camp again the way he had come tidehour missed again ebb going uncommonly rapid lacy had been about waldau to try farther up the schwartzwasser on ziethens right but the schwartzwasser proved amazingly boggy not accessible on any point to heavy peopleowing to bogs on the bank with perhaps poor prospect on the other side too  and in fact nothing of lacy more than of daun could manage to get across nothing except two poor hussar regiments who winding up far to the left attempted a snatch on the baggage about hummelnhummeln or kuchel of the scrubs and gave a new alarm to mitchell the last of several during this horrid night who has sat painfully blocked in his carriage with such a devils tumult going on to eastward and no sight share or knowledge to be had of it repeated hussar attacks there were on the baggage here loudons hussars also trying but mitchells captain was miraculously equal to the occasion and had beaten them all off mitchell by magnanimous choice of his own has been in many fights by the side of friedrich but this is the last he will ever be in or nearthis miraculous one of liegnitz 3 to 430 am friday august 15th 1760  never did such a luck befall friedrich before or after he was clinging on the edge of slippery abysses his path hardly a footsbreadth mere enemies and avalanches hanging round on every side ruin likelier at no moment of his lifeand here is precisely the quasimiracle which was needed to save him partly by accident too the best of management crowned by the luckiest of accidents tempelhof iv 151171 archenholtz ubi supra ho bericht von der schlacht so am 15 august 1760 bey liegnitz vorgefallen seyfarth beylagen ii 696703 c c  friedrich rested four hours on the battlefieldif that could be called rest which was a new kind of diligence highly wonderful diligence of gathering up accurately the results of the battle packing them into portable shape and marching off with them in ones pocket so to speak majorgeneral saldern had charge of this a man of many talents and did it consummately the wounded austrian as well as prussian are placed in the empty mealwagons the more slightly wounded are set on horseback double in possible cases only the dead are left lying 100 or more mealwagons are left their teams needed for drawing our 82 new cannonthe wagons we split up no austrians to have them usable only as firewood for the poor countryfolk the 4 or

friedrich with his 6000 prisoners new cannonteams sickwagon teams trophies properties is afoot again one of the succinctest of kings  i should have mentioned the joy of poor regiment bernburg which rather affected me loudon gone the miracle of battle done and this miraculous packing going onfriedrich riding about among his people passed along the front of bernburg the eye of him perhaps intimating i saw you bursche but no word coming from him the bernburg officers tragically tressless in their hats stand also silent grim as blackened stones all bernburg black with gunpowder in us also is no word unless our actions perhaps speak but a certain sergeant fugleman or chief corporal stept out saluting reverentially regiment bernburg ihro majestat hm well you did handsomely yes you

natural commanding officer are not we as good as thou are not all men equal not a whit of it you mutinous blockheads very far from it indeed  this was the breaking of friedrichs imprisonment in the deadly rocklabyrinths this success at liegnitz delivered him into free field once more for twentyfour hours more indeed the chance was still full of anxiety to him for twentyfour hours daun could he have been rapid still had the possibilities in handbut only dauns antagonist was usually rapid about 9 in the morning all roadready this latter gentleman gave three salvos as joyfire on the field of liegnitz and in the above succinct shapeleaving ziethen to come on with the prisoners the sickwagons and captured cannon in the afternoonmarched rapidly away for parchwitz with our best speed parchwitz is the road to breslau also to glogauto breslau if it be humanly possible friedrich has but two days bread left on the breslau road at auras there is czernichef with 24000 there are or there may be the loudon remnants rallied again the lacy corps untouched all dauns force had daun made any despatch at all which daun seldom did a man slow to resolve and seeking his luck in leisure  all judges say daun ought now to have marched on this enterprise of still intercepting friedrich without loss of a moment but he calculated friedrich would probably spend the day in tedeuming on the field as is the manner of some and that by tomorrow things would be clearer to ones own mind daun was in no haste gave no ordersdid not so much as send czernichef a letter czernichef got one however friedrich sent him one that is to say sent him one to intercept friedrich namely writes a note addressed to his brother henri austrians totally beaten this day now for the russians dear brother and swift do what we have agreed on oeuvres de frederic v 67 friedrich hands this to a peasant with instructions to let himself be taken by the russians and give it up to save his life czernichef it is thought got this letter and perhaps rumor itself and the delays of daun would at any rate have sent him across across he at once went with his 24000 and burnt his bridge a vanished czernichefthough friedrich is not yet sure of it and as for the wandering austrian divisions the loudons lacys all is dark to him  so that at parchwitz next morning august 16th the question to glogau to breslau must have been a kind of sphinxenigma to friedrich dark as that and in case of error fatal after some brief paroxysm of consideration friedrichs reading was to breslau then and for hours as the march went on he was noticed riding much about his anxieties visibly great till at neumarkt not far from the field of leuthen getting on the heights theretowards noon i will guesswhat a sight before this he had come upon austrian outparties becks or somebodys who did not wait his attack he saw at one point the whole austrian army on march the tops of its columns visible among the knolls three miles off impossible to say whitherward and fared on all the faster i suppose such a bet dependingand in fine galloped to the heights of neumarkt for a view dare we believe it not an austrian there and might be for the moment the gladdest of kings secure now of breslau of junction with henri fairly winner of the betand can at last pause and take breath very needful to his poor army if not to himself after such a mortal spasm of sixteen days daun had taken the liegnitz accident without remark usually a stoical man especially in other peoples misfortunes but could not conceal his painful astonishment on this new occasionastonishment at unjust fortune or at his own sluggardly cunctations is not said  next day august 17th friedrich encamps at hermannsdorf headquarter the schloss of hermannsdorf within seven miles of breslau continues a fortnight there resting his wearied people himself not resting much watching the dismal miscellany of entanglements that yet remain how these will settle into groupsespecially what daun and his soltikof will decide on in about a fortnight dauns decision did become visible soltikofs not in a fortnight nor ever clearly at all unless it were to keep a whole skin and gradually edge home to his victuals as essentially it was and continued to be creating endless negotiations and futile overtures and messagings from daun to his barbarous friend endless suasions and troubles from poor montalembertof which it would weary every reader to hear mention except of the result only  friedrich for his own part is little elated with these bits of successes at liegnitz or since and does not deceive himself as to the difficulties almost the impossibilities that still lie ahead in answer to dargens who has written at midnight starting out of bed the instant the news came in zealous congratulation on liegnitz here is a letter of friedrichs well worth readingthough it has been oftener read than almost any other of his a letter which dargens never saw in the original form which was captured by the austrians or cossacks see oeuvres de frederic xix 198 dargens himself 19th october following and ib 191 n rodenbeck ii 31 36mention of it in voltaire

times my dear marquis the affair of the 15th would have settled the campaign at present it is but a scratch there will be needed a great battle to decide our fate such by all appearance we shall soon have and then you may rejoice if the event is favorable to us thank you meanwhile for all your sympathy it has cost a deal of scheming striving and much address to bring matters to this point dont speak to me of dangers the last action costs me only a coat torn useless only one skirt left by some rebounding cannonball and a horse shot under me that is not paying dear for a victory  in my life i was never in so bad a posture as in this campaign believe me miracles are still needed if i am to overcome all the difficulties which i still see ahead and one is growing weak withal herculean labors to accomplish at an age when my powers are forsaking me my weaknesses increasing and to speak candidly even hope the one comfort of the unhappy begins to be wanting you are not enough acquainted with the posture of things to know all the dangers that threaten the state i know them and conceal them i keep all the fears to myself and communicate to the public only the hopes and the trifle of good news i may now and then have if the stroke i am meditating succeed stroke on dauns antischweidnitz strategies of which anon then my dear marquis it will be time to expand ones joy but till then let us not flatter ourselves lest some unexpected bit of bad news depress us too much  i live here schloss of hermannsdorf a seven miles west of breslau like a military monk of la trappe endless businesses and these done a little consolation from my books i know not if i shall outlive this war but should it so happen i am firmly resolved to pass the remainder of my life in solitude in the bosom of philosophy and friendship when the roads are surer perhaps you will write me oftener i know not where our winterquarters this time are to be my house in breslau is burnt down in the bombardment loudons three weeks ago our enemies grudge us everything even daylight and air to breathe some nook however they must leave us and if it be a safe one it will be a true pleasure to have you again with me  well my dear marquis what has become of the peace with france english peace your nation you see is blinder than you thought those fools will lose their canada and pondicherry to please the queen of hungary and the czarina heaven grant prince ferdinand may pay them for their zeal and it will be the innocent that suffer the poor officers and soldiers not the choiseuls and but here is business

posts principal post of them the durrenberg dryhill therein a most extensive manner filling the whole region with vague artillerythunder and endless charges here there of foot and horse which all issued in zero and minus quantities hulsen standing beautifully to his work and hussar kleist especially at one point cutting in with masterly execution which proved general overthrow to the reichs project and left hulsen master of the field and of his durrenberg plus 1217 prisoners and one prince among them and one cannon a hulsen who has actually given a kind of beating to the reichsfolk and austrians though they were 30000 to his 10000 and had counted on making a new maxen of it archenholts ii 114 bericht von der om 20 august 1780 bey strehla vorgefallonen action seyfarth beylagen ii

sunshine to the royal mind dark enough otherwise had friedrich got done here right fast would he fly to the relief of hulsen and recovery of saxony hope in good moments says hulsen will be able to hold out till then fear answers no he cannot unless you get done here extremely soonthe russian event full of painful anxiety to friedrich was a new siege of colberg that is the sad fact which since the middle of august has been becoming visibly certain  second siege of colberg august 26th under siege again that poor place and this time the russians seem to have made a vow that take it they will

the gauls and since his time by nobodytill friedrich his studious scholar and admirer revived it against another enemy it is of excellent efficacy adds tempelhof it disheartens your adversary and especially his common people and has the reverse effect on your own confuses him in endless apprehensions and details of selfdefence so that he can form no plan of his own and his overpowering resources become useless to him excellent efficacyonly you must be equal to doing it not unequal which might be very fatal to you  for about five weeks friedrich eminently practising this style has a most complex multifarious briarean wrestle with big daun and his lacyloudon satellites who have a troublesome time running hither thither under danger of slaps and finding nowhere an available mistake made the scene is that intricate hillcountry between schweidnitz and glatz kind of glacis from schweidnitz to the glatz mountains daun generally speaking has his back on glatz friedrich on schweidnitz and we hear of encampings at kunzendorf at bunzelwitz at burkersdorfplaces which will be more famous in a coming year daun makes no complaint of his lacyloudon or other satellite people who are diligently circumambient all of them as bidden but are unable like daun himself to do the least good and have perpetually daun and they a bad life of it beside this neighbor the outer world especially the vienna outer world is naturally a little surprised how is this feldmarschall daun can you do absolutely nothing with him then but sit pinned in the hills eating sour herbs  in the russians appears no help soltikof on glogau we know what that amounts to soltikof is evidently intending home and nothing else to all austrian proposalsand they have been manifold as poor montalembert knows too wellthe answer of soltikof was and is above 90000 of you circling about helping one another to do nothing happy were you not a doubt of it could we be wiled across to you to get worried in your stead daun begins to be extremely illoff provisions scarce are far away in bohemia and the roads daily more insecure friedrich aiming evidently to get command of them altogether think of such an issue to our once flourishing campaign 1760 daun is vigilance itself against such fatality and will do anything except risk a fight here however is the fatal posture since september 18th daun sees himself considerably cut off from glatz his provisionroad more and more insecureand for fourteen days onward the king and he have got into a deadlock and sit looking into one anothers faces daun in a more and more distressed mood his provender becoming so uncertain and the winter season drawing nigh the sentries are in mutual view each camp could cannonade the other but what good were it by a tacit understanding they dont the sentries outposts and vedettes forbear musketry on the contrary exchange tobaccoes sometimes and have a snatch of conversation daun is growing more and more unhappy to which of the gods if not to soltikof again can he apply  friedrich himself successful so far is abundantly dissatisfied with such a kind of successand indeed seems to be less thankful to his stars than in present circumstances he ought profoundly wearied we find him worn down into utter disgust in the small war of posts here we still are nose to nose exclaims he see letters to henri both of us

behoove him to continue here and try to dislodge daun or help hunger to dislodge him which will be the remedy for berlin and all things else there are news from colberg of welcome tenor could daun be sent packing soltikof it is probable will not be in much alacrity for berlinseptember 18th at dittmannsdorf was the first day of dauns deadlock ever since he has had to sit more and more hampered pinned to the hills eating sour herbs nothing but hunger ahead and a retreat battle we will not dream of likely to be very ruinous with a friedrich sticking to the wings of it here is the note on colberg  september 18th colherg siege raised the same september 18th what a day at colberg too it is the twentyfourth day of the continual bombardment there colberg is black ashes most of its houses ruins not a house in it uninjured but heyde and his poor garrison busy day and night walk about in it as if fireproof with a great deal of battle still left in them the king i know not whether heyde is aware has contrived something of relief general werner comingthe fittest of men if there be possibility when see september 18th uneasy motion in the russian intrenchments for the russians too are

relief o god the merciful  werner with 5000 was detached from glogau september 5th from goltzs small corps there has come as on wings 200 miles in thirteen days and attacks now as with wings the astonished russian 15000 who were looking for nothing like himwith wings with claws and with beak and in a highly aquiline manner fierce swift skilful storms these intrenched russians straightway scatters them to piecesand next day is in colberg the siege raising itself with great precipitation leaving all its artilleries and furnitures rushing on shipboard all of it that can getthe very

gold medalswhat an honor i do not hear that heyde got any other reward or that he needed any a beautiful old hero voiceless in history though very visible in that remote sphere if you care to look  that is the news from colberg comfortable to friedrich not likely to inspire soltikof with new alacrity in behalf of daun it remains to us only to add that friedrich with a view to quicken daun shot out september 24th after nightfall and with due mystery a detachment towards neisse4000 or so who call themselves 15000 and affect to be for mahren ultimately for mahren and my bit of daily bread daun may well think and did for some time think or partly did pushed off one small detachment really thither to look after mahren and september 29th pushed off another bigger lacy namely with 15000 pretending to be thitherbut who the instant they were out of friedrichs sight have whirled at a rapid pace quite into the opposite direction as will shortly be seen daun has now other irons in the fire daun ever since this fatal deadlock in the hills has been shrieking hoarsely to the russians day and night who at last take pity on himor find something feasible in his proposals     the russians

palisades and of effective garrison 1200 men  and feasible in a sort this thing did prove indisputably delivering daun from strangulation in the silesian mountains filling the gazetteer mind with loud emotion of an empty nature and very much affecting many poor people in berlin and neighborhood making a big chapter in berlin local history though compressible to small bulk for strangers who have no specific sympathies in that locality  friday 3d october 1760 tottleben with his hasty vanguard of 3000 preceded by hastier rumor comes circling round berlin environs takes post at the halle gate west side of the city summons rochow the same old commandant of haddicks timerequires instant admittance ransom of four million thalers and other impossible things berlin has been putting itself in some posture repairing its palisades throwing up bits of redoubts in front of the gates and though sounding with alarms and uncertainties shows a fine spirit of readiness for the emergency rochow is still

went all to magdeburg again on the kunersdorf disaster last year and are safe from such insults the spirit of the population it appears even of the rich classes some of whom are very rich is extraordinary besides rochow moreover there are by accident certain generals in berlin seidlitz and two others recovering from their kunersdorf hurts who step into the breach with heart admirably willing if with limbs still lame then there is old fieldmarshal lehwald antirussian at gross jagersdorf but dismissed as too old who is official governor of berlin who succeeded poor keith in that honorable office all these were strong for defenceand do not now grudge great men as they are to take each his gate of berlin his small redoubt thrown up there and pass the night and the day in doing

their seidlitzes and the population zealously cooperating especially quenching all fires that rose what greatly contributed withal was the arrival of prince eugen overnight eugen of wurtemberg cadet

in exactly six days since he first came circling to the halle gate and began bombarding tottleben knowing friedrich knew the value of despatch and they say was privately no enemy to berlin remembering old grateful days here for tottleben has himself been in difficulties indeed was never long out of them during the long stormy life he had not a russian at all though i suppose father of the now russian tottlebens whom one hears of this one was a poor saxon gentleman page once to poor old drunken weissenfels whom for a certain fair souls sake we sigh to remember weissenfels dying tottleben became a soldier of polish majestysacceptable soldier but disagreed with bruhl for which nobody will like him worse disagreed with bruhl went into the dutch service may have been in fontenoy for what i know was there till aixlachapelle till after aixlachapelle kindly treated and promoted in the dutch army but with outlooks i can fancy rather dull outlooks probably dull in such an elementwhen being a handsome fellow in epaulettes majorgeneral in fact though poor he diligently endeavoring caught the eye of a dutch westindian heiress soft creature with no end of money whom he privately wedded and ran away with to the horror of her appointed dutch lover and friends who prosecuted the poor majorgeneral with the utmost rigor not of law only and were like to be the ruin of his fair westindian and him when friedrich about 1754 as i guess gave him shelter in berlin finding no insupportable objection in what the man had done the rather as his heiress and he were rich tottleben gained general favor in berlin society wished in 1756 to take service with friedrich on the breaking out of this war a colonel with me yes said friedrich but tottleben had been majorgeneral among the dutch and could not consent to sink had to go among the russians for a majorgeneralcy and there and elsewhere for many years coming had many adventures mostly troublesome which shall not be memorable to us here sketch of tottlebens life in rodenbeck ii 6972  lacy who after hovering about in these vicinities for four days had now actually come up so soon as eugen and hulsen withdrewwas deeply disgusted at the terms of capitulation angry to find that tottleben had concluded without him and in fact flew into open rage at the arrangements tottleben had made for himself and for others no admittance except on order from his excellency said the russian sentry to lacys austrians upon which lacy forced the gate and violently marched in took lodging to his own mind in the friedrichstadt quarter and was fearfully truculent upon person and property during his short stay a scandal to be seen how his croats and loose hordes went openly ravening about bent on mere housebreaking streetrobbery and insolent violence so that tottleben had fairly to fire upon the vagabonds once or twice and force on the unwilling lacy some coercion of them within limits for the three days of his continuanceit was but three days in alllacy was as the evil genius of berlin tottleben and his russians the good their discipline was so excellent all cossacks and loose rabble strictly kept out beyond the walls to bachmann russian commandant the berliners on his departure had gratefully got ready a moneygift of handsome amount by no means answered bachmann your treatment was according to the mildness of our sovereign czarina for myself if i have served you in anything the fact that for three days i have been commandant of the great friedrichs capital is more than a reward to me  tottleben and lacy during those three days of russian and austrian joint dominion had a stormy time of it together destroy the lagerhaus said lacy lagerhaus where they manufacture their soldiers uniforms it is the parent of all clothmanufacturing in prussia set up by friedrich wilhelmnot on freetrade principles the lagerhaus say you i doubt it is now private property screened by our capitulationwhich it proves to be you shall blow up the arsenal said lacy with vehemence and truculence a noble edifice as travellers yet know fancy its fragments flying about among the populous streets plunging through the roofs of palaces and great houses all round lacy was inexorable tottleben had to send a russian party one wishes they had been croats on this sad errand they proceeded to the powdermagazine for explosive material as preliminary they were rash in handling the gunpowder there which blew up in their hands sent itself and all of them into the air and saved the poor arsenal not powder enough now left for our own artillery uses urged tottleben  saxon and austrian parties were in the palaces aboutat potsdam at charlottenburg schonhausen the queens at friedrichsfeld the margraf karls some of whom behaved well some horribly ill in charlottenburg certain saxon bruhldragoons who by their conduct might have been dragoons of attila smashed the furnitures the doors cutting the pictures much maltreating the poor people and what was reckoned still more tragical overset the poor polignac collection of antiques and classicalities not only knocking off noses and arms but beating them small lest reparation by cement should be possible their officers pirna people looking quietly on a scandalous proceeding thought everybody friend or foeespecially thought friedrich whose indignation at this ruin of charlottenburg came out in way of reprisal by and by at potsdam on the other hand prince esterhazy with perhaps hungarians among his people behaved like a very prince received from the castellan an attestation that he had scrupulously respected everything and took as souvenir only one picture of little value prince de ligne who was under him carrying off still more daintily one goosequill immortal by having been a pen of the great friedrichs  tottleben with no feeling other than official tempered by human was in great contrast with lacy and very beneficent to berlin during the three days it lay under the tribula or harrow of war but the tutelary angel of berlin then and afterwards for weeks and months till all scores got settled was the gotzkowsky mentioned above whom we shall see again helpful at leipzig a man worth marking in these tumults if tottleben was the temporal armed king this gotzkowsky was the spiritual king papa or universal father armed only with charities pieties prayers ever shiningly attended by selfsacrifices on gotzkowskys part which averted woes innumerable lagerhaus only one of a long list and which surpassed all belief write the berlin magistracy as if in tears over such heroism truly a prince of merchants this gotzkowsky not for his vast enterprises and the mere 1500 workmen he employs but for the still greater heart that dwells in him had begun as a travelling pedler used to call at reinsberg with female haberdasheries exquisitely chosen gallanterie wares the germans call them for the then princess royal not unnoticed by friedrich who recognized the broad sense solidity and great thoughts of the man of all which friedrich has known far more since then in various branches of prussian commerce improved by gotzkowskys managements a truly notable gotzkowsky became bankrupt at last one is sorry to hear and died in affliction and neglectshort of the humblest wages for so much good work done in the world preuss ii 257

gallop the king is coming after which it was beautiful to see how all things got to the gallop and in a notime berlin was itself again that same evening saturday lacy took the road with extraordinary velocity towards torgau country where the reichsfolk in hulsens absence are supreme and the second evening after was got 60 miles thitherward his joint dominion had been of two days on the morning of

berlin but direct for saxony and itto lubben 50 or 60 miles straight south of berlin and halted there some days to adjust himself for a new sequel these are the things exclaims he sorrowfully to

friedrichs orderings and adjustings dated lubben where his army rested after this news from berlin were manifold and a good deal still of wrecks from the berlin business fell to his share for instance one thing he had at once ordered your bill of a millionandhalf to the russians dont pay it or any part of it when bamberg was ransomed spring gone a yearreich and kaiser did they respect our bill we had on bamberg did not they cancel it and flatly refuse friedrich is positive on the point reprisal our clear remedy but berlin itself was in alarm for perhaps another russian visit berlin and gotzkowsky were humbly positive the other way upon which a visit of gotskowsky to the royal camp merchants bills are a sacred thing your majesty urged gotzkowsky who in his zeal for the matter undertook dangerous visits to the russian quarters and a great deal of trouble peril and expense during the weeks following magnanimous gotzkowsky in mere bribes to the russian officials spent about 6000 pounds of his own for one item but he had at length convinced his majesty that merchants bills were a sacred thing in spite of bamberg and desecrative individualities and that this millionandhalf must be paid friedrich was struck with gotzkowsky and his view of the facts friedrich from his own distressed funds handed to gotzkowsky the necessary millionandhalf commanding only profound silence about it and to gotzkowsky himself a present of 150000 thalers 20000 pounds odd archenholtz ii 146 and so the matter did at last end  it had been a costly business to berlin and to the king and to the

be done nearly in a couple of days with the king after goltz is furnished there are about 30000 eugen and hulsen not idle for their own part wait in those far western or ultrawittenberg regions in and beyond dessau country to join him with their 14000 when they get signal joined with these he will be 44000 he will then cross elbe somewhere probably not where daun and the reich imagine and be in contact with his problem with what a pitch of willingness nobody need be told daun in torgau country has one of the best positions nor is daun a man for getting flurried  the poor reichs army though it once flattered itself with intending to dispute friedrichs passage of the elbe and did make some detachings and manoeuvrings that way on his approach to wittenberg october 22d23dtook a safer view on his actual arrival there on his reseizure of that ruined place and dangerous attitude on the right bank below and above safer view on salutary second thoughtsand fell back leipzigway southward to duben 30 or 40 miles whence rapidly to leipzig itself 30 or 40 more on his actually putting down his bridges over elbe friedrichs crossingplace was schanzhaus in dessau country between roslau and klikau 12 or 15 miles below wittenberg about midway between wittenberg and the inflow of the mulda into elbe he crossed october 26th no enemy within wind at all daun at torgau in his inexpugnable camp reichsfolk at duben making towards leipzig at their best pace and is now wholly between elbe and mulda nothing but mulda and the anhall countries and the halle country now to rear of him  at jonitz next march southward he finds the eugenhulsen people ready we said they had not been idle while waiting signal of which here is one pretty instance eugens brother supreme reigning duke of wurtembergwhom we parted with at fulda last winter on sore terms but who again zealous creature heads his own little army in frenchaustrian service in still more eclipsed circumstances no subsidy at all this year say your august majesties well i must do without a volunteer and shall need only what i can make by forced contributions which of course he is diligent to levy wherever possiblehas latterly taken halle country in hand very busy raising contributions there and eugen hears not without interest that certain regiments or detachments of his pushed out are lying here there superintending that salutary workwithin clutch perhaps of kleist the hussar eugen despatches kleist upon him who pounces with his usual fierce felicity upon these people to such alarm of his poor serenity and poor army that serenity flies off homeward at once and out of these wars altogether where he never had other than the reverse of business to be and where he has played such a farcetragedy for four years back eugen has been heard to speaktheoretically and in excited momentsof running such a fellow through the body were one near him but it is actually eugen in person that sends him home from these wars which may be counted a not unfraternal or unpatriotic procedure being of indisputable benefit to the poor sovereign man himself and to everybody concerned with him  hearing that friedrich was across daun came westward that same day october 26th and planted himself at eilenburg concluding that the reichsfolk would now be in jeopardy first of all which was partly the fact and indeed this daun movement rather accelerated the completion of it without this the reichs army might have lived another day it had quitted duben and gone in all haste for leipzig at 1 in the morning not by eilenburg of which or of dauns arrival there it knows nothingat 1 in the morning of the 27th or in fact so soon as news could reach it at the gallop that friedrich was across and now friedrich seeing daun out in this manner judged that a junction was contemplated and that one could not be too swift in preventing it october 29th with one diligent march friedrich posted himself at duben there in a sort now between daun and the reichsfolk detached hulsen with a considerable force to visit these latter in leipzig itself and began with all diligence forming a small magazine in duben magdeburg and the current of the elbe being hitherto his only resource in that kind by the time of hulsens return this little operation will be well forward and daun will have declared himself a little  hulsen evening of october 30th found leipzig in considerable emotion the reichsfolk taking refuge in it not the least inclined to stand a push when hulsen presented himself night of 30th31st there was summoning and menacing reich endeavoring to answer in firm style but all the while industriously packing up to go by 5 in the morning things had come to extremitymorning happily for some of us was dark mist but about 5 oclock hulsen or hulsens second coming on with menace of fire and sword upon these poor reichspeople found the reichspeople wholly vanished in the mist gone bodily in full march for the spurs of the metalmountain range againconcluding for the fourth time an extremely contemptible campaign daun with the king ahead of him made not the least attempt to help them in their leipzig difficulty but retired to his strong camp at torgau feels his work to lie thereas friedrich perceives of him with some interest  hulsen left a little garrison in leipzig friend quintus a part of it tempelhof iv 290 and returned to the king whose small magazine at duben and other small affairs theremagdeburg with boats and the king with wagons having been so diligent in carrying grain thitherare now about completed from dauns returning to torgau friedrich infers that the cautious man has got order from court to maintain torgau at all coststo risk a battle rather than go good he shall have one thinks friedrich and november 2d in four columns marches towards torgau to schilda that night which is some seven miles on the southward side of torgau the king himself in the vanguard as usual has watched with eager questioning eye the courses of dauns advanced parties and by what routes they retreat discerns for certain that daun has no views upon duben or our little magazine and that the tug of wrestle for torgau which is to crown this campaign into conquest of saxony or shatter it into zero like its foregoers on the austrian part and will be of deathorlife nature on the prussian part ought to ensue tomorrow forward then  this camp of torgau is not a new place to daun it was prince henris camp last autumn where daun tried all his efforts to no purpose and though hugely outnumbering the prince could make absolutely nothing of it nothing or less and was flowing back to dresden and the bohemian frontier uncheered by anything till that comfortable maxen incident turned up daun well knows the strength of this position torgau and the block of hill to west called hill of siptitzhulsen too stood here this summer not to mention finck and wunsch and their beating the reichspeople here a hill and post of great strength not unfamiliar to many prussians nor to friedrichs studious considerations though his knowledge of it was not personal on all pointsas tomorrow taught him somewhat to his cost  tourists from weimar and the thuringian countries says a notebook sometimes useful to us have most likely omitted rossbach in their screaming railway flight eastward and done little in leipzig but endeavor to eat dinner and still more vainly to snatch a little sleep in the inhuman dormitories of the country next morning screaming dresdenward they might especially if military pause at oschatz a stage or two before meissen where again are objects of interest you can look at hubertsburg if given that waya royal schloss memorable on several groundsat hubertsburg and at other features in the neighborhood of oschatz this done or this left not done you strike off leftward that is northward in some open vehicle for survey of torgau and its vicinities and environs not above fifteen miles for you a drive singular and pleasant time enough to return and be in dresden for dinner  torgau is a fine solid old town prussian military now abundant in it in ancient heathen times i suppose it meant the gau or district of thor capital of that gaupart of which now under christian or quasichristian circumstances you have just been traversing with elbe on your right hand innocent rural aspects of humanity boors life gentrys life all the way not in any holiday equipment on the contrary somewhat unkempt and scraggy but all the more honest and inoffensive there is sky earth air and freedom for your own reflections a really agreeable kind of gau pleasant though in part ugly large tracts of it are pinewood with pleasant villages and fine arable expanses interspersed schilda and many villages you leave to right and left oldfashioned villages with their village industries visible around laboring each in its kindnot too fast probably with extinct tobaccopipe hanging over its chin kaltrauchend smoking cold as they phrase it  schilda has an absurd celebrity among the germans it is the gotham of teutschland a fountain of old broadgrins and homely and hearty rustic banter welling up from the serious extinct ages to our own day schiltburger inhabitant of schilda meaning still among all the teutsch populations a man of calmly obstinate whims and delusions of notions altogether contrary to fact and agreeable to himself only resolutely pushing his way through life on those terms amid horselaughter naturally and general wagging of beards from surrounding mankind extinct mirth not to be growled at or despised in ages running to the shallow which have lost their mirth and become all one snigger of mockmirth for it is observable the more solemn is your background of dark the brighter is the play of all human genialities and coruscations on itof genial mirth especially in the hour for mirth who the doctor bordel of schilda was i do not know but they have had their bordel as gotham hadprobably various bordels industrious to pick up those spiritual fruits of the earth for the records are still abundant and current fully more alive than those of gotham here areand yonder then is actually schilda of the absurd fame a small cheerfullooking human village in its island among the woods you see it lying to the righta clean brickslate congeries with faint smokecanopy hanging over it indicating frugal dinnerkettles on the simmerand you remember kindly those good old grinnings over good schiltburger good wise men of gotham and their learned chroniclers and unlearned peasant producers who have contributed a wrinkle of human fun to the earnest face of life  after schilda and before you traverse long tracts of pine forest all under forest management with long straight stretches of sandy road one of which is your own straight like red tapestrings intersecting the wide solitudes dangerous to your topographiesfor the fingerposts are not always there and human advice you can get none nothing but the stripe of blue sky overhead and the brown one of tape or sand under your feet the trees poor and mean for most part but so innumerable and all so silent watching you all like mute witnesses mutely whispering together no voice but their combined whisper or big forest sough audible to you in the worldon the whole your solitary ride there proves unexpectedly a singular deliverance from the mad railway and its iron bedlamisms and shrieking discords and precipitances and is soothing and pensively welcome though sad enough and in outward features ugly enough no wild boars are now in these woods no chance of a wolfwhat concerns us more is that friedrichs columns on the 3d of november had to march up through these long lanes or tapestripes of the torgau forest and that one important column one or more took the wrong turn at some point and was dangerously wanting at the expected moment  torgau itself stands near elbe on the shoulder eastern or elbeward shoulder of a big mass of knoll or broad height called of siptitz the main eminence of the gau shoulder i called it of this height of siptitz but more properly it is on a continuation or lower ulterior height dipping into elbe itself that torgau stands siptitz height nearly a mile from elbe drops down into a straggle of ponds after which on a second or final rise comes torgau dipping into elbe not a shoulder strictly but rather a cheek with neck interveningneck goitry for that matter or quaggy with ponds the old town stands high enough but is enlaced on the western and southern side by a set of lakes and quagmires some of which are still extensive and undrained the course of the waters hereabouts and of elbe itself has had its intricacies close to northwest torgau is bordered in a straggling way by what they call old elbe which is not now a fluent entity but a stagnant congeries of dirty waters and morasses the hill of siptitz abuts in that aqueous or quaggy manner its forefeet being as it were at or in elbe river and its sides to the south and to the north for some distance each way considerably enveloped in ponds and boggy difficulties  plenty of water all about but i suppose mostly of bad quality at least torgau has declined drinking it and been at the trouble to lay a pipe or rohrgraben several miles long to bring its culinary water from the western neighborhoods of siptitz height along the southern side of siptitz height goes leisurely an uncomfortable kind of brook called the rohrgraben pipeditch the meaning of which unexpected name you find to be that there is a servicepipe laid cunningly at the bottom of this brook lifting the brook at its pure upper springs and sending it along in secret tubular quasibottled condition leaving the fouler drippings from the neighborhood to make what brook they still can over its head and keep it out of harms way till torgau get it this is called the rohrgraben this which comes running through siptitz village all along by the southern base of siptitz hill to the idle eye a dirtyish brook ending in certain notable ponds eastward but to the eye of the inquiring mind which has pierced deeper a tube of rational water running into the throats of torgau while the socalled brook disembogues at discretion into the entefang ducktrap and what ponds or reedy puddles there areof which in poor wunschs fine bit of fighting last year we heard mention let readers keep mind of them  the hill siptitz with this rohrgraben at the southern basis of it makes a very main figure in the battle now imminent siptitz height is in fact dauns camp where he stands intrenched to the utmost repeatedly changing his position the better to sustain friedrichs expected attacks it is a blunt broadbacked elevation mostly in vineyard perhaps on the average 200 feet above the general level and of five or six square miles in area length east to west from grosswig neighborhood to the environs of torgau may be about three miles breadth south to north from the siptitz to the zinna neighborhoods above half that distance the height is steepish on the southern side all along to the southwest angle which was dauns left flank in the great action coming but swells up with easier ascent on the west earth and other sides let the reader try for some conception of its environment and it as the floor or arena of a great transaction this day  daun stands fronting southward along these siptitz heights looking towards schilda and his dangerous neighbor heights woods ponds and inaccessibilities environing his position and him one of the strongest positions imaginable which under prince henri proved inexpugnable enough to some of us a position not to be attacked on that southern front nor on either of its flankswhere can it be attacked impregnable under prince henri in far inferior force how will you take it from daun in decidedly superior a position not to be attacked at all most military men would saythough one military man in his extreme necessity must and will find a way into it  one fault the unique military man intensely pondering discovers that it has it is too small for daun not area enough for manoeuvring 65000 men in it who will get into confusion if properly dealt with a most comfortable lightflash the eureka of this terrible problem we will attack it on rear and on front simultaneously that is the way to handle it yes simultaneously though that is difficult say military judges perhaps to prussians it may be possible it is the opinion of military judges who have studied the matter that friedrichs plan could it have been perfectly executed might have got not only victory from daun but was capable to fling his big army and him pellmell upon the elbe bridge that is to say in such circumstances into elbe river and swallow him bodily at a frightful rate that fate was spared poor daun  monday 3d november 1760 at halfpast 6 in the morning friedrich is on march for this great enterprise the march goes northward in three columns with a fourth of baggage through the woods on four different roads roads or combinations of those intricate sandy avenues already noticed northward all of it at first but at a certain point ahead at crossing of the eilenburgtorgau road namely the march is to divide itself in two half of the force is to strike off rightward there with ziethen and to issue on the south side of siptitz hill other half under friedrich himself to continue northward long miles farther and then at last bending round issuesimultaneously with ziethen if possibleupon siptitz hill from the north side we are about 44000 strong against daun who is 65000  simultaneously with ziethen so far as humanly possible that is the essential point friedrich has taken every pains that it shall be correct in this and all points and to take double assurance of hiding it from daun he yesternight in dictating his orders on the other heads of method kept entirely to himself this most important ziethen portion of the business and now at starting he has taken ziethen in his carriage with him a few miles to explain the thing by word of mouth at the eilenburg road or before it ziethen thinks he is clear as to everything dismounts takes in hand the mass intrusted to him and strikes off by that rightward course rightward herr ziethen rightward till you get to klitschen your first considerable island in this sea of wood at klitschen strike to the left into the woods againyour road is called the butterstrasse butterstreet goes by the northwest side of siptitz height reach siptitz by the butterstreet and then do your endeavor  with the other half of his army specially with the first column of it friedrich proceeds northward on his own part of the adventure three columns he has besides the baggage one in number about equal to ziethens if perhaps otherwise rather the chosen half about 8000 grenadier and footguard people with kleists hussars are friedrichs own column friedrichs column marches nearest the daun positions the baggagecolumn farthest and that latter is to halt under escort quite away to left or westward of the disturbance coming the other two columns hulsens of foot holsteins mostly of horse go through intermediate tracks of wood by roads more or less parallel and are all friedrichs own column still more the others to leave siptitz several miles to right and to end not at siptitz height but several miles past it and then wheeling round begin business from the northward or rearward side of daun while ziethen attacks or menaces his frontsimultaneously if possible friedrichs march hidden all by woods is more than twice as far as ziethenssome 14 or 15 miles in all going straight northward 10 miles thence bending eastward then southward through woods to emerge about neiden there to cross a brook striebach and strike home on the north side of daun the track of march is in the shape somewhat of a shepherds crook the long handle of it well away from siptitz reaches up to neiden this is the straight or wooden part of said crook after which comes the bent catching or iron partintended for daun and his fierce flock ziethen has hardly above six miles and ought to be deliberate in his woodlands till the kings party have time to get round  the morning i find is wet fourteen miles of march fancy such a promenade through the dripping woods heavy toilsome and with such errand ahead the delays were considerable some of them accidental vigilant daun has detachments watching in these woodsa general ried who fires cannon and gets off then a general st ignon and the st ignon regiment of dragoons who being between column first and column second cannot get away but after some industry by kleist and those of column two are caught and pocketed st ignon himself prisoner among the rest this delay may perhaps be considered profitable but there were other delays absolutely without profit for example that of having difficulties with your artillerywagons in the wet miry lanes that of missing your road at some turn in the solitary woods which latter was the sad chance of column third fatally delaying it for many hours  daun learning by those returned parties from the woods what the royal intentions on him are hastily whirls himself round so as to front north and there receive friedrich best line northward for friedrichs behoof rear line or secondbest will now receive ziethen or what may come dauns arrangements are admitted to be prompt and excellent lacy with his 20000who lay while friedrichs attack was expected from south at loswig as advanced guard east side of the grosse teich supreme pond of all which is a continuation of the ducktrap entefang and hangs like a chief goitre on the goitry neck of torgaulacy is now to draw himself north and westward and looking into the entefang over his left shoulder so to speak be rearguard against any ziethen or prussian party that may come dauns baggage is all across the elbe all in wagons since yesterday three bridges hanging for daun and it in case of adverse accident daun likewise brings all or nearly all his cannon to the new front for friedrichs behoof 200 new pieces hither archenholtz says 400 in whole certainly such a weight of artillery as never appeared in battle before unless friedrichs arrangements prove punctual and his stroke be emphatic friedrich may happen to fare badly on the latter point of emphasis there is no dubiety for friedrich but on the formerthings are already past doubt the wrong way for the last hour or so of friedrichs march there has been continual storm of cannonade and musketry audible from ziethens sideziethen engaged thinks everybody and quickens step here under this marching music from the distance which is but a wrong reading or mistake nothing more the real phenomenon being as follows ziethen punctually got to klitschen at the due hour struck into the butterstrasse calculating his paces but on the edge of the wood found a small austrian party like those in friedrichs route and pushing into it the austrian party replied with cannon before running whereupon ziethen not knowing how inconsiderable it was drew out in battleorder gave it a salvo or two drove it back on lacy in the ducktrap directiona long way east of butterstreet and ziethens real placeunlucky that he followed it so far ziethen followed it and got into some languid dispute with lacy dispute quite distant languid on both sides and consisting mainly of cannon but lasting in this way many precious hours this is the phenomenon which friends in the distance read to be ziethen engaged engaged yes and alas with what what ziethens degree of blame was i do not know friedrich thought it considerablestupid stupid mein lieber which ziethen never would admitand beyond question it was of high detriment to friedrich this day such accidents say military men are inherent not to be avoided in that double form of attack which may be true only that friedrich had no choice left of forms just now  about noon friedrichs vanguard kleist and hussars about 1 oclock friedrich himself 7 or 8000 grenadiers emerged from the woods about neiden this column which consists of choice troops is to be frontline of the attack but there is yet no second column under hulsen still less any third under holstein come in sight and ziethens cannonade is but too audible friedrich halts sends adjutants to hurry on these columnsand rides out reconnoitring questioning peasants earnestly surveying dauns ground and his own dauns now right wing well eastward about zinna had been friedrichs intended point of attack but the ground out there proves broken by boggy brooks and remnant stagnancies of the old elbe friedrich finds he must return into the wood again and attack dauns left dauns left is carefully drawn down en potence or gallowsshape there and has within the wood carefully built by prince henri last year an extensive abatis or complete western wallonly the north part of which is perhaps now passable the austrians having in the cold time used a good deal of it as firewood lately there on the northwest corner of daun across that weak part of the abatis must friedrichs attack lie but friedrichs columns are still fatally behindholstein with all the cavalry we have so precious at present is wandering by wrong paths took the wrong turn at some point and the adjutant can hardly find him at all with his precept of haste haste  we may figure friedrichs humor under these ill omens ziethens cannonade becomes louder and louder which friedrich naturally fancies to be death or life to himnot to mean almost nothing as it did mein gott ziethen is in action and i have not my infantry up tempelhof iv 303 cried he and at length decided to attack as he was grenadiers in front the chosen of his infantry ramins brigade for second line and except about 800 of kleist no cavalry at all his battalions march out from neiden hand through difficult brooks striebach and the like by bridges of austrian build which the austrians are obliged to quit in hurry the prussians are as yet perpendicular to daun but will wheel rightward into the domitsch wood again and then formparallel to dauns northwest shoulder and to prince henris abatis which will be their first obstacle in charging their obstacles in forming were many and intricate ground so difficult for artillery especially seldom was seen such expertness such willingness of mind and seldom lay ahead of men such obstacles after forming think only of one fact daun on sight of their intention has opened 400 pieces of artillery on them and these go raging and thundering into the hem of the wood and to whatever issues from it now and for hours to come at a rate of deafening uproar and of sheer deadliness which no observer can find words for  archenholtz a very young officer of fifteen who came into it perhaps an hour hence describes it as a thing surpassable only by doomsday clangorous rage of noise risen to the infinite the boughs of the trees raining down on you with horrid crash the forest with its echoes bellowing far and near and reverberating in universal deathpeal comparable to the trump of doom friedrich himself who is an old hand said to those about him what an infernal fire hollisches feuer did you ever hear such a cannonade before i never tempelhof iv 304 archenholtz ii 164 friedrich is between the two lines of his grenadiers which is his place during the attack the first line of grenadiers behind prince henris abatis is within 800 yards of daun ramins brigade is to rear of the second line as a reserve horse they have none except the 800 kleist hussars who stand to the left outside the wood fronted by austrian horse in hopeless multitude artillery they have in effect none their batteries hardly to be got across these last woody difficulties of trees growing and trees felled did rank outside the wood on their left but could do absolutely nothing guncarriages and gunners officers and men being alike blown away and when tempelhof saw them afterwards they never had been fired at all the grenadiers have their muskets and their hearts and their righthands  with amazing intrepidity they being at length all ready in rank within 800 yards rush into the throat of this firevolcano in the way commandedwhich is the alone way such a problem as human bravery seldom had the grenadiers plunge forward upon the throat of daun but it is into the throat of his iron engines and his tearing billows of cannonshot that most of them go shorn down by the company by the regiment in those terrible 800 yardsthen and afterwards regiment stutterheim was nearly all killed and wounded say the books you would fancy it was the fewest of them that ever got to the length of selling their lives to daun instead of giving them away to his 400 cannon but it is not so the grenadiers both lines of them still in quantity did get into contact with daun and sold him their lives hand to hand at a rate beyond example in such circumstancesdaun having to hurry up new force in streams upon them resolute to purchase though the price for a long while rose higher and higher  at last the 6000 grenadiers being now reduced to the tenth man had to fall back upon which certain austrian battalions rushed dawn in chase counting it victory come but were severely admonished of that mistake and driven back by ramins people who accompanied them into their ranks and again gave daun a great deal of trouble before he could overpower them this is attack first issuing in failure first one of the stiffest bits of fighting ever known began about 2 in the afternoon ended i should guess rather after 3 daun by this time is in considerable disorder of line though his 400 firethroats continue belching ruin and deafening the world without abatement daun himself had got wounded in the foot or leg during this attack but had no time to mind it a most busy strong and resolute daun doing his very best friedrich too was woundednobody will tell me in which of these attacksbut i think not now at least will not speak of it now what his feelings were as this grenadier attack went ona struggle so unequal but not to be helped from the delays that had risennobody himself least of all records for us only by this little symptom two grandsons of the old dessauers are adjutants of his majesty and well loved by him one of them now at his hand the other heading his regiment in this charge of grenadiers word comes to friedrich that this latter one is shot dead on which friedrich turning to the brother and not hiding his emotion as was usual in such moments said all goes ill today my friends are quitting me i have just heard that your brother is killed tout va mal aujourdhui mes amis me quittent on vient de mannoncer la mort de votre frere preuss ii 226 words which the anhalt kindred and the prussian military public treasured up with a reverence strange to us of anhalt perhaps some word by and by at a fitter season  shortly after 3 as i reckon the time hulsens column did arrive choice troops these too the pomeranian manteuffel one regiment of themyoung archenholtz of forcade first battalion here second and third are with ziethen making vain noise was in this column came with the others winding to the woods edge in such circuits poor young soul rain pouring if that had been worth notice cannonballs plunging boughs crashing such a todesposaune or doomsdaythunder broken loosethey did emerge steadily nevertheless he says like seabillows or flow of tide under the smoky hurricane pretty men are here too manteuffel pommerners no hearts stouter with these and the indignant remnants which waited for them a new assault upon daun is set about and bursts out on that same northwest corner of him say about halfpast 3 the rain is now done blown away by the tremendous artillery thinks archenholtz if that were any matter  the attack supported by a few more horse though column three still fatally lingers and i should hope by some practicable weight of fieldbatteries is spurred by a grimmer kind of indignation and is of fiercer spirit than ever think how manteuffel of foot will blaze out and what is the humor of those once overwhelmed remnants now getting air again dauns line is actually broken in this point his artillery surmounted and become useless dauns potence and north front are reeling backwards prussians in possession of their ground the field to be ours thinks friedrich for some time if indeed ziethen had been seriously busy on the southern side of things instead of vaguely cannonading in that manner but resolute daun with promptitude calls in his reserve from grosswig calls in whatsoever of disposable force he can gather daun rallies rushes again on the prussians in overpowering number and in spite of their most desperate resistance drives them back ever back and recovers his ground  a very desperate bout this second one probably the toughest of the battle but the result again is dauns the prussians palpably obliged to draw back friedrich himself got wounded herepoor young archenholtz too only wounded not killed as so many werefriedrichs wound was a contusion on the breast came of some spent bit of caseshot deadened farther by a famed pelisse he worewhich saved my life he said afterwards to henri the king himself little regarded it mentioning it only to brother henri on inquiry and solicitation during the few weeks it still hung about him the books intimate that it struck him to the earth void of consciousness for some time to the terror of those about him and that he started up disregarding it altogether in this press of business and almost as if ashamed of himself which imposed silence on peoples tongues in military circles there is still on this latter point an anecdote which i cannot confirm or deny but will give for the sake of berenhorst and his famed book on the art of war berenhorsta natural son of the old dessauers and evidently enough a chip of the old block only gone into the articulatespeaking or intellectual formwas for the present an adjutant or aidedecamp of friedrichs and at this juncture was seen bending over the swooned friedrich perhaps with an overpathos or elaborate something in his expression of countenance when friedrich reopened his indignant eyes was macht er hier cried friedrich er sammle fuyards what have you to do here go and gather runaways be of some real use cant youwhich unkind cut struck deep into berenhorst they say and could never after be eradicated from his gloomy heart it is certain he became prince henris adjutant soon after and that in his kriegskunst amidst the clearest orthodox admiration he manifests by little touches up and down a feeling of very fell and pallid quality against the king and belongs in a peculiarly virulent though taciturn way to the opposition party his book next to english lloyds or perhaps superior for berenhorst is of much the more cultivated intellect highly condensed too though so discursive and farread were it not for the vice of perverse diabolic temper seemed to a humble outsider like myself greatly the strongestheaded most penetrating and humanly illuminative i had had to study on that subject who the weakestheaded was perhaps jomini among the widely circulating kind i will not attempt to decide so great is the crush in that bad direction to return  this second attack is again a repulse to the indignant friedrich though he still persists in fierce effort to recover himself and indeed dauns interior too it appears is all in a whirl of confusion his losses too having been enormouswhen see here at length about halfpast 4 sun now down is the tardy holstein with his cavalry emerging from the woods comes wending on yonder half a mile to north of us straight eastward or elbeward according to the order of last night leaving us and our deathstruggles unregarded as a thing that is not on his tablets and is no concern of holsteins friedrich halts him not quite too late organizes a new and third attack simultaneous universal effort of foot and horse upon dauns front holstein himself who is almost at zinna by this time to go upon dauns right wing this is attack third and is of sporadic intermittent nature in the thickening dusk and darkness part of it successful none of it beaten but nowhere the success complete thus in the extreme west or leftmost of friedrichs attack spaen dragoonsone of the last horse regiments of holsteins columnspaen dragoons under their lieutenantcolonel dalwig a beautiful manoeuvrer who has stormed through many fields from

tempelhof iv 305 had these prussian horse been on their ground at 2 oclock and done as now it is very evident says tempelhof what the battle of torgau had by this time been  near by too farther

wrench these out force them to abandon their battery and to set siptitz on fire while they run out of it comfortable bit of success so farwere not siptitz burning so that we cannot get through through no and were we through is not there the rohrgraben thinks ziethen not seeing his way  how lucky that at this moment mollendorf comes in with a discovery to westward discovery of our old friend the butterstreetit is nothing morewhere ziethen should have marched this morning there would he have found a solid road across the rohrgraben free passage by a bridge between two bits of ponds at the schaferei sheepfarm of siptitz yonder there still reports mollendorf the solid road is unbeset hitherto except by me mollendorf thitherward all do now hasten austrians prussians but the prussians are beforehand mollendorf is master of the pass deploying himself on the other side of it and ziethen and everybody hastening through to support him there and the austrians making fierce fight in vain the

he wheels round on the attacking austrians is the southwest corner of siptitz height southwest corner highest point of it summit and key of all that battle area rules it all if you get cannon thither

of torgau the prussians in a parallel halfmoon posture some furlongs behind them the austrians sat but a short time not a moment longer than was indispensable daun perceives that the key of his ground is gone from him that he will have to send a second courier to vienna and above all things that he must forthwith get across the elbe and away lucky for him that he has three bridges or four including the town bridge and that his baggage is already all across and standing on wheels with excellent despatch and order daun winds himself acrossall of him that is still coherent and indeed in the distant

rest packed off except these 26and did not follow farther lacy retreated by the other or left bank of the river to guard against attempts from that side next day there was pursuit of lacy some prisoners and furnitures got from him but nothing of moment daun and lacy joined at dresden took post as usual behind their inaccessible plauen chasms sat there in view of the chasing prussians

otherwise daun showed not the least disposition to quit his plauen chasm or fall into discouragement and after some weeks of diligent trial on friedrichs part and much running about in those central and hillward parts friedrich found he would have to be content with his former allotment of saxon territory and to leave the austrians quiet in theirs took winterquarters accordingly and let the enemy

duke ferdinand  after warburg july 31st while friedrich was on the eve of crossing elbe on new adventures dresden siege having failed him duke ferdinand made no figure to the gazetteers fought no battle farther and has had a campaign which is honorable only to judges of a higher than the gazetteer sort  by warburg ferdinand had got the diemel on the north bank of which he spread himself out impassable to broglio who lay trying on the opposite bankno hanover by this road broglio thereupon drew back a little pushed out circuitously from his right wing which reaches far eastward of ferdinand a considerable brigadecircuitously round by the weserfulda country and beyond the embouchure of diemelto try it by that method got actually a few miles into hanoverian territory by that method laid hold of gottingen also of munden which secures a road thither and at gottingen there ever since august 4th broglio has been throwing up works and shooting out hussarparties to a good distance intending it would seem to maintain himself and to be mischievous in that post would in fact fain entice ferdinand across the weser to help gottingen across weser yesand so leave broglio free to take lippstadt from me as he might after a short siege thinks ferdinand always which would beautifully shorten broglios communication quite direct then and without interruption all the way to wesel and make hanover itself hanover and brunswick the central seat of war which ferdinand grieved as he is for gottingen will by no means consent to  ferdinand strong only as one to two cannot hinder broglio though he tries variously and is much at a loss seeing broglio irrepressibly busy this way all through august and on into septemberhas heard however from wesel through secret partisans there that wesel considered altogether out of risk is left in a very weak condition weak in garrison weak even in gunners reflecting upon which in his difficulties ferdinand asks himself a sudden stroke at wesel 200 miles away might it not astonish broglio who is so busy on us just hereand september 22d despatches the hereditary prince on that errand a man likely for it if there be one in the worldunable to do it however as the issue told here is what i find noted  september 22d the erbprinz with a chosen corps of 15000 mostly english left these diemel regions towards wesel at his speediest september 29th erbprinz and vanguard corps rapidly following are got to dorsten within 20 miles of wesel a most swift erbprinz likely for such work and it is thought by judges had he had either siegeartillery or scaling apparatus he might really have attacked wesel with good chance upon it but he has not even a ladder ready much less a siegegun siegeguns are at bielefeld come from bremen i suppose by english boating up the weser so far but that is six score miles of wheelcarriage roads bad and threatening to be worse as it is equinoctial weather there is nothing for it but to wait for those guns  the erbprinz hopefully waiting does his endeavor in the interim throws a bridge over the rhine pounces upon cleve garrison prisoners with their furnitures pounces upon this and that spreads terror on the french thereabouts up to dusseldorf and kolnand on broglio himself so far off the due astonishment wesel to be snatchedye heavens our netherlands road cut off dusseldorf koln our rhine magazines all and sundry fallen to the hawkswho the lighterwinged of them might pay visits in france itself broglio has to suspend his gottingen operations and detach marquis de castries with say ultimately for castries is to grow and gather by the road 35000 to relieve wesel castries marches doublequick weather very rainyarrives in those parts october 13thhardly a gun from bielefeld come to hand yet erbprinz merely filling men with terror and so  october 14th after two weeks and a day the hereditary prince sees not guns from bielefeld but castries pushing into wesel a 7000 of additional garrisonand the enterprise on wesel grown impossible impossible and probably far more castries in a condition to devour us if he prove sharp it behooves the hereditary prince to be himself sharpwhich he undoubtedly was in this sharp crisis next day our erbprinz taking survey of castries in his strong ground of kloster kampen decides like a gallant fellow to attack himand straightway does it breaks that same night october 15th16th 1760 stealthily through woods and with precautions into castriess postintending surprisal and mere ruin to castries and there ensued not the surprisal as it turned out but the battle of kloster kampen which again proved unsuccessful or only halfsuccessful to the hereditary prince a manywinged intricate nightbattle to be read of in books this is where the chevalier dassas he or somebody gave the alarm to the castries people at the expense of his life a moi auvergne ho auvergne shouted dassas if it was dassas at all when the stealthy english came upon him who was at once cut down preuss ii 270 n asserts it to be proved in miscellen aus den neuesten auslandischen litteratur 1824 no 3 p 409 a book which none of us ever saw that the real hero equal to a roman decius or more was not captain dassas of the regiment auvergne but a poor private soldier of it called duboisis not this a strange turn after such bepensioning bepainting singing and celebrating as rose upon poor dassas or the family of dassas twenty years afterwards 17771790both dubois and dassas i conclude lay among the slain at kloster kampen silent they foreverand a painful doubt does rise as to the miraculous operation of posthumous rumor and wonder and whether there was any miracle of heroism or other miracle at all and not rather a poor nocturnal accidentpoor sentry in the edge of the wood shrieking out on apparition of the stealthy english ho auvergne help probably firing withal and getting killed in consequence non nostrum est it is certain auvergne gave fire awoke castries bodily and saved him from what was otherwise inevitable surprise now there was none farther but a complex fight managed in the darkness with uncommon obstinacy ending in withdrawal of the erbprinz as from a thing that could not be done his loss in killed wounded and prisoners was 1638 that of castries by his own counting 2036 but kloster kampen in the wideawake state could not be won  during the fight the erbprinzs rhinebridge had burst in two his ammunition was running shortand it would seem there is no retreat either the erbprinz put a bold face on the matter stood to castries in a threatening attitude manoeuvred skilfully for two days longer face still to castries till the bridge was got mended then night of october 18th19th crossed to his own side

on it in england perhaps of the unwise sort generally sorrow in the highest quarter an unaccountable expedition walpole calls it on which prince ferdinand suddenly despatched his nephew at the head of a considerable force towards the frontiers of hollandmerely to see the country therewhich occasioned much solicitude in england as the main army already unequal to that of france was thus rendered much weaker king george felt it with much anxiety walpoles george second iii 299 an unaccountable enterprise my poor gazetteer friendsvery evidently an unsuccessful one so far as wesel went many english fallen in it too the english showed here again a ganz ausnehmende tapferkeit says mauvillon and probably their share of the loss was proportionate  clearly enough there is no wesel to be had neither could broglio though disturbed in his gottingen fortifyings and operations be ejected out of gottingen ferdinand on failure of wesel himself marched to gottingen and tried for some days but found he could not in such weather tear out that firmly rooted french post but must be content to mask it for the present and this done withdrew december 13th to his winterquarters near by as did broglio to hisabout the time friedrich and daun had finally settled in theirs  ferdinands campaigns henceforth which turn all on the defence of hanover are highly recommended to professional readers but to the laic sort do not prove interesting in proportion to the trouble in fact the huge war henceforth begins everywhere or everywhere except in pitts department of it to burn lower like a lamp with the oil getting done and has less of brilliancy than formerly let us try for hanover the belleisles choiseuls and wise french heads had said to themselves canada india everything is lost but were dear hanover well in our clutch hanover would be a remedy for many things through the remaining campaigns as in this now done that is their fixed plan ferdinand by unwearied effort succeeded in defending hanovernothing of it but that inconsiderable slice or skirt round gottingen which they kept long could ever be got by the french ferdinand defended hanover and wore out annually the big french armies which were missioned thither as in the spasm of an expiring last effort by this poor hagridden franceat an expense to her say of 50000 men per year which was good service on ferdinands part but done less and less in the shining or universally notable way  so that with him too we are henceforth thank heaven permitted and even bound to be brief hardly above two battles more from him

perhaps the unaccountable news from kloster kampen may have been too agitating to the dim old mind on the monday of this week he had from a tent in hyde park presided at a review of dragoons and on thursday as his coldstream guards were on march for portsmouth and foreign service was in his portico at kensington to see them passfull of zeal always in regard to military matters and to this war in particular saturday by sunrise he was on foot took his cup of chocolate inquired about the wind and the chances of mails arriving opened his window said he would have a turn in the gardens the morning

gentlemans magazine xxx 486488  intrinsically taken this seemed no very great event for friedrich for pitt for england or mankind but it proved otherwise the merit of this poor king deceased who had led his nation stumbling among the chimneypots at such a rate in these mad german wars for twenty years past was that he did now stand loyal to the enterprise now when it had become sane indeed now when the nation was broad awake and a captain had risen to guide it out of that perilous posture into neverexpected victory and triumph poor old george had stood by his pitt by his ferdinand with a

imagine endless sore business he doubtless has of recruiting financiering watching and providing which grows more difficult year by year but he has subordinates that work to his signal and an organized machinery for business such as no other man and solacements there are withal his books he has about him welcomer than ever in such seasons friends toohe is not solitary nor neglectful of resources faithful dargens came at once stayed till the middle of march oeuvres de frederic xix 212 213 sends a courier to conduct dargens for december 8th 21st march dargens is back at berlin dargens

in schoning  music too he had daily evening concert though from himself there is no fluting now one of his berlin concert people who had been sent for was fasch a virtuoso on i know not what instrumentbut a man given to take note of things about him fasch was painfully surprised to see his king so altered in the interim past bent now sunk into himself grown old to whom these five years of wartumult and anxiety of sorrow and hard toil had given a dash of gloomy seriousness and melancholy which was in strong contrast with his former vividly bright expression and was not natural to his years zelters life of fasch cited in preuss ii 278  from dargens there is one authentic anecdote worth giving one evening dargens came to him entering his apartment found him in a situation very unexpected which has been memorable ever since one evening there is no date to it except vaguely as above december 1760march 1761 dargens entering the kings apartment found him sitting on the ground with a big platter of fried meat from which he was feeding his dogs he had a little rod with which he kept order among them and shoved the best bits to his favorites the marquis in astonishment recoiled a step struck his hands together and exclaimed the five great powers of europe who have sworn alliance and conspired to undo the marquis de brandebourg how might they puzzle their heads to guess what he is now doing scheming some dangerous plan for the next campaign think they collecting funds to have money for it studying about magazines for man and horse or he is deep in negotiations to divide his enemies and get new allies for himself not a bit of all that he is sitting peaceably in his room and feeding his dogs preuss ii 282     interview with herr professor gellert thursday 18th december 1760  still more celebrated is the interview with gellert though i cannot say it is now more entertaining to the ingenuous mind one of friedrichs many interviews this winter with the learned of leipzig university for he is a born friend of the muses so called and never neglects an opportunity wonderful to see how in such an environment in the depths of mere toil and tribulation with a whole breaking world lying on his shoulders as it werehe always shows such appetite for a snatch of talk with anybody presumably of sense and knowledge on something  this winter say the books he had in vacant intervals a great deal of communing with the famed of leipzig university this or the other famed professorwinkler ernesti gottsched again and others coming to give account each for himself of what he professed to be teaching in the world on the natural sciences more especially the moral on libraries on rare books gottsched was able to satisfy the king on one point namely that the celebrated passage of st johns gospelthere are three that bear recordwas not in the famous manuscript of the vienna library gottsched having himself examined that important codex and found in the text nothing of said passage but merely written on the margin a legible intercalation of it in melanchthons hand luther in his version never had it at all heldengeschichte vi 596 a gottsched inclined to the socinian view not the least consequence to friedrich or us our business is exclusively with gellert here  readers have heard of gellert there are or there were english writings about him lives or i forget what and in his native protestant saxony among all classes especially the higher he had in those years and onwards to his death such a popularity and real splendor of authority as no man before or since had risen against his will in some sort to be a real pope a practical oracle in those parts in his modest bachelor lodging age of him fiveandforty gone he has sheaves of letters dailyabout affairs of the conscience of the household of the heart from some evangelical young lady for example shall i marry him think you o my father and perhaps from her papa shall she think you o my dittosheaves of letters and of oral consulters such crowds that the poor oracle was obliged to appoint special hours for that branch of his business his classroom he lectures on morals some theory of moral sentiment or such like is crowded with blue uniforms ingenuous prussian officers eager to hear a gellert in these winters rugged hulsen this very season who commands in freyberg country alleviates the poor village of hainichen from certain official inflictions and bids the poor people say it is because gellert was born among you plainly the trismegistus of mankind at that datewho is now as usual become a surprising trismegistus to the new generations  he had written certain thin books all of a thin languid nature but rational clear especially a book of fables in verse which are watery but not wholly water and have still a languid flavor in them for readers his book on letterwriting was of use to the rising generation in its time clearly an amiable ingenious correct altogether good man of pious mindand what was more of strictly orthodox according to the then saxon standard in the best circles this was the figure of his life for the last fifteen years of it and he was now about the middle of that culminating period a modest despondent kind of man given to indigestions dietetics hypochondria of neat figure and dress nose hooked but not too much eyes mournfully blue and beautiful fine open browa fine countenance and fine soul of its sort poor gellert punctual like the churchclock at divine service in all weathers jordens lexikon deutscher dichter und prosaisten leipzig 1807 ii 5468 gellert  a man of some real intellect and melody some by no means much who was of amiable meek demeanor studious to offend nobody and to do whatever good he could by the established methodsand who what was the great secret of his success was of orthodoxy perfect and eminent whom accordingly the whole world polite saxon orthodox world hailed as its evangelist and trismegistus essentially a commonplace man but who employed himself in beautifying and illuminating the commonplace of his clay and generationinfinitely to the satisfaction of said generation how charming that you should make thinkable to us make vocal musical and comfortably certain what we were all inclined to think you creature plainly divine and the homages to gellert were unlimited and continual not pleasant all of them to an idlish man in weak health  mitchell and quintus icilius who are often urging on the king that a new german literature is springing up of far more importance than the king thinks have spoken much to him of gellert the trismegistusand at length in the course of a ten days from friedrichs arrival here actual interview ensues the dialogue though it is but dull and watery to a modern palate shall be given entire for the sake of one of the interlocutors the report of it gleaned gradually from gellert himself and printed not long afterwards from his manuscripts or those of others is to be taken as perfectly faithful gellert writing to his inquiring friend rabener a then celebrated berlin wit describes from leipzig 29th january 1760 or about six weeks after the event how one day about the middle of december quintus icilius suddenly came to my poor lodging here to carry me to the king am too ill to go quintus will excuse me today but will return tomorrow when no excuse shall avail did go accordingly next day thursday 18th december 4 oclock of the afternoon and continued till a quarter to 6 had nothing of fear in speaking to the king recited my maler zu athen king said at parting he would send for me again the english ambassador mitchell an excellent man was probably the cause of the kings wish to see me the king spoke sometimes german sometimes french i mostly german gellerts briefwechsel mit demoiselle lucius herausgegeben von f a ebert leipzig 1823 pp 629 631 as follows  king are you er the professor gellert  gellert yea ihro majestat  king the english ambassador has spoken highly of you to me where do you come from  gellert from hainichen near freyberg  king have not you a brother at freyberg  gellert yea ihro majestat  king tell me why we have no good german authors  major quintus icilius puts in a word your majesty you see here one before youone whom the french themselves have translated calling him the german la fontaine  king that is much have you read la fontaine  gellert yes your majesty but have not imitated i am original ich bin ein original  king well this is one good author among the germans but why have not we more  gellert your majesty has a prejudice against the germans  king no i cant say that nein das kann ich nicht sagen  gellert at least against german writers  king well perhaps why have we no good historians why does no one undertake a translation of tacitus  gellert tacitus is difficult to translate and the frenoh themselves have but bad translations of him  king that is true da hat er recht  gellert and on the whole various reasons may be given why the germans have not yet distinguished themselves in every kind of writing while arts and sciences were in their flower among the greeks the romans were still busy in war perhaps this is the warlike era of the germansperhaps also they have yet wanted augustuses and louisfourteenths  king how would you wish one augustus then for all germany  gellert not altogether that i could wish only that every sovereign encouraged men of genius in his own country  king starting a new subject have you never been out of saxony  gellert i have been in berlin  king you should travel  gellert ihro majestat for that i need two thingshealth and means  king what is your complaint is it die gelehrte krankheit disease of the learned dyspepsia so called i have myself suffered from that i will prescribe for you you must ride daily and take a dose of rhubarb every week  gellert ach ihro majestat if the horse were as weak as i am he would be of no use to me if he were stronger i should be too weak to manage him mark this of the horse however a tale hangs by it  king then you must drive out  gellert for that i am deficient in the means  king yes that is true that is what authors gelehrte in deutschland are always deficient in i suppose these are bad times are not they  gellert ja wohl and if your majesty would grant us peace den frieden geben wollten  king how can i have not you heard then there are three of them against me es sind ja drei wider mich  gellert i have more to do with the ancients and their history than with the moderns  king changing the topic what do you think is homer or virgil the finer as an epic poet  gellert homer as the more original  king but virgil is much more polished viel polirter  gellert we are too far removed from homers times to judge of his language i trust to quintilian in that respect who prefers homer  king but one should not be a slave to the opinion of the ancients  gellert nor am i that i follow them only in cases where owing to the distance i cannot judge for myself  major icilius again giving a slight fillip or suggestion he the herr professor here has also treated of german letterwriting and has published specimens  king so but have you written against the chancery style then the painfully solemn style of ceremonial and circumlocution letters written so as to be mainly wig and buckram  gellert ach ja that have i ihro majestat  king but why doesnt it change the devil must be in it es ist etwas verteufeltes they bring me whole sheets of that stuff and i can make nothing of it  gellert if your majesty cannot alter it still less can i i can only recommend where you command  king can you repeat any of your fables  gellert i doubt it my memory is very treacherous  king bethink you a little i will walk about gellert bethinks him brow puckered king seeing the brow unpucker itself well have you one  gellert yes your majesty the painter gellert recites

otherwise come back soon gellerts briefwechsel mit demoiselle lucius already cited pp 632 et seq exit gellert  king to icilius as we learn from a different record that is quite another man than gottsched exuent omnes  the modest gellert says he remembered jesus sirachs advice press not thyself on kingsand never came back nor was specially sent for in the hurries succeeding though the king never quite forgot him next day at dinner the king said he is the reasonablest man of all the german literary people cest le plus raisonnable de tous les savans allemands and to garve at breslau years afterwards gellert is the only german that will reach posterity his department is small but he has worked in it with real felicity and indeed the king had before that as practical result of the gellert dialogue managed to set some berlin bookseller upon printing of these eligible fables for the use of our prussian schools in which and other capacities the fables still serve with acceptance there and elsewhere preuss ii 274  in regard to gellerts horseexercise i had still to remember that gellert not long after did get a horse two successive horses both highly remarkable the first especially which was prince henris gift the horse prince henri had ridden at the battle of freyberg battle to be mentioned hereafterquadruped that must have been astonished at itself but a pretty enough gift from the warlike admiring prince to his dyspeptic great man this horse having yielded to time the very kurfurst grandson of polish majesty that now is sent gellert another housing and furniture complete mounted on which gellert and it were among the sights of leipzigwell enough known here to young goethe in his college days who used to meet the great man and princely horse and do salutation with perhaps some twinkle of scepticism in the corner of his eye dichtung und wahrheit theil ii buch 6 in goethes werke xxv 51 et seq poor gellert fell seriously ill in december 1769 to the fear and grief of all the world estafettes from the kurfurst himself galloped daily or oftener from dresden for the sick bulletin but poor gellert died all the same 13th of that month and we have really with pathetic thoughts even we to bid his amiable existence in this world his bits of glories and him adieu forever     dialogue with general saldern in the apel house leipzig 21st january 1761  four or five weeks after this of gellert friedrich had another dialogue which also is partly on record and is of more importance to us here dialogue with majorgeneral saldern on a certain business delicate yet profitable to the doernobody so fit for it as saldern thinks the king saldern is he who did that extraordinary feat of packing the wrecks of battle on the field of liegnitz a fine clearflowing silent kind of man rapid and steady with a great deal of methodic and other good faculty in himmore perhaps than he himself yet knows of him the king has sent for this morning and it is on the business of polish majestys royal huntingschloss at hubertsburgwhich is a thing otherwise worth some notice from us  for three months long the king had been representing in the proper quarters what plunderings and riotous and even disgusting savageries the saxons had perpetrated at charlottenburg schonhausen friedrichsfeld in october last while masters there for a few days but neither in reichs diet where plotho was eloquent nor elsewhere by the diplomatic method could he get the least redress or one civil word of regret from polish majesty himself to whom friedrich remonstrated the matter through the english resident at warsaw friedrich had expected regret but he got none some think he had hoped that polish majesty touched by these horrors of war and by the reciprocities evidently liable to follow might be induced to try something towards mediating a general peace but polish majesty did not polish majesty answered simply nothing at all nor would get into any correspondence upon which friedrich possibly a little piqued withal had at length determined on retaliation  within our cantonments reflects friedrich here is hubertsburg schloss with such a hunting apparatus in and around it polish majestys hertzblatt lid of the heart as they call it breastbone at least and pit of his stomach which inclines to nothing but hunting let his hubertsburg become as our charlottenburg is perhaps that will touch his feelings friedrich had formed this resolution and wednesday january 21st sends for saldern one of the most exact deftgoing and punctiliously honorable of all his generals to execute it enter saldern accordinglyroyal audienceroom in the apelsche haus new neumarkt no 16 as aboveto whom one kuster a reliable creature reporting for us on salderns behalf the king says in the distinct slowish tone of a king giving orders  king saldern tomorrow morning you go er he goes with a detachment of infantry and cavalry in all silence to hubertsburg beset the schloss get all the furnitures carefully packed up and invoiced i want nothing with them the money they bring i mean to bestow on our field hospitals and will not forget you in disposing of it  saldern usually so prompt with his ja on any order from the king looks embarrassed stands silentto the kings great surpriseand after a moment or two says  saldern forgive me your majesty but this is contrary to my honor and my oath  king still in a calm tone you would be right to think so if i did not intend this desperate method for a good object listen to me great lords dont feel it in their scalp when their subjects are torn by the hair one has to grip their own locks as the only way to give them pain these last words the king said in a sharper tone he again made his apology for the resolution he had formed and renewed his order with the modesty usual to him but also with manliness saldern replied  saldern order me your majesty to attack the enemy and his batteries i will on the instant cheerfully obey but against honor oath and duty i cannot i dare not  the king with voice gradually rising i suppose repeated his demonstration that the thing was proper necessary in the circumstances but saldern true to the inward voice answered steadily  saldern for this commission your majesty will easily find another person in my stead  king whirling hastily round with an angry countenance but i should say an admirable preservation of his dignity in such extreme case saldern er will nicht reich werdensaldern you refuse to become rich and exit leaving saldern to his own stiff courses kuster charakterzuge des generallieutenant v saldern berlin 1793 pp 3944  nothing remained for saldern but to fall ill and retire from the service which he did a man honorably ruined thought everybodywhich did not prove to be the case by and by  this surely is a remarkable dialogue far beyond any of the gellert kind an absolute king and commanderinchief and of such a type in both characters getting flat refusal once in his life this once only so far as i know and how he takes itone wishes kuster or somebody had been able to go into more detailsdetails on the quintusicilius procedure which followed next day would also have been rather welcome had kuster seen good it is well known quintus icilius and his battalion on order now given went cheerfully next day in salderns stead and sacked hubertsburg castle to the due extent or farther 100000 thalers 15000 pounds were to be raised from it for the fieldhospital behoof the rest was to be quintuss own who it was thought made an excellent thing of it for himself and in hauling out the furnitures especially in selling them quintus having an enterprising sharp head in trade affairs it is certain says kuster as says everybody various schandlichkeiten scandals occurred which were contrary to the kings intention and would not have happened under saldern what the scandals particularly were is not specified to me anywhere though i have searched up and down much less the net amount of money realized by quintus i know only poor quintus was bantered about it all his life after by this merciless king and at potsdam in years coming had ample time and admonition for what penitence was needful  the case was much canvassed in the army says poor kuster it was the topic in every tent among officers and common men and among us armychaplains too poor honest souls the question of conflicting duties arose your king ordering one thing and your own conscience another what ought a man to do what ought an armychaplain to preach or advise and considerable mutual light in regard to it we struck out from one another and saw how a prudent armychaplain might steer his way our general conclusion was that neither the king nor saldern could well be called wrong saldern listening to the inner voice right he for certain but withal the king in his place might judge such a thing expedient and fit perhaps saldern himself would had saldern been king of prussia there in january 1761  salderns behavior in his retirement was beautiful and after the peace he was recalled and made more use of than ever being indeed a model for army arrangements and procedures and reckoned the completest general of infantry now left far and near the outcries made about hubertsburg which still linger in books are so considerable one fancies the poor schloss must have been quite ruined and left standing as naked walls such however we by no means find to be the case but on the contrary shall ourselves see that everything was got refitted there and put into perfect order again before long     there are some warmovements during winter general financiering difficulties choiseul proposes peace  february 15th there fell out at langensalza on the unstrut in gotha country a bit of sharp fighting done by friedrichs people and duke ferdinands in concert which and still more what followed on it made some noise in the quiet months not a great thing this of langensalza but a sudden and successfully done costing broglio some 2000 prisoners and the ruin of a considerable post of his which he had lately pushed out thither to seize the unstrut as he hoped a broglio grasping at more than he could hold in those thuringen parts as elsewhere and indeed the fight of langensalza was only the beginning of a series of such duke ferdinand being now upon one of his grand winteradventures that of suddenly surprising and exploding broglios winterquarters altogether and rolling him back to frankfurt for a lodging so that since the first days of february especially since langensalza day there rose suddenly a great deal of rushing about in those regions with hard bits of fighting at least of severe campaigningwhich lasted two wholemonthsfilling the whole world with noise that winter and requiring extreme brevity from us here it was specially duke ferdinands adventure friedrich going on it as per bargain to the langensalza enterprise but no farther after which it did not much concern friedrich nor indeed come to much result for anybody  strenuous ferdinand very impatient of the gottingen business and provoked to see broglios quarters extend into hessen so near hand for the first time silently determines to dislodge him broglios chain of quarters which goes from frankfurt north as far as marburg then turns east to ziegenhayn thence north again to cassel to munden with its defiles and again east or southeast to langensalza even this chain has above 150 miles of weak length and various other grave faults to the eye of ferdinandespecially this that it is in the form not of an elbow only or joinerssquare which is entirely to be disapproved but even of two elbows in fact of the profile of a chair if readers had a map at hand foot of the chair is frankfurt seat part is from marburg to ziegenhayn back part near where ferdinand lies in chief force is the cassel region on to munden which is top of the backstill backwards from which there is a kind of proud curl or overlapping down to langensalza in gotha country which greedy broglio has likewise grasped at broglios friends say he himself knew the faultiness of this zigzag form but had been overruled ferdinand certainly knows it and proceeds to act upon it  in profound silence namely ranks himself february 1st12th in three divisions wide enough asunder bursts up sudden as lightning at langensalza and elsewhere kicks to pieces broglios chairprofile kicks out especially the bottom part which ruins both foot and back these being disjointed thereby and each exposed to be taken in rearand of course astonishes broglio not a little but does not steal his presence of mind  so that in effect broglio had instantly to quit cassel and warm lodging and take the field in person to burn his magazines and at the swiftest rate permissible condense himself at first partially about fulda well down the leg of his chair and then gradually all into one mass near frankfurt itselfwith considerable losses loss especially of all his magazines full or half full and has now except marburg ziegenhayn and cassel no post between gottingen and him ferdinand with his three divisions went storming along in the wild weather granby as vanguard pricking into the skirts of broglio captured this and that of corps of magazines that had not been got burnt laid siege to tassel siege to ziegenhayn blocked marburg not having guns ready and for some three or four weeks was by the gazetteer world and general public thought to have done a very considerable featthough to himself such were the distances difficulties of the season of the long roads it probably seemed very questionable whether in the end any feat at all  cassel he could not take after a months siege under the best of siegecaptains ziegenhayn still less under one of the worst provisions ammunitions were not to be had by force of wagonry scant food for soldiers doubly scant the food of siegesthe road from beverungen where the weserboats have to stop which is 30 miles from cassel perhaps 60 from ziegenhayn and perhaps 100 from the outmost or southernmost of ferdinands parties is paved with dead horses nor has even cassel nearly enough of ammunitionin a word broglio finding the time come bursts up from his frankfurt position march 14th21st in a sharp and determined manner drives ferdinands people back beats the erbprinz himself one day by surprisal my compliment for langensalza and sets his people running ferdinand sees the affair to be over and deliberately retires lucky perhaps that he still can deliberately and matters return to their old posture broglio resumes his quarters somewhat altered in shape and not quite so grasping as formerly and beyond his halffilled magazines has lost nothing considerable or more considerable than has ferdinand himself tempelhof v 1545 mauvillon ii 135148  the vital element in ferdinands adventure was the siege of cassel all had to fail when this by defect of means under the best of management declared itself a failure siege captain was a graf von lippebuckeburg ferdinands ordnancemaster who is supposed to be the best artillery officer in the worldand is a man of great mark in military and other circles he is son and successor of that fantastic lippebuckeburg by whom friedrich was introduced to freemasonry long since he has himself a good deal of the fantast again but with a better basis of solidity beneath it a man of excellent knowledge and faculty in various departments strict as steel in regard to discipline to practice and conduct of all kinds a most punctilious silently supercilious gentleman of polite but privately irrefragable turn of mind a tall lean dusky figure much seen to by neighbors as he stalks loftily through this puddle of a world on terms of his own concerning whom there circulates in military circles this anecdote among many otherswhich is set down as a fact and may be whether quite believable or not a symbol of all the rest and of a man not unimportant in these wars two years ago on king friedrichs birthday 24th january 1759 the count had a select dinnerparty in his tent in ferdinands camp in honor of the occasion dinner was well over and wine handsomely flowing when somebody at last thought of asking what is it then herr graf that whistling kind of noise we hear every now and then overhead that is nothing said the graf in his calm dusky way that is only my artillerypeople practising i have bidden them hit the pole of our tent if they can unhappily there is not the slightest danger push the bottles on archenholtz ii 356 zimmermann einsamkeit iii 461 c lippebuckeburg was siegecaptain at cassel commandant besieged was comte de broglio the marshals younger brother formerly in the diplomatic linewhom we saw once five years ago at the pirna barrier fly into fine frenzy and kick vainly against the pricks friedrich says once to dargens or somebody i hope we shall soon have cassel and m le comte de broglio prisoner deserves it for his fine frenzies at pirna and sincebut that comfort was denied us  some careless books say friedrich had at first good hopes of this enterprise and had himself lent 7000 men to it which is the fact but not the whole fact friedrich had approved and even advised this plan of ferdinands and had agreed to send 7000 men to cooperate at langensalzawhich so far out in thuringen and pointing as if to the reichsfolk is itself an eyesorrow to friedrich the issue we have seen his 7000 went accordingly under a general syburg met the ferdinand people general sporken head of these and walpoles conway one of them found the unstrut in flood but crossed nevertheless dashed in upon the french and saxons

withdrew leaving sporken and his conways to complete the adventure and for his part set himself with his whole might to raising contributions recruits horses proviants over thuringen which says tempelhof had been his grand errand there and in which he succeeded wonderfully  towards the end of ferdinands affair cassel siege now evidently like to fail friedrich organized a small expedition for his own behoof expedition into voigtland or frankenland against the intrusive reichspeople who have not now a broglio or langensalza to look across to but are mischievous upon our outposts on the edge of the voigtland yonder the expedition lasted only ten days april 1st it left quarters april 11th was home again a sharp swift and very pretty expedition tempelhof v 4857 of which we can here say only that it was beautifully impressive on the reichs gentlemen and sent their croateries and them home again to bamberg to eger quite over the horizon in a considerably flurried state after which there was no smallwar farther and everybody rested in cantonment making ready till the great should come  the prussian wounded are all in leipzig this winter a crowded stirring town young archenholtz among many others going about in convalescent statenot attending gellerts course that i hear ofbut noticing vividly to right and left much difficulty about the contributions archenholtz observesof course an everincreasing difficulty here as everywhere in regard to finance from archenholtz chiefly i present the following particulars which though in loose form and without date except the general one of winter 17601761 to any of them are to be held substantially correct   it is impossible to pay that contribution exclaim the leipzigers you said long since it was to be 75000 pounds on us by the year and this year you rise to 160000 pounds more than doubleperhaps that is because you favored the reichsfolk while here answer the prussians if they answer anything it is the kings order pay it you mustcannot simply impossible possible we tell you and also certain we will burn your leipzig if you dont and they actually these collector fellows a stonyhearted set who had a percentage of their own on the sums levied got soldiers drawn out more than once pitchlink in hand as if for immediate burning hut the leipzigers thought to themselves king friedrich is not a soltikof and openly laughed at those pitchlinks whereupon about a hundred of their chief merchants were thrown into prisonone hundred or so riddled down in a day or two to seventeen which latter seventeen as they stood out were detained a good many days how many is not said but only that they were amazingly firm blackhole for lodging breadandwater for diet straw for bed nothing would avail on the seventeen impossible they answered always each unit of them in sight of the other sixteen was upon his honor and could not think of flinching you shall go for soldiers thenpossibly you will prefer that you fine powdered velvet gentlemen up then and march here are your firelocks your seventeen knapsacks to the road with us to magdeburg there to get on drill upon which the seventeen horrorstruck at such quasiactual possibility gave in  magnanimous gotzkowsky who had come to leipzig on business at the time which will give us a date for this by and by and been solemnly applied to by deputation of the rath pleaded with his usual zealous fidelity on their behalf got various alleviations abatements gave billsnever was seen such magnanimity said the leipzig towncouncil solemnly as that of berlin in october last had done archenholtz ii 187192  of course the difficulties financial and other are increasing every winternot on friedrichs side only here for instance from the duchy of gottingen are some items in the french account current this winter which are also furnished by archenholtz  for bedticking 13000 webs of shirts readymade 18000 shoes i forget in what quantity but from the poor little town of duderstadt 600 pairsliability to instant flogging if they are not honest shoes flogging and the whole shoemaker guild summoned out to see it hardy women the same duderstadt has had to produce 300 of them each with basket on back who are carrying cannonballs from the foundry at lauterberg to gottingen the road being bad archenholtz ii 237 these french are in such necessity continues archenholtz they spare neither friend nor foe the frankish circle for example pleads piteously in reichs diet that it has already smarted by this war to the length of 2230000 pounds and entreats the kaiser to bid most christian majesty cease his exactionsbut without the least result result if most christian majesty and his pompadour will continue this war is it he or is it you that can furnish the magazines magazinefurnishings over all hessen and this part of hanover are enormous recruits too native hessian native hanoverian you shall furnishand we will hang them and do if caught deserting to their own side  i add only one other item from archenholtz mice being busy in these hanover magazines it is decided to have cats and a requisition goes out accordingly cipher not given cats do execution for a time but cannot stand the confinement are averse to the solitary system and object think with what vocality upon which hanover has to send foxes and weasels ib ii 240 these guardian animals and the 300 women laden with cannonballs from the forge are the most peculiar items in the french account current and the last i will mention  difficulty quasiimpossibility on the french side there evidently is perhaps more than on any other but choiseul has many artsand his official existence were there nothing more demands that he do the impossible now if ever this spring 26th march 1761 to the surprise and joy of mankind there came formal proposal issuing from choiseul to which maria theresa and the czarina had to put their signatures regretting that the britishprussian proposal of last year had by ill accident fallen to the ground and now repeating it themselves real congress at augsburg and all things fair and handsome to britannic and prussian majesties who answered april 3d as before nothing with more willingness we the declaration of france c with the answer or counterdeclaration in seyfarth beylagen iii 1216  and there actually did ensue at paris a vivid negotiating all summer which ended not quite in nothing but in less if we might say so considerably less for some of us we shall have to look what end it had and mauduit will lookmost people pitt probably among the others came to think that choiseul though his france is in beggary had no real view from the first except to throw powder in the eyes of france and mankind to ascertain for himself on what terms those english would make peace and to get spain drawn into his quarrel a choiseul with many arts but we will leave him and his peaceproposals and the other rumors and futilities of this year they are part of the sound and smoke which fill all years and which vanish into next to nothing oftenest into pure nothing when the years have waited a little friedrichs finances copper and other were got completed his armies too were once more put on a passable footingand this year will have its realities withal  gotzkowsky in regard to those leipzig finance difficulties yields me a date which is supplementary to some of the archenholtz details i find it was january 20th 1761precisely while the saldern interview and subsequent wreck of hubertsburg went onthat gotzkowsky arrived in leipzig rodenbeck ii 77 and got those unfortunate seventeen out of ward and the contributions settled  and withal at paris in the same hours there went on a thing worth noting that january day while icilius was busy on the schloss of hubertsburg poor old marechal de belleislemark him readerin the rue de lille at paris lay sunk in putrid fever and on the fourth day after january 26th 1761 the last of the grand old frenchmen died he had been reported dead three days before says barbier the public wished it so they laid the blame on him of this apparent let a cautious man write it apparent derangement in our affairsinstead of thanking him for all he had done and suffered loss of so much including reputation and an only son to repair and stay the same he was in his 77th year many people say we must wait three months to see if we shall not regret himeven him barbier iv 373 i 154 so generous are nations  marechal duc de belleisle was very wealthy in vernon country normandy he had estates and chateaux to the value of about 24000 pounds annually all these having first accurately settled for his own debts he in his grand old way childless forlorn but loftily polite to the last bequeathed to the king his splendid paris mansion he expressly left to serve in perpetuity as a residence for the secretary of state in the department of war a magnificent townhouse it is hotel magnifique at the end of the pontroyalwhich i notice farther is in our time called hotel de choiseulpraslina house latterly become horrible in mens memory if my guess is right  and thus vanishes in sour dark clouds the once great belleisle grandiose something almost of great in him of sublimealas yes of too sublime and of unfortunate beyond proportion paying the debt of many foregoers he too is a notability gone out the last of his kind twenty years ago he crossed the oeildeboeuf with papers just setting out to cut teutschland in four and in the rue de lille no 54 with that grandiose enterprise drawing to its issue in universal defeat disgrace discontent and preparation for the general overturn culbute generale of 1789 he closes his weary old eyes choiseul succeeds him as warminister warminister and primeminister both in oneand by many arts of legerdemain and another real spasm of effort upon hanover to do the impossible there is leading france with winged steps the same road  since march 17th friedrich was no longer in leipzig he left at that time for meissen country and the hill cantonmentsorganized there his little expedition into voigtland for behoof of the reichsfolkand did not return continued mostly in meissen country as the fittest for his many businesses armyregulatings and other till the campaign come we will remember of him nothing but this little note and pleasant little gift to his chere maman the day after his arrival in those parts   to madam camas at magdeburg with the queen  meissen 20th march 1761  i send you my dear mamma a little trifle by way of keepsake and memento snuffbox of meissen porcelain with the figure of a dog on the lid you may use the box for your rouge for your patches or you may put snuff in it or bonbons or pills but whatever use you turn it to think always when you see this dog the symbol of fidelity that he who sends it outstrips in respect of fidelity and attachment to maman all the dogs in the world and that his devotion to you has nothing whatever in common with the fragility of the material which is manufactured hereabouts  i have ordered porcelain here for all the world for schonhausen for your mistress my poor uncomplaining wife for my sistersinlaw in fact i am rich in this brittle material only and i hope the receivers will accept it as current money for the truth is we are poor as can be good mamma i have nothing left but honor my coat my sword and porcelain  farewell my beloved mamma if heaven will i shall one day see you again face to face and repeat to you by word of mouth what i have already said and written but turn it and return it as i may i shall never except very incompletely express what the feelings of my heart to you aref given in rodenbeck ii 79 omitted for i know not what reason in oeuvres de frederic xviii 145 cited partly in preuss ii 282   it was during this winter if ever it was that friedrich received the following letter from an aspiring young lady just coming out age seventeenin a remote sphere of things in sleepy hollow namely or the court of mirow in mecklenburgstrelitz where we once visited with friedrich almost thirty years ago the poor collapsed duke has ceased making dressinggowns there and this is his niece princess charlotte sister to the now reigning duke  this letter in the translated form and the glorious results it had for some of us are familiar to all english readers for the last hundred years of friedrichs answer to it if he sent one we have no trace whatever which is a pity more or lessthough in truth the answer could only have been some polite formality the letter itself being a mere breath of sentimental wind absolutely without significance to friedrich or anybody elseexcept always to the young lady herself to whom it brought a royal husband and queenship of england within a year signature presumably this letter once had date of place of day year or even century except by implication there never was any but judicious persons scanning on the spot have found that the victory spoken of can only have meant torgau and that the aspiring young lady hitherto a school girl not so much as confirmed till a month or two ago age seventeen in may last can only have i written it at mirow in the winter subsequent ludwig giesebrechtder furstenhof in mirow wuhrend der jahre 17081761 in programm des vereinigten koniglichen und stadtgymnasiums for 1863 stettin

angenehmste gestalt gewonnen man traf keine verodete stellen an alles war angebaut das landvolk sah vergnugt aus und in den stadten herrschte wohlstand und freude aber welch eine veranderung gegen eine so angenehme scene ich bin in partheischen beschreibungen nicht erfahren noch weniger kann ich die grauel der verwilstung mit erdichteten schilderungen schrecklicher darstellen allein gewiss selbst krieger welche ein edles herz und gefuhl besitzen wurden durch den anblick dieser scenen zu thranen bewegt werden das ganze land mein werthes vaterland liegt da gleich einer wuste der ackerbau

majesty i am at a loss whether i shall congratulate or condole with you on your late victory since the same success that has covered you with laurels has overspread the couutry of mecklenburgh with desolation i know sire that it seems unbecoming my sex in this age of vicious refinement to feel for ones country to lament the horrors of war or wish for the return of peace i know you may think it more properly my province to study the art of pleasing or to turn my thoughts to subjects of a more domestic nature but however unbecoming it may be in me i cant resist the desire of interceding for this unhappy people  it was but a very few years ago that this territory wore the most pleasing appearance the country was cultivated the peasant looked cheerful and the towns abounded with riches and festivity what an alteration at present from such a charming scene i am not expert at description nor can my fancy add any horrors to the picture but sure even conquerors themselves would weep at the hideous prospect now before me the whole country my dear country lies one frightful waste presenting only objects to excite terror pity and despair the business of the husbandman and the shepherd are quite discontinued the husbandman and the shepherd are become soldiers themselves and help to ravage the soil they formerly occupied the towns are inhabited only by old men women and children perhaps here and there a warrior by wounds and loss of limbs rendered unfit for service left at his door his little children hang round him ask a history of every wound and grow themselves soldiers before they find strength for the field but this were nothing did we not feel the alternate insolence of either army as it happens to advance or retreat it is impossible to express the confusion even those who call themselves our friends create even those from whom we might expect redress oppress us with new calamities from your justice therefore it is that we hope relief to you even children and women may complain whose humanity stoops to the meanest petition and whose power is capable of repressing the greatest injustice  i am sire c   it is remarked that this young lady so amiably melodious in tone though she might address to king friedrich seems to be writing to the wind and that she gives nothing of fact or picture in regard to mecklenburg especially to mecklenburgstrelitz but what is taken from her own beautiful young brain all operatic vague imaginarysome of it expressly untrue in mecklenburgschwerin which had always to smart sore for its duke and the line he took the swedes this

conclusive proof of the perfectly amicable footing now and always subsisting there friedrich reluctant to intrude even with a small request or solicitation on eugens behalf at this time so that latterly there have been doubts as to its authenticity altogether boll geschichte mecklenburgs mit besonderer berucksichtigung der culturgeschichte neubrandenburg 1856 ii 303305cited by giesebrecht who himself takes the opposite view and in fact the piece has a good deal the air of some schoolexercise model of letterwriting patriotic aspiration or the likethrown off shall we say by the young parson of mirow charlottes late tutor with charlotte there to sign or by some patriotic schoolmaster elsewhere anywhere in a moment of enthusiasm and without any charlotte but a hypothetic one certainly it is difficult to fancy how a modest rational practical young person like charlotte can have thought of so airy a feat of archery into the blue charlotte herself never disavowed it that i heard of and to colonel grahame the exjacobite hunting about among potential queens of england for behoof of bute and of a certain young king and kings mother the letter did seem abundantly unquestionable and adorable perhaps authentic after alland certainly small matter whether or not     chapter viisixth campaign opens camp of bunzelwitz  to the outward observer friedrich stands well at present and seems again in formidable posture after two such victories and such almost miraculous recovery of himself who shall say what resistance he will not yet make in comparison with 1759 and its failures and disasters what a year has 1760 been liegnitz and torgau instead of kunersdorf and maxen here are unexpected phenomena here is a king risen from the deeps againmore incalculable than ever to contemporary mankind how these things will end fancy of what a palpitating interest then while everybody watched the huge game as it went on though it is so little interesting now to anybody looking at it all finished finished no mystery of chance of worldhope or of worldterror now remaining in it all is fallen stagnant dull distantand it will behoove us to be brief upon it  contemporaries and posterity that will make study must alike admit that among the sons of men few in any age have made a stiffer fight than friedrich has done and continues to do but to friedrich himself it is dismally evident that year by year his resources are melting away that a year must come when he will have no resource more ebbing very fast his resourcesfast too no doubt those of his enemies but not so fast they are mighty nations he is one small nation his thoughts we perceive have always in the background of them a hue of settled black easy to say resist till we die but to go about year after year practically doing it under cloudy omens no end of it visible ahead is not easy many men kings and other have had to take that stern posturefew on sterner terms than those of friedrich at present and none that i know of with a more truly stoical and manful figure of demeanor he is long used to it wet to the bone you do not regard new showers the one thing is reach the bridge before it be swum away  the usual hopes about turks about peace and the like have not been wanting to friedrich this winter mentionable as a trait of friedrichs character not otherwise worth mention hope of aid from the turks it is very strange to see how he nurses this fond shadow which never came to anything happily it does not prevent it rather encourages the utmost urgency of preparation the readier we are the likelier are turks and everything peace at least between france and england after such a proposal on choiseuls part and such a pass as france has really got to was a reasonable probability but indeed from the first year of this war as we remarked peace has seemed possible to friedrich every year especially from 1759 onward there is always every winter a lively hope of peaceno slackening of preparation the reverse rather but surely the campaign of next summer will be cut short and we shall all get home only half expended schoning in locis  practically friedrich has been raising new freecorps people been recruiting refitting and equipping with more diligence than ever and in spite of the almost impossibilities has two armies on foot some 96000 men in all for defence of saxony and of silesiahenri to undertake saxony versus daun silesia with loudon and the russians to be friedrichs heavier share the campaign of which by the one party and the other very great things had been hoped and feared seemed once as if it would begin two months earlier than usual but was staved off a long time by friedrichs dexterities and otherwise and in effect did not begin what we can call beginning till two months later than usual essentially it fell almost all to friedrichs share and turned out as little decisive on him as any of its foregoers the one memorable part of it now is friedrichs encampment at bunzelwitz which did not occur till four months after friedrichs appearance on the field and from the end of april when loudon made his first attempt till the end of august when friedrich took that camp there was nothing but a series of attempts all ineffectual of demonstrations marchings manoeuvrings and small events which in the name of every reader demand condensation to the utmost if readers will be diligent here so far as needful are the prefatory steps  since fouquets disaster goltz generally has silesia in charge and does it better than expected he was never thought to have fouquets talent in him but he shows a rugged loyalty of mind less egoistic than the fiery fouquets and honestly flings himself upon his task in a way pleasant to look at pleasant to the king especially who recognizes in goltz a useful brave frank souland has given him this spring the order of merit which was a high encouragement to goltz in silesia after kosel last year there had been truce between goltz and loudon which should have produced repose to both but did not altogether owing to mistakes that rose and at any rate in the end of april loudon bursting suddenly into silesia with great increase to the forces already there gave notice as per bargain that in 96 hours the truce would expire and waiting punctiliously till the last of said hours was run out loudon fell upon goltz april 25th in the schweidnitzlandshut country with his usual vehemencemeaning to get hold of the silesian passes and extinguish goltz only 10 or 12000 against 30000 as he had done fouquet last year  but goltz took his measures better seized the gallowshill of hohenfriedberg seized this and that and stood in so forcible an attitude that loudon carefully considering durst not risk an assault and the only result was friedrich hastened to relief of goltz rose from meissen country may 3d and appeared in silesia six weeks earlier than he had intended but again took cantonments there schweidnitz and neighborhoodloudon retiring wholly on first tidings of him home to bohemia again home in bohemia at braunau on the western edge of the glatz mountainsthere sits loudon thenceforth silent for a long time silently collecting an army of 72000 with strict orders from vienna to avoid fighting till the russians come loudon has very high intentions this year intends to finish silesia altogethercannot he after such a beginning upon glatz last year that is the firm notion at vienna among men of understanding everactive loudon the favorite there against a cunctator who has been too cunctatory many times liegnitz itself was not that as many opine a disaster due to cunctation not of loudons  loudon is to be joined by 60000 russians under a feldmarschall butturlin not under sulky soltikof this year junction to be in upper silesia in neisse neighborhood we take that fortress say the vienna people it is next on the file after glatz neisse taken thence northward cleaning the country as we go brieg schweidnitz glogau probably breslau itself in some good interim there are but four fortresses to do and the thing is finished let the king one to three and loudon in command against him try if he can hinder it this is the program in vienna and in petersburg and accordingly the russians have got on march about the end of may plodding on ever since due hereabouts before june end junction to be as near neisse as you can and no fighting of the king on any terms till the russians come never were the vienna people so certain before daun is to do nothing rash in saxony a daun not given that way they can calculate but is to guard loudons game carefully to reinforce comfort and protect the brave loudon and his russians till they winafter which saxony as rash as you like this is the program of the seasonreaders feel what an immensity of preliminary higglings hitchings and manoeuvrings will now demand to be suppressed by us read these essential fractions chiefly chronologicaland then at once to bunzelwitz and the time of close grips in silesia here  last year says a loose note which we may as well take with us tottleben did not go home with the rest but kept hovering about in eastern pommern with a 10000 all winter attempting several kinds of mischief in those countries especially attempting to do something on colberg which the russians mean to besiege next summer with more intensity than ever for the third and if possible the last time storm their outposts there thinks tottleben especially belgard the chief outpost girdle tighter and tighter the obstinate little crowsnest of a colberg and have it ready for besieging in good time tottleben did try upon the outposts especially belgard the chief one january 18th 1761 but without the least success at belgard with a severe reproof instead werners people being broad awake account of itt heldengeschichte vi 670 upon which tottleben and they made a truce peaceable till may 12th till june 1st it proved about which time which time or afterwards as the silesian crisis may admit we will look in on them again  may 3d as above intimated friedrich hastened off for silesia quitted meissen that day with an army of some 50000 pressingly intent to relieve goltz from his dangerous predicament there this is one of friedrichs famed marches done in a minimum of time and with a maximum of ingenuity concerning which i will remember only that one night he lodged again at rodewitz near hochklrch in the same house as on that occasion what a thirty months to look back upon as you sink to sleepand that no accident anywhere befell the march though dauns people all through saxony and the lausitz were hovering on the flankapprehensive chiefly lest it might mean a plunge into bohemia for relief of goltz instead of what it did for six weeks after that hard march the kings people got cantonments again and rested  prince henri is left in saxony with daun in huge force against him daun and the reich between whom and henriseidlitz being in the field again with henri seidlitz and others of markthere fell out a great deal of exquisite manoeuvring rapid detaching and occasional sharp cutting on the small scale but nothing of moment to detain us here or afterwards we shall say only that henri to a wonderful extent maintained himself against the heavy overwhelming daun and his austrian and reichs masses and that napoleon i know not after what degree of study pronounced this campaign of 1761 to be the masterpiece of henri and really a considerable thing la campagne de 1761 est celle ou ce prince a vraiment montre des talents superieurs the battle of freyberg wait till next year nothing in comparison montholon memoires de napoleon vii 324 which may well detain soldierpeople upon it but must not us in any measure the result of henri being what we saida drawn game or nearly sowe will without interference from him follow friedrich and goltz  friedrich and goltzor alas it is very soon friedrich alone the valiant goltz soon perishing from his hand after brief junction in schweidnitz country friedrich detached goltz to his old fortified camp at glogau there to be on watch goltz watching there lynxeyed skilful volunteered a proposal june 22d reinforce me to 20000 your majesty i will attack so and so of those advancing russians which his majesty straightway approved of and set going goltzs letter to the king glogau 22d june 1761 is in tempelhof v 8890 who thinks the plan good goltz thereupon tasked all his energies perhaps overmuch and it was thought might at last really have done something for the king in this matter of the russians still in separate divisionsa thing feasible if you have energy and velocity always unfeasible otherwise but alas poor goltz just when ready to march was taken with sudden violent fever the fruit probably of overwork and in that sad flame blazed away his valiant existence in three or four daysgone forever june 30th 1761 to the regret of friedrich and of many  old ziethen was at once pushed on from glogau over the frontier to replace goltz but i doubt had not now the requisite velocity ziethen merely manoeuvred about and came home attending the russians as henri dohna and others had done the russians entered silesia from the northeast or polish side without difficulty and july 15th20th were within reach of breslau and of an open road to southward and to junction with loudon who is astir for them there about breslau they linger and higgle at their leisure for three weeks longer and if their junction with the austrians in neisse neighborhood is to be prevented or impeded it is friedrich not ziethen that will have to do it  junction in neisse neighborhood oppeln where it should have been which is some 35 miles from neisse friedrich did by velocity and dexterity contrive to prevent but junction somewhere he probably knows to be inevitable these are among friedrichs famed marches and manoeuvrings these against the swift loudon and his slow russians but we will not dwell on them my readers know the kings manner in such cases have already been on two marches with him and even in these same routes and countries we will say only that the russians were and had been very dilatory loudon much the reverse and their and loudons adversary still more that for five days the russians at length close to breslau august 6th11th kept vaguely cannonading and belching noise and apprehension upon the poor city but without real damage to it and as if merely to pass the time and had gradually pushed out foreposts as far as oppeln towards loudon up their safe right bank of oder that loudon on the first glimpse of these had made his best speed neisseward and did a march or two with good hope but at munsterberg july 22d on the morning of the third or fourth days march was astonished to see friedrich ahead of him nearer neisse than he and that in neisse country there was nothing to be done no russian junction possible there  try it in schweidnitz country then said loudon the russians leave off cannonading breslau cross oder about auras or leubus august 11th12th and loudon after some finessing marches back schweidnitzway cautiously skilfully followed by friedrich anxious to prevent a junction here too or at lowest to do some stroke before it occur a great deal of cunning marching shifting and manoeuvring there is for days round schweidnitz on all sides encampings by friedrich now liegnitz headquarter now wahlstadt now schonbrunn striegauwithout the least essential harm to loudon or likelihood increasing that the junction can be hindered no offer of battle either loudon is not so easy to beat as some the russians come on at a snails pace so loudon thinks it who is extremely impatient but makes no mistakes in consequence keeps himself safe kunzendorf on the edge of the glatz hills his main post and the roads open for his heavyfooted friends  in nicolstadt a march from wahlstadt 16th august there are 60000 russians in front of friedrich 72000 austrians in rear what can he with at the very utmost 57000 do against them now was the time to have fallen upon the king and have consumed him between two fires as it is thought might have been possible had they been simultaneous and both of them done it with a will but simultaneity was difficult and the will itself was wanting or existed only on loudons side nothing of the kind was attempted on the confederate part still less on friedrichswho stands on his guard and from the heights about has at last to witness what he cannot hinder sees both armies on march austrians from the southeast or kunzendorffreyberg side russians from the northeast or kleinerwitz side wending in many columns by the back of jauer and the back of liegnitz respectively till august 18th they join hands as it is termed or touch mutually by their light troops and on the 19th friedrich now off on another scheme and not witnessing fall into one anothers arms ranked all in one line of posts tempelhof v 58150 can the reichshofrath say our junction is not complete and so ends what we call the prefatory part and the time of close grips seems to be comefriedrich has now nothing for it but to try if he cannot possibly get hold of kunzendorf readers may look in their map and cut off loudons staff of bread loudons and butturlins as well for the whole 130000 are now to be fed by loudon and no slight task he will find it by rushing direct on kunzendorf with such a velocity as friedrich is capable of it is thought he might have managed kunzendorf but he had to mask his design and march by the rear or east side of schweidnitz not by the west side they will think i am making off in despair intending for the strong post of pilzen there with schweidnitz to shelter me in front hoped friedrich morning of the 19th as he marched off on that errand but on approaching in that manner by the bow he found that loudon had been quite sceptical of such despair and at any rate had by the string made sure of kunzendorf and the foodsources august 20th at break of day scouts report the kunzendorf ground thoroughly beset again and loudon in his place there no use marching thitherward fartherwhither now therefore  friedrich knows pilzen what an admirable post it really is except only that schweidnitz will be between the enemy and him and liable to be besieged by them which will never do friedrich on the moment of that news from kunzendorf gets on march not by the east side as intended till the scouts came in but by the west or exposed side of schweidnitzhe stood waiting ready for either route and lost not a moment on his scouts coming in all upon the road by 3 am august 20th and encamps still at an early hour midway between schweidnitz and striegau right wing of him at zedlitz if the reader look on his map left wing at jauernik headquarters bunzelwitz a poor village celebrated ever since in warannals and begins that same evening the earlier or rested part of him begins digging and trenching at a most extraordinary rate according to plan formed no enemy taking heed of him or giving the least molestation this is the worldfamous camp of bunzelwitz upon which it is worth while to dwell for a little  to common eyes the ground hereabouts has no peculiar military strength a wavy champaign with nothing of abrupt or high much of it actual plain excellent for cavalry and their workthis latter too is an advantage which friedrich has well marked and turns to use in his scheme the area he takes in is perhaps some seven or eight miles long by as many broad on the west side runs the stillyoung striegau water defensive more or less and on the farther bank of it green little hills their steepest side streamward inexpugnable schweidnitz with its stores of every kind especially with its store of cannon and of bread is on the left or east part of the circuit in the intervening space are peaceable farmvillages spots of bog knolls some of them with wood not a village bog knoll but friedrich has caught up and is busy profiting by swift bursche dig ourselves in here and be ready for any quotity and quantity of them if they dare attack  and 25000 spades and picks are at work under such a fieldengineer as there is not in the world when he takes to that employment at all hours night and day 25000 of them half the army asleep other half digging wheeling shovelling plying their utmost and constant as time himself these in three days will do a great deal of spadework batteries redoubts big and little spare not for digging here is ground for cavalry too post them here there to bivouac in readiness should our batteries be unfortunate long trenches there are and also short batteries commanding every ingate and under them are mines we will blow you and our batteries both into the air in case of capture think the prussians the common men at least if friedrich do not mines and that of being blown into the air says tempelhof are always very terrible to the common man in places there are trenches 16 feet broad by 16 deep says an admiring archenholtz who was in it and we have two of those flatterminen scattermines blowingup apparatuses to each battery archenholtz ii 262 c  bunzelwitz jauernik tschechen and peterwitz all fortified continues archenholtz wurben in the centre is like a citadel looking down upon striegau water heavy cannon plenty of them we have brought from schweidnitz we have 460 pieces of cannon in all and 182 mines wurben our citadel and centre is about five miles from schweidnitz our intrenchmentsyou already heard what gulfs some of them were before the lines are palisades stormposts the things we call spanish horse chevauxdefrisewoods we have in abundance in our circuit and axes busy for carpentries of that kind there are four intrenched knolls 24 big batteries capable of playing beautifully all like pieces in a concert four knolls elaborately intrenched clothed with cannon founded upon flattermines try where you will to enter such torrents of deathshot will converge on you and a concert of 24 big batteries begin their music  on the third day loudon looking into this thing which he has not minded hitherto finds it such a thing as he never dreamt of before a thing strong as gibraltar in a mannerwhich it will be terribly difficult to attack with success for eight days more friedrich did not rest from his spadework made many changes and improvements till he had artificially made a very stolpen of it a plauen or more cogniazzo the austrian veteran says plauen and dauns often ridiculed precautions there were nothing to it not as if bunzelwitz had been so inaccessible as our sheer rocks there but because it is a masterpiece of art in which the principles of tactics are combined with those of fieldfortification as never before tielke grows quite eloquent on it a masterpiece of judgment in ground says he and the treatment of it a model of sound true and consummate fieldengineering tielke iii bunzelwitz which is praised as an attractive piece oesterreichischer veteran iv 79 cited in preuss ii 285  ziethen

from ziethen lie the angry enemies austrians south and nearest about kunzendorf and freyberg russians are on the top of striegau hills which are well known to some of us russian headquarter is

sense not their fencing chasot is gone to lubeck long since will perhaps pay friedrich a visit by and by their fiery gessler is gone much farther and will never visit anybody more many were the reapers then and they are mostly gone to rest here is a new harvest the old sickles are still here but the hands that wielded them steady answers the herr general profoundly aware of all that but averse to words upon it  fancy loudons astonishment on the third day while we have sat consulting how to attack him there is heunattackable shall we say unattackable loudon will not consent to think him though butturlin has quite consented difficult murderous thinks loudon but possible certain could butturlin but be persuaded and tries all his rhetoric on butturlin shame on us urges the ardent loudon imperial and czarish majesties kriegshofrath russian senate vienna petersburg versailles and all the worldwhat are they expecting of us to ourselves it seemed certain and here we sit helplessly gazing loudon is very diligent upon butturlin do but believe that it is possible a plan can be made many plans the problem is solved if only your excellency will believe which butturlin never quite will  nobody knows better than friedrich in what perilous crisis he now stands beaten here what army or resource has he left silesia is gone from him by every likelihood the game is gone this of bunzelwitz is his last card this is now his one stronghold in the worldwe need not say if he is vigilant in regard to this from about the fourth day when his engineering was only complete in outline he particularly expects to be attacked on the fifth night he concludes it will be knowing loudons way towards sunset that evening august 25th all the tents are struck tents cookeries every article of baggage his own among the rest are sent to wurben heights to schweidnitz archenholtz says but has misremembered the ground cleared for action and horse and foot every man marches out and stands ready under arms  contrary to everybodys expectation not a shot was heard that night nor the next night nor the next but the practice of vigilance was continued punctual as mathematics at a given hour of the afternoon tents are all struck tents and furnitures field swept clear and the 50000 in their places wait under arms next morning nothing having fallen out the tents come back the army half of it at once or almost the whole of it according to aspects rests goes to sleep if it can by night there is vigilance is work and no sleep it is felt to be a hard life but a necessary  nor in these labors of detail is the king wanting far from it the king is there as ear and eye of the whole for the king alone there is near the chief battery on the pfarrberg namely in the clump of trees there a small tent and a bundle of straw where he can lie down if satisfied to do so if all is safe he will do so but perhaps even still he soon awakens again and strolls about among his guardparties or warms himself by their fires one evening among the orders is heard this item and remember a lock of straw will youthat i may not have to sleep on the ground as last night seyfarth ii 16 n many anecdotes are current to this day about his pleasant homely ways and affabilities with the sentry people and the rugged hospitalities they would show him at their watchfires good evening children the same to thee fritz what is that you are cookingand would try a spoonful of it in such company while the rough fellows would forbid smoking dont you know he dislikes it no smoke away the king would insist  mythical mainly these stories but the dialect of them true and very strange to us like that of an arab sheik among his tribesmen like that of a man whose authority needs no keeping up but is a law of nature to himself and everybody he permits a little bantering even a rough joke against himself if it spring sincerely from the complexion of the fact the poor men are terribly tired of this work such bivouacking packing unpacking and continual waiting for the tug of battle which never comes biscuits meal are abundant enough but fleshmeat wearing low above all no right sleep to be had friedrichs own table i should think is very sparingly beset a cup of chocolate is my dinner on marchingdays wrote he once this season certainly his lodgingdamp ground and the straw sometimes forgottenis none of the best and thus it has to last night after night and day after day on september 8th general bulow went out for a little butchersmeat did bring home 200 head of neat cattle i fear not very fat and 300 sheep tempelhof v 172  loudon all this while is laboring as man seldom did to bring butturlin to the striking place who continues flaccid loudon screwing and rescrewing altogether in vain loudon does not deny the difficulty but insists on the possibility the necessity councils of war are bid remonstrances encouragements we will lend you a corps answers butturlin but as to our army cooperatingexcept in that faroff way it is too dangerous meanwhile provisions are running low the time presses a formal plan presented by the ardent loudonloudon himself to take the deadlier partmark it noble russian gentlemen and you to have the easiersurely that is loyal and not in the old catspaw way but in that too there is an offence butturlin and the russians grumble to themselves and you to take all the credit as you did at kunersdorf a mere adjunct or auxiliary we and we are a feldmarschall and you what is your rank and seniority in short they will not do it and in the end coldly answer a corps if you like but the whole army positively no upon which loudon goes home half mad and has a colic for eightandforty hours this was september 2d the final sour refusalnearly heartbreaking to loudon provisions are run so low withal the campaign season all but done result nothing not even an attempt at a result  no prussian from friedrich downwards had doubted but the attack would be the grand upshot and fiery consummation of these dark continual hardships and nocturnal watchings thrice over on different nights the prussians imagined loudon to have drawn out intending actual business and thrice over to have drawn in againinstead of once only as was the fact and then taken colic tempelhof v 170 friedrichs own notion that over dinner glass in hand the two generals had in the enthusiasm of such a moment agreed to do it but on sober inspection found it too dubious oeuvres de frederic v 125 appears to be ungrounded whether they could in reality have stormed him had they all been willing is still a question and must continue one wednesday evening 9th september there was much movement noticeable in the russian camp also among the austrian there are regiments foot and horse coming down hitherward meaning to try it then thought friedrich and got at once under arms suppositions were various but about 10 at night the whole russian camp went up in flame and next morning the russians were not there  russian main army clean gone already got to jauer as we hear and beck with a division to see them safe across the oderonly czernichef and 20000 being left as a corps of loudons who with all austrians are quiet in their heights of kunzendorf again and thus on the twentieth morning september 10th this strange business terminated shot of those batteries is drawn again powder of those mines lifted out again no firing of your heavy artillery at all nor even of your light after such elaborate charging and shoving of it hither and thither for the last three weeks the prussians cease their bivouacking nightly striking of tents and encamp henceforth in a merely human manner their spanish riders frisian horse chevauxdefrise others of us call them their stormpales and elaborate wooden engineerings they gradually burn as fuel in the cold nights finding loudon absolutely quiescent and that the thing is over for the present one huge peril handsomely staved away though so many others impend  by way of accelerating butturlin friedrich next day september 11th despatched general platen with some 8000 so i will guess them from tempelhofs enumeration by battalions to get round the flank of butturlin and burn his magazines platen a valiant skilful person did this business as he was apt to do in a shining style shot dexterously forward by the skirts of butturlin heard of a big wagenburg or travelling magazine of his at gostyn over the polish frontier in fact his travelling breadbasket arranged as wagonfortress in and round some convent there with trenches brick walls cannon and defence considered strong enough for so important a necessary of the road september 15th platen before cockcrow burst out suddenly on this wagonfortress with its cannons trenches brick walls and defensive russians stormed into it with extraordinary fury fixed bayonets ordered he at the main point of their defence not a shot till they are tumbled outtumbled them out accordingly into flight and ruin took of prisoners 1845 seven cannon and burnt the 5000 provender wagons which was the soul of the adventure and directly got upon the road again tempelhof v 281293

samecompletely destroying the travelling haversack or general roadbag of butturlin a butturlin that will have to hasten forward or starve  which done platen not waiting the kings new orders but anticipating them to the kings great contentment marched instantly with his best speed and skilfulest contrivance of routes and methods not back to the king but onward towards colbergwhich he knows as readers shall anon to be much in need of him at presentand without injury though begirt all the way by a hurricane of cossacks and light people doing their utmost upon him arrived there september 25th victoriously cutting in across the besieging party and will again be visible enough when we arrive there indignant butturlin chased violently eager to punish platen but could get no hold found platen was clear off to pommernon what errand butturlin knew well if not so well what to do in consequence reinforce our poor besiegers there and again reinforce to enormous amounts 40000 of them in the endget bread from them withaland before long flow bodily thitherward for bread to ourselves and for their poor sake that on the whole was what butturlin did  friedrich stayed at bunzelwitz above a fortnight after butturlin why did not friedrich stay altogether and wait here said some triumphantly soon after that was not well possible his schweidnitz magazine is worn low not above a months provision now left for so many of us the rate of sickness too gets heavier and heavier in this bunzelwitz circuit in fine it is greatly desirable that loudon who has nothing but bohemia for outlook should be got to start thither as soon as possible and be quickened homeward september 25th26th friedrich will be under way again  and in the mean while may not we employ this fortnight of quiescence in noting certain other things of interest to him and us which have occurred or are occurring in other parts of the field of war of henri in saxony we undertook to say nothing and indeed hithertobig daun with his lacys and reichsfolk lying so quiescent tethered by considerations daun continually detaching watching for support of his loudon and russians and their thriceimportant operation which has just had such a finishthere could almost nothing be said nothing hitherto or even henceforth as it proves except mutual vigilances multifarious bickerings manoeuvrings affairs of posts sharp bits of cutting seidlitz green kleist and other sharp people there which must not detain us in such speed but there are two points the britannicfrench campaign and the third siege of colberg which in no rate of speed could be quite omitted     of ferdinands battle of vellinghausen 15th16th july and the campaign 1761  vellinghausen is a poor little moory hamlet in paderborn country near the south or left bank of the lippe river lies to the north of soestsome 15 miles to your lefthand there as you go by rail from aachen to paderbornbut nobody now has ever heard of it at soest or elsewhere famous as it once became a hundred years ago ferdinand had taken a singular position there in the early days of july 1761 here is brief notice of that affair and of some results or adjuncts still more important which it had  this year ferdinands campaign is more difficult than ever choiseul having made a quite spasmodic effort towards hanover while negotiating for peace two armies counting together 160000 men in great completeness of equipment choiseul has got on foot against ferdinands of 95000 had a fine dashing plan toodevised by himself something of a soldier he too and full of what the messrooms call dashnot so bad a plan of the dashing kind say judges but it was marred sadly in one point that broglio on issuing from his hessian winterquarters is not to be sole general that soubise from the lowerrhine country is to be cogeneralsuch the inexorable will of pompadour this clause of the business ferdinand at an early stage appears to have guessed or discerned might for him be the saving clause  now as formerly ferdinands first grand business is to guard lippstadtguard it now from these two generalsand singular to see instead of opposing the junction of them he has submitted cheerfully to let them join and in the course of a week or two after taking the field is found to be on the western or outmost flank of soubise crushing him up towards broglio not otherwise and has partly by accident taken a position at vellinghausen which infinitely puzzles broglio and soubise when they rush into junction at soest july 6th and study the thing with their own eyes for eight whole days in concert what continual reconnoitring galloping about of highplumed gentlemen together or apart what memoiring mutual consulting beating of brains to little purpose during those eight days  ferdinand stands in moory difficult ground length of him about eight miles looking eastward with his left at vellinghausen and the lippe centre of him is astride of the ahse centre partly and right wing wholly are on the south side of ahse which is a branch of lippe and in front he has various little hamlets kirchdenkern kirchdenkern for there are three or four other denkerns thereabouts scheidingen wambeln and others and his right wing is covered farther by a quaggy brook which runs into the abovesaid ahse and is a subbranch of lippe at most of these villages ferdinand has thrown up something of earthworks there are bogs rough places woods all are turned to advantage ferdinand is in a strongish but yet a dangerous position and will give difficulties and does give endless dubieties to these highplumed gentlemen galloping about with their spyglasses for eight days one possibility they pretty soon discern in him his left flank rests on lippe yes but his right flank is in the air has nothing to rest onhere surely is some possibility for us a strong position that of his but if driven out of it by any method he has no retreat is tumbled back into the angle where ahse and lippe meet and into the little town of hamm there where his magazine is what a fate for him if we succeed  ferdinand by the incessant reconnoitring and other symptoms judges what is coming concludes he will be attacked in this posture of his and on the whole what critics now reckon very wise and very courageous of him determines to stand his chance in it the consultations of broglio and soubise are a thing unique to look upon spread over volumes of official record and about a volume and a half even of bourcet where it is still almost amusing to read memoires historiques that is to say for most part selection of official papers sur la guerre que les francais ont soutenue en allemagne depuis 1757 jusquau 1762 par m de bourcet lieutenantgeneral des armees du roi 3 tomes paris 1792worthily done but occupied twothirds of it with this vellinghausen and the paltry campaign of 1761 and ending in helpless downbreak on both parts of strategic faculty nobody supposes they had much and nearly all of it is in broglio soubise being strong in courtfavor only exquisitely polite they both strive to be and under the exquisite politeness what infirmities of temper splenetic suspicions and in fact mutual hatred lay hidden could never be accurately known attack him sunday next on the 13th so at the long last both of them had said and then on more reflection broglio afterwards or not till the 15th m le prince till i reconnoitre ye  and drive in his outposts m le marechals will is always mine tuesday 15th reconnoitre him drive him in be it so then answers soubise with extreme politenessbut thinking in his own mind or thought to be thinking wants to do it himself or to get the credit of doing it as in former cases and bring me into disgrace not quite an insane notion either on soubises part say some who have looked into the brogliosoubise controversywhich far be it from any of us at this or at any time to do here are the facts that ensued  tuesday july 15th 1761 broglio reconnoitred with intensity all day drove in all ferdinands outposts and about six in the evening seeing hope of surprise or spurred by some notion of doing the feat by himself suddenly burst into onslaught on ferdinands position vellinghausen yonder and the woody strengths aboutcould not we get hold of that it would be so convenient tomorrow morning granby and the english are in camp about vellinghausen

others in a highly satisfactory waymit unbeschreiblicher tapferkeit says mauvillon on this occasion again broglio truly has burst out into enormous cannonade musketade and cavalrywork in this part and struggles at it almost four hoursa furious and especially a very noisy business charging recharging through the woods therebut met in this manner finds he can make nothing of it and about 10 at night leaves off till a new morning  next morning about 4 broglio having diligently warned soubise overnight recommenced again very fiercely and with loud cannonading but with result worse than before ferdinand overnight while broglio was warning soubise had considerably strengthened his left wing hereby detachments from the right or antisoubise wing judging with good foresight how soubise would act and accordingly while poor broglio kept storming forward with his best ability and got always hurled back again soubise took matters easy had understood the hour of attack to be soandso had understood this and that and on the whole except summoning or threatening in the most languid way one outlying redoubt redoubt of scheidingen on ferdinands right wing did nothing or next to nothing for behoof of his broglio who hour after hour finds himself ever worse bestedthose granby people proving indescribable once more their wutgenau also with his hanoverians not being absent as they rather were last nightand about 10 in the morning gives up the bad job and sets about retiring if retiring be now permissible which it is not altogether ferdinand watching intently through his glass the now silent broglio discerns some confusion in the marechal yonderand orders a general charge of the left wing upon broglio which considerably quickened his retreat and broke it into flight and distressful wreck and capture in some partsregiment rouge for one item falling wholly men cannon flags and furniture to that maxwell and his brigade  ferdinand lost by the indistinct accounts from

at the sign of the marquis of granby which is now everywhere prevalent and splendentthe beer we will hope good and as this is a thing still said both over beer and higher liquors and perhaps is liable to be too much insisted on i will give from a caudid bystander who knows the matter well what probably is a more solid and circumstantially correct opinion speaking of ferdinands skill of management and of how very composite a kind his army was major mauvillon has these words  the first in rank of ferdinands force were the english about a fourth part of the whole army braver troops when on the field of battle and under arms against the enemy you will nowhere find in the world that is a truthand with that the sum of their military merits ends in the first place their infantry consists of such an unselected handoverhead miscellany of people that it is highly difficult to preserve among them even a shadow of good disciplineof mannszucht in regard to plunder drinking and the like does not mean kriegszucht or drill their cavalry indeed is not so constituted but a foolish love for their horses makes them astonishingly plunderous of forage and thus they exhaust a district far faster in that respect than do the germans  officers commissions among them are all had by purchase from which it follows that their officers do not trouble their heads about the service and understand of it very very few excepted absolutely nothing whatever what a charming set of officersand this goes from the ensign up to the general their homecustoms incline them to the indulgences of life and nearly without exception they all expect to have ample and comfortable means of sleep hear hear this leads them often into military negligences which would sound incredible were they narrated to a soldier to all this is added a quiet natural arrogance uebermuthvery quiet mostly unconscious and as if inborn and coming by discernment of mere factswhich tempts them to despise the enemy as well as the danger and as they very seldom think of making any surprisal themselves they generally take it for granted that the enemy will as little  this arrogance however had furthermore a very bad consequence for their relation to the rest of the army it is well known how much these people despise all foreigners this of itself renders their cooperating with troops of other nations very difficult but in this case there was the circumstance that as the army was in english pay they felt a strong tendency to regard their fellowsoldiers and copartners as a sort of subordinate warvalets who must be ready to put up with anythingwhich was far indeed from being the opinion of the others concerned the others had not the smallest notion of consenting to any kind of inferior treatment or consideration in respect of them to the hanoverians especially from known political feelings they were at heart for most part specially indisposed and this mode of thinking was capable of leading to very dangerous outbreaks the hanoverians a dull steady people brave as need be but too slow for anything but foot service considered silently this war to be their war and that all the rest english as well were here on their and britannic majestys account  think what difficulties ferdinands were and what his merit in quietly subduing them while to the cursory observer they were invisible and nobody noticed them but himself mauvillon ii 270272  yes doubtless he needed to know his kinds of men to regard intensely the chemic affinities and natural properties to keep his phosphorescents his nitres and charcoals well apart to get out of these english what they were capable of giving him namely heavy strokesand never ask them for what they had not them or the others but treat each according to his kind just candid consummately polite an excellent manager of men as well as of warmovements though voltaire found him shockingly defective in esprit the english i think he generally quartered by themselves employed them oftenest under the hereditary princea man of swift execution and prone to strokes like themselves oftenest under the erbprinz says mauvillon till after the fight of kloster kampen it began to be noticed that there was a change in that respect and the messrooms whispered by accident or notwhich shall remain mysterious to me in battle after battle he got the most unexceptionable sabring and charging from lord granby and the difficult english element and never was the least discord heard in his campnor could even sackville at minden tempt him into a loud word  but enough of english soldiering and battling with the french for about two months prior to this of vellinghausen and for more than two months after there is going on by special envoys between pitt and choiseul a lively peacenegotiation which is of more concernment to us than any battle congress at augsburg split upon formalities preliminaries and never even tried to meet but france and england are actually busy each country has sent its envoy the sieur de bussy a tricky gentleman known here of old is choiseuls whom pitt is on his guard against mr hans stanley a lively clearsighted person of whom i could never hear elsewhere is pitts at paris and it is in that city between choiseul and stanley with pitt warily and loftily presiding in the distance that the main stress of the negotiation lies pitt is lofty haughty but very fine and noble no king or kaiser could be more sincere severe though most softshining high earnest steady like the stars artful choiseul again flashes out in a cheerily exuberant way and stanleys despatches about choiseul ce fou plein desprit as friedrich once christens him about choiseul and the france then round him and the effects of vellinghausen in society and the likeare the liveliest reading one almost anywhere meets with in that kind in thackeray i 505579 and especially ii 520626 is the stanleyandpitt correspondence stanley went 23d may returned got his passports for returning september 20th choiseul frankly admits that he has come to the worst ready for concessions but the question is what canada is gone for instance of canada you will allow us nothing but our poor fisherpeople toiling in the newfoundland waters cannot they have a rock to dry their fish on isle of miquelon or the like not the breadth of a blanketthat is pitts private expression i believe and for certain that in polite official language is his inexorable determination you shall go home out of those countries messieurs america is to be english or yankee not frangcee that has turned out to be the decree of heaven and we will stand by that  so that choiseul soon satisfies himself it will be a hard bargain this with pitt and turns the more assiduously to the majesty of spain baby carlos our old friend who has sore grudges of his own against the english standing grievance of campeachy logwood of bitter naples reminiscences and enough else turns to baby carlos time after time with his pathetic see your most catholic majesty and by rapid degrees induces most catholic majesty to go wholly into the adventure with most christian dittoand to say at length or to let choiseul say for him by way of cautious firststep 15th july a date worth remembering if the reader please might not most catholic majesty be allowed perhaps to mediate a little in this business most catholic majesty answers pitt with a flash as if from the empyrean who sent for most catholic majestyand the matter catches fire totally explodes and spain too declares war in what way is generally known  details are not permitted us the catastrophe we shall give afterwards and can here say only first that old earl marischal friedrichs spanish envoy is a good deal in england coming and going at this timeon that interesting business of the kintore inheritance doubtlessand has been beautifully treated been pardoned disattainted permitted to inheritby the king on the instant by the parliament so soon as possible kings patent is of 30th april 1760 dated 29th may 1759 act of parliament to follow shortly august 16th 1760 act having passed is marischals public presentation to his majesty late majesty old gazettes in gentlemans magazine for 1760 xxx 201 392and is of a naturally grateful turn secondly that in the profoundest secrecy penetrable only to eyes near at hand and that see in the dark a celebrated bourbon family compact was signed august 15th 1761 ten days before the digging at bunzelwitz began of which the first news to the olympian man conveyed by marischal as is thought was likelike news of dead pythons pretending to revive upon him and thirdly that postponing the catastrophe and recommending the above two dates 15th july 15th august to careful readers we must hasten to colberg for the present     third siege of colberg  readers had some while ago a flying note which we promised to take up again about tottlebens procedures and a third siege of colberg coming siege we have chanced to see there accordingly is and a platen gone to help against it siege after infinite delays and haggles has at length comeuncommonly vivid during the final days of bunzelwitzand is and has been and continues to be much in the kings thoughts probably a matter of more concernment to him before during and after bunzelwitz though the pitt catastrophe going on simultaneously is still more important if he knew it than anything else befalling in the distance let us now give a few farther indications on that matter  truce between werner and tottleben expired may 12th but for five weeks more nothing practical followed except diligent reinforcing revictualling and extraordinary fortifying of colberg and its environs on the prussian parteugen of wurtemberg direct from restock and his antiswede business eugen 12000 strong with a werner and other such among them taking head charge outside the walls old heyde again as commandant within while on the russian part under general romanzow there is a most tortoiselike advanceexcept that the tortoise carries all his resources with him and romanzows multifarious and enormous are scattered over seas and lands and need endless waiting for in the intervals of crawling  this is the romanzow who failed at colherg once already on the heel of zorndorf in 1758 if readers recollect and is the more bound to be successful now from sea and from land for five weeks there is rumor of a romanzow in overwhelming force and with intentions very furious upon colbergupon the outposts under werner as first point five weeks went before anything of romanzow was visible even to werner 22d june at coslin forty miles to eastward after which his advance such waiting for the ships for the artilleries the this and the that was slower than ever and for about eight weeks more he haggles along through coslin through corlin belgard again flowing slowly forward upon werners outposts like a summer glacier with its rubbishes or like a slow lavatidea great deal of smoke on each side of him owing to the cossacks as usual romanzows progress is of the slowest and it is not till august 19th that he practically gets possession of corlin belgard and those outposts on the persante river and comes within sight of colberg and his problem by which time he finds eugen of wurtemberg encamped and intrenched still ahead of him still nearer colberg and likely to give him what they call de la tablature or extremely difficult music to play  it was on august 19th very eve of friedrichs going into bunzelwitz that romanzowwerner for the sake of those poor towns he holds generally retiring without bombardment or utter conflagrationhad got hold of corlin and of the river persante with quetzin and degow if anybody knew them as his main posts there and was actually now within sight of colbergonly 7 or 8 miles west of him and a river more or less in his waywhen singular to see eugen of wurtemberg has rooted himself into the ground farther inward environing colberg with a fortified camp as with a second wall and it will be a difficult problem indeed  but sea armaments swedishrussian with endless siegematerial and redhot balls are finally at hand and this pitiful colberg must be done were it only by falling flat on it and smothering it by weight of numbers and of redhot iron the day before yesterday august 17th after such rumoring and such manoeuvring as there has been six russian shipsofwar showed themselves in colberg roads and three of them tried some shooting on heydes workpeople busy at a redoubt on the beach but hit nothing and went away till romanzow himself should come romanzow come there is utmost despatch and within the eight days following the russian ships and then the swedish as well have all got to their moorings12 sail of the line with 42 more of the frigate and gunboat kind 54 ships in alland from august 24th especially from august 28th bombardment to the very uttermost is going on tempelhof v 311 bombardment by every method from sea and from land continues diligent for the next fortnightwith little or no result so diligent are eugen and veteran heyde  september 4th the swedishrussian gunboats have been much shot down by heydes batteries on the beach no success had owing to heyde and eugen paltry little colberg as impossible as bunzelwitz it seems double our diligence therefore that is romanzows and everybodys sentiment here romanzow comes closer in september 4th besieges in form since not colberg eugens camp or brazen wall of colberg and there rises in and round this poor little colberg a 2000 balls daily redhot and other such a volcano as attracts the eyes of all the world thither  september 12th news yesterday of reinforcement men and provender coming from stettin is to be at treptow on the 13th werner night of the 11th stealthily sets out to meet it it in the first place then joined with it to take by rearward a certain inconvenient battery which romanzow is building to westward of us out that way to demolish said battery and be generally distressful to the rear of romanzow at treptow after his difficult nights march werner is resting secure now of the adventuretoo contemptuous of his slow russians as appeared who for once surprise him and at and round treptow next morning werner finds himself suddenly in a most awkward predicament werner one of the rapidest and stormiest of skilful men plunged valiantly into the affair would still have managed it they say had not in some sudden swoopcharge or something of critical or vital naturerapid werners horse got shot and fallen with him whereby not only the charge failed but werner himself was taken prisoner a loss of very great importance and grievous to everybody though i believe the reinforcement and supply for this time got mostly through and the dangerous battery was got demolished by other means seyfarth beylagen iii 238 tempelhof v 314 this is romanzows first item of success this of getting such a werner snatched out of the game and sent to petersburg instead as we shall hear and other items fell to romanzow thenceforth by the aid of time and hunger  in the way of storming battering or otherwise capturing eugens camp not to speak of heydes town romanzow finds on trial after trial that he can do as good as nothing and his unwieldy seacomrades equinoctial gales coming on them too are equally worthless september 19th a week after this of werner tenth day after bunzelwitz had ended romanzow made his fiercest attempt that way fiercest and last furious extremely from 2 in the morning onwards had for some time hold of the important green redoubt but was still more furiously battered and bayoneted out again with the loss of above 3000 men and tried that no farther impossible by that method but he can stand between the eugenheyde people and supplies and by obstinacy hunger them out this added to the fruitless bombardment is now his more or less fruitful industry  in the end of september the effects of bunzelwitz are felt platen after burning the butturlin magazine at gostyn has hastened hither in what style we know blaten arrives 25th september cuts his way

many as you like my romanzow and in the beginning of october came rolling thitherward bodily hoping they say to make a maxen of it upon those eugens and platens but after a fortnights survey of them found there was not the least feasibilityand that he himself must go home on the score of hunger which he did november 2d leaving romanzow reinforced at discretion 40000 but with him too provisions

his goods first to pilzen that fine post on the east side of schweidnitz and from that straightwaysouthwestward two marches fartherto neisse neighborhood grossnossen the name of the place loudon making little dispute or none in neisse are abundant magazines living upon these friedrich intends to alarm loudons rearward country and draw him towards bohemia as must have gradually followed and would at oncehad loudon been given to alarms which he was not loudon very privately has quite different game afield loudon merely detaches this and the other small corps to look after friedrichs operations which probably he believes to be only a feintand before a week passes friedrich will have news he little expects  friedrich pausing at grossnossen and perhaps a little surprised to find no loudon meddling with him pushes out first one party and then anotherdalwig bulow towards landshut hillcountry to threaten loudons bohemian roadswho singular to say do not hear the least word of loudon thereabouts a loudon strangely indifferent to this new enterprise of ours on the third day of grossnossen friday october 2d friedrich detaches general lentulus to rearward or the way we came for news of loudon rearward too lentulus sees nothing whatever of loudon but from the rumor of the country and from two prussian garrisonsoldiers whom he found wandering abouthe hears with horror and amazement that loudon by a sudden pantherspring the night before last has got hold of schweidnitz now his wholly since 5 am of yesterday and a strong austrian garrison in it by this time that was the news lentulus brought home to his king the sorest jobspost of all this war  truly a surprising enterprise this of loudons and is allowed by everybody to have been admirably managed loudon has had it in his head for some timeever since that colic of fortyeight hours i should guess upon the wrecks of which it might well rise as a new daystar he kept it strictly in his own head nobody but daun and the kaiser had hint of it both of whom assented and agreed to keep silence  on friedrichs removal towards neisse and threatening of bohemia says my note on this subject loudons time had come friedrich had disappeared to southwestward saturday september 26th gone to pilzen reported loudons scouts rests there over sunday gone to sigeroth 28th gone to grossnossen tuesday september 29th tempelhof v 330 that will do thinks loudon who has sat immovable at kunzendorf all this whileand wednesday 30th instantly proceeds to business  draws out about 10 am of wednesday all round schweidnitz at some miles distance a ring or complete girdle of croatcossack people blocking up every path and road nobody to pass this day towards schweidnitz much less into it on any pretext that is the duty of the croat people to another active officer he intrusts the task of collecting from the neighboring villages outside the croat girdle as many ladders planks and the like as will be requisite which also is punctually done for the attack itself which is to be fourfold our picked officers are chosen with the 20 best battalions in the army czernichef is apprised who warmly assents and offers every help800 of your grenadiers answers loudon no more needed loudons arrangements for management of the ladders for punctuality about the routes the times the simultaneity are those of a perfect artist no friedrich could have done better  about 4 in the afternoon all the captains and battalions with their ladders and furnitures everybody with instruction very pointed and complete are assembled at kunzendorf loudon addresses the troops in a few fiery words assures himself of victory by them promises them 10060 pounds in lieu of plunder which he strictly prohibits officers had better make themselves acquainted with the four routes they are to take in the dark proper also to set all your watches by the chief generals that there be no mistake as to time in tempelhof v 332349 and archenholtz ii 272280 all these details at 9 all being now dark and the croat girdle having gathered itself closer round the place since nightfall the four divisions march to their respective startingplaces will wait there silent and about 2 in the morning each at its appointed minute step forward on their business with fixed bayonets all of them no musketry permitted till the works are won loudon will wait at the village of schonbrunn not warkotschs schonbrunn of which by and by and which also is not far see archenholtz ii 287 and correct his mistake of the two placesat schonbrunn within short distance give loudon notice when you are within 600 yardsthere shall if desirable be reinforcements farther orders loudon knows schweidnitz like his own bedroom he was personally there in leuthen time improving the works by nocturnal croat parties in the latter part of bunzelwitz time and since then by deserters and otherwisehe knows the condition of the garrison of the commandant and of every essential point has calculated that the garrison is hardly third part of what it ought to be3800 in whole and many of them loose deserter fellows special artillerymen instead of about 400 only 191most important of all that commandant zastrow is no wizard in his trade and on the whole that the enterprise is likely to succeed  zastrow has been getting married lately and has many things to think of besides schweidnitz some accounts say this was his weddingnightwhich is not true but only that he had meant to give a ball this last night of september and perhaps did give it dancing over before 2 let us hope something of a jolterhead seemingly though solid and honest i observe he is a kind of butt or laughingstock of friedrichs and has yielded some gleams of momentary fun he and this marriage of his between prince henri and the king in the tragic gloom all round schoning ii soepius nothing so surprises me in friedrich as his habitual inattention to the state of his garrisons he has the best of commandants and also the worst tauentzien in breslau heyde in colberg unsurpassable in the world in glatz a do in schweidnitz a zastrow both of whom cost him dear opposition sneers secretly it is as they happen to have come to hand which has not much truth though some tauentzien he chose do was fouquets choice not his zastrow he did choose heyde he had by accident of heyde he had never heard till the defence of colberg began to be a worlds wonder and in regard to his garrisons it is indisputable they were often left palpably defective in quantity and quality and more than once fatally gave way at the wrong moment we can only say that friedrich was bitterly in want of men for the field that a garrisonregiment was always reckoned an inferior article and that friedrich in the press of his straits had often had to say well these plainly helots not spartans these will have to do for which he severely suffered and perhaps repentedwho knows  zastrow in spite of loudons precautionary girdle of croats and the cares of a coming ball had got sufficient inkling of something being in the wind and was much on the walls all day he and his officers scanning with their glasses and their guesses the surrounding phenomena to little purpose at night he sent out patrols kept sputtering with musketry and an occasional cannon into the vacant darkness we are alert you see herr loudon in a word took what measures he could poor manvery stupid measures thinks tempelhof and almost worse than none especially this of sputtering with musketryand hoped always there would be no attack or none to speak of till in fine between 2 and 3 in the morning his patrols gallop in austrians on march and zastrow throwing out a rocket or two descries in momentary illumination that the fact is verily here  his defence four of the five several forts attacked at once was of a confused character but better than could have been expected loudons columns came on with extraordinary vigor and condensed impetuosity stormed the outworks everywhere and almost at once got into the shelter of the coveredway but on the main wall or in the scaling part of their business were repulsed in some places twice or thrice and had a murderous struggle of very chaotic nature in the dark element no picture of it in the least possible or needful here in one place a powdermagazine blew up with about 400 of themblown said rumor with no certainty by an indignant prussian artilleryman to whom they had refused quarter in another place the 800 russian grenadiers came unexpectedly upon a chasm or bridgeless interstice between two ramparts and had to halt suddenlytill says rumor again with still less certainty their officers insisting with the rearward part forward forward enough of front men were tumbled in to make a roadway this was the story current archenholtz ii 275 greatly exaggerated i have no doubt what we know is that these russians did scramble through punctually perform their part of the workand furthermore that having got upon the townwall which was finis to everything they punctually sat down there and reflectively leaning on their muskets witnessed with the gravity and dignity of antique sages superior to money or moneys worth the general plunder which went on in spite of loudons orders  for in fine between 5 and 6 that is in about three hours and a half loudon was everywhere victorious zastrow schweidnitz fortress and all that it held were loudons at discretion loudons one care now was to stop the pillage of the poor townsfolk as the most pressing thing which was not done without difficulty nor completely till after hours of exertion by cavalry regiments sent in the captors had fought valiantly but it was whispered there had been a preliminary of brandy in them certainly except those poor russians nobodys behavior was unexceptionable  the capture of schweidnitz cost loudon about 1400 men he found in schweidnitz besides the garrison all prisoners or killed some 240 pieces of artillery211 heavy guns 135 handmortars say the austrian accounts with stores and munitions in such quantities 89760 musketcartridges 1300000 flints in heldengeschichte vi 651665 the austrian account with lists c for two itemsand all this was a trifle compared to the shock it has brought on friedrichs silesian affairs for in present circumstances it amounts to the actual conquest of a large portion of silesia and for the first time to a real prospect of finishing the remainder next year it is judged to have been the hardest stroke friedrich had in the course of this war our strenuous campaign on a sudden rendered wind and of no worth the enemy to winter in silesia after all silesia to go inevitablyand life along with it what friedrichs black meditations were in the following weeks not close following but poor kuster does not date the king fell ill of gout saw almost nobody never came out and it was whispered the inflexible heart of him was at last breaking that is to say the very axis of this prussian world giving way and for certain there never was in his camp and over his dominions such a gloom as in this october 1761 till at length he appeared on horseback again with a cheerful face and everybody thought to himself ha the world will still roll then kuster lebensrettungen friedrichs des zweyten berlin 1797 p 59 c it is the same innocent reliable kuster whom we cited in salderns case already  this is what loudon had done without any russians except russians to give him eightandforty hours colic and put him on his own shifts and the way in which the kriegshofrath and her imperial majesty the kaiserinn received it is perhaps still worth a word the kaiser who had alone known of loudons scheme and for good reason absolute secrecy being the very soul of it had whispered nothing of it farther to any mortal was naturally overjoyed but the olympian brow of maria theresa when the kaiser went radiant to her with this news did not radiate in response but gloomed indignantly no order from kriegshofrath or me indignant kriegshofrath called it a croatenstreich croatstrick and loudon like prince eugen long since was with difficulty excused this act of disobedience great is authorityand ought to be divinely rigorous if as by no means always happens it is otherwise of divine quality  friedrichs treatment of zastrow was in strong contrast of style here is his letter to that unlucky gentleman who is himself clear that he deserves no blame my dear majorgeneral von zastrowthe misfortune that has befallen me is very grievous but what consoles me in it is to see by your letter that you have behaved like a brave officer and that neither you nor the garrison have brought disgrace or reproach on yourselves i am your wellaffectioned kingfriedrich and in autograph this postscript you may in this occurrence say what francis i after the battle of pavia wrote to his mother all is lost except honor as i do not yet completely understand the affair i forbear to judge of it for it is altogether extraordinaryf  militairlexikon iv 305 306 letter undated there date probably grossnossen october 3d  and never meddled farther with zastrow only left him well alone for the future grant me a courtmartial then said zastrow finding himself fallen so neglected after the peace no use answered friedrich i impute nothing of crime to you but after such a mishap it would be dangerous to trust you with any post or commandand in 1766 granted him on demand his demission instead the poor man then retired to cassel where he lived twenty years longer and was no more heard of he was halfbrother of the general zastrow who got killed by a pandour of long range bullet through both temples from brushwood across the elbe in the first year of this war    chapter ixtraitor warkotsch  friedrichs army was to have cantoned itself round neisse october 3d but on the instant of this fatal schweidnitz news proceeded 3d6th october towards strehlen insteadfriedrich personally on the 5thand took quarters there and in the villages round general cantonment at strehlen in guard of breslau and of neisse both loudon still immovable at kunzendorf attempting nothing on either of those places and carefully declining the risk of a battle which would have been friedrichs game all this continued till the beginning of december when both parties took winterquarters tempelhof v 349 cantoned themselves in the neighboring localitiesczernichef with his russians in glatz country friedrich in breslau as headquarterand the campaign had ended ended in this part without farther event of the least notabilityexcept the following only which a poor man of the name of kappel has recorded for us of which and the astounding sequel to which we must now say something  kappel is a gentlemans groom of those strehlen parts and shall in his own words bring us face to face with friedrich in that neighborhood directly after schweidnitz was lost it is october 5th day or rather night of the day of friedrichs arrival thereabouts most of his army ahead of him and the remainder all under way friedrich and the rearward part of his army are filing about in that new strehlenward movement of theirs under cloud of night in the intricate hillanddale country to post themselves to the best advantage for their double object of covering breslau and neisse both kappel loquitur abridged by kuster whom we abridge  monday night october 5th 1761 the king with two or three attendants still ahead of his army appeared at schonbrunn a schloss and village five or six miles south from strehlen this is the warkotsch schonbrunn not the other near schweidnitz as archenholtz believes see archenholtz ii 287 and the bit of myth he has gone into in consequence and did the owner baron von warkotsch an acquaintance of his the honor of lodging there before bedtimeif indeed the king intended bed at all meaning to be off in four hours hencefriedrich inquired of warkotsch for a trusty man well acquainted with the roads in this country warkotsch mentioned kappel his own groom one who undoubtedly knew every road of the country and who had always behaved as a trusty fellow in the seven years he had been with him let me see him said the king kappel was sent up about midnight king still dressed sitting on a sofa by the fire kappels look was satisfactory kappel knows several roads to strehlen in the darkest night it is the footpath which goes soandso that i want for friedrich knows this country intimately readers remember his worldfamous camp of strehlen with all the diplomacies of europe gathered there through summer in the train of mollwitz ja ihro majestat i know it be ready then at 4  before the stroke of 4 kappel was at the door on masters best horse the kings groom too and led horse a nimble little gray were waiting as 4 struck friedrich came down warkotsch with him unspeakable the honor you have done my poor house besides the kings groom there were a chamberlain an adjutant and two mounted chasers reitende jager which latter had each a lighted lantern in all seven persons including kappel and the king go before us on foot with your lanterns said the king very dark it was and overnight the army had arrived all about some of them just coming in on different roads and paths the king walked above two miles and looked how the regiments were without speaking a word at last as the cannons came up and were still in full motion the king said sharp sharp bursche it will be march directly march the devil it will we are just coming into camp said a cannonier not knowing it was the king  the king said nothing walked on still a little while then ordered blow out the lanterns to horseback now and mounted as we all did me he bade keep five steps ahead five and not more that he might see me for it was very dark not far from the lordship casserey where there is a watermill the king asked me have nt you missed the bridge here a king that does not forget roads and topographies which may come to concern himand bade us ride with the utmost silence and make no jingle as day broke we were in sight of strehlen near by the farm of treppendorf and do you know where the kallenberg lies said the king it must be to left of the town near the hills bring us thither  when we got on the kallenberg it was not quite day and we had to halt for more light after some time the king said to his groom give me my perspective looked slowly all round for a good while and then said i see no austriansground all at our choice then we know where to choose the king then asked me if i knew the road toin fact to several places which in a parish history of those parts would be abundantly interesting but must be entirely omitted here the king called his chamberlain gave some sign which meant beermoney to kappeland i got four eightgroschen pieces three shillings odd a rich reward in those days and was bid tell my master that the king thanked him for the good quarters and assured him of his favor  riding back across country kappel some four or five miles homeward came upon the whole prussian army struggling forward in their various columns two generalsone of them krusemark kings adjutant colonel krusemark not general as kappel thinks who came to know him some weeks afterhad him brought up to whom he gave account of himself how he had been escorting the king and where he had left his majesty behind strehlen say you breslau road devil knows whither we shall all have to go yet observed krusemark and left kappel free kuster  lebensrettungen pp 6676  in those weeks colberg siege pitts catastrophe and high things are impending or completed elsewhere but this is the one thing noticeable hereabouts in regard to strehlen and friedrichs history there what we have to say turns all upon this kappel and warkotsch andafter mentioning only that friedrichs lodging is not in strehlen proper but in woiselwitz a village or suburb almost half a mile off and very negligently guardedwe have to record an adventure which then made a great deal of noise in the world  warkotsch is a rich lord schonbrunn only one of five or six different estates which he has in those parts though not many years ago being younger brother he was a captain in the austrian service regiment botta if you are particular and lay in olmutzwith very dull oulooks not improved i should judge by the fact that silesia and the warkotsch connections were become prussian since this junior entered the austrian army the junior had sown his wild oats and was already getting gray in the beard in that dull manner when about seven years ago his elder brother to whom friedrich had always been kind fell unwell and in the end of 1755 died whereupon the junior saw himself heir and entered on a new phase of things quitted his captaincy quitted his allegiance and was settled here peaceably under his new king in 1756 a little while before this war broke out and at schonbrunn october 5th 1761 has had his majesty himself for guest  warkotsch was not long in riding over to strehlen to pay his court as in duty bound for the honor of such a visit and from that time kappel every day or two had to attend him thither the king had always had a favor for warkotschs late brother as an excellent silesian landlord and manager whose fine domains were in an exemplary condition as under the new warkotsch too they have continued to be always a gracious majesty to this warkotsch as well who is an old soldier withal and man of sense and ingenuity acceptable to friedrich and growing more and more familiar among friedrichs circle of officers now at strehlen  to strehlen is warkotschs favorite ride in the solitary country quite a charming adjunct to your usual dull errand out for air and exercise kappel too remarks about this time that he kappel gets once and again and ever more frequently a letter to carry over to siebenhuben a village three or four miles off the letter always to one schmidt who is catholic curate there letter under envelope well sealedand consisting of two pieces if you finger it judiciously and what is curious the letter never has any address master merely orders punctual for curatus schmidt you know what can this be thinks kappel some secret doubtless perhaps some intrigue which madam must not know ofach herr baron and at your agefifty i am sure kappel a solid fellow concerned for groombusiness alone punctually carries his letters takes charge of the responses too which never have any address and does not too much trouble himself with curiosities of an impertinent nature  to these external phenomena i will at present only add this internal one that an old brother officer of warkotschs a colonel wallis with hussars is now lying at heinrichausay 10 miles from strehlen and about 10 from schonbrunn too or a mile more if you take the siebenhuben way and that all these missives through curatus schmidt are for wallis the hussar colonel and must be a secret not from madam alone how a baron hitherto of honor could all at once become turpissimus the superlative of scoundrels this is even the reasonthe

waits hour after hour master taking his ease with the kings people regardless of the horses and me in this shivery weatherand one must not walk about either for disturbing the kings sleep not till midnight does master emerge and the freezing kappel and quadrupeds get under way under way master breaks out into singular talk about the kings lodging was ever anything so careless nothing but two sentries in the kings anteroom thirteen all the soldiers that are in woiselwitz strehlen not available in less than twenty minutes nothing but woods haggly glens and hills all on to heinrichau how easy to snatch off his majesty um gottes willen my lord dont speak so think if a patrolling prussian were to hear it in the dark pooh pooh answers the herr baron  at schonbrunn in the short hours

it with me not with my ladymy lady not to know of it tush woman but frau kappel has been herself unappeasably running about ever since she got this letter has applied to two fellowservants one after the other who can read writing break it up will you but they would not practical kappel takes the letter up to masters room delivers it with the message what curatus schmidt interrupts my lady who was sitting there herr goodman what is that that is a letter to me answers the goodman what have you to do with it upon which my lady flounces out in a huff and the herr baron sets about writing his answer whatever it may be  kappel and frau are gone to bed frau still eloquent upon the mystery of curatus schmidt when his lordship taps at their door enters in the dark this is for the curatus at 7 oclock tomorrow i leave it on the table here be in time like a good kappel kappel promises his unappeasable that he will actually open this piece before delivery of it upon which she appeases herself and they both fall asleep kappel is on foot betimes next morning kappel quietly pockets his letter still more quietly from a neighboring room pockets his masters big seal petschaft with a view to resealing he then steps out giving his bursch apprentice or undergroom order to be ready in so many minutes you and these two horses specific for speed and in the interim walks over with letter and petschaft to the reverend herr gerlachs for some preliminary business kappel is catholic warkotsch protestant herr gerlach is protestant preacher in the village of schonbrunnmuch hated by warkotsch whose standing order is dont go near that insolent fellow but known by kappel to be a just man faithful in difficulties of the weak against the strong gerlach not yet out of bed listens to the awful story reads the horrid missive warkotsch to colonel wallis you can seize the king living or dead this nighthesitates about copying it as kappel wishes for a good purpose but is encouraged by his wife and soon writes a copy this copy kappel sticks into the old cover seals as usual and with the original safe in his own pocket returns to the stables now his bursch and he mount after a little he orders his bursch bursch ride you to siebenhuben and curatus schmidt with this sealed letter you and say nothing i was to have gone myself but cannot be speedy be discreet and the bursch dashes off for siebenhuben with the sealed copy for schmidt warkotsch wallis and companys behoof kappel riding at a still better pace to strehlen with the original for behoof of the kings majesty  at strehlen kings majesty not yet visible kappel has great difficulties in the anteroom among the sentry people but he persists insists read my letter then which they dare not do which only colonel krusemark the adjutant perhaps dare they take him to krusemark krusemark reads all aghast locks up kappel runs to the king returns muffles kappel in soldiers cloak and cap and leads him in the king looking into kappels face into kappels clear story and the warkotsch handwriting needed only a few questions and the fit orders as to warkotsch and company were soon given dangerous engineers now fallen harmless blown up by their own petard one of the kings first questions was but how have i offended warkotsch kappel does not know master is of strict wilful turnmaster would grumble and growl sometimes about the peasant people and how a nobleman has now no power over them in comparison are you a protestant no your majesty catholic see ihr herren said the king to those about him warkotsch is a protestant his curatus schmidt is a catholic and this man is a catholic there are villains and honest people in every creed  at noon that day warkotsch had sat down to dinner comfortably in his dressinggown nobody but the good baroness there when rittmeister rabenau suddenly descended on the schloss and diningroom with dragoons in arrest herr baron i am sorry you must go with me to brieg warkotsch a strategic fellow kept countenance to wife and rittmeister in this sudden fall of the thunderbolt yes herr rittmeister it is that mass of corn i was to furnish showing him an actual order of that kind and i am behind my time with it nobody can help his luck take a bit of dinner with us anyway rittmeister refused but the baroness too pressed him he at length sat down warkotsch went to dress first of all to give orders about his best horse but was shocked to find that the dragoons were a hundred and that every outgate was beset returning halfdressed with an air of baffled hospitality herr rittmeister our schloss must not be disgraced here are your brave fellows waiting and nothing of refreshment ready for them i have given order at the tavern in the village send them down there they shall drink better luck to me and have a bit of bread and cheese stupid rabenau again consentsand in few minutes more warkotsch is in the woods galloping like epsom towards wallis and rabenau can only arrest madam who knows nothing and return in a baffled state  schmidt too got away the party sent after schmidt found him in the little town of nimptsch halfway home again from his wallis errand comfortably dining with some innocent hospitable people there schmidt could not conceal his confusion but pleading piteously a necessity of nature was with difficulty admitted to theto the abtritt so called and there by some long pole or rakehandle vanished wholly through a neverimagined aperture and was no more heard of in the upper world the prussian soldiery does not seem expert in thieftaking  warkotsch came back about midnight that same tuesday 500 wallis hussars escorting him and took away his ready moneys near 5000 pounds in gold reports frau kappel who witnessed the ghastly operation

be satisfied destiny does send him a wonderful starofday bursting out on the sudden as will be seenmeanwhile here is the english calamity worse than any schweidnitz colberg or other that has befallen in this blackest of the night     the pitt catastrophe how the peacenegotiation went off by explosion how pitt withdrew 3d october 1761 and there came a spanish war nevertheless  in st jamess street in the duke of cumberlands late lodgings on the 2d of october 1761 there was held one of the most remarkable cabinetcouncils known in english history it is the last of pitts cabinetcouncils for a long timemight as well have been his last of alland is of the highest importance to friedrich through pitt we spoke of the choiseul peacenegotiation of an offer indirectly from king carlos could not i mediate a littleoffer which exploded said negotiation and produced the bourbon family compact and an additional war instead let us now look slightly for a few moments into that matter and its sequences  it was july 15th when bussy along with something in his own french sphere presented this beautiful spanish appendixapprehensive that war may break out again with spain when we two have got settled by the same opportunity came a note from him which was reckoned important too that the empress queen would and did whatever might become of the congress of augsburg approve of this separate peace between france and englandengland merely undertaking to leave the king of prussia altogether to himself in future with her imperial majesty and her allies never sir answered pitt with emphasis to this latter proposition and to the former about spains interfering or whispering of interference he answeredby at once returning the paper as a thing nonextant or which it was charitable to consider so totally inadmissible sir mention it no moreand at once called upon the spanish ambassador to disavow such impertinence imputed to his master fancy the colloquies the agitated consultations thereupon between bussy and this don in view suddenly of breakers ahead  in about a week july 23d bussy had an interview with pitt himself on this high spanish matter and got some utterances out of him which are memorable to bussy and us it is my duty to declare to you sir in the name of his majesty said pitt that his majesty will not suffer the disputes with spain to be blended in any manner whatever in the negotiation of peace between the two crowns to which i must add that it will be considered as an affront to his majestys dignity and as a thing incompatible with the sincerity of the negotiation to make farther mention of such a circumstance in thackeray ii 554pitt next day putting it in writing word for word at bussys request bussy did not go at once after this deliverance but was unable by his arguments and pleadings by all his oil and fire joined together to produce the least improvement on it time enough to treat of all that sir when the tower of london is taken sword in hand beatson ii 434 archenholtz ii 245 has heard of this expression in a slightly incorrect way was pitts last word an expression which went over the world and went especially to king carlos as fast as it could fly or as his choiseul could speed it and in about three weeks producedit and what had gone before it by the united industry of choiseul and carlos finally producedthe famed bourbon family compact august 15th 1761 and a variety of other weighty results which lay in embryo therein  pitt in the interim had been intensely prosecuting in spain and everywhere his inquiry into the bussy phenomenon of july 15th which he from the first glimpse of it took to mean a mystery of treachery in the pretended peacenegotiation on the part of choiseul and catholic majestythough other long heads and pitts ambassador at madrid investigating on the spot considered it an inadvertence mainly and of no practical meaning on getting knowledge of the bourbon family compact pitt perceived that his suspicion was a certaintyand likewise that the one clear course was to declare war on the spanish bourbon too and go into him at once we are ready fleets soldiers in the east in the west he not ready anywhere since he wants war let him have it without loss of a moment that is pitts clear view of the case but it is by no means bute and companyswho discern in it rather a means of finishing another operation they have long been secretly busy upon by their mauduits and otherwise and are clear against getting into a new war with spain or anybody have not we enough of wars say they  since september 18th there had been three cabinetcouncils held on this great spanish question mystery of treachery meaning war from spain or awkward inadvertence only practically meaning little or nothing pitt surer of his course every time every time meets the same contradiction council of october 2d was the third of the series and proved to be the last  twelve seventyfours sent instantly to cadiz had been pitts proposal on the first emergence of the bussy phenomenon here are his words october 2d when it is about to get consummated this is now the time for humbling the whole house of bourbon and if this opportunity is let slip we shall never find another their united power if suffered to gather strength will baffle our most vigorous efforts and possibly plunge us in the gulf of ruin we must not allow them a moment to breathe selfpreservation bids us crush them before they can combine or recollect themselvesno evidence that spain means war too many wars on our hands let us at least wait urge all the othersall but one or one and a half of whom presently whereupon pitt if these views are to be followed this is the last time i can sit at this board i was called to the administration of affairs by the voice of the people to them i have always considered myself as accountable for my conduct and therefore cannot remain in a situation which makes me responsible for measures i am no longer allowed to guide beatson ii 438  carteret granville president of said council for ten years past came in 17th june 1751died 2d january 1763 now an old rednosed man of seventytwo snappishly took him upit is the last public thing poor carteret did in this worldin the following terms i find the gentleman is determined to leave us nor can i say i am sorry for it since otherwise he would have certainly compelled us to leave him has ruled us may not i say with a rod of iron but if he be resolved to assume the office of exclusively advising his majesty and directing the operations of the war to what purpose are we called to this council when he talks of being responsible to the people he talks the language of the house of commons forgets that at this board he is only responsible to the king however though he may possibly have convinced himself of his infallibility still it remains that we should be equally convinced before we can resign our understandings to his direction or join with him in the measure he proposes biog britannica kippiss london 1784 iii 278 see thackeray i 589592  who besides temple pitts brotherinlaw confirmatory of pitt bute negatory and newcastle silent

manner following say the old newspapers  the garrison of almeida before which place the whole spanish army had been assembled surrendered to the spaniards on the 25th august 25th as we have just heard having capitulated on condition of not serving against spain for six months  as a counterbalance to this advantage the count de lippe caused valencia dalcantara to be attacked sword in hand by the british troops who carried it after an obstinate resistance the loss of the british troops who had the principal share in this affair is luckily but inconsiderable and consists in lieutenant burk of colonel fredericks one sergeant and three privates killed two sergeants one drummer 18 privates wounded 10 horses killed and 2 wounded loss not at all considerable in a war of such dimensions the british troops behaved upon this occasion with as much generosity as courage and it deserves admiration that in an affair of this kind the town and the inhabitants suffered very little which is owing to the good order brigadier burgoyne kept up even in the heat of the action this success would probably have been attended with more if circumstances that could not well be expected had not retarded

proved of little benefit to bute enough enough of bute and his performances  pitt being gone friedrichs english subsidy lags this time friedrich concludes it is cut offsilent on the subject no words will express ones thoughts on it not till april 9th has poor mitchell the sad errand of announcing formally that such are our pressures portuguese war and other we cannot afford it farther answered by i know not what kind of glance from friedrich answered i find by words few or none from the forsaken king good that too was wanting thought the proud soul keep your coin since you so need it i have still copper and my sword the alloy this year became as 3 to 1what other remedy  from the same cause i doubt not this year for the first time in human memory came that complete abeyance of the giftmoneys douceurgelder which are become a standing expectation quasiright and necessary item of support to every prussian officer from a lieutenant upwards not a word in the least official said of them this year still less a penny of them actually forthcoming to a wornout expectant army one of the greatest sins charged upon friedrich by prussian or prussianmilitary public opinion not to be excused at allprussianmilitary and even prussiancivil opinion having a strange persuasion that this king has boundless supply of money and only out of perversity refuses it for objects of moment in the army as elsewhere much has gone awry see mollendorfs two or three letters preuss iv 407411 many rivets loose after such a climbing of the alps as there has been through dense and rare  it will surprise everybody that friedrich with his copper and other resources actually raised his additional 60000 and has for himself 70000 to recover schweidnitz and bring silesia to its old state 40000 for prince henri and saxony with a 10000 of margin for sweden and accidental sundries this is strange but it is true stenzel v 297 286 tempelhof vi 2 10 63 and has not been done without strivings and contrivings hard requisitions on the places liable and has involved not a little of severity and difficultyespecially a great deal of haggling with the collecting parties or at least with prince henri who presides in saxony and is apt to complain and mourn over the undoable rather than proceed to do it the kings correspondence with henri this winter is curious enough like a dialogue between hope on its feet and despair taking to its bed you know there are two doctors in moliere says friedrich to him once a doctor tantmieux so much the better and a doctor tantpis so much the worse these two cannot be expected to agreeinstead of infinite arithmetical details here is part of a letter of friedrichs to dargens and a passage one of many with prince henriwhich command a view into the interior that concerns us   the king to dargens at berlin  breslau 18th january 1762   you have lifted the political veil which covered horrors and perfidies meditated and ready to burst out butes dismal procedures i believe who is ravenous for peace and would fain force friedrich along with him on terms altogether disgraceful and inadmissible see dargenss letter to which this is answer oeuvres de frederic xix 281 282 you judge correctly of the whole situation i am in of the abysses which surround me and as i see by what you say of the kind of hope that still remains to me it will not be till the month of february turks probably and tartar khan great things coming then that we can speak of that and that is the term i contemplate for deciding whether i shall hold to cato catoand the little glass tube i have or to caesars commentaries and the best fight one can make  the school of patience i am at is hard longcontinued cruel nay barbarous i have not been able to escape my lot all that human foresight could suggest has been employed and nothing has succeeded if fortune continues to pursue me doubtless i shall sink it is only she that can extricate me from the situation i am in i escape out of it by looking at the universe on the great scale like an observer from some distant planet all then seems to me so infinitely small and i could almost pity my enemies for giving themselves such trouble about so very little what would become of us without philosophy without this reasonable contempt of things frivolous transient and fugitive about which the greedy and ambitious make such a pother fancying them to be solid this is to become wise by stripes you will tell me well if one do become wise what matters it howi read a great deal i devour my books and that brings me useful alleviation but for my books i think hypochondria would have had me in bedlam before now in fine dear marquis we live in troublous times and in desperate situationsi have all the properties of a stagehero always in danger always on the point of perishing one must hope the conclusion will come and if the end of the piece be lucky we will forget the rest patience then mon cher till february 20th by which time what far other veritable starofday will have risen on me adieu mon cherf oeuvres de frederic xix 282 283     tiff of quarrel between king and henri marchapril 1762  in the spring months prince henri is at hof in voigtland on the extreme right of his long line of quarters behind the mulda busy enough watching the austrians and reich levying the severe contributions speeding all he can the manifold preparativesconscious to himself of the greatest vigilance and diligence but wrapt in despondency and black acidulent humors a doctor so much the worse who is not a comforting correspondent from hof towards the middle of march he becomes specially gloomy and acidulous sends a series of complaints also of news not important but all rather in your favor my dearest brother than in mine if you will please to observe as thus  henri at hof 10th13th march sadly off here my dearest brother of our 1284 head of commissariat horses only 180 are come in of our 287 drivers not one will be impossible to open campaign at that rategrenadier battalions rothenburg and grant demand to have picked men to complete them of cantonist or sure prussian sort i find nota bene reader there are eight austrian regiments going to silesia off my hands and upon yours in a sense eight instead of four that i spoke of intending probably for glatz to replace czernichef a czernichef off for home lately in a most miraculous way as readers shall hearto replace czernichef and the blank he has left there eight of them your majesty can have no difficulty but i will detach platen or somebody if you order it though i am myself perilously ill off here so scattered into parts not capable of speedy junction like your majesty  friedrich 14th16th march commissariat horses drivers i arranged and provided where everything was to be got but if my orders are not executed nor the requisitions brought in of course there is failure i am despatching adjutant von anhalt to saxony a second time to enforce matters if i could be for three weeks in saxony myself i believe i could put all on its right footing but as i must not stir two steps from here i will send you anhalt with orders to the generals to compel them to their duty schoning iii 301 302 as to grenadier battalions grant and rothenburg it is absurd henri falls silent for about a week brooding his gloomnot aware that still worse is coming king continues  king 22d march eight regiments you said here by enclosed list are seventeen of them names and particulars all given which is rather a different view of the account against silesia seventeen of them going not for glatz i should say but to strengthen our enemies hereabouts  henri hm hah answers only in german dry military reports official merelythinks of writing to chiefclerk eichel who is factotum in these spheres artillery recruits are scarce in the extreme demand bounty five thalers shall we say  king seventeen regiments of them beyond question instead of eight coming on us strange that you did nt warn me better i have therefore ordered your majorgeneral schmettau hitherward at once as he has not done raising the contributions in the lausitz you must send another to do it and have them ready when general platen passes that way hitherfive thalers bounty for artillery men say you it is not to be thought of artillery men can be had by conscription where you are henri in silence still more indignant sends military reports exclusively march 26th henris gloom reaches the igniting point he writes to chiefclerk eichel  monsieur you are aware that adjutant von anhalt is on the way hither to judge by his orders if they correspond to the letters i have had from the king adjutant von anhalts appearance here will produce an embarrassment from which i am resolved to extricate myself by a voluntary retirement from office my totally ruined abimee health the vexations i have had the fatigues and troubles of war leave in me little regret to quit the employment i solicit only from your attentions and skill of management that my retreat be permitted to take place with the decency observed towards those who have served the state i have not a high opinion of my services but perhaps i am not mistaken in supposing that it would be more a shame to the king than to me if he should make me endure all manner of chagrins during my retirement schoning iii 307  eichel sinks into profound reflection says nothing how is this fire to be got under where is the place to trample on it before opening door or window or saying a word to the king or anybody  henri same day 26th march my dearest brotherin the list you send me of those seventeen austrian regiments several i am informed are still in saxony and by all the news that i get there are only eight gone towards silesiafrom leipzig my accounts are the reichs army is to make a movement in advance and prince xavier with the saxons was expected at naumburg the 20th ult i know not if you have arranged with duke ferdinand for a proportionate succor in case his french also should try to penetrate into saxony upon me i am with the profoundest attachment your faithful and devoted servant and brother  king 30th march seventeen of them you may depend i am too well informed to be allowed to doubt in any way what you report of the reichsfolk and saxons moving hither thither that seems to me a bit of game on their part they will try to cut one post from you then another unless you assemble a corps and go in upon them till you decide for this resolution you have nothing but chicanes and provocations to expect there as to duke ferdinand of brunswick i dont imagine that his orders from england would permit him what you propose for relief of yourself at any rate you will have to write at least thrice to himthat is to say waste three weeks before he will answer no or yes you yourself are in force enough for those fellows but so long as you keep on the defensive alone the enemy gains time and things will always go a bad road henris patience is already out this same day he is writing to the king  henri 30th march you have hitherto received proofs enough of my ways of thinking and acting to know that if in reality i was mistaken about those eight regiments it can only have been a piece of ignorance on the part of my spy meanwhile you are pleased to make me responsible for what misfortune may come of it i think i have my hands full with the task laid on me of guarding 4000 square miles of country with fewer troops than you have and of being opposite an enemy whose posts touch upon ours and who is superior in force your preceding letters from march 16th hitherto on which i have wished to be silent and this last proof of want of affection show me too clearly to what fortune i have sacrificed these six years of campaigning  king 3d april official orders given in teutsch at the tail of which spare your wrath and indignation at your servant monseigneur you who preach indulgence have a little of it for persons who have no intention of offending you or of failing in respect for you and deign to receive with more benignity the humble representations which the conjunctures sometimes force from me fwhich relieves eichel of his difficulties and quenches this sputter plucked up from the waste imbroglios of schoning iii 296311 by arranging and omitting  prince henri for all his complaining did beautifully this season again though to us it must be silent being smallwar merelyand in particular may 12th early in the morning simultaneously in many different parts burst across the mulda ten or twenty miles long or broad rather from his right hand to his left sudden as lightning upon the supine serbelloni and his austrians and reichsfolk and hurled them back one and all almost to the plauen chasm and their old haunts widening his quarters notably bericht von dem uebergang uber die mulde den der prinz heinrich den 12ten may 1762 glucklich ausgefuhrt in seyfarth beylagen iii 280291 a really brilliant thing testifies everybody though not to be dwelt on here seidlitz was of it much fine cutting and careering from the seidlitz and others we have to omit in these two saxon campaignsseidlitz was of it he and another still more special acquaintance of ours the learned quintus icilius who also did his best in it but lost his amusette small bit of cannon plaything so called by marechal de saxe inventor of the article and did not shine like seidlitz  henris quarters being notably widened in this way and nothing but torpid serbellonis and prince stollbergs on the opposite part henri drew himself out thirtyfive miles long and stood there almost looking into plauen region as formerly and with his fiery seidlitzes kleists made a handsome summer of it and beat the austrians and reichsfolk at freyberg october 29th a fine battle and his sole oneon the horse which afterwards carried gellert as is pleasantly known  but we are omitting the news from petersburgwhich came the very day after that gloomy letter to dargens months before the tiff of quarrel with henri and the brilliant better destinies of that gentleman in his campaign     bright news from petersburg certain jan 19th which grow ever brighter and become a starofday for friedrich  to friedrich long before all this of henri indeed almost on the very day while he was writing so despondently to dargens a new phasis had arisen hardly had he been five weeks at breslau in those gloomy circumstances whenabout the middle of january 1762 day not given though it is forever notablethere arrive rumors arrive newsnews from petersburg such as this king never had before among the thousand ill strokes of fortune does there at length come one preeminently good the unspeakable sovereign woman is she verily dead then and become peaceable to me forevermore we promised friedrich a wonderful starofday and this is itthough it is long before he dare quite regard it as such peter the successor he knows to be secretly his friend and admirer if only in the new czarish capacity and its chaotic environments and conditions peter dare and can assert these feelings what a hope to friedrich from this time onward russia may be counted as the bigger half of all he had to strive with the bigger or at least the far uglier more ruinous and incendiaryand if this were at once taken away think what a daybreak when the night was at the blackest  pious people say the darkest hour is often nearest the dawn and a dawn this proved to be for friedrich and the fact grew always the longer the brighterand before campaign time had ripened into real daylight and sunrise the dates should have been precise but are not to be had so here is the nearest we could come january 14th writing to henri the king has a mysterious word about possibilities of an uncommon sortrumors from petersburg i could conjecture though perhaps they are only turk or tartarkhan affairs which are higher this year than ever and as futile as ever but on january 19th he has heard plainlywith what hopes if one durst indulge themthat the implacable imperial woman infame catin du nord is verily dead dead and does not hate me any more deliverance peace and victory lie in the wordcatin had long been failing but they kept it religiously secret within the court walls even at petersburg nobody knew till the prayers of the church were required prayers as zealous as you canthe doctors having plainly intimated that she is desperate and that the thing is over on christmasday 1761 by russian style 5th january 1762 by european the poor imperial catin lay deada death still more important than that of george ii to this king  peter iii who succeeded has lang been privately a sworn friend and admirer of the king and hastens not too slowly as the king had feared but far the reverse to make that known to all mankind that and much elsein a far too headlong manner poor soul like an ardent violent totally inexperienced person enfranchised schoolboy come to the age of thirtyfour who has sat hitherto in darkness in intolerable compression as if buried alive he is now czar peter autocrat not of himself only but of all the russiasand has besides the complete regeneration of russia two great thoughts first that of avenging native holstein and his poor martyr of a father now with god against the danesand  second what is scarcely second in importance to the first and indeed is practically a kind of preliminary to it that of delivering the prussian pattern of heroes from such a pattern of foul combinations and bringing peace to europe while he settles the holsteindanish business peter is russian by the mothers side his mother was sister of the late catin a daughter like her of czar peter called the great and of the little brown catharine whom we saw transiently long ago his holstein business shall concern us little but that with friedrich during the brief six months allowed him for itfor it and for all his remaining businesses in this worldis of the highest importance to friedrich and us  peter is one of the wildest men his fate which was tragical is now to most readers rather of a ghastly grotesque than of a lamentable and pitiable character few know or have ever considered in how wild an element poor peter was born and nursed what a time he has had since his fifteenth year especially when cousin of zerbst and he were married perhaps the wildest and maddest any human soul had during that century i find in him starting out from the lethean quagmires where he had to grow a certain rash greatness of idea traces of veritable conviction just resolution veritable and just though rash that of admiration for king friedrich was not intrinsically foolish in the solitary thoughts of the poor young fellow nay it was the reverse though it was highly inopportune in the place where he stood nor was the holstein notion bad it was generous rather noble and natural though again somewhat impracticable in the circumstances  the summary of the friedrichpeter business is perhaps already known to most readers and can be very briefly given nor is peters tragical six months of czarship 5th january9th july 1762 a thing for us to dwell on beyond need but it is wildly tragical strokes of deep pathos in it blended with the ghastly and grotesque it is part of friedrichs strange element and environment and though the outer incidents are public enough it is essentially little known had there been an aeschylus had there been a shakspearebut poor peters shocking six months of history has been treated by a far different set of hands themselves almost shocking to see and to the seriously inquiring mind it lies and will long lie in a very waste chaotic enigmatic condition here out of considerable bundles now burnt are some rough jottings excerpts of notes and studieswhich i still doubt rather ought to have gone in auto da fe along with the others auto da fe i called it act of faith not spanishinquisitional but essentially celestial many times if you reflect well on the poisonous consequences on the sinfulness and deadly criminality of human babbleas nobody does nowadays i label the different pieces and try to make legiblehasty readers have the privilege of skipping if they like the first two are of preliminary or prefatory natureperhaps still more skippable than those that will by and by follow  1 genealogy of peter his grandfather was friedrich iv duke of holsteingottorp and schleswig karl xiis brotherinlaw on whose score it was denmark finding the time opportune for a stroke of robbery there that karl xii a young lad hardly eighteen first took arms and began the career of fighting that astonished denmark and certain other neighbors who had been too covetous on a young king this his young brotherinlaw friedrich of holsteingottorp young he too though karls senior by ten years had been reinstated in his territory and the danes sternly forbidden farther burglary there by the victorious karl but went with karl in his farther expeditions always karls intimate and at his right hand for the next two years fell in the battle of clissow 19th july 1702 age not yet thirtyone  he left as heir a poor young boy at this time only two years old his young widow hedwig survived him six years michaelis ii 618629 her poor

a pity for this unfortunate duke a hope in his just hopes and pleaded as did various others and endeavored with the unjust danes mostly without effect did however give him one of his daughters to wifethe result of whom is this new czar peter called the third a czar who is sovereign of holstein and has claims of sovereignty in sweden right of heirship in schleswig and of damages against denmark which are in litigation to this day the czarina catin tenderly remembering her sister would hear of no heir to russia but this peter peter in virtue of his paternal affinities was elected king of sweden about the same time but preferred russiawith an eye to his danes some think for certain did adopt the russian expectancy the greek religion so called and was in the way we saw long years ago married or to all appearance married to catharina alexiewna of anhaltzerbst born in stettin herr preuss knows the house now dr lehmanns at that time the governor of stettins in which also czar pauls second spouse eugen of wurtemberg a new governors daughter who is mother of the czars that follow was born preuss ii 310 311 catharine during her reign was pious in a small way to the place of her cradle sent her successive medals c to stettin which still has them to show a lady who became worldfamous as czarina of the russias  peter is an abstruse creature has lived all this while with his catharine an abstruse life which would have gone altogether mad except for catharines superior sense an awkward ardent but helpless kind of peter with vehement desires with a dash of wild magnanimity even but in such an inextricable element amid such darkness such provocations of unmanageable opulence such impediments imaginary and realdreadfully real to poor peteras made him the unique of mankind in his time he used to drill cats it is said and to do the maddestlooking things in his late buriedalive conditionand fell partly never quite which was wonderful into drinking as the solution of his inextricabilities poor peter always and now more than ever the cynosure of vulturous vulpine neighbors withal which infinitely aggravated his otherwise bad case  for seven or eight years there came no progeny nor could come about the eighth or ninth there could and did the marvellous czar paul that was to be concerning whose exact paternity there are still calumnious assertions widely current to this individual editor much a matter of indifference though on examining his verdict is calumnies to all appearance mysteries which decent or decorous society refuses to speak of and which indecent is pretty sure to make calumnies out of czar paul may be considered genealogically genuine if that is much an object to him poor paul does not he father himself were there nothing more only that peter and this catharine could have begotten such a paul genealogically genuine enough my poor czarthat needed to be garroted so very soon  2 of catharine and the books upon peter and her catharine too had an intricate time of it under the catin which was consoled to her only by a tolerably rapid succession of lovers the best the ground yielded in which department it is well known what a thricegreatest she became superior to any charles ii equal almost to an august the strong of her loves now and henceforth which are heartily uninteresting to me i propose to say nothing farther merely this that in extent they probably rivalled the highest male sovereign figures and are to be put in the same category with these and damned as deep or a little deeperand cost her in gifts in magnificent pensions to the emeriti for she did things always in a grandiose manner quietly and yet inexorably dismissing the emeritus with stores of gold the considerable sum of 20 millions sterling in the course of her long reign one or at most two were off on pension when hanbury williams brought poniatowski for her as we transiently saw poniatowski will be king of poland in the course of events  russia is not a publishing country the books about catharine are few and of little worth tooke an english chaplain castera an unknown french hangeron who copies from tooke or tooke from him these are to be read as the badbest and will yield little satisfactory insight castera in particular a great deal of dubious backstairs gossip and street rumor which are not delightful to a reader of sense in fine there has been published in these very years a fragment of early autobiography by catharine herselfa credible and highly remarkable little piece worth all the others if it is knowledge of catharine you are seeking memoires de limperatrice catharine ii ecrits par ellememe a herzen editing london 1859which we already cited on occasion of catharines marriage  anonymous castera vie de catharine ii

such an element as might have driven most people mad but it did not her it only made her wiser and wiser in her generation element black hideous dirty as lapland sorceryin which the first clear duty is to hold ones tongue well and keep ones eyes open starsnot very heavenly but of fixed nature and heavenly to catharinea star or two shine through the abominable murk steady patient steer silently in all weathers towards these  young catharines immovable equanimity in this distracted environment strikes us very much peter is careering tumbling about on all manner of absurd broomsticks driven too surely by the devil terrificabsurd big lapland witch surrounded by multitudes smaller and some of them less ugly will be czar of russia howeverand is ones socalled husband these are prospects for an observant immovably steadygoing young woman the reigning czarina old catin herself is silently the olympian jove to catharine who reveres her very much though articulately stupid as ever in this book of catharines she comes out with a dumb weight of silence of obstinacy of intricate abrupt rigor whichwho knows but it may savor of dumb unconscious wisdom in the fat old blockhead the book says little of her and in the way of criticism of praise or of blame nothing whatever but one gains the notion of some dark human female object bigger than one had fancied it before  catharine steered towards her stars lovers were vouchsafed her of a kind her small stars as we may call them and at length through perilous intricacies the big star autocracy of all the russiasthrough what horrors of intricacy that last she had hoped always it would be by husband peter that she with the deeper steady head would be autocrat but the intricacies kept increasing grew at last to the strangling pitch and it came to be between peter and her either you to siberia perhaps farther or else i and it was peter that had to goin what hideous way is well enough known no siberia no holstein thought to be far enough for peterand catharine merely weeping a little for him mounted to the autocracy herself and then the big star of stars being once hers she had not in the lover kind alone but in all uncelestial

objects yet there are uglier how infinitely uglier object grandiose if not greatwe return to friedrich and the death of catin  colonel hordt i believe was the first who credibly apprised friedrich of the great russian event colonel hordt late of the freecorps hordt but captive since soon after the kunersdorf time and whose doleful quasiinfernal twentyfive months and three days in the citadel of petersburg have changed in one hour into celestial glories in the court of that cityas readers shall themselves see anon by hordt or by whomsoever the instant friedrich heard by an authentic source of the new czars accession friedrich hastened to turn round upon him with the friendliest attitude with arms as if ready to open dismissing all his russian prisoners and testifying in every polite and royal way how gladly he would advance if permitted to which the czar by hordt and by other channels imperially responded rushing forward he as if with arms flung wide  january 31st is order from the king in schoning iii 275 breslau 31st january 1762 that our russian prisoners one and all shod clad and dieted be forthwith set under way from stettin in return for which generosity the prussians from

czarish majesty to the horror of vienna and glad astonishment of mankind emits declaration note to all the foreign excellencies in petersburg that there ought to be peace with this king of prussia that czarish majesty for his own part is resolved on the thing gives up east preussen and the socalled conquests made russian participation in such a war has ceased and practically orders czernichef who is wintering with his 20000 in glatz to quit glatz and these austrian combinations and march homeward with his 20000 which czernichef so soon as arrangements of proviant and the like are made hastens to doand does as far as thorn but no farther for a reason that will be seen on the last day of march czernichefoff about a week ago from glatz and now got into the breslau latitudecame across with a select suite of four to pay his court there and had the honor to dine with his majesty and to be personally too a czernichef agreeable to his majesty  the vehemency of austrian diplomacies at petersburg and the horror of kaiserinn and kriegshofrath in viennawho have just discharged 20000 of their own people counting on this czernichef and being dreadfully tight for moneymay be fancied but all avails nothing the ardent czar advances towards friedrich with arms flung wide goltz and gudowitsh are engaged on treaty of peace czar frankly gives up east preussen yours again what use has russia for it royal friend treaty of peace goes forward like the drawing of a marriagesettlement concluded may 5th and in a month more has changed into treaty of allianceczernichef ordered to stop short at thorn to turn back and join himself to this heroic king instead of fighting against him which again czernichef himself an admirer of this king joyfully doesthough unhappily not with all the advantage he expected to the king  swedish peace queen ulrique and the antifrench party now getting the upper hand had been hastening forward in the interim finished at hamburg may 2d a most small matter in comparison to the russian but welcome enough to friedrichthough he said slightingly of it when first mentioned peace i know not hardly of any war there has been with swedenask colonel belling about it colonel belling a most shining swift hussar colonel who with a 2000 sharp fellows hanging always on the swedish flanks sharp as lightning nowhere and yet everywhere as was said of him

height dawn of day has ripened into sunrise for friedrich the way out is now a thing credible and visible to him peters friendliness is boundless almost too boundless peter begs a prussian regimentdresses himself in its uniform colonel of itzenplitz friedrich begs a russian regiment colonel of schuwalof and all is joyful hopeful marriagebells instead of dirge ditto and gallows dittounhappily not for very long  in regard to friedrichs feelings while all this went on take the following small utterances of his before going farther january 27th 1762 to madam camaseight days after the russian event i rejoice my good mamma to find you have such courage i exhort you to redouble it all ends in this world so we may hope this accursed war will not be the only thing eternal there since death has trussed up a certain catin of the hyperborean countries our situation has advantageously changed and becomes more supportable than it was we must hope that some other events favor of the new czar mainly will happen by which we may profit to arrive at a good peace  january 31st to minister finkenstein behold the first gleam of light that risesheaven be praised for it we

friedrich himself had specially to depend on them at present and doubtless in times long afterwards now and then heard speech of them from hordt our second eyewitness is the reverend herr doctor

skirmish began was suddenly surrounded by 200 cossacks and after desperate plunging into bogs desperate firing of pistols and the like was taken prisoner was carted miserably to petersburgsuch a journey for dead ennui as hordt never knew and was then tumbled out into solitary confinement in the citadel a place like the spanish inquisition not the least notice taken of his request for a few

first volume of which unavailable here is in my possession hordt was reckoned a perfectly veracious intelligent kind of man but he seldom gives the least date specification or precise detail and his

walking slowly through a suite of rooms in each of which a body of congratulators were assembled courtofficials preceded stateofficials followed him then came the czarina attended in a similar way and

administer their rich abbey lands and the likethis gave a sad shock to the upper strata of priesthood extending gradually to the lower and ultimately raising an ominous general thought perhaps worse than a general cry of church in danger alas is our czar regardless of holy religion then perhaps at heart still lutheran and has no religion this and his too headlong prussian tendencies are counted to have done him infinite mischief  herr busching sees the czar on horseback when the czars own regiment of cuirassiers came to petersburg the czar dressed in the uniform of the regiment rode out to

foresaw what would come she also had her circle every evening and always asked the company to stay supper one evening when i was of her party a confidential equerry of the czar came in and whispered me that i had been searched for all over town to come to supper at the countesss that was the usual designation of the sultanadas fraulein spelt in russian ways is the more usual i begged to be excused for this time being engaged to sup with the czarina to whom i could not well state the reason for which i was to leave the equerry had not gone long when suddenly a great noise was heard the two wings of the door were flung open and the czar entered he saluted politely the czarina and her circle called me with that smiling and gracious air which he always had took me by the arm and said to the czarina excuse me madam if tonight i carry off one of your guests it is this prussian i had searched for all over the town the czarina laughed i made her a deep bow and went away with my

my way from the first house where i had called i heard a distant noise like that of a rising thunderstorm and asked my people what it was they did not know but it appeared to them like the shouting of a mob volksgeschrei and there were all sorts of rumors afloat some said the czar had suddenly resolved to get himself crowned at petersburg before setting out for the war on denmark others said he had named the czarina to be regent during his absence and that she was to be crowned for this purpose these rumors were too silly meanwhile the noise perceptibly drew nearer and i ordered my coachman to proceed no farther but to turn home  on getting home i called my wife and told her that something extraordinary was then going on but that i could not learn what that it appeared to me like some popular tumult which was coming nearer to us every moment we hurried to the corner room of our house threw open the window which looks to the church of st mary of casan where an act of thanksgiving has just been consummated of a very peculiar kindand we then saw near this church an innumerable crowd of people dressed and halfdressed soldiers of the footregiments of the guards mixed with the populace we perceived that the crowd pressed round a common twoseated hackney coach drawn by two horses in which after a few minutes a lady dressed in black and wearing the order of st catharine coming out of the church took a seat whereupon the churchbells began ringing and the priests with their assistants carrying crosses got into procession and walked before the coach we now recognized

low russians in their wantonness  july 11th the disorder amongst the soldiers was at its height yet still much less than might have been expected many of them entered the houses of foreigners and

leuthen with their nun danket alle gott five years ago in memorable circumstances to what various uses are earths fields liable  friedrich by degrees has considerably changed his opinion and bent towards the late keiths about russian soldiery a soldiery of most various kinds from predatory cossacks and calmucks to those noble grenadiers whom we saw sit down on the walls of schweidnitz when their work was done a perfectly steady obedience is in these men at any and all times obedient to the death if needful and with a silence with a steadfastness as of rocks and gravitation which is a superlative quality in soldiers good in nations too within limits and much a distinction in the russian nation rare or almost unique in these unruly times the russians have privately had their admirations of friedrich all this while and called him by i forget what unpronounceable vernacular epithet signifying son of lightning or some such thing buchholz neueste preussischbrandenburgische geschichte 1775 vol ii page irrecoverable no doubt they are proud to have a stroke of service under such a one since father peter feodorowitsh graciously orders it the very cossacks show an alertness a vivacity and see cheery possibilities ahead in countries not yet plundered out they stayed with friedrich only three weeksrussia being an uncertain country as we have seen above though friedrich who is vitally concerned has not yet seen but their junction with him and review by him in the field of lissa had its uses by and by and may be counted an epoch in russian history if nothing more the poor russian nation most pitiable of loyal nationsstruggling patiently ahead on those bad terms under such catins and foul nightmareshas it shall we say quite gone without conquest in this mad war perhaps not quite it has at least shown europe that it possesses fighting qualities a changed nation since karl xii beat them easily at narva 8000 to 80000 in the snowy morning long since  czernichef once come and in his place in the camp of tintz business instantly beginsbusiness and a press of it in right earnestupon the hitherto idle daun july 1st there is general complex advance everywhere on friedrichs part general attempt towards the mountains upon which daun well awake at once rolls universally thitherward again takes post in front of the mountainson the heights of kunzendorf to wit loudons old post in bunzelwitz timeand elaborately spreads himself out in defence there take him multifariously by the left flank get between him and his magazine at braunau thinks friedrich discovering which daun straightway hitches back into the mountains altogether leaving kunzendorf to friedrichs use as main camp his outmost austrians on the edge of the mountain country and back as far as suitable daun elaborately posts and intrenches himself behind them in all the commanding pointsschweidnitz still well in sight and braunau and the roads to it well capable of being guarded dauns headquarter is tannhausen burkersdorf ludwigsdorf if readers can remember them are frontward postsin his old imperturbable way daun sits there waiting events  and for near three weeks there ensues a very multiplex series of rapid movements and alarming demonstrations on dauns front on dauns right flank with serious extensive effort masked in that way to turn dauns left flank and push round by landshut country upon bohemia and braunau effort very serious indeed on that landshut side conducted at first by friedrich in person with general wied called also neuwied a man of mark since liegnitz time as second under him latterly by wied himself as friedrich found it growing dubious or hopeless that was friedrichs first notion of the daun problem there are rapid marches here there round that western or left flank of daun sudden spurts of fierce fighting oftenest with a stiff climb as preliminary but not the least real success on daun daun perfectly comprehends what is on foot refuses to take shine for substance stands massed or grouped at his own skilful judgment in the proper points for braunau still more for schweidnitz and is very vigilant and imperturbable  kunzendorf heights which are not of the hills but in front of them with a strip of flat still interveningthese we said daun had at once quitted and these are now friedrichsbut yield him a very complex prospect at present a line of opposing heights burkersdorf ludwigsdorf leuthmannsdorf bristling with abundant cannon behind is the multiplex sea of hills rising higher and higher to the ridge of the eulenberg in glatz country 10 or 12 miles southward daun with forces much superior calmly lord of all that infinitely needing to be ousted could one but say how friedrich begins to perceive that braunau will not do that he must contrive some other plan general wied he still leaves to prosecute the braunau scheme perhaps there is still some chance in it at lowest it will keep dauns attention thitherward and wied perseveres upon braunau and braunau proving impossible pushes past it deeper into bohemia daun loftily regardless of him wieds marches and attempts were of approved quality though unsuccessful in the way of stirring daun wieds light troops went scouring almost as far as pragespecially a 500 cossacks that were with him following their old fashion in a new country to the horror of austria who shrieked loudly feeling them in her own bowels though so quiet while they were in other peoples on her score this of the 500 cossacks under wied if this were anything was all of actual work that friedrich had from his czernichef alliesnothing more of real or actual while they stayed though something of imaginary or ostensible which had its importance as we shall see  friedrich in the third week recalls wied braunau clearly impossible only let us still keep up appearances july 18th wied is in kunzendorf country again on an important new enterprise or method with the daun problem in which wied is to bear a principal hand that is to say the discomfiture and overturn of dauns right wing if we cansince his left has proved impossible this was the storming of burkersdorf heights friedrichs new plan which did prove successful and is still famous in the annals of war reckoned by all judges a beautiful plan beautifully executed and once more a wonderful achieving of what seemed the impossible when it had become the indispensable one of friedrichs prettiest feats and the last of his notable performances in this war readers ought not to be left without some shadowy authentic notion of it though the real portraiture or image which is achievable too after long study is for the professional soldier onlyfor whom tempelhof good maps and plenty of patience are the recipe  the scene is the wall of heights running east and west parallel to friedrichs position at kunzendorf which form the face or decisive beginning of that mountain glacis spreading up ten miles farther towards glatz country they these heights called of burkersdorf are in effect dauns right wing vitally precious to daun who has taken every pains about them burkersdorf height or heights for there are two divided by the brook weistritz but we shall neglect the eastern or lower which is ruled by the other and stands or falls along with it burkersdorf height is the principal a hill of some magnitude short way south of the village of burkersdorf which also is dauns hill falling rather steep down on two of its sides namely on the north side which is towards friedrich and kunzendorf and on the east side where weistritz water as yet only a brook gushes out from the mountainshastening towards schweidnitz or schweidnitz water towards lissa and leuthen country where we have seen it on an important night weistritz at this part has scarped the eastern flank of burkersdorf height and made for itself a pleasant little valley there this is the one pass into the mountains a valley of level bottom where daun has a terrific trench and sunk battery level with the ground capable of sweeping to destruction whoever enters there without leave  east from burkersdorf lesser height which we neglect for the present and a little farther inwards or south are two other heights ludwigsdorf and leuthmannsdorf which also need capture as adjuncts of burkersdorf or second line to burkersdorf and are abundantly difficult though not so steep as burkersdorf  the enterprise therefore divides itself into two wied is to do the ludwigsdorfleuthmannsdorf part mollendorf the burkersdorf the strength of guns in these places especially on burkersdorfwe know dauns habit in that particular and need say nothing mandevouring batteries abatis battalions palisaded to the teeth the pales strong as masts and room only for a musketbarrel between nay they are furnished with a lath or crossstrap all along for resting your gunbarrel on and taking aimso careful is daun the ground itself is intricate in parts impracticably steep everywhere full of bushes gnarls and impediments seldom was there such a problem altogether friedrichs position as we say is kunzendorf heights with schweidnitz and his old ground of bunzelwitz to rear czernichef and others lying there and wurben and the old villages and heights again occupied as postswhat a tale of egyptian bricks has one to bake your majesty on certain fields of this world and with such insufficiency of rawmaterial sometimes  by the 16th of july friedrichs plans are complete contrived i must say with a veracity and opulent potency of intellect flashing clear into the matter and yet careful of the smallest practical detail friday 17th mollendorf with men and furnitures complete circles off northwestward by wurben for the benefit of certain onlookers but will have circled round to burkersdorf neighborhood two days hence by which time also wied will be quietly in his place thereabouts with a view to business on the 20th and 21st mollendorf wied and everything are prosperously under way in this mannerwhen on the afternoon of that same friday 17th compare tempelhof vi 99 and rodenbeck ii 164 czernichef steps over most privately to headquarters with what a bit of news a revolution in petersburg july 9th as we saw above or as herr busching saw czar peteryour majestys adorer is dethroned perhaps murdered your majestys enemies in the name of czarina catharine order me instantly homeward with my 20000 this is true news this of czernichef a most unexpected overwhelming revolution in those northern partsnot needing to be farther touched upon in this place  what here concerns us is friedrichs feelings on hearing of it which no reader can now imagine horror amazement pity very poignant grief for ones hapless friend peter for ones still more hapless self the sisyphus stone which we had got dragged to the top the chains all beautifully slack these three months pasthas it leapt away again and on the eve of burkersdorf and our grand daun problem truly the destinies have been quite dramatic with this king and have contrived the moment of hitting him to the heart he passionately entreats czernichef to be helpful to himwhich czernichef would fain be only how can he to be helpful at least to keep the matter absolutely secret yet for some hours this the obliging czernichef will do and friedrich remains czernichef having promised this in the throes of desperate consideration and uncertainty hour after hourhow many hours i do not know it is confidently said retzow ii 415 friedrich had the thought of forcibly disarming czernichef and his 20000in which case he must have given up the daun enterprise for without czernichef as a positive quantity much more with czernichef as a negative it is impossible but at any rate most luckily for himself he came upon a milder thought stay with us yet three days merely in the semblance of allies no service required of you but keeping the matter a dead secreton the fourth day go with my eternal thanks this is his milder proposal urged with his best efforts upon the obliging czernichef who is in huge difficulty and sees it to be at peril of his head but generously consents it is the same czernichef who got lodged in custrin cellars on one occasion know o kingthe king before this does begin to knowthat russians too can have something of heroic and can recognize a hero when they see him in this fine way does friedrich get the frightful chasm or sudden gap of the ground under him bridged over for the moment and proceeds upon burkersdorf all the same  of the attack itself we propose to say almost nothing it consists of two parts wied and mollendorf which are intensely real and of a great many more which are scenic chieflysome of them scenic to the degree of drurylane itself as we perceiveall cunningly devised and beautifully playing into one another both the real and the scenic evening of the 20th friedrich is on his ground according to program friedrichwho has now his mollendorf and wied beside him again near this village of burkersdorf and has his completely scenic czernichef and partly scenic ziethen and others all in their places behind himquietly crushes dauns people out of burkersdorf village and furthermore so soon as night has fallen bursts up for his own uses burkersdorf old castle and its obstinate handful of defenders which was a noisier process which done he diligently sets to trenching building batteries in that part will have forty formidable guns howitzers a good few of them ready before sunrise and so  wednesday 21st july 1762 all prussians are in motion far and wide especially mollendorf and wied versus okelly and prince de lignewhich pair of prussians may be defined rather as near and close these two being in fact the soul of the matter and all else garniture and semblance about 4 in the morning friedrichs battery of 40 has begun raging the howitzers diligent upon okelly and his burkersdorf heightnot much hurting okelly or his height so high was it but making a prodigious noise upon okellyothers of the cannon shearing home on those palisades and elaborations in the weistritz valley in particular and quite tearing up a cavalry regiment which was drawn out there so that okelly had instantly to call it home in a very wrecked condition why okelly ever put it thereexcept that he saw no place for it in his rugged localities or no use for it anywhereis still a mystery to the intelligent mind tempelhof vi 107 the howitzers their shells bursting mostly in the air did okelly little hurt nor for hours yet was there any real attack on burkersdorf or him but the noise the horrid deathblaze was prodigious and kept okelly like some others in an agitated occupied condition till their own turn came  for it had been ordered that wied and mollendorf were not to attack together not together but successivelyfor the following reasons together suppose mollendorf to prosper on okelly whom he is to storm not by the steep front part as okelly fancies but to go round by the western flank and take him in rear suppose mollendorf to be near prospering on burkersdorf heightunless wied too have prospered ludwigsdorf batteries and forces will have mollendorf by the right flank and between two fires he will be ruined he and everything on the other hand let wied try first if wied can manage ludwigsdorf well if wied cannot he comes home again with small damage and the whole enterprise is off for the present that was friedrichs wise arrangement and the reason why he so bombards okelly with thunder blank mostly  and indeed from 4 this morning and till 4 in the afternoon there is such an outburst and blazing series of scenic effect and thunder mostly blank going on far and near all over that district of country general this ostentatiously speeding off as if for attack on some important place general that for attack on some other all hands busythe 20000 russians not yet speeding but seemingly just about to do itand blank thunder so mixed with not blank and scenic effect with bitter reality tempelhof vi 105111as was seldom seen before and no wisest daun not to speak of his okellys and lieutenants can for the life of him say where the real attack is to be or on what hand to turn himself daun in person i believe is still at tannhausen near the centre of this astonishing scene five or six miles from any practical part of it and does order forward hither thither masses of force to support the de ligne the okelly among othersbut who can tell what to support dauns lieutenants were alert some of them others less general guasco for instance who is in schweidnitz an alert commandant with 12000 picked men was drawing out of his own will with certain regiments to try friedrichs rear but a check was put on him some dangerous shake of the fist from afar when he had to draw in again in general the okelly supports sat gazing dubiously and did nothing for okelly but roll back along with him when the time came but let us first attend to wied and the ludwigsdorfleuthmannsdorf part  wied divided into three is diligently pushing up on ludwigsdorf by the slacker eastern ascents meets firm enough battalions potent dangerous and resolute in their strong posts but endeavors firmly to be more dangerous than they dislodges everything on his right on his left comes in sight of the batteries and ranked masses atop which seem to him difficult indeed flatly impossible if tried on front but always some colonel lottum or quickeyed man finds some little valley little hollow gets at the enemy sidewise and rearwise rushes on with fixed bayonets doublequick to cooperate with the front and on the whole there are the best news from wied and we perceive he sees his way through the affair  upon which mollendorf gets in motion upon his specific errand mollendorf has been surveying his ground a little during the leisure hour especially examining what mode of passage there may be and looking for some road up those slacker western parts has found no road but a kind of sheep track which he thinks will do mollendorf with all energy surmounting many difficulties pushes up accordingly gets into his sheeptrack finds in the steeper part of this track that horses cannot draw his cannon sets his men to do it pulls and pushes he and they with a right willsees over his left shoulder at a certain point the ranked austrians waiting for him behind their cannon which must have been an interesting glimpse of scenery for some moments tugs along till he is at a point for planting his cannon and then under help of these rushes forwardin two parts perhaps in three but with one impetus in allto seize the austrian fruit set before him surely if a precious a very prickly pomegranate to clutch hold of on different sides after such a climb the austrians make stiff fight have abatis multiplex defences and mollendorf has a furious wrestle with this last remnant holding out wonderfullytill at length the abatis itself catches fire in the musketry and they have to surrender this must be about noon as i collect and feldmarschall daun himself now orders everybody to fall back and the tug of fight is overthough friedrichs scenic effects did not cease and in particular his big battery raged till 5 in the afternoon the more to confirm dauns rearward resolutions and quicken his motions on fall of night daun everybody having had his orders and been making his preparations for six hours past ebbed totally away in perfect order bag and baggage well away to southward and left friedrich quit of him tempelhof vi 100115 compare bericht von der bey leutmannsdorf den 21sten julius 1762 vorgefallenen action seyfarth beylagen iii 302308 anderweiter bericht von der c ib

resistance which is rather vehement tempelhof vi 126 he expects to have the place in a couple of weeksone week huit jour he sometimes counts it but was far out in his reckoning as to time  the siege of schweidnitz occupied two most laborious tedious monthsand would be wearisome to every reader now as it was to friedrich then did we venture on more than the briefest outline the resistance is vehement very skilfulcommandant is guasco the same who was so truculent to schmettau in the dresden time his garrison is near 12000 picked from all regiments of the austrian army his provisions ammunitions are of the amplest and he has under him as chief engineer a m gribeauval who understands countermining like no other after about a fortnight of trial and one event in the neighborhood which shall be mentioned this of mining and counterminingthough the external sap went restlessly forward too and the cannonading was incessant on both sidescame to be regarded more and more as the real method and for six or seven weeks longer was persisted in with wonderful tenacity of attempt and resistance friedrichs chief mining engineer is also a frenchman one lefebvre who is personally the rival of gribeauval his old classfellow at college i almost think but is not his equal in subterranean workor perhaps rather has the harder task of it that of mining instead of countermining or spoiling mines tempelhofs account of these two people and their underground wrestle here is really curious readingclear as daylight to those that will study but of endless expansion as usual in

battle of reichenbach though there was not much of battle in itin which our old friend the duke of brunswickbevern whom we have seen in abeyance and merely a garrison commandant for years back till the russians left stettin to itself again played a shining part  daunat tannhausen 10 miles to southwest of friedrich and spread out among the hills with loudons lacys becks as lieutenants and in plenty of force could he resolve on using ithas at last after a months meditation hit upon a plan plan of flowing round by the southern skirt of friedrich and seizing certain heights to the southeastern or open side of schweidnitzkoltschen height the key one from which he may spread up at will height after height to the very zobtenberg on that eastern side and render schweidnitz an impossibility the plan people say was good but required rapidity of executiona thing daun is not strong in  beverns behavior too upon whom the edge of the matter fell was very good bevern coming on from neisse and upper silesia had been much manoeuvred upon for various days by beck beck a dangerous alert man doing his utmost to seize post after post and bar beverns waymeaning especially as ultimate thing to get hold of a height called fischerberg which lies near reichenbach in the southern schweidnitz vicinities and is preface to koltschen height and to the whole enterprise of daun in most of which attempts especially in this last bevern with great merit not of dexterity alone for the kings orders had often to be disobeyed in the letter and only the spirit of them held in view contrived to outmanoeuvre beck and be found august 13th already firm on the fischerberg when beck in full confidence came marching towards it the fischerberg lost to us beck had to report in disappointment must be recovered and my grand enterprise no longer put off thinks daun to himself in still more disappointment laggard that i amand on the third day following the battle of reichenbach ensued lacy as chief with abundant force and beck and brentano under him these are to march recover me that fischerberg it is the preface to koltschen and all else tempelhof vi 144  monday august 16th

austrians proceed to cooking their dinner nothing coming of them till tomorrow said friedrich who was here and went his way home on this symptom of the austrian procedureshardly consenting to regard them farther even when he heard their cannonade begin  lacy the general composure being thus established and dinner well done suddenly drew out about five in the evening in long strong line before these hamlets of peilau on the western side of the fischerberg beck privately pushing round by woods to take it on the eastern side and there ensued abundant cannonading on the part of lacy and brentano and some idle flourishing about of horse responded to by bevern and on the part of lacy and brentano nothing else whatever more like a theatre fight than a real one says tempelhof beck however is in earnest has a most difficult march through the tangled pathless woods does arrive at length and begin real fighting very sharp for some time which might have been productive had lacy given the least help to it as he did not tempelhof vi 146151 beck did his fieriest but got repulsed everywhere beck tries in various places finds swamps impediments fierce resistance from the bevern peoplefinds at length that the king is awake and that reinforcements horse foot ridingartillery are coming in at the gallop and that he beck cannot too soon get away  none of the kings foot people

compression which he reckoned to be the real sovereign methodunlucky that he was i may at least explain what globe de compression is for it becomes famous on this occasion and no name could be less descriptive of the thing not a globe at all for that matter nor intended to compress but to express and shatter to pieces in a transcendent degree it is in fact a huge cubical minechamber filled by a wooden box till friedrich in his hurry taught lefebvre that a sack would do as well loaded with say five thousandweight of powder sufficient to blow any hornwork bastion bulwark into the airprovided you plant it in the right place which poor lefebre never can he tried with immense labor successively some four or almost five of these press balls so called or volcanoes in little mining on many yards 15 or 20 feet underground tormented by gribeauval all the way then at last exploding his five thousandweightwould produce a funnel or crater of perhaps 30 yards in diameter but alas 150 yards

friedrich had to console him courage you will manage it make chicanes on gribeauval as he does on youand suggested that powdersack instead of dealbox which we just mentioned  friedrichs patience seems to have been great but in the end he began to think the time long he was in three successive headquarters dittmannsdorf peterswaldau bogendorf nearer and nearer at length quite near bogendorf within a couple of miles and wondering gazetteers reported him on horseback examining minutely the parallels and siegeworkswith a singular indifference to the cannonballs flying about not easy to hit a small

stollberg and company by a stunning blow battle of freyberg october 29thwhich must not go without mention were it only as prince henris sole battle and the last of this war preparatory to which and its sequel let us glance again at duke ferdinand and the englishfrench posturealso for the last time  cannonade at amoneburg 21st september 1762 the controversies about right or left bank of the fulda have been settled long since in ferdinands favor who proceeded next to blockade the various french strongholds in hessen marburg ziegenhayn especially cassel with an eye to besieging the same and rooting the french permanently out to prevent or delay which what can soubise and destrees do but send for their secondary smaller army which is in the lowerrhine country under a prince de conde mostly idle at present to come and join them in the critical regions here whereupon new controversy shifting westward to the mayn and niddalahn country to achieve said junction and to hinder it junction was not to be hindered the destreessoubise people and young conde made good manoeuvring handsome fight on occasion so that in spite of all the erbprinz could do they got hands joined far too strong for the erbprinz thenceforth and on the last night of august were all fairly together headquarter friedberg in frankfurt country a thirty miles north of frankfurt and were earnestly considering the now not hopeless question how or by what routes and methods push to northwestward get through to those blockaded hessian strongplaces cassel especially and hinder ferdinands besieging them and quite outrooting us there  this is a difficult question but a vital sweep rapidly past ferdinandcannot we well frontward or eastward of him dexterously across the lahn and its branches our light people are to rear of him on this side of the fulda between the fulda and him once joined with those light people by such methods we have cassel ahead ferdinand to rear and will make short work with the blockadesthe blockades will have to rise in a hurry this was the plan devised by destrees and rapidly set about but it was seen into at the first step by ferdinand who proved still more rapid upon it campings countercampings crossings of the lahn by destrees people then recrossings of it ensued for above a fortnight which are not for mention here in fine about the middle of september the destrees enterprise had plainly become impossible unless it could get across the ohman eastern or widecircling northeastern branch of the lahnwhere on the right or eastern bank of which as better for him than the lahn itself in this part ferdinand now is across the ohm and that how can that be done the provident ferdinand having laid hold of ohm and secured every pass of it several days ago perhaps by a surprisal by extreme despatch  amoneburg is a pleasant little town about thirty miles east of marburgin which latter we have been in very old times looking after st elizabeth teutsch ritters philip the magnanimous and other objects amoneburg stands on the left or western bank of the ohm with an old schloss in it and a bridge near by both of which ferdinand the left or southmost wing of whose position on the other bank of ohm is hereabouts has made due seizure of seizure of the bridge first of allbridge with a mill at it which in consequence is called bruckenmuhle bridgemillat the eastern end of this there is a strong redoubt with the bridgeway blocked and rammed ahead of it there ferdinand has put 200 men 500 more are across in amoneburg and its old castle unless by surprisal and extreme despatch there is clearly no hope ferdinands headquarter is seven or eight miles to northwest of this his bruckenmuhle and extreme left next to bruckenmuhle is zastrows division next again is granbys several divisions between ferdinand and it do it by surprisal by utmost force of vehemency say the french and accordingly  september 21st day of the equinox 1762 an hour before sunrise there began quite on the sudden a vivid attack on the bruckenmuhle and on amoneburg by cannon by musketry by all methods and in spite of the alert and completely obstinate resistance would not cease but on the contrary seemed to be on the increasing hand new cannon new musketries and went on hour after hour ever the more vivid so that about 8 in the morning after three hours of this zastrow with his division had to intervene to range himself on the hilltop behind this bruckenmuhle replace the afflicted 200 many of them hurt not a few killed by a fresh 200 of his own who again needed to be relieved before long for the french whom zastrow had to imitate in that respect kept bringing up more cannon ever more as if they would bring up all the cannon of their army and there rose between zastrow and them such a cannonade for length and loudness together as had not been heard in this war most furious cannonading musketading and seemingly no end to it ferdinand himself came over to ascertain found it a hot thing indeed zastrow had to relieve his 200 every hour dont go down in rank you new ones ordered heslide leap descend the hillface in scattered form rank at the bottomand generally about half of the old 200 were left dead or lamed by their hours work they intend to have this bridge from us at any cost thinks ferdinand and at any cost they shall not and in the end orders granby forward in room of zastrow who has had some eight hours of it now and rides home to look after his main quarters  it was about 4 in the afternoon when granby and his english came into the fire and i rather think the french onslaught was if anything more furious than everdespair striding visibly forward on it or something too like despair amoneburg they had battered to pieces wall and schloss so that the 500 had to ground arms but not an inch of way had they made upon the bridge nor were like to make granby continued on the old plan plying all his diligences and artilleries needing them all fierce work to a degree 200 of you go down on wings in an hour about 100 will come back in english families you will still hear some vague memory of amoneburg how we had built walls of the dead and fired from behind themfrench more and more furious we more and more obstinate granby had still four hours of it sunset twilight dusk about 8 the french in what spirits i can guess ceased and went their ways bridge impossible game up they had lost by their own account 1100 killed and wounded ferdinand probably not fewer mauvillon ii 251 heldengeschichte vii 432439  and in this loud peal what none could yet know the frenchenglish part of the sevenyears war had ended the french attempted nothing farther hutted themselves where they were and waited in the pouring rains ferdinand also hutted himself in guard of the ohm while his people plied their siegebatteries on cassel on ziegenhayn cannonading their best in the bad weathertook cassel did not quite take ziegenhayn

with reinforcements to him in fact prince henri of himself was all alertness and instantly appeared on the heights again seemingly quite in sanguinary humor and courting battle much more than was yet really the case which cowed stollberg from meddling with him farther as he might have done not for some ten days had henri finished his arrangements and then under cloud of night 28th29th october 1762 he did break forward on those spittelwalds and michaels mounts and multiplex impregnabilities about freyberg in what was thought a very shining manner the battle of freyberg i think is five or six miles long all on the west and finally on the southwest side of freyberg north and northwest sides with so many batteries and fortified villages are judged unattackable and the main stress very heavy for some time lay in the abatis of the spittelwald where seidlitz was sublime and about the roots of st michaels mount the top of it stollberg or some foolish general of stollbergs had left empty nobody there when we reached the topdown from which freyberg now lying free ahead of us and the spittelwald on our left now also ours we take stollberg in rear and turn him inside out the battle lasted only three hours till stollberg and his maguires campitellis and austrians especially his reichsfolk who did no work at all except at last running were all under way and the hopes of some saxon

should never have done my adorable duchess if i rendered you account of all the impressions which the friendship you lavished on me has made on my heart i could wish to answer it by entering into everything that can be agreeable to you conduct of my recruiters or commissariat people first of all i take the liberty of forwarding the answers which have come in to the two memoires you sent me i am mortified madam if i have not been able to fulfil completely your desires but if you knew the situation i am in i flatter myself you would have some consideration for it  i have found myself here in leipzig as elsewhere overwhelmed with business and even to a degree i had not expected meanwhile if i ever can manage again to run over and pay you in person the homage of a heart which is more attached to you than that of your near relations assuredly i will not neglect the first opportunity that shall present itself  messieurs the english bute bedford and company with their preliminaries signed and all my westphalian provinces left in a condition we shall hear of continue to betray poor m mitchell has had a stroke of apoplexy on hearing it it is a hideous thing chose affreuse but i will speak of it no more may you madam enjoy all the prosperities that i wish for you and not forget a friend who will be till his death with sentiments of the highest esteem and the most perfect considerationmadam your highnesss most faithful cousin and servant friedrich oeuvres de frederic xzvii 201  for a fortnight past friedrich has had no doubt that general peace is now actually at hand november 25th ten days before this visit a saxon privycouncillor baron von fritsch who by order from his court had privately been at vienna on the errand came privately next with all speed to friedrich meissen november 25th rodenbeck ii 193 austria willing for treaty is your majesty willing thricewilling i my terms well known friedrich would answergladdest of mankind to see general pacification coming to this vexed earth again the dance of the furies waltzing itself off home out of this upper sunlight the mad bellona steeds plunging down down towards their abysses again for a season  this was a result which friedrich had foreseen as nearly certain ever since the french and english signed their preliminaries and there was only one thing which gave him anxiety that of his rhine provinces and strong places especially wesel which have been in french hands for six years past ever since spring 1757 bute stipulates that those places and countries shall be evacuated by his choiseul as soon as weather and possibility permit but bute astonishing to say has not made the least stipulation as to whom they are to be delivered toallies or enemies it is all one to bute truly rather a shameful omission pitt might indignantly thinkand call the whole business steadily as he persisted to do a shameful peace had there been no other article in it but thisas friedrich with at least equal emphasis thought and felt and in fact it had thrown him into very great embarrassment on the first emergence of it  for her imperial majesty began straightway to draw troops into those neighborhoods we will take delivery our allies playing into our hand and friedrich who had no disposable troops had to devise some rapid expedient and did set his freecorps agents and recruiters in motion enlist me those light people of duke ferdinands who are all getting discharged especially that britannic legion so called all to be discharged reenlist them you ferdinand will keep them till you do it be swift and it is donea small bit of actual enlistment among the many prospective that were going on as we noticed above precise date of it not given must have been soon after november 3d there were from 5 to 6000 of them and it was promptly done divided into various regiments chief command of them given to a colonel bauer under whom a colonel beckwith whose name we have heard these to the surprise of imperial majesty and alarm of a pacific versailles suddenly appeared in the cleve countries handy for wesel for geldern in such posts and in such force and condition as intimated it shall be we under favor that take delivery snatch wesel from them some night sword in hand that had been bauers notion but nothing of that kind was found necessary mere demonstration proved sufficient to the french garrisons the one thing needful was to get away in peace bauer with his brows gloomy is a dangerous neighbor perhaps the french officers themselves rather favored friedrich than his enemies enough a private agreement or mutual understanding on word of honor was come to and very publicly at length on the 11th and 12th days of march 1763 peace now settled everywhere wesel in great gala full of fieldmusic military salutations and mutual dining saw the french all filing out and bauer and people filing in to the joy of that poor town preuss ii 342  soon after which painful to relate such the inexorable pressure of finance bauer and people were all paid off flung loose again ruthlessly paid off by a necessitous king there were about 6000 of those poor fellowsspecimens of the bastard heroic under difficulties from every country in the world beckwith and i know not what other english specimens of the lawless heroic who were all cashiered officer and man on getting to berlin as were the earlier freecorps and indeed the subsequent all and sundry except seven whose names will not be interesting to you paid off with or without remorse such the exhaustion of finance kleist icilius count hordt and others vainly repugning and remonstrating the king himself inexorable as arithmetic can maintain 138000 of regular 12000 of other sorts not a man more zealous icilius applied for some consideration to his officers partial repayment of the money they have spent from their own pocket in enlistment of their people now discharged not a doit the kings answer is in autograph still extant not in good spelling but with sense clear as light seine officiers haben wie die raben gestollen sie krigen nichts your officers stole like ravensthey get nothing preuss ii 320 lessings fine play of minna von barnhelm testifies to considerable public sympathy for these impoverished exmilitary people pathetic truly in a degree but such things will happen irregular gentlemen to whom the world s their oystersaid oyster does suddenly snap to on them by a chance and they have to try it on the other side and say littlebut we are forgetting the peacetreaty itself which still demands a few words  kleists raid into the reich had a fine effect on the potentates there and plothos offer was greedily complied with the kaiser such his generosity giving free permission we spoke of privycouncillor von fritsch and his private little word with friedrich at meissen on november 25th the electoralprince of saxony it seems was author of that fine stroke the history of it this since november 3d the french and english have had their preliminaries signed and all nations are longing for the like let us have a german treaty for general peace said the kurprinz of saxony that amiable heirapparent whom we have seen sometimes who is rather crooked of back but has a sprightly wife by all means answered polish majesty and as i am in the distance do you in every way further it my son whereupon despatch of fritsch to vienna and thence to meissen with yes to him from both parties plenipotentiaries are named fritsch shall be ours they shall have my schloss of hubertsburg for place of congress said the prince and on thursday december 30th 1762 the three dignitaries met at hubertsburg and began business  this is the schloss in torgau country which quintus iciliuss people saldern having refused the job willingly undertook spoiling and as is well known did it january 22d 1761 a thing quintus never heard the end of what the amount of profit or the degree of spoil and mischief quintuss people made of it i could not learn but infer from this new event that the wreck had not been so considerable as the noise was at any rate that the schloss had soon been restored to its pristine state of brilliancy the plenipotentiariesfor saxony fritsch for austria a von collenbach unknown to us for prussia one hertzberg a man experienced beyond his years who is of great name in prussian history subsequentlysat here till february 15th 1763 that is for six weeks and five days leaving their protocols to better judges who report them good we will much prefer a word or two from friedrich himself while waiting the result they come to   friedrich to prince henri home at berlin  leipzig 14th january 1763 am not surprised you find berlin changed for the worse such a train of calamities must in the end make itself felt in a poor and naturally barren country where continual industry is needed to second its fecundity and keep up production however i will do what i can to remedy this dearth la disette at least as far as my small means permit  no fear of geldern and wesel all that has been cared for by bauer and the new freecorps by the end of february peace will be signed at the beginning of april everybody will find himself at home as in 1756  the circles are going to separate indifferent to me or nearly so but it is good to be plucking out tiresome burning sticks stick after stick i hope you amuse yourself at berlin at leipzig nothing but balls and redouts my nephews diverting themselves amazingly madam friedrich lately gardenmaid at seidlitz village in the neumark with this beauty plucking weeds in itlittle prescient of such a fortune now wife to an officer of the free hussars is the principal heroine of these festivities schoning iii 528  leipzig 25th january 1763 thanks for your care about my existence i am becoming very old dear brother in a little while i shall be useless to the world and a burden to myself it is the lot of all creatures to wear down with agebut one is not for all that to abuse ones privilege of falling into dotage  you still speak without full confidence of our negotiation business going on at hubertsburg yonder most certainly the chapter of accidents is inexhaustible and it is still certain there may happen quantities of things which the limited mind of man cannot foresee but judging by the ordinary course and such degrees of probability as human creatures found their hopes on i believe before the month of february entirely end our peace will be completed in a permanent arrangement many things need settling which are easier to settle now than they ever will be again patience haste without speed is a thriftless method ib iii 529  february 5th the trio at hubertsburg got their preliminaries signed on the tenth day thereafter the treaty itself was signed and sealed all other treaties on the same subject had been guided towards a contemporary finis england and france ready since the 3d of november last

there had perished of actual fighters on the various fields of all the nations 853000 of which above the fifth part or 180000 is his own share and by misery and ravage the general population of prussia finds itself 500000 fewer nearly the ninth man missing this is the expenditure of life other items are not worth enumerating in comparison if statistically given you can find the most approved guesses at them by the same head who ought to be an authority oeuvres de frederic v 230234 preuss iii 349351 it was a war distinguished byarchenholtz will tell you with melodious emphasis what a distinguished great and thricegreatest war it was there have since been other far bigger warsif size were a measure of greatness which it by no means is i believe there was excellent heroism shown in this war by persons i could name by one person heroism really to be called superior or in its kind almost of the rank of supremeand that in regard to the military arts and virtues it has as yet for faculty and for performance had no rival nor is likely soon to have the prussians as we once mentioned still use it as their schoolmodel in those respects and weo readers do not at least you and i thank god to have now done with it  of the peacetreaties at hubertsburg paris and other places it is not necessary that we say almost anything they are to be found in innumerable books dreary to the mind and of the 158 articles to be counted there not one could be interesting at present the substance of the whole lies now in three points not mentioned or contemplated at all in those documents though repeatedly alluded to and intimated by us here  the issue as between austria and prussia strives to be in all points simply asyouwere and in all outward or tangible points strictly is so after such a tornado of strife as the civilized world had not witnessed since the thirtyyears war tornado springing doubtless from the regions called infernal and darkening the upper world from south to north and from east to west for seven years longissuing in general asyouwere yes truly the tornado was infernal but heaven too had silently its purposes in it nor is the mere expenditure of mens diabolic rages in mutual clash as of opposite electricities with reduction to equipoise and restoration of zero and repose again after seven years the one or the principal result arrived at inarticulately little dreamt of at the time by any bystander the results on survey from this distance are visible as threefold let us name them one other time  1 there is no taking of silesia from this man no clipping of him down to the orthodox old limits he and his country have palpably outgrown these austria gives up the problem we have lost silesia yes and what you hardly yet knowand what i perceive friedrich himself still less knowsteutschland has found prussia prussia it seems cannot be conquered by the whole world trying to do it prussia has gone through its firebaptism to the satisfaction of gods and men and is a nation henceforth in and of poor dislocated teutschland there is one of the great powers of the world henceforth an actual nation and a nation not grounding itself on extinct traditions wiggeries papistries immaculate conceptions no but on living factsfacts of arithmetic geometry gravitation martin luthers reformation and what it really can believe into the infinite advantage of said nation and of poor teutschland henceforth to be a nation and to believe as you are convinced instead of pretending to believe as you are bribed or bullied by the devils about you what an advantage to parties concerned if prussia follow its staras it really tries to do in spite of stumbling for the sake of germany one hopes always prussia will and that it may get through its various childdiseases without death though it has had sad plunges and crisesand is perhaps just now in one of its worst influenzas the parliamentaryeloquence or ballotbox influenza one of the most dangerous diseases of national adolescence extremely prevalent over the world at this timeindeed unavoidable for reasons obvious enough sic itur ad astra all nations certain that the way to heaven is by voting by eloquently wagging the tongue within those walls diseases real or imaginary await nations like individuals and are not to be resisted but must be submitted to and got through the best you can measles and mumps you cannot prevent them in nations either nay fashions even fashion of crinoline for instance how infinitely more that of ballotbox and fourthestateare you able to prevent even that you have to be patient under it and keep hoping  2 in regard to england her jenkinssear controversy is at last settled not only liberty of the seas but if she were not wiser dominion of them guardianship of liberty for all others whatsoever dominion of the seas for that wise object america is to be english not french what a result is that were there no other really a considerable fact in the history of the world fact principally due to pitt as i believe according to my best conjecture and comparison of probabilities and circumstances for which after all is not everybody thankful less or more o my english brothers o my yankee halfbrothers how oblivious are we of those that have done us benefit  these are the results for england and in the rear of these had these and the other elements once ripened for her the poor country is to get into such merchandisings colonizings foreignsettlings goldnuggetings as lay beyond the drunkenest dreams of jenkins supposing jenkins addicted to liquorand in fact to enter on a universal uproar of machineries eldorados unexampled prosperities which make a great noise for themselves in the very days now come prosperities evidently not of a sublime type which in the mean while seem to be covering the at one time creditably clean and comely face of england with mudblotches sootblotches miscellaneous squalors and horrors to be preaching into her amazed heart which once knew better the omnipotence of  shoddy filling her ears and soul with shriekery and metallic clangor mad noises mad hurries mostly nowhitherand are awakening i suppose in such of her sons as still go into reflection at all a deeper and more ominous set of questions than have ever risen in englands history before as in the foregoing case we have to be patient and keep hoping  3 in regard to france it appears noble old teutschland with such pieties and unconquerable silent valors such opulences human and divine amid its wreck of new and old confusions is not to be cut in four and made to dance to the piping of versailles or another far the contrary to versailles itself there has gone forth versailles may read it or not the writing on the
