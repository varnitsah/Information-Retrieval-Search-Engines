and saw her sitting there fair as a flower and robed like a royal courtesan in flame and snow  like a red torch flamed the ruby in her hair her shoulders were framed in her cloak white as marble warmed with firelight her gloved hands held an opera glass which also glowed with flashing light  his face grew dark and stern he looked down at his poor coat and around at the motley gallery which reeked with the smell of tobacco and liquor  students were therepoor like himself but with great musicloving hungry ambitious souls men and women of refinement and indomitable will sat side by side with drunken loafers who had chanced to stumble up the stairway  his eyes went back to her so sweet and dainty was every thread on her fair body no smell of toil nor touch of care nor mark of weariness her flesh was ivory her eyes were jewels her heart was as clean and sweet as her eyes she was perfectly clothed protected at ease  no not at ease she seemed restless again and again she swept her glass around the lower balcony  the man in the gallery knew she was looking for him and he took a bitter delight in the distance between them he waited calm as a lion in his power  the man at her elbow talks on she does not hear she is still lookinga little swifter a little more anxiouslyher red lips ready to droop in disappointment  the noise of feet of falling seats continues boys call shrilly ushers dart hastily to and fro the soft laughter and hum of talk come up from below  she has reached the second balcony she sweeps it hurriedly her companion raises his eyes to the same balcony and laughs as he speaks she colors a little but smiles as she lifts her eyes to the third balcony  suddenly the glass stops the color surges up her neck splashing her cheeks with red her breath stops also for a moment then returns quick and strong  her smile settles into a curious contraction that is almost painful to see his unsmiling eyes are looking somberly sternly accusingly into hers they are charged with all the bitterness and hate and disappointed ambition which social injustice and inequality had wrought into his soul  she shivered and dropped her glass shivered and drew her fleecy pink and paleblue cloak closer about her bare neck  her face grew timid almost appealing as she turned it upward toward him like a flower to be kissed across the height that divided him from her  his heart swelled with exultation his face softened from the height of his intellectual pride he bent his head and sent a winged caress fluttering down upon that flowerlike face  and then the stealing harmony of the violins began gliding like mist above the shuddering tumultuous obscure thunder of the drums and the mans soul swept across that sea of song with the heart of a lion and the wings of an eagle  a tender musing smile was on the womans lips       wayside courtships  a preachers love story  i   the train drew out of the great van buren street depot at 430 of a dark day in late october a tall young man with a timid look in his eyes was almost the last one to get on and his pale face wore a worried look as he dropped into an empty seat and peered out at the squalid buildings reeling past in the mist  the buildings grew smaller and vacant lots appeared stretching away in flat spaces broken here and there by ridges of ugly squat little tenement blocks over this landscape vast banners of smoke streamed magnified by the misty rain which was driven in from the lake  at last there came a swell of land clothed on with trees it was still light enough to see they were burr oaks and the young students heart thrilled at sight of them his forehead smoothed out and his eyes grew tender with boyish memories  he was seated thus with head leaning against the pane when another young man came down the aisle from the smoking car and took a seat beside him with a pleasant word  he was a handsome young fellow of twentythree or four his face was large and beardless and he had beautiful teeth he had a bold and keen look in spite of the bang of yellow hair which hung over his forehead  some commonplaces passed between them and then silence fell on each the conductor coming through the car the smoothfaced young fellow put up a card to be punched and the student handed up a ticket simply saying kesota  after a decent pause the younger man said going to kesota are you  yes  so am i i live there in fact  do you then perhaps you can tell me the name of your county superintendent im looking for a school he smiled frankly im just out of jackson university and  that so im an ann arbor man myself they took a moment for mutual warming up yes i know the superintendent why not come right up to my boarding place and tomorrow ill introduce you looking for a school eh what kind of a school  oh a village school or even a country school its too late to get a good place but ive been sick and  yes the good positions are all snapped up still you might by accident hit on something i know mott hell do all he can for you by the way my names allen  the young student understood this hint and spoke mine is stacey  the younger man mused a few minutes as if he had forgotten his new acquaintance suddenly he roused up  say would you take a country school several miles out  i think i would if nothing better offered  well out in my neighborhood theyre without a teacher its six miles out and it isnt a lovely neighborhood however they will pay fifty dollars a month thats ten dollars extra for the scrimmages they wanted me to teach this wintermy sister teaches it in summerbut great peter i cant waste my time teaching school when i can run up to chicago and take a shy at the pit and make a whole terms wages in thirty minutes  i dont understand said stacey  wheat exchange ive got a lot of friends in the pit and i can come in any time on a little deal im no jim keene but i hope to get cash enough to handle five thousand i wanted the old gent to start me up in it but he said nix come arouse fact is i dropped the money he gave me to go through college with he smiled at staceys disapproving look yes indeedy theres where the jar came into our tender relations oh i call on the governoralways when ive got a wad i have fun with him he smiled brightly ask him if he dont need a little cash to pay for hogkillin or something like that he laughed again no i didnt graduate at ann arbor funny how things go aint it i was on my way back the third year when i stopped in to see the pitits one o the sights of chicago you knowand billy krans saw me looking over the rail i went in won and then took a flyer on december come a big slump and i failed to materialize at school  what did you do then asked stacey to whom this did not seem humorous  i wrote a contrite letter to the governor stating case requesting forgivenessand money no go couldnt raise neither i then wrote casting him off you are no longer father of mine he smiled again radiantly you should have seen me the next time i went home plug hat imported suit gold watch diamond shirtstud cost me 200 to paralyze the general but i did it my glory absolutely turned him white as a sheet i knew what he thought so i said perfectly legitimate dad the walls of joliet are not gaping for me that about half fetched himcalling him dad i meanbut he cant get reconciled to my business too many ups and downs he says fact is he thinks its gambling and i dont argue the case with him im on my way home now to stay over sunday  the train whistled and allen looked out into the darkness were coming to the crossing now i cant go up to the boarding place when you do but ill give you directions and you tell the landlady i sent you and itll be all right allen you rememberherman allen  following directions stacey came at length to a twostory frame house situated on the edge of the bank with its back to the river it stood alone with vacant lots all about a pleasantfaced woman answered the ring  he explained briefly how do you do im a teacher and id like to get board here a few days while passing my examinations mr herman allen sent me  the womans quick eye and ear were satisfied all right walk in sir im pretty full but i expect i can accommodate youif you dont mind mr allen for a roommate  oh not at all he said while taking off his coat  come right in this way supper will be ready soon  he went into a comfortable sitting room where a huge open fire of soft coal was blazing magnificently the walls were papered in florid patterns and several enlarged portraits were on the walls the fire was the really great adornment all else was cheap and some of it was tawdry  stacey spread his thin hands to the blaze while the landlady sat down a moment out of politeness to chat scanning him keenly she was a handsome woman strong well rounded about forty years of age with quick gray eyes and a clean firmlipped mouth  did you just get in  yes ive been on the road all day he said on an impulse of communication indeed im just out of college  is that so exclaimed mrs mills stopping her rocking in an access of interest what college  jackson university ive been sick and only came west  there came a look into her face that transformed and transfigured her my boy was in ann arbor he was killed on the train on his way home one day she stopped for fear of breaking into a quaver and smiled brightly thats why i always like college boys they all stop here with me she rose hastily well youll excuse me wont you and ill go an tend to supper  there was a great deal that was feminine in stacey and he felt at once the pathos of the womans life he looked a refined studious rather delicate young man as he sat low in his chair and observed the light and heat of the fire his large head looked to be full of learning and his dark eyes were deep with religious fervor  several young women entered and the room was filled with clatter of tongues herman came in a few moments later his face in a girlish glow of color everybody rushed at him with loud outcry he was evidently a great favorite he threw his arms about mrs mills giving her a hearty hug the girls pretended to be shocked when he reached out for them but they were not afraid of him they hung on his arms and besieged him with questions till he cried out in jolly perplexity  girls girls this will never do  mrs mills brushed out his damp yellow curls with her hands youre all wet  girls if youll let me sit down ill take one on each knee he said pleadingly and they released him  stacey grew red with sympathetic embarrassment and shrank away into a corner  go get supper ready commanded herman and it was only after they left that he said to stacey oh you found your way all right i didnt see youthose confounded girls bother me so he took a seat by the fire and surveyed his wet shoes i took a run up to motts houseonly a half block out o the way he said theyd be tickled to have you at cyene by the way youre a theolog arent you wallace nodded and herman went on so i told mott he said you might work up a society out there at cyene  is there a church there  used to be butsay i tell you what you do you go out with me tomorrow and ill give you the whole history  the ringing of the bell took them out into the cheerful dining room in a goodnatured scramble mrs mills put stacey at one end of the table near a young woman who looked like a teacher and he had full sweep of the table which was surrounded by bright and sunny faces the station hand was there and a couple of grocery clerks and a brakeman sat at staceys right hand the table was very merry they called each other by their christian names and there was very obvious courtship on the part of several young couples  stacey escaped from the table as soon as possible and returned to his seat beside the fire he was young enough to enjoy the chatter of the girls but his timidity made him glad they paid so little attention to him the rain had changed to sleet outside and hammered at the window viciously but the blazing fire and the romping young people set it at defiance the landlady came to the door of the dining room dish and cloth in hand to share in each outburst of laughter and not infrequently the hired girl peered over her shoulder with a broad smile on her face a little later having finished their work they both came in and took active part in the lighthearted fun  herman and one of the girls were having a great struggle over some trifle he had snatched from her hand and the rest stood about laughing to see her desperate attempts to recover it this was a familiar form of courtship in kesota and an evening filled with such romping was considered a cracking good time after the girl red and disheveled had given up herman sat down at the organ and they all sang moody and sankey hymns negro melodies and college songs till nine oclock then mrs mills called come now boys and girls and they all said good night like obedient children  herman and wallace went up to their bedroom together  say stacey have you got a policy wallace shook his head and dont want any i suppose well i just asked you as a matter of form you see he went on winking at wallace comically nominally im an insurance agent but practically im a lambbut i get a mouthful o fur myself occasionally what im working for is to get on that wheat exchange thats where you get life id rather be an established broker in that howling mob than go to congress  suddenly a thought struck him he rose on his elbow in bed and looked at wallace just as he rose from a silent prayer catching his eye herman said  say why didnt you shout i forgot all about iti mean your profession  wallace crept into bed beside his communicative bedfellow in silence he didnt know how to deal with such spirits  say called herman suddenly as they were about to go to sleep you aint got no picnic old man  why what do you mean  wait till you see cyene church oh its a daisy snarl  i wish youd tell me about it  oh its quiet now the calmness of death said herman well you see it came this way the church is made up of baptists and methodists and the methodists wanted an organ because you understand father was the head center and mattie is the only girl among the methodists who can play the old man has got a head like a mule he cant be switched off once he makes up his mind deacon marsden he dont believe in anything above tuning forks and hes tightern the bark on a bulldog he stood out like a sore thumb and dad wouldnt give an inch  you see they held meetings every other sunday so dad worked up the organ business and got one and then locked it up when the baptists held their services well it went from bad to worse they didnt speak as they passed bythat is the old folks we young folks didnt care a continental whether school kept or not well upshot is the church died out the wind blew the horse sheds down and there they lieand the church is standing there empty as anold bootand he grew too sleepy to finish  suddenly a comical idea roused him again say staceyby jinksare you a baptist  yes  oh peter aint that lovely he chuckled shamelessly and went off to sleep without another word   ii  herman was still sleeping when stacey rose and dressed and went down to breakfast mrs mills defended herman against the charge of laziness hes probably been out late all the week  stacey found mott in the county courthouse and a perfunctory examination soon put him in possession of a certificate there was no question of his attainments  herman met him at dinnertime  well elder im going down to get a rig to go out home in its coldern a blue whetstone so put on all the clothes youve got gimme your check and ill get your traps have you seen mott  yes  well then everythings all fixed  he turned up about three oclock seated on the spring seat of a lumber wagon beside a woman who drove the powerful team whether she was young or old could not be told through her wraps she wore a cap and a thick faded cloak  mrs mills hurried to the door why mattie allen what you doin out such a day as this come in here instanter  cant stop called a clear boyish voice too late  well land o starsyoull freeze  when wallace reached the wagon side herman said my sister stacey  the girl slipped her strong brown hand out of her huge glove and gave him a friendly grip get right in she said herman youre going to stand up behind  herman appealed to mrs mills for sympathy this is what comes of having plebeian connections  oh dry up laughed the girl or ill make you drive  stacey scrambled in awkwardly beside her she was not at all embarrassed apparently  tuck yourself in tight its mighty cold on the prairie  why didnt you come down with the baroosh grumbled herman  well the corn was contracted for and father wasnt able to comehe had another attack of neuralgia last night after he got the corn loadedso i had to come  shant i drive for you asked wallace  no thank you youll have all you can do to keep from freezing she looked at his thin coat and worn gloves with keen eyes he could see only her pink cheeks strong nose and dark smiling eyes  it was one of those terrible illinois days when the temperature drops suddenly to zero and the churned mud of the highways hardens into a sort of scoriac rock which cripples the horses and sends the heavy wagons booming and thundering along like mad things the wind was keen and terrible as a sawbladed sword and smote incessantly the desolate sky was one thick impenetrable mass of swiftly flying clouds when they swung out upon the long pike leading due north wallace drew his breath with a gasp and bent his head to the wind  pretty strong isnt it shouted mattie  oh the farmers life is the life for me trala sang herman from his shelter behind the seat  mattie turned what do you think of penelope this month  shes agitten there said herman pounding his shoe heels  shes too smart for young corey she ought to marry a man like bromfield my wouldnt they talk  did y get the second bundle of magazines last saturday  yes and dad found something in the popular science that made him mad and he burned it  did e tumlala oh the farmers life for me  are you cold she asked wallace  he turned a purple face upon her nonot much  i guess you better slip right down under the blankets she advised  the wind blew gray out of the northa wild blast which stopped the young students blood in his veins he hated to give up but he could no longer hold the blankets up over his knees so he slipped down into the corner of the box with his back to the wind with the blankets drawn over his head  the powerful girl slapped the reins down on the backs of the snorting horses and encouraged them with shouts like a man get out o this dan hup there nellie  the wagon boomed and rattled the floor of the box seemed beaten with a maul the glimpses wallace had of the land appalled him it was so flat and gray and bare the houses seemed poor and drainpipe scattered about told how wet it all was  herman sang at the top of his voice and danced and pounded his feet against the wagon box this ends it if i cant come home without freezing to death i dont come i should have hired a rig irrespective of you  the girl laughed oh youre getting thinblooded herman life in the city has taken the starch all out of you  better grow limp in a great city than freeze stiff in the country he replied  an hours ride brought them into a yard before a large graywhite frame house  herman sprang out to meet a tall old man with head muffled up hello dad take the team were just naturally froze solidat least i am this is mr stacey the new teacher  how de do run in ill take the horses  herman and wallace stumbled toward the house stiff and bent  herman flung his arms about a tall woman in the kitchen door hello muz he said this is mr stacey the new teacher  draw up to the fire sir herman take his hat and coat  mattie came in soon with a boyish rush she was gleeful as a happy babe she unwound the scarf from her head and neck and hung up her cap and cloak like a man but she gave her hair a little touch of feminine care and came forward with both palms pressed to her burning cheeks  did you suffer child asked mrs allen  no i enjoyed it  herman looked at stacey i believe on my life she did  oh its fun i dont get a chance to do anything so exciting very often  herman clicked his tongue exciting well well  you must remember things are slower here mattie explained  she came to light much younger than stacey thought her she was not eighteen but her supple and splendid figure was fully matured her hair hung down her back in a braid which gave a subtle touch of childishness to her  sis youre still agrowin herman said as he put his arm around her waist and looked up at her  she seemed to realize for the first time that stacey was a young man and her eyes fell  well now set up the chairs child said mrs allen  when the young teacher returned from his cold spare room off the parlor the family sat waiting for him they all drew up noisily and allen said  ask the blessing sir  wallace said grace  as allen passed the potatoes he continued  my son tells me you are a minister of the gospel  i have studied for it  what denomination  tut tut warned herman dont start any theological rabbits tonight dad with jaw swelled up you wont be able to hold your own  im a baptist stacey answered  the old mans face grew grim it had been ludicrous before with its swollen jaw baptist the old man turned to his son whose smile angered him didnt you know no moren to bring a baptist preacher into this house  there there father began the wife  be quiet im boss of this shanty  herman struck in dont make a show of yourself old man dont mind the old gent stacey hes mumpy today anyhow  stacey rose i guess iid better not stayi  oh no no sit down stacey its all right the old mans a little acid at me he doesnt mean it  stacey got his coat and hat his heart was swollen with indignation he felt as if something fine were lost to him and the cold outside was so desolate now  mrs allen was in tears but the old man having taken his stand was going to keep it  herman lost his temper a little well dad youre a little the cussedest christian i ever knew stacey sit down dont you be a fool just because he is  stacey was buttoning his coat with trembling hands when martha went up to him  dont go she said fathers sick and cross hell be sorry for this tomorrow  wallace looked into her frank kindly eyes and hesitated  herman said dad you are a lovely follower of christ youll apologize for this or ill never set foot on your threshold again  stacey still hesitated he was hurt and angry but being naturally a sweet and gentle nature he grew sad and yielding to the pressure of the girls hand on his arm he began to unbutton his overcoat  she helped him off with it and hung it back on the nail she did not show tears but her face was unwontedly grave  they sat at the table again and herman and mattie tried to restore something of the brightness which had been lost allen sat grimly eating his chin pushed down like a hogs snout  after supper as his father was about retiring to his bedroom herman fixed his bright eyes on him and something very hard and masterful came into his boyish face  old manyou and i havent had a settlement on this thing yet ill see you later  allen shrank before his sons look but shuffled sullenly off without uttering a word  herman turned to wallace stacey i want to beg your pardon for getting you into this scrape i didnt suppose the old gentleman would act like that the older he gets the more his new hampshire granite shows i hope you wont lay it up against me  wallace was too conscientious to say he didnt mind it but he took hermans hand in a quick clasp  lets have a song proposed herman music hath charms to soothe the savage breast to charm a rock and split a cabbage  they went into the best room where a fire was blazing and mattie and herman sang hymns and oldfashioned love songs and college glees wonderfully intermingled they ended by singing lorena a wailing supersentimental love song current in war times and when they looked around there was a lofty look on the face of the young preachera look of exaltation of consecration and resolve   iii  the next morning at breakfast herman said as he seized a hot biscuit well dispense with grace this morning and till after the war is over but wallace blessed his bread in a silent prayer and mattie thought it very brave of him to do so  herman was full of mockery the sun rises just the same whether its sprinkling or immersion its lucky nature dont take a hand in these theological contestsshe doesnt even referee the scrap she never seems to care whether you are sparring for points or fighting to a finish what you theologic middleweights are really fighting for i cant seeand i dont care till you fall over the ropes on to my corns  stacey listened in a daze to hermans tirade he knew it was addressed to allen and that it deprecated war and that it was mocking the fresh face and smiling lips of the young girl seemed to put hermans voice very far away it was such a beautiful thing to sit at table with a lovely girl  after breakfast he put on his cap and coat and went out into the clear cold november air all about him the prairie extended marked with farmhouses and lined with leafless hedges artificial groves surrounded each homestead relieving the desolateness of the fields  down the road he saw the spire of a small white church and he walked briskly toward it hermans description in his mind  as he came near he saw the ruined sheds the rotting porch and the windows boarded up and his face grew sad he tried one of the doors and found it open some tramp had broken the lock the inside was even more desolate than the outside it was littered with rotting straw and plum stones and melon seeds obscene words were scrawled on the walls and even on the pulpit itself  taken altogether it was an appalling picture to the young servant of the man of galilee a blunt reminder of the ferocity and depravity of man  as he pondered the fire burned and there rose again the flame of his resolution he lifted his face and prayed that he might be the one to bring these people into the living union of the church of christ  his blood set toward his heart with tremulous action his eyes glowed with zeal like that of the middle ages he saw the people united once more in this desecrated hall he heard the bells ringing the sound of song the smile of peaceful old faces and voices of love and fellowship filling the anterooms where hate now scrawled hideous blasphemy against woman and against god  as he sat there herman came in his keen eyes seeking out every stain and evidence of vandalism  cheerful prospectisnt it  wallace looked up with the blaze of his resolution still in his eyes his pale face was sweet and solemn  oh how these people need christ  herman turned away they need killingabout two dozen of em id like to have the job of indicating which ones i wouldnt miss the old man you bet he said with blasphemous audacity  wallace was helpless in the face of such reckless thought and so sat looking at the handsome young fellow as he walked about  well now stacey i guess youll need to move i had another session with the old man but he wont give in so im off for chicago mothers brother george chapman who lives about as near the schoolhouse on the other side will take you in i guess wed better go right down now and see about it ive said goodby to the old manfor good this time we didnt shake hands either he said as they walked down the road together he was very stern and hard something of the father was hidden under his laughing exterior  stacey regretted deeply the necessity which drove him out of allens house mrs allen and mattie had appealed to him very strongly for years he had lived far from young women and there was a magical power in the intimate home actions of this young girl her bare head with simple arrangement of hair someway seemed the most beautiful thing he had ever seen  he thought of her as he sat at the table with george and his aged mother they lived alone and their lives were curiously silent once in a while a lowvoiced question and that was all  george read the popular science harpers monthly magazine and the open court and brooded over them with slow intellectual movement it was wonderful the amount of information he secreted from these periodicals he was better informed than many college graduates  he had little curiosity about the young stranger he understood he was to teach the school and he did not go further in inquiry  he tried wallace once or twice on the latest discoveries of john fiske and edison and then gave him up and retired to his seat beside the sittingroom stove  on the following monday morning school began and as wallace took his way down the lane the wrecked church came again to his eyes he walked past it with slow feet his was a deeply religious nature one that sorrowed easily over sin suffering of the poor did not trouble him hunger seemed a little thing beside losing ones everlasting soul therefore to come from his studies upon such a monument of human depravity as this rotting church was to receive a shock and to hear a call to action  approaching the schoolhouse his thought took a turn toward the scholars and toward mattie he had forgotten to ask her if she intended to be one of his pupils  there were several children already gathered at the schoolhouse door as he came up it was all very americanthe boxlike house of white the slender teacher approaching the roughly clad urchins waiting  he said good morning scholars  they chorused a queer croak in replyhesitating inarticulate shy he unlocked the door and entered the cold bare roomfamiliar unlovely with a certain power of primitive associations in such a room he had studied his primer and his rays arithmetic in such a room he had made gradual recession from the smallest front seat to the back wall seat and from one side of such a room to the other he had furtively worshiped a graceful girlish head  he allowed himself but a moment of such dreaming and then he assumed command and with his ready helpers a fire was soon started other children came in timorous as rabbits slipping by with one eye fixed on him like scared chickens they preempted their seats by putting down books and slates and there arose sly wars for possession which he felt in curious amusementit was so like his own life at that age  he assumed command as nearly in the manner of the oldtime teachers as he could recall and the work of his teaching was begun the day passed quickly and as he walked homeward again there stood that rotting church and in his mind there rose a surging emotion larger than he could himself comprehenda desire to rebuild it by uniting the warring factions of whose lack of christianity it was fatal witness   iv  now this mystical thing happened as this son of a line of preachers brooded on this unlovely strife among men he lost the equipoise of the scholar and student of modern history he grew narrower and more intense the burden of his responsibility as a preacher of christ grew daily more insupportable  toward the end of the week he announced preaching in the schoolhouse on sunday afternoon and at the hour set he found the room crowded with people of all ages and sorts  his heart grew heavy as he looked out over the room on women nursing querulous children on the grizzled faces of grimlooking men who studied him with keen unsympathetic eyes he had hard unfriendly material to work with there were but few of the opposite camp present while the baptist leaders were all there with more curiosity than sympathy in their faces  they exulted to think the next preacher to come among them as an evangelist should be a baptist  after the singing which would have dribbled away into failure but for mattie wallace rose looking very white and weak and began his prayer some of the boys laughed when his voice stuck in his throat but he went on to the end of an earnest supplication feeling he had not touched them at all  while they sang again he sat looking down at them with dry throat and staring eyes they seemed so hard so unchristianlike what could he say to them he saw mattie looking at him and on the front seat sat three beautiful little girls huddled together with hands clasped they were inexpressibly dainty by contrast as he looked at them the thought came to him what is the goodness of a girlof a child it is not partisanit is not of creeds of articlesit is goodness of thought of deeds his face lighted up with the inward feeling of this idea and he rose resolutely  friends with the help of christ i am come among you to do you good i shall hold meetings each night here in the schoolhouse until we can unite and rebuild the church again let me say now friends that i was educated a baptist my father was a faithful worker in the baptist church and so was his father before him i was educated in a baptist college and i came here hoping to build up a baptist church he paused  but i see my mistake i am here to build up a church of christ of good deeds and charity and peace and so i here say i am no longer a baptist or methodist i am only a preacher and i will not rest until i rebuild the church which stands rotting away there his voice rang with intellectual determination as he uttered those words  the people listened there was no movement now even the babies seemed to feel the need of being silent when he began again it was to describe that hideous wreck he delineated the falling plaster the litter around the pulpit the profanation of the walls it is a symbol of your sinful hearts he cried  much more he said carried out of himself by his passion it was as if the repentant spirit of his denominational fathers were speaking through him and yet he was not so impassioned that he did not see or at least feel the eyes of the strong young girl fixed upon him his resolution he spoke looking at her and a swift response seemed to leap from her eyes  when it was over some of the methodists and one of the baptists came up to shake hands with him awkwardly wordless and the pressure of their hands helped him many of the baptist brethren slipped outside to discuss the matter some were indignant others much more moved  allen went by him with an audible grunt of derision and there was a dark scowl on his face but mattie smiled at him with tears still in her eyes she had been touched by his vibrant voice she had no sins to repent of  the skeptics of the neighborhood were quite generally sympathetic youve struck the right trail now parson said chapman as they walked homeward together the days of the oldtime denominationalism are about played out  but the young preacher was not so sure of itnow that his inspiration was gone he remembered his debt to his college to his father to the denomination and it was not easy to set aside the grip of such memories  he sat late revolving the whole situation in his mind when he went to bed it was still with him and involved itself with his dreams but always the young girl smiled upon him with sympathetic eyes and told him to go onor so it seemed to him  he was silent at breakfast he went to school with a feeling that a return to teaching little towheads to count and spell was now impossible he sat in his scarred and dingy desk while they took their places and his eyes had a passionate intensity of prayer in them which awed the pupils he had assumed new grandeur and terror in their eyes when they were seated he bowed his head and uttered a short plea for grace and then he looked at them again  on the low front seat with dangling legs and red round faces sat the little ones someway he could not call them to his knees and teach them to spell he felt as if he ought to call them to him as christ did to teach them love and reverence it was impossible that they should not be touched by this hideous neighborhood of hate and strife  behind them sat the older children some of them with rough hard sly faces some grinned rudely and nudged each other the older girls sat with bated breath they perceived something strange in the air most of them had heard his sermon the night before  at last he broke silence children there is something i must say to you this morning im going to have meeting here tonight and it may be i shall not be your teacher any morei mean in school i wish youd go home today and tell your people to come to church here tonight i wish youd all come yourselves i want you to be good i want you to love god and be good i want you to go home and tell your people the teacher cant teach you here till he has taught the older people to be kind and generous you may put your books away and school will be dismissed  the wondering children obeyedsome with glad promptness others with sadness for they had already come to like their teacher very much  as he sat by the door and watched them file out it was as if he were a king abdicating a throne and these his faithful subjects it was the most momentous hour of his life he had set his face toward dark waters  mrs allen came over with mattie to see him that day she was a good woman gentle and prayerful and she said with much emotion  o mr stacey i do hope you can patch things up here if you could only touch his heart he dont mean to do wrong but hes so set in his waysif he says a thing he sticks to it  stacey turned to mattie for a word of encouragement but she only looked away it was impossible for her to put into words her feeling in the matter which was more of admiration for his courage than for any part of his religious zeal he was so different from other men it seemed he had a touch of divinity in him now  it did him good to have them come and he repeated his vow  by the grace of our lord i am going to rebuild the cyene church and his face paled and his eyes grew luminous  the girl shivered with a sort of awe he seemed to recede from her as he spoke and to grow larger too such nobility of purpose was new and splendid to her                                       the revival was wondrously dramatic the little schoolhouse was crowded to the doors night by night the reek of stablestained coats and boots the smell of strong tobacco the effluvia of many breaths the heat the closeness were forgotten in the fervor of the young evangelists utterances his voice took on wild emotional cadences without his conscious effort and these cadences sounded deep places in the heart to these people long unused to religious oratory it was like the return of john and isaiah it was poetry and the drama and processions and apocalyptic visions he had the histrionic spell too and his slender body lifted and dilated and his head took on majesty and power and the fling of his white hand was a challenge and an appeal  a series of stirring events took place on the third night  on wednesday jacob turner rose and asked the prayers of his neighbors and was followed by two baptist spearmen of the front rank on thursday the women all were weeping on each others bosoms only one or two of the men held outold deacon allen and his antagonist stewart marsden grimvisaged old figures they were placed among repentant men and weeping women they sat like rocks in the rush of the two factions moving toward each other for peaceful union granitic narrow keen of thrust they seemed unmoved while all around them one by one skeptics acknowledged the pathos and dignity of the preachers views of life and death  meanwhile the young evangelist lived at high pressure he grew thinner and whiter each night he toiled in the daytime to formulate his thoughts for the evening he could not sleep till far toward morning the food he ate did him little good while his heart went out constantly to his people in strenuous supplication it was testimony of his human quality that he never for one moment lost that shining girl face out of his thought he looked for it there night after night it was his inspiration in speaking as at the first  on the nights when mattie was not there his speech was labored as the elders noticed but on the blessed nights when she came and sang her voice amid all the rest came to him and uttered poetry and peace like a rill of cool sweet water and afterward when he walked home under the stars his mind went with her she was so strong and lithe and good to see he did not realize the worshiping attitude the girl took before divine duties  at last the great day camethe great night  in some way perhaps by the growing mass of rushing emotion set in action by some deepgoing phrase or perhaps by some interior slow weakening of stubborn will deacon allen gave way and when the preacher called for penitents the old man struggled to his feet his seamed weatherbeaten face full of grotesque movement he broke out  brethren pray for me im a miserable sinner i want to confess my sinsherebefore ye all he broke into sobbing terrible to hear my heart is madeflesh againby the blessed power of christ   he struggled to get his voice one or two cried praise god but most of them sat silent awed into immobility  the old man walked up the aisle ive been rebelliousand now i want to shake hands with you alland i ask your prayers he bent down and thrust his hand to marsden his enemy while the tears streamed down his face  marsden turned white with a sort of fear but he rose awkwardly and grasped the outstretched hand and at the touch of palms every soul rose as if by electric shock amens burst forth the preacher began a fervent prayer and came down toward the grizzled weeping old men and they all embraced while some old lady with sweet quavering voice raised a triumphal hymn in which all joined and found grateful relief from their emotional tension  allen turned to mattie and his wife my boysend for himherman  it seemed as if the people could not go away the dingy little schoolhouse was like unto the shining temple of gods grace and the regenerated seemed to fear that to go home might become a return to hate and strife so they clung around the young preacher and would not let him go  at last he came out with allen holding to his arm you must come home with us tonight he pleaded and the young minister with glad heart consented for he hoped he might walk beside mattie but this was not possible there were several others in the group and they moved off two and two up the deep hollows which formed the road in the snow  the young minister walked with head uplifted to the stars hearing nothing of the low murmur of talk conscious only of his great plans his happy heart and the strong young girl who walked before him  in the warm kitchen into which they came he lost something of his spiritual tension and became more humanly aware of the significance of sitting again with these people he gave the girl his coat and hat and then watched her slip off her knitted hood and her cloak her eyes shone with returning laughter and her cheeks were flushed with blood  looking upon her the young evangelist lost his look of exaltation his eyes grew soft and his limbs relaxed his silence was no longer raptit was the silence of delicious drowsy reverie   v  the next morning he did not rise at all the collapse had come the bad air the nervous strain the lack of sleep had worn down his slender store of strength and when the great victory came he fell like a tree whose trunk has been slowly gnawed across by teeth of silent saw his drowse deepened into torpor  in the bright winter morning seated in a gay cutter behind a bay colt strung with slashing bells mattie drove to kesota for the doctor she felt the discord between the joyous jangle of the bells the stream of sunlight and the sparkle of snow crystals but it only added to the poignancy of her anxiety  she had not yet reached selfconsciousness in her regard for the young preachershe thought of him as a noble human being liable to death and she chirped again and again to the flying colt whose broad hoofs flung the snow in stinging showers against her face  a call at the doctors house set him jogging out along the lanes while she sent a telegram to herman as she whirled bay tom into the road to go home her heart rose in relief that was almost exaltation she loved horses she always sang under her breath chiming to the beat of their bells when alone and now she loosened the rein and hummed an old love song while the powerful young horse squared away in a trot which was twelve miles an hourclick clickclick clickclangle langlingle ling  in such air in such sun who could die her good animal strength rose dominant over fear of death  she came upon the doctor swinging along in his old blue cutter dozing in countrydoctor style making up for lost sleep  out o the way doctor she gleefully called  the doctor roused up and looked around with a smile he was not beyond admiring such a girl as that he snapped his whiplash lightly on old sofias back who looked up surprised and seeming to comprehend matters began to reach out broad flat thin legs in a pace which the proud colt respected she came of illustrious line did sofia scanthaired and ungracious as she now was  dont run over me called the doctor ironically and with sofia still leading they swung into the yard  mattie went in with the doctor while allen looked after both horses they found chapman attending wallacewho lay in a dazed quietconscious but not definitely aware of material things  the doctor looked his patient over carefully then he asked who is the yoong mon  hes been teaching here or rather preaching  when did this coom on  last night wound up a big revival last night i believe kind o caved in i reckon  thats all needs rest hell be wearin a wood jacket if he doosna leave off preachin  regular jamboree i couldnt stop him one of these periodical neighborhood awakenings they call it  they have need of it here na doot  well they need somethinglove for godor man  mwell its lettle i can do the wumman can do more if the monll be eatin what they cuke for im said the candid old scotchman mak im eat mak im eat  once more tom pounded along the shining road to kesota to meet the sixoclock train from chicago  herman magnificently clothed in furlined ulster and cap alighted with unusually grave face and hurried toward mattie  well what is it sis mother sick  no its the teacher he is unconscious ive been for the doctor oh we were scared  he looked relieved but a little chagrined oh well i dont see why i should be yanked out of my boots by a telegram because the teacher is sick he isnt kinyet  for the first time a feeling of shame and confusion swept over mattie and her face flushed  hermans keen eyes half closed as he looked into her face  matwhatwhat now look herehows this wheres ben hollys claim  he never had any she shifted ground quickly o herman we had a wonderful time last night father and uncle marsden shook hands  what shouted herman as he fell in a limp mass against the cutter bring a physicianim stricken  dont act so everybodys looking  theyd better look im drowning while they wait  she untied the horse and came back  climb in there and stop your fooling and ill tell you all about it  he crawled in with tearing groans of mock agony and then leaned his head against her shoulder well go on sis i can bear it now  she nudged him to make him sit up  well you know weve had a revival  so you wrote must have been a screamer to fetch dad and old marsden a regular pentecost of shinar  it wasi mean it was beautiful i saw father was getting stirred up he prayed almost all day yesterday and at nightwell i cant tell you but wallace talked oh so beautiful and tender  she calls him wallace mused herman like a comedian  hush and then came the handshaking and then the minister came home with us because father asked him to  well well i supposed you must have asked him  the girl was hurt and she showed it if you make fun i wont tell you another word she said  away chicago enter cyene well come i wont fool any more  then after wallacei mean  let it stand come to the murder  then father came and asked me to send for you and mother cried and so did he and oh hermie hes so sweet and kind dont make fun of him will you its splendid to have him give in and everybody feels glad that the district will be all friendly again  herman did not gibe again his voice was gentle the pathos in the scene appealed to him so the old man sent for me himself did he  yes he could hardly wait till morning but this morning when we came to call the teacher he didnt answer and father went in and found him unconscious then i went for the doctor  bay tom whirled along in the splendid dusk his nostrils flaring ghostly banners of steam on the cold crisp air the stars overhead were points of green and blue and crimson light lowhung changing each moment  their influence entered the soul of the mocking young fellow he felt very solemn almost melancholy for a moment  well sis ive got something to tell you all im going to tell it to you by degrees im going to be married  oh she gasped with quick indrawn breath who  dont be ungrammatical whatever you do shes a cashier in a restaurant and shes a fine girl he added steadily as if combating a prejudice he forgot for the moment that such prejudices did not exist in cyene  sis was instantly tender and very very serious  of course she is or you wouldnt care for her oh id like to see her  ill take you up some day and show her to you  oh will you oh when can i go she was smit into gravity again not till the teacher is well  herman pretended to be angry dog take the teacher the old spindlelegs if id known he was going to raise such a ruction in our quiet and peaceful neighborhood i never would have brought him here  mattie did not laugh she pondered she never quite understood her brother when he went off on those queer tirades which might be a joke or an insult he had grown away from her in his city life  they rode on in silence the rest of the way except now and then an additional question from mattie concerning his sweetheart  as they neared the farmhouse she lost interest in all else but the condition of the young minister they could see the light burning dimly in his room and in the parlor and kitchen as well and this unusual lighting stirred the careless young man deeply it was associated in his mind with death and birth and also with great joy  the house was lighted so the night his elder brother died and it looked so to him when he whirled into the yard with the doctor when mattie was born  oh i hope he isnt worse said the girl with deep feeling  herman put his arm about her and she knew he knew  so do i sis  allen came to the door as they drove in and the careless boy realized suddenly the emotional tension his father was in as the old man came to the sleighside he could not speak his fingers trembled as he took the outstretched hand of his boy  hermans voice shook a little  well dad mattie says the war is over  the old man tried to speak but only coughed and then he blew his nose at last he said brokenly  go right in your mothers waitin  it was singularly dramatic to the youth to come from the careless superficial life of his city companions into contact with such primeval passions as these made him feel like a spectator at some new and powerful and tragic play  his mother fell upon his neck and cried while mattie stood by pale and anxious inside the parlor could be heard the mumble of mens voices  in such wise do death and the fear of death fall upon country homes all day the house had swarmed with people all day this mother had looked forward to the reconciliation of her husband with her son all day had the pale and silent minister of god kept his corpselike calm while all about the white snow gleamed and radiant shadows filled every hollow and the cattle bawled and frisked in the barnyard and the fowls cackled joyously while the mild soft wind breathed warmly over the land  mattie cried out to her mother in quick low voice o mother how is he  he aint no worse the doctor says there aint no immediate danger  the girl brought her hands together girlishly and said oh im so glad is he awake  no hes asleep  is the doctor still here  yes  i guess ill step in said herman  the doctor and george chapman sat beside the hardcoal heater talking in low voices the old doctor was permitting himself the luxury of a story of pioneer life he rose with automatic courtesy and shook hands with herman  hows the sick man getting on  vera wellvera wellconsederin the mon is a complete wornoutthats allnaethin more thes floomadidale bezniss of rantin away on the fear o the laird for sax weeks wull have worn out the frame of a booldawg  herman and chapman smiled i hope youll tell him that  na fear yoong mon said the grim old warrior weel now aill juist be takin anither look at him  herman went in with the doctor and stood looking on while the old man peered and felt about he came out soon and leaving a few directions with herman and chapman took his departure everything seemed favorable he said  there was no longer poignancy of anxiety in matties mind she was too much of a child to imagine the horror of loss but she was grave and gay by turns her healthy and wholesome nature continually reasserted itself over the power of her newly attained womans interest in the young preacher she went to bed and slept dreamlessly while herman yawned and inwardly raged at the fix in which circumstances had placed him  like many another lover days away from his sweetheart were lost days he wondered how she would take all the life down here it would be good fun to bring her down anyway and hear her talk he planned such a trip and grew so interested in the thought he forgot his patient  in the early dawn wallace rallied and woke herman heard the rustle of the pillow and turned to find the sick mans eyes looking at him fixedly calm but puzzled hermans lips slowly changed into a beautiful boyish smile and wallace replied by a faint parting of the lips when herman said  hello old man how do you find yourself his hearty humorous greeting seemed to do the sick man good herman approached the bed know where you are wallace slowly put out a hand and herman took it youre coming on all right want some breakfast make it bucks he said in chicago restaurant slang white wingssunnyone up coff  all this was good tonic for wallace and an hour later he sipped broth while mrs allen and the deacon and herman stood watching the process with apparently consuming interest mattie was still soundly sleeping  there began delicious days of convalescence during which he looked peacefully out at the coming and going of the two women each possessing powerful appeal to himone the motherly presence which had been denied him for many years the other something he had never permitted himselfa sweethearts daily companionship  he lay there planning his church and also his home into the thought of a new church came shyly but persistently the thought of a fireside of his own with this young girl sitting in the glow of it waiting for him his life had held little romance in its whole length he had earned his own way through school and to college his slender physical energies had been taxed to their utmost at every stage of his climb but now it seemed as though some blessed rest and peace were at hand  meanwhile the bitter partisans met each other coming and going out of the gate of the allen estate and the goodness of god shone in their softened faces herman was skeptical of its lasting quality but was forced to acknowledge that it was a lovely light he it was who made the electrical suggestion to rebuild the church as an evidence of good faith you say youre regeneratedgo ahead and regenerate the church he said  the enthusiasm of the neighborhood took flame it should be done a meeting was called everybody subscribed money or work it was a generous outpouring of love and faith  it was herman also who counseled secrecy it would be a nice thing to surprise him he said well agree to keep the scheme from him at home if you dont give it away  they set to work like bees the women came down one day and took possession with brooms and mops and soap and while the carpenters repaired the windows they fell savagely upon the grime of the seats and floors the walls of the church echoed with womans gossip and girlish laughter everything was scoured from the doorhinges to the altar rails new doors were hung and a new stove secured and then came the painters to put a new coat of paint on the inside the cold weather forbade repainting the outside  the sheds were rebuilt by men whose hearts glowed with oldtime fire it was like pioneer days when barnraising and bees made life worth while in a wild stern land it was a beautiful time the old men were moved to tears and the younger rough men shouted cheery boisterous cries to hide their own deep emotion hand met hand in heartiness never shown before neighbors frequented each others homes and the old times of visiting and brotherly love came back upon them nothing marred the perfect beauty of their revivalsave the fear of its evanescence it seemed too good to last  meanwhile love of another and merrier sort went on the young men and maidens turned prayer meeting into trysts and scrubbing bees into festivals they rode from house to house under glittering stars over sparkling snows singing      hallelujah tis done     i believe on the son     i am saved by the blood     of the crucified one  and their rejoicing chorus was timed to the clash of bells on swift young horses who shall say they did not right did the galilean forbid love and joy  no matter gods stars the mysterious night the bells the watchful bay of dogs the sting of snow the croon of loving voices the clasp of tender arms the touch of parting lipsthese things these things outweigh death and hell and all that makes the criminal tremble being saved they must of surety rejoice  and through it all wallace crawled slowly back to life and strength he ate of mother allens chickenbroth and of toast from matties caretaking hand and gradually assumed color and heart his solemn eyes looked at the powerful young girl with an intensity which seemed to take her strength from her she would gladly have given her blood for him if it had occurred to her or if it had been suggested as a good thing instead she gave him potatoes baked to a nicety and buttered toast that would melt on the tongue and on the whole they served the purpose better  one day a smartly dressed man called to see wallace mattie recognized him as the baptist clergyman from kesota he came in and introducing himself said he had heard of the excellent work of mr stacey and that he would like to speak with him  wallace was sitting in a rocking chair in the parlor herman was in chicago and there was no one but mrs allen and mattie in the house  the kesota minister introduced himself to wallace and then entered upon a long eulogium upon his work in cyene he asked after his credentials his plans his connections and then he said  youve done a fine work in softening the hearts of these people we had almost despaired of doing anything with them yes you have done a wonderful work and now we must reorganize a regular society here i will be out again when you get stronger and well see about it  wallace was too weak to take any stand in the talk and so allowed him to get up and go away without protest or explanation of his own plans  when herman came down on saturday he told him of the baptist ministers visit and the proposition herman stretched his legs out toward the fire and put his hands in his pockets then he rose and took a strange attitude such as wallace had seen in comic picturesit was in fact the attitude of a bowery tough  saylook here if you want o set dis community by de ears agin you do dat tingsee you play dat confidence game and deyll rat yesee you invite us to come into a nonpartisan dealseeand den you springs your own platform on us in de joint corkusand we wont stand it dis goes troo de way it began or we dont playsee  out of all this wallace deduced his own feelingthat continued peace and goodwill lay in keeping clear of all doctrinal debates and disputesthe love of christ the desire to do good and to be clean these emotions had been roused far more deeply than he realized and he lifted his face to god in the hope that no lesser thing should come in to mar the beauty of his church  there came a day when he walked out in the sunshine and heard the hens cawcawing about the yard and saw the young colts playing about the barn and the splendor of the winter day dazzled him as if he were looking upon the broadflung robe of the most high everywhere the snow lay ridged with purple and brown hedges smoke rose peacefully from chimneys and the sound of boys skating on a nearby pond added the human element  the trouble of concealing the work of the community upon the church increased daily and mattie feared that some hint of it had come to him she had her plan she wanted to drive him down herself and let him see the reburnished temple alone but this was impossible on the day when he seemed able to go her father drove them all down marsden was there also and several of his womenfolks putting down a new carpet on the platform as they drew near the church wallace said  why theyve fixed up the sheds  mattie nodded she was trembling with the delicious excitement of itshe wanted him hurried into the church at once he had hardly time to think before he was whirled up to the new porch and marsden came out followed by several women he was bewildered by it all marsden helped him out with hearty voice sounding  careful now dont hurry  mattie took one arm and so he entered the church everything repainted everything warm and bright and cozy  the significance of it came to him like a wave of light and he took his seat in the pulpit chair and stared at them all with a look on his pale face which moved them more than words he was like a man transfigured by an inward glow his eyes for an instant flamed with this marvelous fire then darkened softened with tears and his voice came back in a sob of joy and he could only say  friendsbrethren  marsden after much coughing said  we all united on this we wanted to have you come to the church andwell we couldnt bear to have you see it again the way it was  he understood it now it was the sign of a united community it set the seal of christs victory over evil passions and the young preachers head bowed in prayer and they all knelt while his weak voice returned thanks to the lord for his gifts  then they all rose and shook off the oppressive solemnity and he had time to look around at all the changes at last he turned to mattie and reached out his handhe had the boldness of a man in the shadow of some mighty event which makes false modesty and conventions shadowy things of little importance his sharpened interior sense read her clear soul and he knew she was his therefore he reached her his hand and she came to him with a flush on her face which died out as she stood proudly by his side while he said  and martha shall help me  therefore this good thing happenedthat in the midst of his fervor and his consecration to gods work the love of woman found a place     a meeting in the foothills  i   the train which brought young ramsey into red rock gave him no view of the mountains because it arrived about eight oclock of a dark day he went to bed at once in order to be up early and prostrate himself before the peaks for he was of the level middlewest  he was awakened by the sound of loud hearty voices and looking out of the window saw a fourhorse team standing before the little hotel on the wagons side was a sign which made the heart of the youth leap      crinkle creek stage     dave willis pro  he was in the land of gold it was like a chapter from a story by bret harte he dressed himself hurriedly and went down and out into the cool keen dawn eager to catch a glimpse of the great peak whose name had been in his ear since a child as the symbol of the rocky mountains  there it soared dull purple splotched with dark green and rising to white at its shoulders and radiant with light on its crown in such impassible grandeur it must have loomed upon the eyes of the first little caravan trailing its way across the plains to the mysterious west  he spent the day doing little else but gaze at the mountains and study the town  it was also much more stupendous than he had imagined and doubts of his ability to fit with all this splendor came to him with great force he remembered the smooth green swells and fertile fields he had left behind and the memory brought a touch of homesickness  after supper that evening he confided to the landlord his plans for finding a foremans position on a stock farm  well i dunno there are such places but theyre always snapped up fore you can say jack robinson  well im going to give it a good try the young fellow said bravely  thats right if i was you id go out and see some of these realestate fellers they most always know whats going on  thats a good idea much obliged ill tackle em tomorrow said arthur and he went off to bed feeling victory almost a tame bird in his hands  the next forenoon he made his first attempt he had determined on his speech and he went into the first office with his song on his lips  im looking for a place on a dairy farm ive had five years practical experience and am a graduate of the  agricultural college im after the position of bookkeeper and foreman  the man looked at him gravely  youre aiming pretty high young feller for this country there are plenty of chances to work punching cattle but i dont think chances are good for a foremans place he was a kindly man and repented when he saw how the young mans face fell however ill give you some names of people to see  on the whole this was not so depressing arthur thought  the next man made a mistake and took him for an investor he rose with great cordiality  ah good morning sirgood morning have a chair just in do you feel the draft there oh all right then he settled himself in his swivel chair and beamed his warmest well what do you think of our charming town  arthur had not the heart to undeceive him and so saturated in agony sweat crawled out at last and went timidly on to the third man who was kindly and interested in a way and gave him the names of some ranchers likely to hire a hand some days passed in this sort of search and resulted in nothing materially valuable but a strong quality came out in his nature defeat seemed to put a grim sort of resolution into his soul  following faint clews ramsey made long walks into the country toiling from ranch to ranch over the duncolored lonely hills dogged persistent with lips set grimly  he was returning late one afternoon from one of these fruitless journeys it was one of those strange days that come in all seasons at that altitude the air was full of suspended mistit did not rain the road was almost dry under foot and yet this allpervasive moisture seemed soaking everything it was in fact a cloud for this whole land was a mountain top  the road wound among shapeless buttes of red soil the plain was clothed on its levels with a short dry grass and on the side of the buttes were scattering scraggy cedars looking at a distance like droves of cattle  he sat down upon a little hummock to rest for his feet ached with the long stretches of hilly road the larks cried to him out of the mist with their piercing sweet notes cheerful and undaunted ever there was a sudden lighting up of the day as if the larks song had shot the mist with silver light  as he rose and started on with painful slowness he heard the sound of horses hoofs behind him and a man in a yellow cart came swiftly out of the gray obscurity  arthur stepped aside to let him pass but he could not help limping a little more markedly as the man looked at him the man seemed to understand  will you ride he asked  arthur glanced up at him and nodded without speaking the stranger was a finelooking man with a military cut of beard getting gray his face was ruddy and smiling  thank you i am rather tired arthur said as he settled into the seat i guess ill have to own up im about played out  i thought you looked footsore im enough of a western man to feel mean when i pass a man on the road a footman can get very tired on these stretches of ours  ive tramped about forty miles today i guess im trying to find some work to do he added in desperate confidence  is that so what kind of work  well i wanted to get a place as foreman on a ranch  im afraid thats too much to expect  arthur sighed  yes i suppose it is if id known as much two weeks ago as i do now i wouldnt be here  oh dont get discouraged theres plenty of work to do i can give you something to do on my place  well ive come to the conclusion that there is nothing here for me but the place of a common hand so if you can give me anything  oh yes i can give you something to do in my garden perhaps something better will open up later where are you staying he asked as they neared town  arthur told him and the man drove him down to his hotel  id like to have you call at my office tomorrow morning my partner does most of the hiring ive been living in denver heres my card  after he had driven away the listening landlord broke forth  youre in luck cap if you get a place with major thayer youre fixed  who is he anyhow  who is he why he owns all the land up the creek and banks all over colorado  is that so  arthur was delighted of course it was only a common hands place but here was the vista he had looked forhere was the chance  he stretched his legs under the table in huge content as he ate his supper his youthful imagination had seized upon this slender wire of promise and was swiftly making it a hoop of diamonds   ii  when he entered the office next day however the major merely nodded to him over the railing and said  good morning take a seat please  he seemed deeply engaged with a tall young man of about thirtyfive years of age with a rugged smoothshaven face the young man spoke with a marked english accent and there was a quality in his manner of speech which appealed very strongly to arthur  confeound the fellow the young englishman was saying ive discharged him i cawnt reengage him ye kneow we cawnt have a man abeout who gets drunk y kneowits too bloody proveoking majah  but the poor fellows family saulisbury  oh hang the fellows

said  this is the young man i told you about mra  ramsey is my name said arthur rising  mr ramsey this is my partner mr saulisbury  haow de do said saulisbury with a nod and a glance which made arthur hot with wrath coming as it did after the talk he had heard saulisbury did not take the trouble to rise he merely swung round on his swivel chair and eyed the young stranger  arthur was not thickskinned and he had been struck for the first time by the lash of caste and it raised a welt  he choked with his rage and stood silent while saulisbury looked him over and passed upon his good points as if he were a horse there was something in the lazy lift of his eyebrows which maddened arthur  he looks a decent young fellow enough i suppeose hell do to try saulisbury said at last with cool indifference ill use him majah  by heaven you wont arthur burst out i wouldnt work for you at any price  he turned on his heel and rushed out  he heard the major calling to him as he went down the stairs but refused to turn back the tears of impotent rage filled his eyes his fists strained together and the curses pushed slowly from his lips he wished he had leaped upon his insulter where he satthe smooth smiling hound  he was dizzy with rage for the first time in his life he had been trampled upon and could not at least he had not struck his assailant  as he stood on the streetcorner thinking of these things and waiting for the mist of rage to pass from his eyes he felt a hand on his arm and turned to major thayer standing by his side  look here ramsey you mustnt mind sam hes an infernal englishman and cant understand our way of meeting men he didnt mean to hurt your feelings  arthur looked down at him silently and there was a look in his eyes which went straight to the majors heart  come ramsey i want to give you a place never mind this you will really be working for me anyhow  saulisbury himself came down the stairs and approached them putting on his gloves and arthur perceived for the first time that his eyes were blue and very goodnatured saulisbury cared nothing for the youth but felt something was due his partner  i hope i havent done anything unpardonable he began with his absurd rising inflection  arthur flared up again  i wouldnt work for a man like you if i starved im not a dog youll find an american citizen wont knuckle down to you the way your english peasants do if you think you can come out here in the west and treat men like dogs youll find yourself mighty mistaken thats all  the men exchanged glances this volcanic outburst amazed saulisbury but the major enjoyed it it was excellent schooling for his english friend  well work for me mr ramsey sam knuckles down to me on most questions i hope i know how to treat my men im trying to live up to traditions anyway  youll admit it is a tradition said saulisbury glad of a chance to sidle away  the major dismissed saulisbury with a move of the hand  now get into my cart mr ramsey and well go out to the farm and look things over he said and arthur clambered in  i cant blame you very much the major continued after they were well settled ive been trying lately to get into harmonious relations with my employees and i think im succeeding i have a father and grandfather in shirt sleeves to start from and to refer back to but saulisbury hasnt he means well but he cant always hold himself in he means to be democratic but his blood betrays him  arthur soon lost the keen edge of his grievance under the kindly chat of the major  the farm lay on either side of a small stream which ran among the buttes and green mesas of the foothills out to the left the kingly peak looked benignantly across the lesser heights that thrust their ambitious heads in the light cattle were feeding among the smooth strawcolored or sagegreen hills a cluster of farm buildings stood against an abrupt cedarsplotched bluff out of which a stream flowed and shortly fell into a large basin  the irrigation ditch pleased and interested arthur for it was the finest piece of work he had yet seen it ran around the edge of the valley discharging at its gates streams of water like veins which meshed the land whereon men were working among young plants  ill put you in charge of a team i think the major said after talking with the foreman a big redhaired man who looked at arthur with his head thrown back and one eye shut  well now youre safe said the major as he got into his buggy so ill leave you richards will see you have a bed  arthur knew and liked the foremans family at once they were familiar types at supper he told them of his plans and how he came to be out there and they came to feel a certain proprietorship in him at once  well im glad youve come said mrs richards after their acquaintanceship had mellowed a day or two youre like our own folks back in illinois and i cant make these foreigners seem neighbors nohow not but what theyre good enough but land sakes they dont jibe in someway  arthur winced a little at being classed in with her folks and changed the subject  one sunday a couple of weeks later just as he was putting on his old clothes to go out to do his evenings chores the major and a merry party of visitors came driving into the yard arthur came out to the carriage a little annoyed that these city people should not have come when he had on his sunday clothes the major greeted him pleasantly  good evening ramsey just hitch the horses will you i want to show the ladies about a little  arthur tied the horses to a post and came back toward the major expecting him to introduce the ladies but the major did not and mrs thayer did not wait for an introduction but said with a peculiar wellworn inflection  ramsey i wish youd stand between me and the horses im as afraid as death of horses and cows  the rest laughed in musical uproar but arthur flushed hotly it was the manner in which english people in plays and stories addressed their butler or coachman  he helped her down however in sullen silence for his rebellious heart seemed to fill his throat  the party moved ahead in a cloud of laughter the ladies were dainty as spring flowers in their light outdoor dresses and they seemed to light up the whole barnyard  one of them made the most powerful impression upon arthur she was so dainty and so birdlike her dress was quaint with puffed sleeves and bands and edges of light green like an april flower her narrow face was as swift as light in its volatile changes and her little chin dipped occasionally into the fluff of her ruffled bodice like a swallow into the water every movement she made was strange and sweet to see  she cried out in admiration of everything and clapped her slender hands like a wondering child her elders laughed every time they looked at her she was so entirely carried away by the wonders of the farm  she admired the cows and the colts very much but shivered prettily when the bull thrust his yellow and black muzzle through the little window of his cell  the horrid thing isnt he savage  not at all he wants some meal thats all said the major as they moved on  the young girl skipped and danced and shook her perfumed dress as a swallow her wings without appearing vainit was natural in her to do graceful things  arthur looked at her with deep admiration and delight even while mrs saulisbury was talking to him  he liked mrs saulisbury at once though naturally prejudiced against her she had evidently been a very handsome woman but some concealed pain had made her face thin and drawn and one corner of her mouth was set in a slight fold as if by a touch of paralysis her profile was still very beautiful and her voice was that of a highly cultivated american  she seemed to be interested in arthur and asked him a great many questions and all her questions were intelligent  saulisbury amused himself by joking the dainty girl whom he called edith  this is the cow that gives the cream ye know and this one is the buttermilk cow he said as they stood looking in at the barn door  edith tipped her eager little face up at him  really  the rest laughed again  which is the icecream cow the young girl asked to let them know that she was not to be fooled with  saulisbury appealed to the major  majah what have you done with our icecream cow  she went dry during the winter said the major no demand on her supply regulated by the demand you know  they drifted on into the horse barn  were in ramseys domain now said the major looking at arthur who stood with his hand on the hip of one of the big gray horses  edith turned and perceived arthur for the first time a slight shock went through her sensitive nature as if some faint prophecy of great storms came to her in the widening gaze of his dark eyes  oh do you drive the horses she asked quickly  yes for the present i am the plowman he said in the wish to let her know he was not a common hand i hope to be promoted  her eyes rested a moment longer on his sturdy figure and his beautifully bronzed skin then she turned to her companions  after they had driven away arthur finished his work in silence he could hardly bring himself to speak to the people at the supper table his mind was in such tumult  he went up into his little room drew a chair to the window facing the glorious mountains and sat there until the ingulfing gloom of rising night climbed to the glittering crown of white soaring a mile above the lights of the city but he did not really see the mountains his eyes only turned toward them as a cat faces the light of a hearth it helped him to think somehow  he was naturally keen sensitive and impressionable his mind worked quickly for he had read a great deal and held his reading at command  his thought concerned itself first of all with the attitude these people assumed toward him it was perfectly evident that they regarded him as a creature of inferior sort he was their servant  it made him turn hot to think how terribly this contrasted with the flamboyant phraseology of his graduating oration if the boys knew that he was a common hand on a ranch and treated like a butler  he came back for relief to the face of the girl the girl who looked at him differently somehow  the impression she made on him was one of daintiness and light her eager face and her sweet voice almost childish in its thin quality appealed to him with singular force  she was strange to him in accent and life she was good and sweet he felt sure of that but she seemed so far away in her manner of thought he wished he had been dressed a little better his old hat troubled him especially  the girls he had known even the daintiest of them could drive horses and were not afraid of cows their way of talking was generally direct and candid or had those familiar inflections which were comprehensible to him she was alien  was she a girl sometimes she seemed a womanwhen her face sobered a momentthen again she seemed a child it was this change of expression that bewildered and fascinated him  then her lips were so scarlet and her level brown eyebrows wavered about so beautifully sometimes one had arched while the other remained quiet this gave a winsome look of brightness and roguishness to her face  he came at last to the strangest thing of all she had looked at him every time he spoke as if she were surprised at finding herself able to understand his way of speech  he worked it all out at last they all looked upon him as belonging to the american peasantry he belonged to a lower worlda world of service he was brick they were china  saulisbury and mrs thayer were perfectly frank about it they spoke from the english standpoint the major and mrs saulisbury had been touched by the western spirit and were trying to be just to him with more or less unconscious patronization  as his thoughts ran on his fury came back and he hammered and groaned and cursed as he tossed to and fro on his bed determined to go back where the american ideas still heldback to the democracy of lodi and cresco   iii  these spring days were days of growth to the young man he grew older and more thoughtful and seldom joked with the other men  there came to the surface moods which he had not known before there came times when his teeth set together like the clutch of a wolf as some elemental passion rose from the depths of his inherited self  his father had been a rather morose man jealous of his rights quick to anger but just in his impulses arthur had inherited these stronger traits but they had been covered and concealed thus far by the smiling exterior of youth  edith came up nearly every day with the major in order to enjoy the air and beauty of the sunshine and when she did not come near enough to nod to arthur life was a weary treadmill for the rest of the day and the mountains became mere gloomy stacks of débris  sometimes she sat on the porch with the children while mrs richards the foremans wife a hearty talkative woman plied her with milk and cookies  it must be heaven to live here and feed the chickens and cows the young girl said one day when arthur was passing byquite accidentally  mrs richards took a seat wiping her face on her apron  wal i dont know about that when it comes to waiting and tendin on a mess of em it dont edgicate a feller much does it art  we dont do it for play exactly he replied taking a seat on the porch steps and smiling up at edith i cant stand cows i like horses though of course if i were foreman of the dairy that would be another thing  the flowerlike girl looked down at him with a strange glance something rose in her heart which sobered her she studied the clear brown of his face and the white of his forehead where his hat shielded it from the sun and the wind the spread of his strong neck where it rose from his shoulders and the clutch of his brown hands attracted her  how strong you look she said musingly  he laughed up at her in frank delight  well im not out here for my health exactly although when i came here i was pretty tender i was just out of college in fact he said glad of the chance to let her know that he was not an ignorant workingman  she looked surprised and pleased  oh youre a college man i have two brothers at yale one of them plays halfback or shortstop or something of course you played  baseball yes i was pitcher for 88 he heaved a sigh he could not think of those blessed days without sorrow  oh i didnt mean baseball i meant football  we dont play that much in the west we go in more for baseball more science  oh i like football best its so lively i like to see them when they get all bunched up they look so funny and then when some fellow gets the ball under his arms and goes shooting around with the rest all jumping at him oh oh its exciting  she smiled and her teeth shone from her scarlet lips with a more familiar expression than he had seen on her face before some wall of reserve had melted away and they chatted on with growing freedom  well edith are you ready asked the major coming up  arthur sprang up as if he suddenly remembered that he was a workingman  edith rose also  yes all ready uncle  well well be going in a minutemr ramsey do you think that millet has got water enough  for the present yes the ground is not so dry as it looks  as they talked on about the farm mrs richards brought out a glass of milk for the major  arthur with nice calculation unhitched the horse and brought it around while the major was detained  may i help you in miss newell  she gave him her hand with a frank gesture and the major reached the cart just as she was taking the lines from arthur  are you coming she gayly cried if not ill drive home by myself  you mean youll hold the lines  no sir i can drive if i have a chance  thats what the american girl is saying these days she wants to hold the lines  well im going to begin right now and drive all the way home  as they drove off she flashed a roguish glance back at arthura smile which shadowed swiftly into a look which had a certain appeal in it he was very handsome in his working dress  all the rest of the day that look was with him he could not understand it though her mood while seated upon the porch was perfectly comprehensible to him  the following sunday morning he saddled up one of the horses and went down to church he reasoned edith would attend the episcopal service and he had the pleasure of seeing her pass up the aisle most exquisitely dressed  this feeling of pleasure was turned to sadness by sober second thought added to the prostration before his ideal was the feeling that she belonged to another worlda world of pleasure and wealth a world without work or worry this feeling was strengthened by the atmosphere of the beautiful little church fragrant with flowers delicately shadowed tremulous with music  he rode home in deep meditation it was curious how subjective he was becoming she had not seen him there and his trip lacked so much of being a success life seemed hardly worth living as he took off his best suit and went out to feed the horses  the men soon observed the regularity of these sunday excursions and the word was passed around that arthur went down to see his girl and they set themselves to find out who she was they did not suspect that he sought the majors niece  it was a keen delight to see her even at that distance to get one look from her or to see her eyelashes fall over her brown eyes paid him for all his trouble and yet it left him hungrier at heart than before  sometimes he got seated in such wise that he could see the fine line of her cheek and chin he noticed also her growing color the free life she lived in the face of the mountain winds was doing her good  sometimes he went at night to the song service and his rides home alone on the plain with the shadowy mountains over there massed in the starlit sky were most wonderful experiences  as he rose and fell on his bronchos steady gallop he took off his hat to let the wind stir his hair riding thus exalted thus one night he shaped a desperate resolution he determined to call on her just as he used to visit the girls at viroqua with whom he was on the same intimacy of footing  he was as good as any class he was not as good as she was for he lacked her sweetness and purity of heart but merely the fact that she lived in a great house and wore beautiful garments did not exclude him from calling upon her   iv  but week after week went by without his daring to make his resolution good he determined many times to ask permission to call but somehow he never did  he seemed to see her rather less than at first and on her part there was a change she seemed to have lost her first eager and frank curiosity about him and did not always smile now when she met him  then again he could not in working dress ask to call it would seem so incongruous to stand before her to make such a request covered with perspiration and dust it was hard to be dignified under such circumstances he must be washed and dressed properly  in the meantime the men had discovered how matters stood and some of them made very free with the whole situation two of them especially hated him  these two men had drifted to the farm from the mines somewhere and were rough hard characters they would have come to blows with him only they knew something of the power lying coiled in his long arms  one day he overheard one of the men speaking of edith and his tone stopped the blood in arthurs heart when he walked among the group of men his face was white and set  you take that back he said in a low voice you take that back or ill kill you right where you stand  do him up tim shouted the other ruffian but tim hesitated ill do him then said the other man i owe him one myself  he caught up a strip of board which was lying on the ground near but one of the norwegian workmen put his foot on it and before he could command his weapon arthur brought a pail which he held in his right hand down upon his opponents head  the man fell as if dead and the pail shattered into its original staves arthur turned then to face tim his hands doubled into mauls but the other men interfered and the encounter was over  arthur waited to see if the fallen man could rise and then turned away reeling and breathless for an hour afterward his hands shook so badly that he could not go on with his work  at first he determined to go to richards the foreman and demand the discharge of the two tramps but as he thought of the explanation necessary he gave it up as impossible  he almost wept with shame and despair at the thought of her name having been mixed in the tumult he had meant to kill when he struck and the nervous prostration which followed showed him how far he had gone he had not had a fight since he was thirteen years of age and now everything seemed lost in the light of his murderous rage it would all come out sooner or later and she would despise him  he went to see the man just before going to supper and found him in his barracks sitting near a pail of cold water from which he was splashing his head at intervals  he looked up as arthur entered but went on with his ministrations after a pause he said  that was a terrible lick you give me young fellerbrought the blood out of my ears  i meant to kill you was arthurs grim reply  i know you did if that darned norse hadnt put his foot on that board youd be doing this he lifted a handful of water to his swollen and aching head  what did you go to that board for why didnt you stand up like a man  because you were swinging that bucket  oh bosh you were a coward as well as a blackguard  the man looked up with a gleam in his eye  see here young fellerif this head  arthurs face darkened and the man stopped short  now listen dan williams i want to tell you something im not going to report this im going to let you stay here till youre well and then i want this thing settled with richards looking on when i get through with you then youll want a cot in some hospital  the mans eyes sullenly fell and arthur turned toward the door at the doorway he turned and a terrible look came into his face  and more than that if you say another word abouther ill brain you sick or well  as he talked the old wild fury returned and he came back and faced the wounded man  now what do you propose to do he demanded his hands clinching  the other man looked at him with a curious frown upon his face  think im a damned fool he curtly answered and sopped his handkerchief in the water again  the rage went out of arthurs eyes and he almost smiled so much did that familiar phrase convey with its subtle inflections it was cunning and candid and chivalrous all at once it acknowledged defeat and guilt and embodied a certain pride in the victor  well that settles that said arthur one thing morei dont want you to say what made the row between us  all right pard only youd better see tim  in spite of his care the matter came to the ears of richards who laughed over it and told his wife who stared blankly  good land when did it happen  a couple of days ago  wal there i thought there was a nigger in the fence dan had a head on him like a bushel basket what was it about  something tim said about edith  i want to know wal wal an here theyve been going around as peaceful as two kittens ever since  of course they pitched in and settled it man fashion they aint a couple of women who go around sniffin and spittin at each other said richards with brutal sarcasm as near as i can learn tim and dan come at him to once  theyre a nice pair of tramps said mrs richards indignantly i told you when they come theyd make trouble  i told you the cowd eat up the grindstone richards replied with a grin walking away  the more mrs richards thought of it the finer it all appeared to her she was deeply engaged now on arthurs side and was very eager to do something to help on in his sparking as she called it she seized the first opportunity to tell edith  dont spose you heard of the little fracas we had tother day she began in phrase which she intended to be delicately indirect  edith was sitting in the cart and mrs richards stood at the wheel with her apron shading her head  why no what was it  mr ramsey come mighty near gettin killed the old woman enjoyed deeply the dramatic pallor and distortion of the girls face  whywhywhat do you mean  wal if he hadnt a lammed one feller with a bucket hed a been laid out sure so richards says as it is its the other feller that has the head she laughed to see the girls face grow rosy again  thenmr ramsey isnt hurt  not a scratch the funny part of it is theyve been going around here for a week quiet as you please i wouldnt have known anything about it only for richards  oh isnt it dreadful said the girl  yes tis the elder woman readily agreed but why dont you ask what it was all about  oh i dont want to know anything more about it its too terrible  mrs richards was approaching the climax  it was all about you  the girl could not realize what part she should have with a disgraceful row in the barnyard of her uncles farm  yes these mentheyre regular tramps i told richards so the first time i set eyes on emthey made a little free with your name and art he overheard them and he went for em and they both come at him two to one and he lammed both out in a minuteso richards says now i call that splendid dont you a young feller thatll stand up for his girl agin two big tramps  the major had been motioning for edith to drive on down toward the gate and she seized the chance for escape her lips quivered with shame and anger it seemed already as if she had been splashed with mire  oh the vulgar creatures she said in her throat her teeth shut tight  there isnt that a fine field asked the major as he pointed to the cabbages there is a chance for an american imitator of monetthose purplebrown deeps and those graybluepink pearl tintswhats the matter my dear he broke off to ask are you ill  no no only lets go home she said the tears coming into her eyes  he got in hastily  my dear you are really ill whats the matter has your old enemy the headache he put his arm about her tenderly  no no im sick of this placei wish id never seen it how could those dreadful men fight about me its horrible  the major whistled  oh ho thats got around to you has it i didnt know it myself until yesterday i was hoping it wouldnt reach you at all i wouldnt mind it my dear its the shadow every lovely woman throws no matter where she walks its only your shadow that has passed over the cesspool  but i cant even bear that it seems like a part of me what do you suppose they said of me she asked in morbid curiosity  now now dearest to know that would be stepping into the muck after your shadow the talk of such men is unimaginable to you  you dont mean mr ramsey  no mr ramsey is a different sort of man and i dont suppose anything else would have brought him to blows with those rough men  they sat looking straight forward  oh its horrible horrible  her uncle tightened his arm about her  i suppose the knowledge of such lower deeps must come to you some day but dont seek it now ive told you all you ought to know ramsey meant well he went on after a silence but such things do little good not enough to pay for the outlay of selfrespect he cant control their talk when hes out of hearing  but i supposed that if a woman wasgoodi meani didnt know that men talked in that way about girlslike me how could they  the abyss still fascinated her  my dear such men are only half civilized they have all the passions of animals and all the vices of men ramsey was too hotheaded their words do not count they werent worth whipping  there was a little silence they were nearing the mountains again and both raised their eyes to the peaks deeply shadowed in tyrian purple  i know how you feel i think the major went on but the best thing to do is to forget it im sorry ramsey fought to walk into a gang of rough men like that is foolish and dangerous too for the ruffian is generally the best man physically im sorry to say  it was brave though dont you think so she asked  he looked at her quickly  oh yes it was brave and very youthful  she smiled a little for the first time  i guess i like youth  in that case ill have to promote him for it he said with a smile that made her look away toward the mountains again   v  saulisbury took a sudden turn to friendliness and defended the action when the major related the story that night at the dinner table as they were seated over their coffee and cigars he was dining with the saulisburys  its uncommon plucky thats what i think dye kneow by jeove i didnt think the young dog had it in him really he did one fellow up with a bucket they say and met the other fellow with his left where did the young beggah get his science  at college i suppose  but i suppeosed these little western colleges were a milkandwahta sawt of thing ye kneowbaptist and christian endeavor and all that ye kneow  oh no laughed the major they are not so benighted as that they give a little attention to the elementary studies though i believe athletics do come second on the curriculum  well the young dog seems to have made some use of his chawnce said saulisbury who had dramatized the matter in his own way and saw ramsey doing the two men up in accordance with queensberry rules i wouldnt hawf liked the jobe meself do ye kneow theyre forty years apiece and as hard as nails  mrs saulisbury looked up from her walnuts  sam is ready to carry the olive club to mr ramsey the poor beggar as he has called him all along will be a gentleman from this time forward  after the major had gone saulisbury said  theres one thing the majah was careful note to mention my deah why should this young fellow be going abeout defending the good name of his niece do ye kneow my deah i fancy the young idiot is in love with her  well suppose he is  but my deah in england you kneow it wouldnt mattah it would be a case of hopeless devotion but as i understand things heah it may become awkward dont ye think so love  it depends upon the young man edith could do worse than marry a good clean wholesome fellow like that  good gracious you deont allow your mind to go that fah  why certainly id much rather shed marry a strong young workingman than some burntout thirdgeneration wreck of her own set in the city  but the fellow has no means  he has muscle and brains and besides she has something of her own  saulisbury filled his pipe slowly  luckily its all theory on our part the contingency isnt heahisnt likely to arrive in fact  dont be too sure if i can read a girls heart in the lines of her face shes got where principalities and powers are of small account  really  sure as shooting she smilingly said  saulisbury mused and puffed  in that case we will have to turn in and give the fellow what you americans call a boost  thats right his wife replied slangily  edith went to her room that night with a mind whirling in dizzying circles whose motion she could not check it was terrible to have it all come in this way  she knew arthur cared for hershe had known it from the firstbut with the happy indifference of youth she had not looked forward to the end of the summer the sure outcome of passion had kept itself somewhere in a golden glimmer on the lower sweep of the river  she wished for some one to go to for advice mrs thayer she knew would exclaim in horror over the matter the major had hinted the course she would have to take which was to show arthur he had no connection with her lifeif she could but deep in her heart she knew she could not do that  suddenly a thought came to her which made her flush till the dew of shame stood upon her forehead he had never been to see her she had always been to see him  she knew that this was true she did not attempt to conceal it from herself now the charm of those rides with her uncle was the chance of seeing arthur the sweet neverwearying charm that made this summer one of perfect happiness that had made her almost forget her city ways and friends that had made her brown and strong with the soil and wind was daily contact with a robust and wholesome young man a sturdy figure with brown throat and bare strong arms  she went off at this point into a retrospective journey along the pathways of her summer outing at this place he stood at the watering trough leaning upon his great gray horse here he was walking behind his plow he was lifting his hatthe clear sunshine fell over his face she saw again the splendid flex of his side and powerful thigh here he was in the hayfield and she saw the forkhandle bend like a willow twig under his smiling effort the muscles on his brown arms rolling like some perfect machinery she idealized all he did and the entire summer and the wide landscape seemed filled with prismatic colors  then her selfaccusations came back she had gone down into the field to see him perhaps the very man who was with him then was one of those who had jested of her and whom he had punished her little hands clutched  ill never go out there again ill never see him againnever she said with her teeth shut tight  mrs thayer did not take any very great interest in the matter until mrs saulisbury held a session with her then she sputtered in deep indignation  why how dare he make love to my niece why the presumptuous thing why the idea hes a workingman  mrs saulisbury remained calm and smiling she was the only person who could manage mrs thayer  yes thats true but hes a collegebred man and  collegebred these nasty little western collegeswhat do they amount to why he curries our horses  mrs saulisbury was amused  i know that is an enormity but i heard the major tell of currying horses once  that was in the armyanyhow it doesnt matter edith can simply ignore the whole thing  i hope she can but i doubt it very much  what do you mean  i mean that edith is interested in him  i dont believe it why it is impossible youre crazy jeannette  hes very handsome in a way  hes red and bigjointed and hes a common plowboy mrs thayer gasped returning to her original charge  mrs saulisbury laughed being malevolent enough to enjoy the whole situation  he appears to me to be a very uncommon plowboy well i wouldnt try to do anything about it charlotte she added you remember the fate of the brookses who tried to force maud to give up her clerk if this is a case of true love you might as well surrender gracefully  but i cant do that im responsible for her to her father ill go right straight and ask her  charlotte mrs saulisburys voice rang with a stern note dont you presume to do such a thing you will precipitate everything the girl dont know her own mind and if you go up there and attack this young man youll tip the whole dish over dont you know you cant safely abuse that young fellow in her hearing sit down now and be reasonable leave her alone for a while let her think it over alone  this good counsel prevailed and the other woman settled into a calmer state  well its a dreadful thing anyhow  perfectly dreadful but you mustnt take a conventional view of it you must remember a good handsome healthy man should come first as a husband and this young man is very attractive and i must admit he seems a gentleman so far as i can see besides you cant do anything by storming up to that poor girl let her alone for a few days  following this suggestion no one alluded to the fight or appeared to notice ediths changed moods but mrs saulisbury could not forbear giving her an occasional squeeze of wordless sympathy as she passed her  it was pitiful to see the tumult and fear and responsibility of the world coming upon this dainty simplehearted girl life had been so straightforward before no toil no problems no choosing of things for ones self now suddenly here was the greatest problem of all coming at the end of a summertime outing  meanwhile arthur was longing to see edith once more and wondering why she had stopped coming  the major came up on friday and saturday but came alone and that left only the hope of seeing edith at church and the young fellow worked on with that to nerve his arm  the family respected his departure on sunday they plainly felt his depression and sympathized with it  walk home with her i would said mrs richards as he went through the kitchen  so would i dang me if id stand off richards started to say but arthur did not stop to listen  as he rode down to the city he recovered naturally a little of his buoyancy sleep had rested his body and cleared his mind for action  he sat in his usual place at the back of the church and his heart throbbed painfully as he saw her moving up the aisle a miracle of lace and coolness with fragrant linen enveloping her lovely young form so erect and graceful and slender  then his heart bowed down before her not because she was above him in a social classhe did not admit thatbut because he was a lover and she was his ideal he was cast down as suddenly as he had been exalted by her timid look around as was her custom in order to bow to him  he stood at the door as they came out though he felt foolish and boyish in doing so she approached him with eyes turned away but as she passed him she flashed an appealing mystical look at him and flushing a radiant pink slipped out of the side door leaving him stunned and smarting for a moment  as he mounted his horse and rode away toward the ranch his thoughts were busy with that strange look of hers he came to understand and to believe at last that she appealed to him and trusted in him and waited for him  then something strong and masterful rose in him he lifted his big brown fist in the air in a resolution which was like that of napoleon when he entered russia he turned and rode furiously back toward the town  as he walked up the gravel path to the thayer house it seemed like a castle to him the great granite portico the curving flight of steps the splendor of the glass above the door all impressed him with the terrible gulf between his fortune and hers  he was met at the door by the girl from the table he greeted her as his equal and said  is miss newell at home  the girl smiled with perfect knowledge and sympathy she was on his side and she knew besides how much it meant to have the hired man come in at the front door  yes shes at dinner wont you come in mr ramsey  he entered without further words and followed her into the reception room which was the most splendid room he had ever seen he stood with his feet upon a rug which was worth more than his years pay and he knew it  just take a seat here and ill announce you said the girl who was almost trembling with eagerness to explode her torpedo of news  dont disturb them ill wait  but she had whisked out of the room having plans of her own perhaps revenges of her own  arthur listened he could not help it he heard the girls clear distinct voice the open doorways conveyed every word to him  its mr ramsey maam to see miss newell  the young mans strained ears heard the sudden pause in the click of knives and plates he divined the gasps of astonishment with which mrs thayers utterance began  well i declare now major you see what i told you  the plucky young dog said saulisbury in sincere admiration  mrs thayer went on  now mr thayer this is the result of treating your servants as equals  the major laughed  my dear youre a little precipitate it may be a mistake the young man may be here to tell me one of the colts is sick  you dont believe any such thing you heard what the girl saidoh look at edith  there was a sudden pushing and scraping of chairs arthur rose tense terrified a little flurry of voices followed  here give her some wine the poor thing no wonder  then a slight pause  shes all right said the major in a relieved tone just a little surprised thats all  there came a little inarticulate murmur from the girl and then another pause  by jove this is getting dramatic said saulisbury  be quiet sam said his wife i wont have any of your scoffing im glad there is some sincerity of emotion left in our city girls  mrs thayer broke in  major you go right out there and send that impudent creature away its disgraceful  arthur turned cold and hard as granite his heart rose with a murderous slow swell he held his breath while the calm amused voice of the major replied  but see here my dear its none of my business mr ramsey is an american citizeni like himhe has a perfect right to call  hyah hyah called saulisbury in a chuckle  hes a man of parts and besides i rather imagine edith has given him the right to call  the anger died out of arthurs heart and the warm blood rushed once more through his tingling body tears came to his eyes and he could have embraced his defender  nothing like consistency majah said saulisbury  sam will you be quiet  the major went on  i imagine the whole matter is for edith to decide its really very simple let her send word to him that she does not care to see him and hell go awayno doubt of it  why of course said mrs thayer edith just tell mary to say to mr whatshisname  again that creeping thrill came into the young mans hair his world seemed balanced on a needles point  then a chair was pushed back slowly there was another little flurry again the blood poured over him like a splash of warm water leaving him cold and wet  edith called the astonished startled voice of mrs thayer what are you going to do  im going to see him said the girls firm voice  there was a soft clapping of two pairs of hands  as she came through the portière edith walked like a princess there was amazing resolution in her backflung head and on her face was the look of one who sets sail into unknown seas  somewaysomehow through a mist of light and a blur of sound he met herand the cling of her arms about his neck moved him to tears  no word was uttered till the major called from the doorway  mr ramsey mrs thayer wants to know if you wont come and have some dinner     a stopover at tyre  i   albert lohr was studying the motion of the ropes and lamps and listening to the rumble of the wheels and the roar of the ferocious wind against the pane of glass that his head touched it was the midnight train from marion rushing toward warsaw like some savage thing unchained creaking shrieking and clattering through the wild storm which possessed the whole mississippi valley  albert lost sight of the lamps at last and began to wonder what his future would be first i must go through the university at madison then ill study law go into politics and perhaps some time i may go to washington  in imagination he saw that wonderful city as a western boy boston to him was historic new york was the great metropolis but washington was the great american city and political greatness the only fame  the car was nearly empty save here and there the wideawake western drummer and a woman with four fretful children the train was as deserted as it was frightfully cold the engine shrieked warningly at intervals the train rumbled hollowly over short bridges and across pikes swung round the hills and plunged with wild warnings past little towns hid in the snow with only here and there a light shining dimly  one of the drummers now and then rose up from his cramped bed on the seats and swore dreadfully at the railway company for not heating the cars the woman with the children inquired for the tenth time is the next station lodi  yes maam it is snarled the drummer as he jerked viciously at the strap on his valise and darned glad i am too i can tell yeh ill be stiff as a carpin if i stay in this infernal ice chest another hour i wonder what the company think  at lodi several people got on among them a fat man and his pretty daughter abnormally wide awake considering the time of night she saw albert for the same reason that he saw herthey were both young and goodlooking  he began his musings again modified by this girls face he had left out the feminine element obviously he must recapitulate hed study law yes but that would not prevent going to sociables and church fairs and at these fairs the chances were good for a meeting with a girl her father must be influentialcountry judge or district attorney this would open new avenues  he was roused by the sound of his own name  is albert lohr in this car shouted the brakeman coming in enveloped in a cloud of fine snow  yes here shouted albert  heres a telegram for you  albert snatched the envelope with a sudden fear of disaster at home but it was dated tyre      get off at tyre ill be there                             hartley  well now thats fun said albert looking at the brakeman when do we reach there  about 220  well by thunder a pretty time o night  the brakeman grinned sympathetically any answer he asked at length  no that is none that ud do the matter justice albert said studying the telegram  hartley friend o yours  yes know him  yes he boarded where i did in warsaw  when he came back again the brakeman said to albert in a hesitating way  aint going t stop off long i spose  may an may not depends on hartley why  well ive got an aunt there that keeps boarders and i kind o like t send her one when i can if you should happen to stay a few days go an see her she sets up firstclass grub an it wouldnt kill anybody anyhow if you went up an called  course not if i stay long enough to make it pay ill look her up sure i aint no vanderbilt to stop at twodollaraday hotels  the brakeman sat down opposite albert encouraged by his smile  y see my division ends at warsaw and i run back and forth here every other day but i dont get much chance to see them and i aint worth a cuss fr letterwritin ysee shes only aunt by marriage but i like her an i guess shes got about all she can stand up under an so i like t help her a little when i can the old man died owning nothing but the house an that left the old lady t rustle fr her livin dummed if she aint sandy as old sand theyre gittn along purty  the whistle blew for brakes and seizing his lantern the brakeman slammed out on the platform  tough night for twisting brakes suggested albert when he came in again  yeson the freight  good heavens i should say so they dont run freight such nights as this  dont they well i guess they dont stop for a storm like this if theys any money to be made by sending her through manys the night ive broke all night on top of the old wooden cars when the wind cut like a razor shear the hair off a castiron mulewoooo theres where you need grit old man he ended dropping into familiar speech  yes or need a job awful bad  the brakeman was struck with this idea theres where youre right a fellow dont take that kind of a job for the fun of it not much he takes it because hes got to thats as sures youre a foot high i tell you a fellers got t rustle these days if he gits any kind of a job  toot tooooot toot  the station passed the brakeman did not return perhaps because he found some other listener perhaps because he was afraid of boring this pleasant young fellow albert shuddered with a sympathetic pain as he thought of the men on the tops of the icy cars with hands straining at the brake and the wind cutting their faces like a sandblast his mind went out to the thousands of freight trains shuttling to and fro across the vast web of gleaming iron spread out on the mighty breast of the western plains oh those tireless hands at the wheel and throttle  he looked at his watch it was two oclock the next station was tyre as he began to get his things together the brakeman came in  oh i forgot to say that the old ladys name is welshmrs robert welsh say i sent yeh and itll be all right  sure ill try her in the morningthat is if i find out im going to stay  tyre tyre yelled the brakeman as with clanging bell and whizz of steam the train slowed down and the wheels began to cry out in the snow  albert got his things together and pulled his cap firmly down on his head  here goes he muttered  hold yr breath shouted the brakeman albert swung himself to the platform before the stationa platform of planks along which the snow was streaming like water  good night called the brakeman  good night  alll aboooard called the conductor somewhere in the storm the brakeman swung his lantern and the train drew off into the blinding whirl and the lights were soon lost in the clouds of snow  no more desolate place could well be imagined a level plain apparently bare of houses swept by a ferocious wind a dingy little den called a stationno other shelter in sight no sign of life save the dull glare of two windows to the left alternately lost and found in the storm  alberts heart contracted with a sudden fear the outlook was appalling  wheres the town he yelled savagely at a dimly seen figure with a lanterna man evidently locking the station door his only refuge  over there was the surly reply  how far  bout a mile  a mile  thats what i saida mile  well ill be blanked  well ybetter be doing something besides standing here r y ll freeze t death id go over to the arteeshun house an go t bed if i was in your fix  oh y would  i would  well where is the artesian house  see them lights  i see them lights  well theyre it  oh wouldnt your grammar make old grammaticuss curl up though  what say queried the man bending his head toward albert his form being almost lost in the snow that streamed against them both  i said i guessed id try it grinned the youth invisibly  well i would if i was in your fix keep right close after me theys some ditches here and the footbridges are none too wide  the artesian is owned by the railway eh  yup  and youre the clerk  yup nice little scheme aint it  well itll do replied albert  the man laughed without looking around  keep your longest cuss words till morning youll need em take my word for it  in the little barroom lighted by a vilely smelling kerosene lamp the clerk hitherto a shadow and a voice came to light as a middleaged man with a sullen face slightly belied by a sly twinkle in his eyes  this beats all the winters i ever did see it dont do nawthin but blow blow want to go to bed i spose well come along  he took up one of the absurd little lamps and tried to get more light out of it  dummed if a white bean wouldnt be better  spit on it suggested albert  id throw the whole business out o the window for a cent growled the man  heres yr cent said the boy  youre mighty frisky fr a feller gittn offn a midnight train replied the man tramping along a narrow hallway and talking in a voice loud enough to awaken every sleeper in the house  have t be or thered be a pair of us  youll laugh out o the other side o yr mouth when you saw away on one o the bellcollar steaks this house puts up ended the clerk as he put the lamp down  sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof called albert after him and then plunged into the icy bed  he was awakened the next morning by the cooks pounding steak down in the kitchen and wrangling over some division of duty it was a vile place at any time but on a morning like this it was appalling the water was frozen the floor like ice the sevenbynine glass frosted so that he couldnt see to comb his hair  all that got me out of bed said albert to the clerk was the thought of leaving  got yr teeth filed said the day clerk with a wink old collinss beef will try em  the breakfast was incredibly badso much worse than he expected that albert was forced to admit he had never seen its like he fled from the place without a glance behind and took passage in an omnibus for the town a mile away it was terribly cold the thermometer twenty below zero but the sun was very brilliant and the air still  the driver pulled up before a very ambitious wooden hotel entitled the eldorado and albert dashed in at the door and up to the stove with both hands covering his ears  as he stood there frantic with pain kicking his toes and rubbing his ears he heard a chucklea slow sly insulting chuckleturned and saw hartley standing in the doorway visibly exulting over his misery  hello bert that you  whats left of me say youre a good one you are why didnt you telegraph me at marion a deuce of a night ive had of it  do ye good laughed hartley a tall alert handsome fellow nearly thirty years of age  after a short and vigorous blowing up albert said well now whats the meaning of all this anyhow why this change from racine  well you see i got wind of another fellow going to work this county for a life of logan and thinks i by jinks id better drop in ahead of him with blaines twenty years i telegraphed fr territory got it and telegraphed to stop you  you did it when did you come down  last night six oclock  albert was getting warmer and betternatured  well im here what ye going tdo with me  ill use you some way cant tell first thing is to find a boarding place where we can work in a couple o books on the bill  well i dont know about that but im going to look up a place a brakeman gave me a pointer on  all right here goes  scarcely any one was stirring on the streets the wind was pitilessly cold though not strong the snow under the feet cried out with a note like glass and steel the windows of the stores were thick with frost and albert gave a shudder of fear almost as if he were homeless he had never experienced anything like it before  entering one of the stores they found a group of men sitting about the stove smoking chatting and spitting aimlessly into a huge spittoon made of boards and filled with sawdust each man suspended smoking and talking as the strangers entered  can any of you gentlemen tell us where mrs welsh lives  there was a silence then the clerk behind the counter said  i guess so two blocks north and three west next to last house on lefthand side  clear as a bell laughed hartley and they pushed out into the cold again drawing their mufflers up to their eyes  i dont want much of this muttered bert through his scarf  the house was a large frame house standing on the edge of a bank and as the young men waited they could look down on the meadow land where the river lay blue and still and as hard as iron  a pale little girl ten or twelve years of age let them in  is this where mrs welsh lives  yes sir  will you ask her to come here a moment  yes sir piped the little one wont you sit down by the fire she added with a quaint air of hospitality  the room was the usual village sitting room a cylinder heater full of wood at one side of it a rag carpet much faded on the floor a cabinet organ a doleful pair of crayon portraits on the wall one supposedly a babya figure dressed like a child of six months but with a face old and cynical enough to be fortyfive the paper on the wall was of the hideous striped sort and the chairs were nondescript but everything was cleanso clean it looked worn more with brushing than with use  a slim woman of fifty with hollow eyes and a patient smile came in wiping her hands on her apron  how dye do did you want to see me  yes said hartley smiling the fact is were book agents and looking for a place to board  wellaiyes i keep boarders  i was sent here by a brakeman on the midnight express put in bert  oh tom said the woman her face clearing toms always sending us people why yes ive got room for you i guessthis room here she pushed open a folding door leading into what had been her parlor  you can have this  and the price  four dollars  eight dollars fr the two of us all right well be with you a week or two if we have luck  the woman smiled and shut the door bert thought how much she looked like his mother in the backthe same tired droop in the shoulders the same colorless dress once blue or brown now a peculiar drab characterless with much washing  excuse me wont you ive got to be at my baking make yrselves at home  now jim said bert im going t stay right here while you go and order our trunks aroundjust t pay you off fr last night  all right said hartley cheerily going out after getting warm bert sat down at the organ and played a gospel hymn or two from the moody and sankey hymnal he was in the midst of the chorus of let your lower lights etc when a young woman entered the room she had a whiskbroom in her hand and stood a picture of gentle surprise bert wheeled about on his stool  i thought it was stella she began  im a book agent said bert rising with his best grace i might as well out with it im here to board  oh said the girl with some relief she was very fair and very slight almost frail her eyes were of the sunniest blue her face pale and somewhat thin but her lips showed scarlet and her teeth were fine bert liked her and smiled  a book agent is the next thing to a burglar i know but still  oh i didnt mean that but i was surprised when did you come  just a few moments ago am i in your way he inquired with elaborate solicitude  oh no please go on you play very well i think it is so seldom young men play  i had to at college the other fellows all wanted to sing you play of course  when i have time she sighed there was a weary droop in her voice she seemed aware of it and said more brightly  you mean marion i suppose  yes im in my second year  i went there two years then i had to quit and come home to help mother  did you thats why im out here on this infernal book businessto get money  she looked at him with interest now noticing his fine eyes and waving brown hair  its dreadful isnt it but youve got a hope to go back i havent at first i didnt think i could live but i did she ended with a sigh a faroff expression in her eyes  there was a pause again bert felt that she was no ordinary girl and she was quite as strongly drawn to him  it almost killed me to give it up i dont spose id know any of the scholars you know even the teachers are not the same oh yessarah shaw i think shes back for the normal course  oh yes exclaimed bert i know sarah we boarded on the same street used t go home together after class an awful nice girl too  shes a worker she teaches school i cant do that for mother needs me at home there was another pause broken by the little girl who called  maud mamma wants you  maud rose and went out with a tired smile on her face that emphasized her resemblance to her mother bert couldnt forget that smile and he was still thinking about the girl and what her life must be when hartley came in  by jinks its snifty as dad used to say you cant draw a long breath through your nostrils freeze yr nose solid as a bottle he announced throwing off his coat with an air which seemed to make him an old resident of the room  by the way ive just found out why you was so anxious to get into this house hey he said slapping berts knee another case o girl  bert blushed he couldnt help it notwithstanding his innocence in this case hartley went on  oh i know you a girl in the house might a known it hartley continued in a hoarse whisper  i didnt know it myself till about ten minutes ago protested bert  hartley winked prodigiously  dont tell me is she pretty  nothat is you wouldnt call her so  oh the deuce i wouldnt dont you wish i wouldnt id like to see the girl i wouldnt call pretty right to her face too  the girl returned at this moment with an armful of wood  let me put it in cried hartley springing up excuse me my name is hartley book agent blaines twenty years plain cloth sprinkled edges three dollars half calf three fifty this is my friend mr lohr of marion german extraction soph at the university  the girl bowed and smiled and pushed by him toward the door of the parlor hartley followed her in and bert could hear them rattling away at the stove  wont you sit down and play for us asked hartley after they returned to the sitting room with the persuasive music of the book agent in his fine voice  oh no its nearly dinner time and i must help about the table  now make yourselves at home said mrs welsh appearing at the door leading to the kitchen if you want anything just let me know  all right we will dont worry well be trouble enoughnice people said hartley as he shut the door of their room and sat down but the girl aint what i call pretty  by the time the dinner bell rang they were feeling at home in their new quarters at the table they met the other boarders the brann brothers newsdealers old man troutt who kept the livery stable and smelled of it and a small dark and wizened woman who kept the millinery store the others who came in late were clerks  maud served the dinner while stella and her mother waited upon the table albert was accustomed to this and made little account of the service he did notice the hands of the girl however so white and graceful no amount of work could quite remove their essential shapeliness  hartley struck up a conversation with the newsdealers and left bert free to observe maud she was not more than twenty he decided but she looked older so careworn and sad was her face  theys one thing agin yeh troutt the liveryman was bawling to hartley theys jest been worked one o the goldingedest schemes you ever see bout six munce ago sm fellers come all through here claimin t be after information about the county and the leadin citizens wanted t write a history an wanted all the pitchers of the leading men old settlers an so on you paid ten dollars an you had a book an your pitcher in it  i know the scheme grinned hartley  wal sir i spose them fellers roped in every man in this town i dont spose they got out with a cent lessn one thousand dollars an when the book comewal here he stopped to roar i dont spose you ever see a madder lot o men in your life in the first place they got the names and the pitchers mixed so that i was judge ricker an judge ricker was ol man daggett didnt the judge swearoh it was awful  i should say so  an the pitchers that want mixed was so goldinged black you couldnt tell em from niggers you know how kind o lilylivered lawyer ransom is wal he looked like ol black joe he was the maddest man of the hull bilin he throwed the book in the fire and tromped around like a blind bull  it wasnt a success i take it then why i should a thought theyd a nabbed the fellows  not much they was too keen for that they didnt deliver the books theirselves they hired dick bascom to do it fr them course dick want t blame  no i never tried it before albert was saying to maud at their end of the table hartley offered me a good thing to come and as i needed money i came i dont know what hes going to do with me now im here  albert did not go out after dinner with hartley it was too cold hartley let nothing stand in the way of business however he had been at school with albert during his first year but had gone back to work in preference to study  albert had brought his books with him planning to keep up with his class if possible and was deep in a study of cæsar when he heard a timid knock on the door  come he called student fashion  maud entered her face aglow  how natural that sounds she said  albert sprang up to help her put down the wood in her arms i wish youd let me bring the wood he said pleadingly as she refused his aid  i wasnt sure you were in were you reading  cæsar he replied holding up the book i am conditioned on latin im going over the commentaries again  i thought i knew the book she laughed  you read latin  yes a littlevergil  maybe you can help me out on these oratia obliqua they bother me yet i hate these cæsar saids i like vergil better  she stood at his shoulder while he pointed out the knotty passage she read it easily and he thanked her it was amazing how well acquainted they felt after this they were as fellowstudents  the wind roared outside in the bare maples and the fire boomed in its pent place within the young people forgot the time and place the girl sank into a chair almost unconsciously as they talked of madisona great city to themof the capitol building of the splendid campus of the lakes and the gay sailing there in summer and iceboating in winter of the struggles of rooming  oh it makes me homesick cried the girl with a deep sigh it was the happiest sunniest time of all my life oh those walks and talks those recitations in the dear chalky old rooms oh how i would like to go back over that hollow doorstone again  she broke off with tears in her eyes he was obliged to cough two or three times before he could break the silence  i know just how you feel i know the first spring when i went back on the farm it seemed as if i couldnt stand it i thought id go crazy the days seemed fortyeight hours long it was so lonesome and so dreary on rainy days but of course i expected to go back thats what kept me up i dont think i could have stood it if i hadnt had hope  ive given it up now she said plaintively its no use hoping  why dont you teach asked albert deeply affected by her voice and manner  i did teach here for a year but i couldnt endure the noise im not very strong and the boys were so rude if i could teach in a seminaryteach latin and englishi should be happy i think but i cant leave mother now  she began to appear a different girl in the boys eyes the cheap dress the check apron could not hide her pure intellectual spirit her large blue eyes were deep with thought and the pale face lighted by the glow of the fire was as lovely as a rose almost before he knew it he was telling her of his life  i dont see how i endured it as long as i did he went on it was nothing but work work and mud the whole year round its just so on all farms  yes i guess it is said she father was a carpenter and ive always lived here but we have people who are farmers and i know how it is with them  why when i think of it now it makes me crawl to think of getting up in the morning before daylight and going out to the barn to do chores to get ready to go into the field to work working wasting yr life on dirt goin round and round in a circle and never getting out  its just the same for us women she corroborated think of us going around the house day after day and doing just the same things over an over year after year thats the whole of most womens lives dishwashing almost drives me crazy  i know it said albert but a fellow has t do it if his folks are workin hard why of course he cant lay around and study theyre not to blame i dont know that anybodys to blame  no i dont but it makes me sad to see mother going around as she does day after day she wont let me do as much as i would the girl looked at her slender hands you see im not very strong it makes my heart ache to see her going around in that quiet patient way shes so good  i know i know ive felt just like that about my mother and father too  there was a long pause full of deep feeling and then the girl continued in a low hesitating voice  mothers had an awful hard time since father died we had to go to keeping boarders which was hardvery hard for mother the boy felt a sympathetic lump in his throat as the girl went on again but she doesnt complain and she didnt want me to come home from school but of course i couldnt do anything else  it didnt occur to either of them that any other course was open nor that there was any heroism or selfsacrifice in the act it was simply right  well im not going to drudge all my life said the boy at last i know its kind o selfish but i cant live on a farm it ud kill me in a year ive made up my mind to study law and enter the bar lawyers manage to get hold of enough to live on decently and thats more than you can say of the farmers and they live in town where something is going on once in a while anyway  in the pause which followed footsteps were heard on the walk outside and the girl sprang up with a beautiful blush  my stars i didnt thinki forgoti must go  hartley burst into the room shortly after she left it in his usual breeze  hullo still at the latin hey  yes said bert with ease how goes it  oh im whooping er up im getting started in great shape been up to the courthouse and roped in three of the county officials in these small towns the big man is the politician or the clergyman ive nailed the politicians through the ear now you must go for the ministers to head the listthats your layout  howm i t do it said bert in an anxious tone i cant sell books if they dont want em  yes yeh can thats the trade offer a big discount say full calf two fifty morocco two ninety regular discount to the clergy ye know oh theyre on to that little racketno trouble if you can get a few of these leaders of the flock the rest will follow like lambs to the slaughter tralalawhoooish whish  albert laughed at hartley as he plunged his face into the icecold water puffing and wheezing  jeemimy crickets but aint that water cold i worked rock river this way last month and made a boomin success if you take hold here in the  oh im all ready to do anything that is needed short of being kicked out  no danger of that if youre a real book agent its the snide that gets kicked youve got t have some savvy in this just like any other business he stopped in his dressing to say weve struck a great boarding place hey  looks like it  i begin t cotton to the old lady aready good eal like mother used t be fore she broke down didnt the old lady have a time of it raisin me phewee patient job wasnt a patchin but the test is goin t come on the biscuit if her biscuit comes up t mothers im hern till death  he broke off to comb his hair a very nice bit of work in his case   ii  there was no discernible reason why the little town should have been called tyre and yet its name was as characteristically american as its architecture it had the usual main street lined with low brick or wooden storesa street which developed into a road running back up a wide sandy valley away from the river being a county town it had a courthouse in a yard near the center of the town and a big summer hotel the valley was peculiarly picturesque curiously shaped and oddly distributed hills rose out of the valley sand abruptly forming a sort of amphitheater in which the village lay these squaretopped hills rose to a common level showing that they were not the result of an upheaval but were the remains of the original stratification left standing after the vast scooping action of the postglacial floods  the abrupt cliffs and lone huge pillars and peaks rising out of tamarack swamps here and there showed the original layers of rock unmoved they looked like ruined walls of castles ancient as hills on whose massive tops time had sown sturdy oaks and cedars they lent a distinct air of romance to the valley at all times but when in summer vines clambered over their rugged sides and underbrush softened their broken lines it was not at all difficult to imagine them the remains of an unrecorded very warlike people  even now in winter with yellowbrown and green cedars standing starkly upon their summits the hickories and small ashes blueblack with their masses of fine bare limbs meshed against the snow these towers had a distinct charm the weather was glorious winter and in the early morning when the trees glistened with frost or at evening when the white light of the sun was softened and violet shadows lay along the snow the whole valley was a delight to the eye full of distinct and lasting charm part of the beautiful and strange mississippi river scenery  in the campaign which hartley began albert did his best and his best was done unconsciously for the charm of his manner all unknown to himself was the most potent factor in securing consideration  im not a book agent he said to one of the clergymen to whom he first appealed im a student trying to sell a good book and make a little money to help me to complete my course at the university  he did not go to the back door but walked up to the front asked to see the minister and placed his case at once before him with a smiling candor and a leisurely utterance quite the opposites of the brazen timidity and rapid parrotlike tone of the professional he secured three clergymen of the place to head his list much to the delight and admiration of hartley  good now corral the alumni of the place work the fraternal racket to the bitter end oh say theres a sociable tomorrow night i guess wed better go hadnt we  go alone  alone no take some girls im going to take neighbor pickets daughter shes homely as a hedge fence but ill take hergreat scheme  hartley youre an infernal fraud  nothing of the kindim business ended hartley with a laugh  after supper the following day as albert was still lingering at the table with the girls and mrs welsh he thought of the sociable and said on the impulse  are you going to the sociable  no i guess not  would you go if i asked you  try me and see answered the girl with a laugh her color rising  all right miss welsh will you attend the festivity of the evening under my guidance and protection  yes thank you  ill be ready before you are  no doubt ive got to wash the dishes  ill wash the dishes you go get ready said the selfregardless mother  albert felt that he had one of the loveliest girls in the room as he led maud down the floor of the vestry of the church filled with laughing young people moving about or seated at the long tables mauds cheeks were full of delicate color and her eyes shone with maidenly delight as they took seats at the table to sip a little coffee and nibble a bit of cake  i suppose they must have my fifteen cents some way said albert in a low voice and i guess wed better sit down  maud introduced him to a number of young people who had been students at the university they received him cordially and in a very short time he was enjoying himself very well indeed he was reminded rather disagreeably of his office however by seeing hartley surrounded by a laughing crowd of the more frolicsome young people he winked at albert as much as to say good stroke of business  the evening passed away with songs games and recitations and it was nearly eleven oclock when the young people began to wander off toward home in pairs albert and maud were among the first of the young folks to bid the rest good night  the night was clear and cold but perfectly still and the young people arm in arm walked slowly homeward under the bare maples in delicious companionship albert held her arm close to his side  are you cold he asked in a low voice  no thank you the night is lovely she replied then added with a sigh i dont like sociables so well as i used tothey tire me out  we stayed too long  it wasnt that im getting so they seem kind o silly  well i feel a little that way myself he confessed  but there is so little to see here in tyre at any timeno music no theaters i like theaters dont you  i cant go half enough  but nothing worth seeing ever comes into these little townsand then were all so poor anyway  the lamp turned low was emitting a terrible odor as they entered the sitting room  my goodness its almost twelve oclock good night she held out her hand  good night he said taking it and giving it a cordial pressure which she remembered long  good night she repeated softly going up the stairs  hartley came in a few moments later and found bert sitting thoughtfully by the fire with his coat and shoes off evidently in deep abstraction  well i got away at lastmuch as ever great scheme that sociable eh i saw your little girl introducing you right and left  say hartley i wish youd leave her out of this thing i dont like the way you speak of her when  phew you dont oh all right im mum as an oysteronly keep it up get in all the church sociables and all that theres nothing like it  hartley soon had canvassers out along the country roads and was working every house in town the campaign promised to lengthen into a month perhaps longer albert especially became a great favorite every one declared there had never been such book agents in the town such gentlemanly fellows they didnt press anybody to buy they didnt rush about and poke their noses where they were not wanted they were more like merchants with books to sell the only person who failed to see the attraction in them was ed brann who was popularly supposed to be engaged to maud he grew daily more sullen and repellent toward albert noticeably so  one evening about six after coming in from a long walk about town albert entered his room without lighting his lamp lay down on the bed and fell asleep he had been out late the night before with maud at a party and slumber came almost instantly  maud came in shortly hearing no response to her knock and after hanging some towels on the rack went out without seeing the sleeper in the sitting room she met ed brann he was a stalwart young man with curling black hair and a heavy face at its best but set and sullen now his first words held a menace  say maud i want t talk to you  very well what is it ed replied the girl quietly  i want to know how often youre going to be out till twelve oclock with this book agent  perhaps it was the derisive inflection on book agent that woke albert branns tone was brutalmore brutal even than his words and the girl turned pale and her breath quickened  why ed whats the matter  matter is just this you aint got any business goin around with that feller with my ring on your finger thats all he ended with an unmistakable threat in his voice  very well said the girl after a pause curiously quiet then i wont heres your ring  the mans bluster disappeared instantly bert could tell by the change in his voice which was incredibly great as he pleaded  oh dont do that maud i didnt mean to say that i was madim sorry  im glad you did it now so i can know you take your ring ed i neverll wear it again  albert had heard all this but he did not know how the girl looked as she faced the man in the silence which followed she looked him in the face and scornfully passed him and went out into the kitchen he did not return at supper  young people of this sort are not selfanalysts and maud did not examine closely into causes she was astonished to find herself more indignant than grieved she broke into an angry wail as she went to her mothers bosom  mother mother  why whats the matter maudie tell me there there dont cry pet whos been hurtin my poor little bird  ed has he saidhe said  there there poor child have you been quarreling never mind itll come out all right  no it wontnot the way you mean the girl cried lifting her head ive given him back his ring and ill never wear it again  the mother could not understand with what wounding brutality the mans tone had fallen upon the girls spirit and maud felt in some way as if she could not explain sufficiently to justify herself mrs welsh consoled herself with the idea that it was only a lovers quarrelone of the little jars sure to come when two natures are settling togetherand that all would be mended in a day or two  but there was a peculiar set look on the girls face that promised little for brann albert being no more of a selfanalyst than maud simply said served him right and dwelt no more upon it for the time  at supper however he was extravagantly gay and to himself unaccountably so he joked troutt till maud begged him to stop and after the rest had gone he remained seated at the table enjoying the indignant color in her face and the flash of her infrequent smile which it was such a pleasure to provoke he volunteered to help wash the dishes  thank you but im afraid youd be more bother than help she replied  thank you but you dont know me i aint so green as i look by no manner o means ive been doing my own housekeeping for four terms  i know all about that laughed the girl you young men rooming do precious little cooking and no dishwashing at all  thats a base calumny i made it a point to wash every dish in the house except the spider once a week had a regular cleaningup day  and about the spider  i wiped that out nicely with a newspaper every time i wanted to use it  oh horrorsmother listen to that  why what more could you ask you wouldnt have me wipe it six times a day would you  i wonder it didnt poison you commented mrs welsh  takes moren that to poison a student laughed albert as he went out  the next afternoon he came bursting into the kitchen where maud stood with her sleeves rolled up deep in the dish pan while stella stood wiping the dishes handed to her  dont you want a sleigh ride he asked boyishly eager  she looked up with shining eyes  oh wouldnt ican you get along mother  certainly child the airll do you good  wy maud said the little girl you said you didnt want to when ed  mrs welsh silenced her and said  run right along dear its just the nicest time o day are there many teams out  theyre just beginning t come out said albert ill have a cutter around here in about two jiffies be on hand sure  troutt was standing in the sunny doorway of his stable when the young fellow dashed up to him  hullo uncle troutt harness the fastest nag into your swellest outfit instanter  aha goin t take yr girl out hey  yes and i want o do it in style  i guess ol dans the idee if you can drive him hes a ringtailed snorter  fast  nope but safe gentle as a kitten and as knowin as a fox drive him with one handleft hand the old man chuckled  troutt youre an insinuating old insinuator and ill  troutt laughed till his long faded beard flapped up and down and quivered with the stress of his enjoyment of his joke he ended by hitching a viciouslooking sorrel to a gay duckbellied cutter saying as he gave up the reins  now be keerful dans foxy hes all right when he sees youve got the reins but dont drop em  dont you worry about me i grew up with horses said the overconfident youth leaping into the sleigh and gathering up the lines stand aside my lord and let the cortège pass hoopla  the brute gave a tearing lunge and was out of the doorway like a shot before the old man could utter a word albert thrilled with pleasure as he felt the reins stiffen in his hands while the traces swung slack beside the thills  if he keeps this up hell do he thought  as he turned up at the gate maud came gayly down the path muffled to the eyes  oh what a nice cutter but the horseis he gentle she asked as she climbed in  as a cow albert repliedgit out o this bones  the main street was already full of teams wood sleighs bobsleighs filled with children and here and there a man in a light cutter alone out for a race laughter was on the air and the jinglejangle of bells the sun was dazzling in its brightness and the gay wraps and scarfs lighted up the street with flecks of color loafers on the sidewalks fired a fusillade of words at the teams as they passed  go it bones  let er go gallagher  aint she a daisy  but what cared the drivers if the shouts were insolent they laid them to envy and if they were pleasant they smiled in reply  albert and maud had made two easy turns up and down the street when a man driving a span of large blackhawk horses dashed up a side street and whirled in just before them the man was a superb driver and sat with the reins held carelessly but securely in his left hand guiding the team more by his voice than by the bit he sat leaning forward with his head held down in a peculiar and sinister fashion  hello cried bert that looks like brann  it is said maud  cracky thats a fine teamblack hawks both of them i wonder if ol sorrel can pass em  oh please dont try pleaded the girl  why not  becausebecause im afraid  afraid of what  afraid somethingll happen  something is goin t happen im goin t pass him if old bones has got any git to him  itll make him mad  who mad brann  yes  well spose it does who cares  the teams moved along at an easy pace some one called to brann  theyre on yr trail ed  there was something peculiar in the tone and brann looked behind for the first time and saw them he swore through his teeth and turned about he looked dogged and sullen with his bent shoulders and his chin thrust down  there were a dozen similar rigs moving up or down the street and greetings passed from sleigh to sleigh everybody except brann welcomed albert with sincere pleasure and exchanged rustic jokes with him as they slowed up at the upper end of the street and began to turn a man on the sidewalk said confidentially  say cap if you handle that old rackobones just right hell distance anything on this road when you want him to do his best let him have the rein dont pull a pound i used to own imi know im  the old sorrel came round gauming his ugly head thrown up his great red mouth open his ears back brann and the young doctor of the place were turning together a little farther up the street the blacks superbly obedient to their driver came down with flying hoofs their great glossy breasts flecked with foam from their champing jaws  come on fellers yelled brann insultingly as he came down past the doctor and seemed about to pass albert and maud there was hate in the glare of his eyes  but he did not pass the old sorrel seemed to lengthen to the spectators his nose appeared to be glued to the glossy side of branns off black  see them blacks trot shouted albert in ungrammatical enthusiasm  see that old sorrel shake himself yelled the loafers  the doctor came tearing down with a spirited bay a magnificent stepper as he drew along so that bert could catch a glimpse of the mares neck he thrilled with delight there was the thoroughbreds lacing of veins the proud fling of her knees and the swell of her neck showed that she was far from doing her best there was a wild light in her eyes  these were the fast teams of the town all interest was centered in them  clear the track yelled the loafers  the docs good fr em  if she dont break  albert was pulling at the sorrel heavily absorbed in seeing as well as he could for the flung snowballs the doctors mare draw slowly foot by foot past the blacks suddenly brann gave a shrill yell and stood up in his sleigh the gallant little bay broke and fell behind brann gave a loud laugh the blacks trotted on their splendid pace unchanged  let the sorrel out yelled somebody  let him loose yelled troutt on the corner quivering with excitement let him go  albert remembered what the fellow had said he let the reins loose the old sorrels teeth came together with a snap his head lowered and his tail rose he shot abreast of the blacks brann yelled  samsaul git  see them trot shouted bert lost in admiration but maud frightened into silence had covered her head with the robe to escape the blinding cloud of flying snow the sorrel drew steadily ahead he was passing when brann turned  durn yr old horse he yelled through his shut teeth and laid the whip across the sorrels hips the blacks broke wildly but strange to say the old sorrel increased his speed again brann struck at him but missed him and the stroke fell on berts outstretched wrists he turned to see what brann meant by it he did not see that the blacks were crowding him to the gutter his hands felt numb  look out there  before he could turn to look the cutter seemed to be blown up by a bomb and he rose in the air like a vaulter he saw the traces part he felt the reins slip through his hands and that was all he seemed to fall an immeasurable depth into a black abyss the next that he knew was a curious soft murmur of voices out of which a sweet agonized girlvoice broke familiar but unrecognized  oh wheres the doctor hes deadoh hes dead cant you hurry  next came a quick authoritative voice still far away and a hush followed it then an imperative order  stand out o the way what do you think you can do by crowding on top of him  stand back stand back other voices called  then he felt something cold on his head they were taking his cap off and putting snow on his head then the doctor he knew him now said  let me take him  oh cant i do something said the sweet voice  nonothing  then there came a strange fullness in his head shadows lighted by dull red flashes passed before his eyes he wondered in a slow dull way if he were dying then this changed a dull throbbing ache came into his head and as this grew the noise of voices grew more distinct and he could hear sobbing then the dull rhythmic red flashes passed slowly away from his eyes and he opened his lids but the glare of the sunlight struck them shut again he saw only mauds face agonized white and wet with tears looking down into his he felt the doctors hands winding bandages about his head and he felt a crawling stream of blood behind his ear getting as cold as ice as it sank under his collar  they raised him a little more and he opened his eyes on the circle of hushed and excited men thronging about him he saw brann with wild scared face standing in his cutter and peering over the heads of the crowd  how do you feel now asked the doctor  can you hear us albert do you know me called the girl  his lips moved stiffly but he smiled a little and at length whispered slowly yes i guessim allright  put him into my cutter maud get in here too the doctor commanded with all the authority of a physician in a small village the crowd opened and silenced its muttered comments as the doctor and troutt helped the wounded man into the sleigh the pain in his head grew worse but alberts perception of things grew in proportion he closed his eyes to the sun but in the shadow of mauds breast opened them again and looked up at her he felt a vague childlike pleasure in knowing she was holding him in her arms he felt the sleigh moving he thought of his mother and how it would frighten her if she knew  the doctor was driving the horse and walking beside the sleigh and the people were accosting him albert could catch their words now and then and the reply  no he isnt killed nor anything near it hes stunned thats all he isnt bleeding now no hell be all right in a day or two  hello said a breathless hearty voice what the deuce y been doing with my pardner bert old fellow are you there hartley asked clinging to the edge of the moving cutter and peering into his friends face albert smiled  im herewhat there is left of me he replied faintly  glory howd it happen he asked of the girl  i dont knowi couldnt seewe ran into a culvert replied maud  werent you hurt  not a bit i stayed in the cutter  albert felt a steady return of waves of pain but did not know that they were waves of returning life he groaned and tried to rise the girl gently but firmly restrained him hartley was walking beside the doctor talking loudly it was a devilish thing to do the scoundrel ought o be jugged  albert groaned and tried to rise again im bleeding yet im soaking you  the girl shuddered but remained firm  no were most home  she felt no shame but a certain exaltation as she looked into the curious faces she saw in groups on the sidewalk the boys who ran alongside wore in their faces a look of awe for they imagined themselves in the presence of death  maud gazed unrecognizingly upon her nearest girl friends they seemed something alien in that moment and they gazing upon her white face and unrecognizing eyes spoke in awed whispers  at the gate the crowd gathered and waited with deepest interest with a sort of shuddering pleasure it was all a strange unusual inthralling romance to them the dazzling sunshine added to the wonder of it all  ed brann done it  how asked several  with the butt end of his whip  thats a lie his team ran into lohrs rig  not much ed crowded him into the ditch  what fer  cause bert cut him out with maud  come get out of the way dont stand there gabbing yelled hartley as he took albert in his arms and together with the doctor lifted him out of the sleigh  goodness sakes alive aint it terrible how is he asked an old lady peering at him as he passed  on the porch stood mrs welsh supported by ed brann  shes all right i tell you he aint hurt much either just stunned a little thats all  maud child cried the mother as maud appeared out of the crowd followed by a bevy of girls  mother im all right she said as gayly as she could running into the trembling arms outstretched toward her but oh poor albert  after they disappeared into the house the crowd dispersed brann went off by way of the alley he was not prepared to meet their questions but he met his brother and several others in his store  now what in  you been up to was the fraternal greeting  nothing  welting a man on the head with a whipstock aint anything hey  i didnt touch him we was racing and he run into the culvert  hank says he saw you strike  he lies i was strikin the horse to make him break  oh yeh was sneered the older man well i hope you understand that thisll ruin us in this town if you didnt strike him theyll say you run him into the culvert n every man woman n childll be down on you and me fr bein related to you they all know how you feel towards him for cuttin you out with maud welsh  oh dont bear down on him too hard joe he didnt mean t do any harm said troutt who had followed ed down to the store i guess the young fellerll come out all right just go kind o easy till we see how he comes out if he dies why itll haf t be looked into  ed turned pale and swallowed hastily if he should die he would be a murderer he knew that hate was in his heart he shivered again as he remembered the mans white face with the bright red stream flowing down behind his ear and over his cheek it almost seemed to him that he had struck him so close had the accident followed upon the fall of his whip   iii  albert sank into a feverish sleep that night with a vague perception of four figures in the roommaud her mother hartley and the young doctor when he awoke fully in the morning his head felt prodigiously hot and heavy  it was early dawn and the lamp was burning brightly outside a mans feet could be heard on the squealing snowa sound which told how still and cold it was a team passed with a jingle of bells  albert raised his head and looked about hartley was lying on the sofa rolled up in his overcoat and some extra quilts he had lain down at last worn with watching albert felt a little weak and fell back on his pillow thinking about the strange night he had passeda night more filled with strange happenings than the afternoon  his sleep had been broken by the most vivid and exciting dreams and through these visions had moved the figures of hartley the doctor and maud and her mother he had a confused idea of the night but a very clear idea of the afternoon he could see the sidewalks lined with faces the sun shining on the snow the old sorrels sideflung head and open mouth the sleigh rose under him again and he felt the reins burn through his hands  as the light grew in the room his mind cleared and he began to feel quite like himself again he lifted his muscular arm and opened and shut his hand saying aloud in his old boyish manner  i guess im all here  whats that called hartley rolling out of bed did you ask for anything  noyes gimme some water jim my mouth is dry as a powder mill  how yeh feelin anyway pardner said hartley as he brought the water  first rate jim i guess ill be all right  well i guess youd better keep quiet  albert rose partly assisted by his friend and drank from the glass a moment then fell back on his pillow  i dont feel s well when i sit up  well dont then stay right there where you are ohum gaped hartley stretching himself its about time fr breakfast i guess want yr hands washed and yr hair combed  i guess i aint reduced to that yet  well i guess y be old man now keep quiet or have i got t make yeh he asked in a threatening tone which made albert smile he wondered if hartley hadnt been sitting up most of the night but if he had he showed little effect of it for he began to sing a comic song as he pulled on his boots  he threw on his coat next and went out into the kitchen returning soon with some hot water with which he began to bathe the wounded boys face and hands as tenderly as a woman  there now i guess youre in shape fr grubfeel any like grubcome in he called in answer to a knock on the door  mrs welsh entered  how is he she whispered anxiously  oh im all right cried albert bring me a plate of pancakes quick  mrs welsh turned to hartley with a startled expression but hartleys grin assured her  im glad to find you so much better she said going to his bedside ive hardly slep i was so much worried about you  it was very sweet to feel her fingers in his hair as his mother would have caressed him  i guess i hadnt better take off the bandages till the doctor comes if youre comfortableyour breakfast is ready mr hartley and ill bring something for albert  another knock a few minutes later and maud entered with a platter followed closely by her mother who carried some tea and milk  maud came forward timidly but when he turned his eyes on her and said in a cheery voice good morning miss welsh she flamed out in rosy color and recoiled she had expected to see him pale dulleyed and with a weak voice but there was little to indicate invalidism in his firm greeting she gave place to mrs welsh who prepared his breakfast she was smitten dumb by this turn of affairs she hardly dared look at him as he sat propped up in bed the crimson trimming on his shirtfront seemed like streams of blood his head swathed in bandages made her shudder but aside from these few suggestions of wounding there was little of the horror of the previous day left he did not look so pale and worn as the girl herself  however though he was feeling absurdly well there was a good deal of bravado in his tone and manner for he ate but little and soon sank back on the bed  i feel better when my head is low he explained in a faint voice  cant i do something asked the girl her courage reviving as she saw how ill and faint he really was his eyes were closed and he looked the invalid now  i guess you better write to his folks  no dont do that he said opening his eyes it will only do them harm an me no good ill be all right in a few days you neednt waste your time on me hartleyll wait on me  mr lohr how can you say such cruel  dont mind him now said mrs welsh im his mother now and hes goin to do just as i tell him toaint you albert  he dropped his eyelids in assent and went off in a doze it was all very pleasant to be thus treated hartley was devotion itself and the doctor removed his bandages with the care and deliberation of a man with a moderate practice besides he considered albert a personal friend  hartley after the doctor had gone said with some hesitation  well now pard i ought to go out and see a couple o fellows i promised t meet this morning  all right jim all right you go right ahead on business im goin t sleep anyway and ill be all right in a day or two  well i will but ill run in every hour r two and see if you dont want something youre in good hands anyway when im gone  wont you read to me pleaded albert in the afternoon when maud came in with her mother to brush up the room its getting rather slow business layin here like this course i cant ask jim to stay and read all the time and hes a bad reader anyway wont you  shall i mother  why of course maud  so maud got a book and sat down over by the stove quite distant from the bed and read to him from the lady of the lake while the mother like a piece of tireless machinery moved about the house at the neverending succession of petty drudgeries which wear the heart and soul out of so many wives and mothers making life to them a pilgrimage from stove to pantry from pantry to cellar and from cellar to garreta life that deadens and destroys coarsens and narrows till the flesh and bones are warped to the expression of the wronged and cheated soul  alberts selfishness was in a way excusable he enjoyed beyond measure the sound of the girls soft voice and the sight of her graceful head bent over the page he lay looking and listening dreamily till the voice and the sunlit head were lost in his deep sweet sleep  the girl sat with closed book looking at his face as he slept it was a curious study to her a young manthis young man asleep his brown lashes lay on his cheek his facial lines were as placid as a childs as she looked she gained courage to go over softly and peer down on him how boyish he seemed how little to be feared how innocent after all  as she studied him she thought of him the day before with closed eyes a ghastly stream of blood flowing down and soaking her dress she shuddered his hands clean and strong and white lay out on the coverlet loose and open the fingers fallen into graceful lines abruptly a boy outside gave a shout and she leaped away with a sudden spring that left her pale and breathless as she paused in the door and looked back at the undisturbed sleeper she smiled and the pink came back into her thin face  alberts superb young blood began to assert itself and on the afternoon of the second day he was able to sit in his rocking chair before the fire and read a little though he professed that his eyes were not strong in order that maud should read for him this she did as often as she could leave her other work which was not half often enough the invalid grumbled  more than you deserve she found courage to say  hartley let nothing interfere with the book business and the popular sympathy for albert he coined into dollars remorselessly  you take it easy he kept saying to his partner dont you worryyour pay goes on just the same youre doing well right where you are by jinks biggest piece o luck he went on half in earnest why i cant turn around without taking an orderfact turned in a book on the livery billthats all right well make a clear hundred dollars out o that little bump o yours  little bump say now thats  keep it upput it on dont get up in a hurry i dont need you to canvass and i guess you enjoy this bout as well he ended with a sly wink and cough  yes the convalescence was delicious afterward it grew to be one of the sweetest weeks of his life maud reading to him bringing his food and singing for him yes all that marred it was the stream of people who came to inquire how he was getting along the sympathy was largely genuine as hartley could attest but it bored the invalid he had rather be left in quiet with walter scott and maud the drone of the long descriptive passages being a sure soporific  he did not say as an older person might that she was not to be held accountable for what she did under the stress and tumult of that day but he unconsciously did so regard her actions led to do so by the changed conditions in the light of common day it was hurrying to be a dream  at the end of a week he was quite himself again though he still had difficulty in wearing his hat it was not till the second sunday after the accident that he appeared in the dining room for the first time with a large traveling cap concealing the suggestive bandages he looked pale and thin but his eyes danced with joy  mauds eyes dilated with instant solicitude the rest sprang up in surprise with shouts of delight as hearty as brethren  ginger im glad t see yeh said troutt so sincerely that he looked almost winning to the boy the rest crowded around shaking hands  oh im on deck again  ed brann came in a moment later with his brother and there was a significant little pausea pause which grew painful till albert turned and saw brann and called out  hello ed how are you didnt know you were here  as he held out his hand brann his face purple with shame and embarrassment lumbered heavily across the room and took it muttering some poor apology  hope y dont blame me  of course notfortunes o war nobody to blame just my carelessnessyes ill take turkey he said to maud as he sank into the seat of honor at the head of the table  then the rest laughed and took seats but brann remained standing near alberts chair he had not finished yet  im mighty glad yeh dont lay it up against me lohr an i want o say the doctors bill is all right you unerstand its all right  albert looked at him a moment in surprise he knew this coming from a man like brann meant more than a thousand prayers from a ready apologist it was a terrible victory and he made it as easy for his rival as possible  oh all right ed only id calculated to cheat him out o part of itthat is turn in a couple o blaines twenty years on the bill  hartley roared and the rest joined in but not even albert perceived all that it meant it meant that the young savage had surrendered his claim in favor of the man he had all but killed the struggle had been prodigious but he had snatched victory out of defeat his better nature had conquered  no one ever gave him credit for it and when he went west in the spring people said his love for maud had been superficial in truth he had loved the girl as sincerely as he had hated his rival that he could rise out of the barbaric in his love and hate was heroic  when albert went to ride again it was on melting snow with the slowest horse troutt had maud was happier than she had been since she left school and fuller of color and singing she dared not let a golden moment pass now without hearing it ring full and she did not dare to think how short this day of happiness might be   iv  at the end of the fifth week there was a suspicion of spring in the wind as it swept the southern exposure of the valley february was drawing to a close and there was more than a suggestion of spring in the rapidly melting snow which still lay on the hills and under the cedars and tamaracks in the swamps patches of green grass appearing on the sunny side of the road where the snow had melted led to predictions of spring from the loafers beginning to sun themselves on the saltbarrels and shoeboxes outside the stores  a group sitting about the blacksmith shop were talking it  its an early seedinnow mark my words said troutt as he threw his knife into the soft ground at his feet the sun is crossing the line earlier this spring than it did last  yes an i heard a crow today makin that kind of aa spring noise that kind oi d know whatkind o goes all through a feller  and theres uncle sweeney an that settles it springs comin sure said troutt pointing at an old man much bent hobbling down the street like a symbolic figure of the old year  when he gits out the frogs aint fur behind  well be gittin on to the ground by next monday said sam dingley to a crowd who were seated on the newly painted harrows and seeders which svend  johnson had got out ready for the spring trade svend  johnsons agricultural implement depot was on the north side of the street and on a spring day the yard was one of the pleasantest loafing places that could be imagined especially if one wished company  albert wished to be alone something in the touch and tone of this spring afternoon made him restless and full of strange thoughts he took his way out along the road which followed the river bank and in the outskirts of the village threw himself down on a bank of grass which the snows had protected and which had already a tinge of green because of its wealth of sun  the willows had thrown out their tiny light green flags though their roots were under the ice and some of the hardwood twigs were tinged with red there was a faint peculiar but powerful odor of uncovered earth in the air and the touch of the wind was like a caress from a moist magnetic hand  the boy absorbed the light and heat of the sun as some wild thing might his hat over his face his hands folded on his breast he lay as still as a statue he did not listen at first he only felt but at length he rose on his elbow and listened the ice cracked and fell along the bank with a long hollow booming crash a crow cawed and a jay answered it from the willows below a flight of sparrows passed twittering innumerably the boy shuddered with a strange wistful longing and a realization of the flight of time  he could have wept he could have sung he only shuddered and lay silent under the stress of that strange sweet passion that quickened his heart deepened his eyes and made his breath come and go with a quivering sound across the dazzling blue arch of the sky the crow flapped sending down his prophetic jubilant note the wind as soft and sweet as april stirred in his hair the hills deep in their dusky blue seemed miles away and the voices of the carefree skaters on the melting ice of the river below came to the ear subdued to a unity with the scene  suddenly a fear seized upon the boya horror life life was passing life that can be lived only once and lost is lost forever life that fatal gift of the invisible powers to mana path with youth and joy and hope at its eastern gate and despair regret and death at its low western portal  the boy caught a glimpse of his real significancea gnat a speck in the sun a boy facing the millions of great and wise and wealthy he leaped up clasping his hands  oh i must work i mustnt stay here i must get back to my studies life is slipping by me and i am doing nothing being nothing  his face as pale as death absolutely shone with his passionate resolution and his hands were clinched in a silent inarticulate desire  but on his way back he met the jocund party of skaters going home from the river and with the easy shift and change of youth joined in their ringing laughter the weird power of the winds voice was gone and he was the unthinking boy again but the problem was only put off not solved  he had a suspicion of it one night when hartley said well pardner were getting most ready to pull out some way i always get restless when these warm days begin want o be moving some way  this was as sentimental as hartley ever got or if he ever felt more sentiment he concealed it carefully  i spose it must a been in spring that those old chaps on their steeds and in their steel shirts started out for the holy land or to rescue some damsel hey he ended with a grin now thats the way i feeljust like striking out for say oshkosh this has been a big strike here sures you live that little piece of lofty tumbling was a big boom and no mistake why your share o this campaign will be a hundred and twenty dollars sure  moren ive earned replied bert  no it aint youve done your duty like a man done as much in your way as i have now if you want to try another county with me say so ill make a thousand dollars this year out o this thing  i guess ill go back to school  all right dont blame you at all  i guess with what i can earn for father i can pull through the year i must get back im awfully obliged to you jim  thatll do on that said hartley shortly you dont owe me anything well finish delivery tomorrow and be ready to pull out on friday or sat  there was an acute pain in alberts breast somewhere he had not analyzed his case at all and did not now but the idea of going affected him strongly it had been so pleasant that daily return to a lovely girlish presence  yes sir hartley was going on im going to just quietly leave a book on her center table i dont know as itll interest her much but itll show we appreciate the grub and so on by jinks you dont seem to realize what a worker that woman is up five oclock in the morningby the way youve been going around with the girl a good deal and shes introduced you to some firstrate sales now if you want o leave her a little something make it a morocco copy and charge it to the firm  albert knew that he meant well but he couldnt somehow help saying ironically  thanks but i guess one copy of blaines twenty years will be enough in the house especially  well give her anything you please and charge it up to the firm i dont insist on blaine only suggested that because  i guess i can stand the expense of my own  i didnt say you couldnt man but i want a hand in this thing dont be so turrible keen t snap a feller up said hartley turning on him what the thunder is the matter of you anyway i like the girl and shes been good to us all round she tended you like an angel  there there thats enough o that put in albert hastily fr gods sake dont whang away on that string forever as if i didnt know it  hartley stared at him as he turned away  well by jinks what is the matter o you  he was too busy to dwell upon it much but concluded his partner was homesick  albert was beginning to have a vague underconsciousness of his real feeling toward the girl but he fought off the acknowledgment of it as long as possible his mind moved in a circle coming back to the one point ceaselesslya dreary prospect in which the slender girlfigure had no placeand each time the prospect grew more intolerably blank and the pain in his heart more acute and throbbing  when he faced her that night after they had returned from a final skating party down on the river he was as far from a solution as ever he had avoided all reference to their separation and now he stood as a man might at the parting of two paths saying i will not choose i can not choose i will wait for some sign some chance thing to direct me  they stood opposite each other each feeling that there was more to be said the girl tender her eyes cast down holding her hands to the fire he shivering but not with cold he had a vague knowledge of the vast importance of the moment and he hesitated to speak  its almost spring again isnt it and youve been here she paused and looked up with a daring smileseems as if youd been here always  it was about half past eight mrs welsh was setting her bread in the kitchen they could hear her moving about hartley was downtown finishing up his business  alberts throat grew dry and his limbs trembled his pause was ominous the girls smile died away as he took a seat without looking at her  well maud i supposeyou knowwere going away tomorrow  oh must you but youll come back  i dont expect toi dont see how  oh dont say that cried the girl her face as white as silver her clasped hands straining  i musti must he muttered not looking at her not daring to see her face  oh what can i dowe do without you i cant bear it  she stopped and sank back into a chair her breath coming heavily from her twitching lips the unnoticed tears falling from her staring pitiful wild appealing eyes her hands nervously twisting her gloves  there was a long silence each was undergoing a selfrevelation each was trying to face a future without the other  i must go he repeated aimlessly mechanically  the girls heavy breathing deepened into a wild little moaning sound inexpressibly pitiful her hungry eyes fixed on his face she gave way first and flung herself down upon her knees at his side her hands seeking his neck  albert i cant live without you now take me with you dont leave me  he stooped suddenly and took her in his arms raised her and kissed her hair  i didnt mean it maud ill never leave younever dont cry  she drew his face down to hers and kissed it then turned her face to his breast and laughed and cried there was a silence then joy and confidence came back again  i know now what you meant the girl cried gayly raising herself and looking into his face you were trying to scare me and make me show how much icared for youfirst there was a soft smile on her lips and a tender light in her eyes but i dont mind it  i guess i didnt know myself what i meant he said with a grave smile  when mrs welsh came in they were sitting on the sofa talking in low voices of their future he was grave and subdued while she was radiant with love and hope the future had no terrors for her all plans were good and successful now but the boy unconsciously felt the gravity of life somehow deepened by his love  why maud mrs welsh exclaimed what is  o mother im so happyjust as happy as a bird she cried rushing into her mothers arms  why whywhat is it youre crying dear  no im not im laughingsee  mrs welsh turned her dim eyes on the girl who shook the tears from her lashes with the action of a bird shaking water from its wings she seemed to shake off her trouble at the same moment mrs welsh understood perfectly  im very glad too dearie she said simply looking at the young man with motherly love irradiating her worn face albert went to her and she kissed him while the happy girl put her arms about them both in an ecstatic hug  now youve got a son mother  but ive lost a daughtermy firstborn  oh wait till you hear our plans  hes going to settle down herearent you albert  then they sat down all three and had a sweet intimate talk of an hour full of plans and hopes and confidences  at last he kissed the radiant girl good night and going into his own room sat down by the stove and watching the flicker of the flames through the chinks pondered on the change that had come into his life  already he sighed with the stress of care the press of thought which came upon him the longing uneasiness of the boy had given place to another unrestthe unrest of the man who must face the world in earnest now planning for food and shelter and all plans included maud  to go back to school was out of the question to expect help from his father overworked and burdened with debt was impossible he must go to work and go to work to aid her a living must be wrung from this town all the home and all the property mrs welsh had were here and wherever maud went the mother must follow she could not live without her  he was in the midst of the turmoil when hartley came in humming the mulligan guards  in the dark hey  completely in the dark  well light up light up  im trying to  what the deuce do you mean by that tone whats been going on here since my absence  albert did not reply and hartley shuffled about after a match lighted the lamp threw his coat and hat in the corner and then said  well ive got everything straightened up been freezing out old daggett the old skeesix has been promisin fr a week and i just said old man ill camp right down with you here till you fork over and he did by the way everybody i talked with today about leaving said whats lohr going to do with that girl i told em i didnt know do you it seems youve been thickern i supposed  im going to marry her said albert calmly but his voice sounded strangely alien  whats that yelled hartley  sh dont raise the neighbors im going to marry her he spoke quietly but there was a peculiar numbness creeping over him  well by jinks when say looky here well i swanny exclaimed hartley helplessly when  right away some time this summerjune maybe  hartley thrust his hands into his trousers pockets stretched out his legs and stared at his friend in vast amaze  youre givin me guff  im in dead earnest  i thought you was going through college all so fast  well ive made up my mind it aint much use to try replied albert listlessly  what y goin t do here or are y goin t take the girl away with yeh  she cant leave her mother well run this boarding house for the present ill try for the principalship of the school here raff is going to resign he says if i cant get that ill get into a law office here dont worry about me  but why go into this so quick why not put it off fifteen or twenty years asked hartley trying to get back to cheerful voice  what would be the use at the end of a year id be just about as poor as i am now  cant yr father step in and help you  no there are three boys and two girls all younger than i to be looked out for and he has all he can carry besides she needs me right here and right now two delicate women struggling along suppose one of em should fall sick i tell you they need me and if i can do anything to make life easy or easier im going t do it besides he ended in a peculiar tone we dont feel as if we could live apart much longer  but great scott man you cant  now hold on jim ive thought this thing all over and ive made up my mind it aint any use to go on talking about it what good would it do me to go to school another year come out without a dollar and no more fitted for earning a living for her than i am now and besides all that i couldnt draw a free breath thinking of her here workin away to keep things moving liable at any minute to break down  hartley gazed at him in despair and with something like awe it was a tremendous transformation in the young ambitious student he felt in a way responsible for the calamity and that he ought to use every effort to bring the boy to his senses  like most men in america and especially western men he still clung to the idea that a man was entirely responsible for his success or failure in life he had not admitted that conditions of society might be so adverse that only men of most exceptional endowments and willing and able to master many of the best and deepest and most sacred of their inspirations and impulses could succeed  of the score of specially promising young fellows who had been with him at school seventeen had dropped out and down most of them had married and gone back to farming or to earn a precarious living in the small dull towns where farmers trade and traders farm conditions were too adverse they simply weakened and slipped slowly back into dullness and an oxlike or else a fretful patience thinking of these men and thinking their failure due to themselves alone hartley could not endure the idea of his friend adding one more to the list of failures he sprang up at last  say bert you might just as well hang yrself and done with it why its suicide i cant allow it i started in at college bravely and failed because id let it go too long i couldnt studycouldnt get down to it but youwhy old man id bet on you he had a tremor in his voice i hate like thunder to see you give up your plans say you cant afford to do this its too much to pay  no it aint  i say it is what do you get in  i think so much o her that  oh nonsense youd get over this in a week  jim called albert warningly sharply  all right said jim in the tone of a man who felt that it was all wrongall right but the timell come when youll wish idyou aint doin the girl enough good to make up for the harm youre doin yourself he broke off again and said in a tone of peculiar meaning im done im all through and i cn see youre through with jim hartley why bert look hereno all right  darn curious he muttered to himself that boy should get caught just at this time and not with some one o those girls in marion well its none o my funeral he ended with a sigh for it had stirred him to the bottom of his sunny nature after all a dozen times as he lay there beside his equally sleepless companion he started to say something more in deprecation of the step but each time stifled the opening word into a groan  it would not be true to say that love had come to albert lohr as a relaxing influence but it had changed the direction of his energies so radically as to make his whole life seem weaker and lower as long as his lovedreams went out toward a vague and ideal woman supposedly higher and grander than himself he was spurred on to face the terrible sheer escarpment of social eminence but when he met by accident the actual woman who was to inspire his future efforts the difficulties he faced took on solid reality  his aspirations fell to the earth their wings clipped and became perforce submissive beasts at the plow the force that moved so much of his thought was transformed into other energy whether it were a wise step or not he did not know he certainly knew it was right  the table was very gay at dinner next day maud was standing at the highest point of her girlhood dreams her flushed face and shining eyes made her seem almost a child and hartley wondered at her and relented a little in the face of such happiness her face was turned to albert in an unconscious beautiful way she had nothing to conceal now  mrs welsh was happy too but a little tearful in an unobtrusive way troutt had his jokes of course not very delicate but of good intention in fact they were as flags and trumpets to the young people mrs welsh had confided in him telling him to be secret but the finesse of his joking could not fail to reveal everything he knew  but maud cared little she was filled with a sort of tender boldness and albert in the delight of the hour gave himself up wholly to a trust in the future and to the fragrance and music of love  theyre gay as larks now thought hartley to himself as he joined in the laughter but that wont help em any ten years from now  he could hardly speak next day as he shook hands at the station with his friend  goodby ol man i hope itll come out all right but im afraidbut there i promised not to say anything about it goodby till we meet in congress he ended in a lamentable attempt at being funny  cant you come to the wedding jim weve decided on june you see they need a man around the house so weyoull come wont you old fellow and dont mind my being a little crusty last night  oh yes ill come jim said in a tone which concealed a desire to utter one more protest  its no use that ends him sures im a thief hes jumped into a hole and pulled the hole in after him a man cant marry a family like that at his age and pull out of it he may but i doubt it well as i remarked before its none o my funeral so long as hes satisfied  but he said it with a painful lump in his throat and he could not bring himself to feel that alberts course was right and felt himself to be somehow culpable in the case     an alien in the pines  i   a man and a woman were pacing up and down the wintry station platform waiting for a train on every side the snow lay a stained and crumpled blanket with here and there a light or a chimney to show the village sleeping beneath  the sky was a purpleblack hemisphere out of which the stars glittered almost white the wind came out of the west cold but amiable the cracked bell of a switch engine gurgled querulously at intervals followed by the bumping of coupling freight cars roosters were crowing and sleepy train men were assembling in sullen silence  the couple walked with arms locked like lovers but the tones of their voices had the quality which comes after marriage they were man and wife  the womans clear voice arose o ed isnt this delicious what one misses by not getting up early  sleep for instance laughed her husband  dont drag me down you know what i mean lets get up early every morning while were up here in the woods  shouldnt wonder if we had to therell be a lot to do and i want to get back to chicago by the 1st of february  this is an experience isnt it still when is our train due  due now i think that is our headlight up the track  as he spoke an engine added its voice to the growing noise of the station and drew solemnly down the frosty steel  an eruption of shapeless forms of men from the depot filled the one general coach of the train they nearly all were dressed in some sort of fur coat and all had the look of men accustomed to outdoor lifepowerful loudvoiced unrefined they were in fact traveling men business men the owners of mills or timber the stolid or patient oxlike faces of some norwegian workmen dressed in gay mackinac jackets were sprinkled about  the young wife was a fine type of woman anywhere but these surroundings made her seem very dainty and startlingly beautiful her husband had the fair skin of a city man but his powerful shoulders and firm step denoted health and wholesome living they were good to see as man and wife  they soon felt the reaction to sleepiness which comes to those not accustomed to early rising and the wife soothed by the clank of the train leaned her head on her husbands shoulder and dozed he looked out upon the landscape glad that his wife was not observing it he did not know such desolation existed in wisconsin  on every side were the evidences of a ruined forest land a landscape of flat wastes of thinned and burned and uprooted trees a desolate and apparently useless land  here and there a sawmill stood gray and sagging surrounded by little cabins of unpainted wood to testify to the time when great pines stood all about and the ring of the swampers axe was heard in the intervals of silence between the howls of a saw  to the north the swells grew larger birch and tamarack swamps alternated with dry ridges on which an inferior pine still grew the swamps were dense tangles of broken and uprooted trees slender pikelike stumps of firedevastated firs rose here and there black and grim skeletons of trees  it was a land that had been sheared by the axe torn by the winds and blasted by fire  off to the west low blue ridges rose marking the boundaries of the valley which had been washed out ages ago by water after the floods it had sprung up to pine forests and these in their turn had been sheared away by man it lay now awaiting the plow and seeder of the intrepid pioneer  suddenly the wife roused up why we havent had any breakfast  he smiled at her childish look of bewilderment ive been painfully aware of it for some time back ive been suffering for food while you slept  why didnt you get into the basket  how could i with you on my manly bosom  she colored up a little they had not been married long evidently  they were soon eating a breakfast with the spirit of picnickers occasionally she looked out of the window  what a wild country she said he did not emphasize its qualities to her rather he distracted her attention from the desolation  the train roared round its curves conforming with the general course of the river on every hand were thickening signs of active lumber industry they flashed by freight trains loaded with logs or lumber or ties mills in operation grew thicker  the car echoed with the talk of lumber a brisk man with a red mustache was exhibiting a model of a machine to cut certain parts of machinery out of two by fours another was describing a new shingle mill he had just built  a couple of elderly men one a german were discussing the tariff on lumber the workmen mainly sat silent  its all so strange the young wife said again and again  yes it isnt exactly the lake shore drive  i like it i wish i could smell the pines  youll have all the pines you can stand before we get back to chicago  no sir im going to enjoy every moment of it and youre going to let me help you knowlook over papers and all that im the heiress you must remember she said wickedly  well we wont quarrel about that until we see how it all turns out it may not be worth my time up here i shall charge you roundly as your lawyer depend on that  the outlook grew more attractive as the train sped on old mosinee rose a fine rounded blue shape on the left  why theres a mountain i didnt know wisconsin had such a mountain as that  neither did i this valley is fine now if your uncles estates only included that hill  the valley made off to the northwest with a bold large and dignified movement the coloring blue and silver purplebrown and bronzegreen was suitable to the grouping of lines it was all fresh and vital wholesome and very impressive  from this point the land grew wilderthat is more primeval there was more of nature and less of man the scar of the axe was here and there but the forest predominated the ridges of pine foliages broke against the sky miles and miles in splendid sweep  this must be lovely in summer the wife said again and again as they flashed by some lake set among the hills  its fine now he replied feeling the thrill of the sportsman id like to shoulder a rifle and plunge into those snowy vistas how it brings the wild spirit out in a man women never feel that delight  oh yes we do she replied glad that something remained yet unexplained between them we feel just like men only we havent the strength of mind to demand a share of it with you  yes you feel it at this distance youd come back mighty quick the second night out  she did not relish his laughter and so looked away out of the window just think of ituncle edwin lived here thirty years  he forbore to notice her inconsistency yes the wilderness is all right for a vacation but i prefer chicago for the year round  when they came upon ridgeley both cried out with delight  oh what a dear picturesque little town she said  well well i wonder how they came to build a town without a row of battlemented stores  it lay among and upon the sharp low stumpy pine ridges in haphazard fashion like a swiss village a small brook ran through it smothered here and there in snow a sawmill was the largest figure of the town and the railway station was the center there was not an inch of painted board in the village everywhere the clear yellow of the pine flamed unstained by time lumber piles filled all the lower levels near the creek evidently the town had been built along logging roads and there was something grateful and admirable in its irregular arrangement the houses moreover were all modifications of the logging camps even the drug store stood with its side to the street all about were stumps and fringes of pines which the lumbermen for some good reason had passed by charred boles stood purpleblack out of the snow  it was all green and gray and blue and yellowwhite and wild the sky was not more illimitable than the rugged forest which extended on every hand  oh this is gloriousglorious said the wife do i own some of this town she asked as they rose to go out  i reckon you do  oh im so glad  as they stepped out on the platform a large man in corduroy and wolfskin faced them like a bandit  hello ed  hello jack well weve found you my wife mr ridgeley weve come up to find out how much youve embezzled he said as ridgeley pulled off an immense glove to shake hands all round  well come right over to the hotel it aint the auditorium but then again it aint like sleeping outdoors  as they moved along they heard the train go off and then the sound of the saw resumed its domination of the village noises  was the town named after you or you after the town asked field  named after me old man didnt want it named after him would kill it he said  mr and mrs field found the hotel quite comfortable and the dinner wholesome they beamed upon each other  its going to be delightful they said  ridgeley was a bachelor and found his home at the hotel also that night he said now well go over the papers and records of your uncles property and then well go out and see if the property is all there i imagine this is to be a searching investigation  you may well think it my wife is inexorable  as night fell the wife did not feel so safe and well pleased the loud talking in the office below and the occasional whooping of a crowd of mill hands going by made her draw her chair nearer and lay her fingers in her husbands palm  he smiled indulgently dont be frightened my dear these men are not half so bad as they sound   ii  mrs field sat in the inner room of ridgeleys office waiting for the return of her husband with the team they were going out for a drive  ridgeley was working at his books and he had forgotten her presence  she could not but feel a deep admiration for his powerful frame and his quick absorbed action as he moved about from his safe to his desk he was a man of great force and ready decision  suddenly the door opened and a man entered he had a sullen and bitter look on his thin dark face ridgeleys quick eyes measured him and his hand softly turned the key in his money drawer and as he faced about he swung shut the door of the safe  the stranger saw all this with eyes as keen as ridgeleys a cheerless and strange smile came upon his face  dont be alarmed he said im low but i aint as low as that  well sir what can i do for you asked ridgeley mrs field half rose and her heart beat terribly she felt something tense and strange in the attitude of the two men  but the man only said you can give me a job if you want to  ridgeley remained alert he ran his eyes over the mans tall frame he looked strong and intelligent although his eyes were fevered and dull  what kind of a job  any kind that will take me out into the woods and keep me there the man replied  there was a selfaccusing tone in his voice that ridgeley felt  whats your object you look like a man who could do something else what brings you here  the man turned with a sudden resolution to punish himself his voice expressed a terrible loathing  whisky thats what its a hell of a thing to say but i cant let liquor alone when i can smell it im no common hand or i wouldnt be if ibut let that go i can swing an axe and im ready to work thats enough now the question is can you find a place for me  ridgeley mused a little the young fellow stood there statuesque rebellious  then ridgeley said i guess i can help you out that much he picked up a card and a pencil what shall i call you  oh call me williams that aint my name but itll do  what you been doing  everything part of the time drinking the rest was in a livery stable down at wausau last week it came over me when i woke yesterday that i was gone to hell if i stayed in town so i struck out and i dont care for myself but ive got a woman to look out for he stopped abruptly his recklessness of mood had its limits after all  ridgeley penciled on a card give this to the foreman of no 6 the men over at the mill will show you the teams  the man started toward the door with the card in his hand he turned suddenly  one thing more i want you to send ten dollars of my pay every two weeks to this address he took an envelope out of his pocket it dont matter what i say or do after this i want that money sent the rest will keep me in tobacco and clothing you understand  ridgeley nodded perfectly ive seen such cases before  the man went out and down the walk with a hurried determined air as if afraid of his own resolution  as ridgeley turned toward his desk he met mrs field who faced him with tears of fervent sympathy in her eyes  isnt it awful she said in a half whisper poor fellow what will become of him  oh i dont know hell get along some way such fellows do ive had em before they try it a while here then they move i cant worry about them  mrs field was not listening to his shifty words and then think of his wifehow she must worry  ridgeley smiled perhaps its his mother or a sister  anyway its awful cant something be done for him  i guess weve done about all that can be done  oh i wish i could help him ill tell ed about him  dont worry about him mrs field he aint worth it  oh yes he is i feel hes been a good boy once and then hes so selfaccusing  her own happiness was so complete she could not bear to think of others misery she told her husband about williams and ended by asking cant we do anything to help the poor fellow  field was not deeply concerned no hes probably past help such men are so set in their habits nothing but a miracle or hypnotism can save them hell end up as a lumber jack as the townsmen call the hands in the camps  but he isnt that edward hes finer some way you feel he is ask mr ridgeley  ridgeley merely said yes he seemed to me to be more than a common hand but all the same it wont be two weeks before hell be in here as drunk as a wild cat wanting to shoot me for holding back his money  in this way williams came to be to mrs field a very important figure in the landscape of that region she often spoke of him and on the following saturday night when field came home she anxiously asked is williams in town  no he hasnt shown up yet  she clapped her hands in delight good good hes going to win his fight  field laughed dont bet on williams too soon well hear from him before the week is out  when are we going to visit the camp she asked changing the subject  as soon as it warms up a little it is too cold for you  she had a laugh at him you were the one who wanted to plunge into the snowy vistas  he evaded her joke on him by assuming a careless tone im not plunging as much as i was the snow is too deep  when you go i want to go with youi want to see williams  ha he snorted melodramatically she scorns me faithful heart she turns  mrs field smiled faintly dont joke about it ed i cant get that wife out of my mind   iii  a few very cold gray days followed and then the north wind cleared the sky and though it was still cold it was pleasant the sky had only a small white cloud here and there to make its blueness the more profound  ridgeley dashed up to the door with a hardy little pair of bronchos hitched to a light pair of bobs and mrs field was tucked in like a babe in a cradle  almost the first thing she asked was how is williams  oh hes getting on nicely he refused to sleep with his bunk mate and finally had to lick him i understand to shut him up challenged the whole camp then to let him alone or take a licking they let him alone lawson saysglang there you rats  mrs field said no more for the air was whizzing by her ears and she hardly dared look out so keen was the wind but as soon as they entered the deeps of the forest it was profoundly still  the ride that afternoon was a glory she never forgot everywhere yellowgreens and purple shadows the sun in a burnished blue sky flooded the forests with light striking down through even the thickest pines to lay in fleckings of radiant white and gold upon the snow  the trail it was not a road ran like a graceful furrow over the hills around little lakes covered deep with snow through tamarack swamps where the tracks of wild things thickened over ridges of tall pine clear of brush and curving everywhere amid stumps where dismantled old shanties marked the site of the older logging camps sometimes they met teams going to the store sometimes they crossed logging roadswide smooth tracks artificially iced down which mountainous loads of logs were slipping creaking and groaning sometimes they heard the dry clickclock of the woodsmens axes or the crash of falling trees deep in the wood when they reached the first camp ridgeley pulled up the steaming horses at the door and shouted hello the camp  a tall old man with a long red beard came out he held one bare red arm above his eyes he wore an apron  hello sandy  hello mr ridgeley  ready for company  am always ready for company he said with a scotch accent  well were coming in to get warm  vera wal  as they went in under the roofed shed between the cooks shanty and the other and larger shanty mrs field sniffed sandy led them past a large pyramid composed of the scraps of beef bones eggshells cans and tea grounds left over during the winter in the shed itself hung great slabs of beef  it was as untidy and suggestive of slaughter as the nest of a brood of eagles  sandy was beginning dinner on a huge stove spotted with rust and pancake batter all about was the litter of his preparation beefbeef on all sides and tin dishes and bare benches and huge iron cooking pans  mrs field was glad to get out into the sunlight again  what a horrible place are they all like that  no my camps are not like thator i should say our camps ridgeley added with a smile  not a gay place at all said field in exaggerated reserve  but mrs field found her own camps not much better true the refuse was not raised in pyramidal shape before the front door and the beef was a little more orderly but the low log huts the dim cold light the dingy walls and floors the lack of any womanly or home touch the tin dishes the wholesale cooking all struck upon her with terrible force  do human beings live here she asked ridgeley when he opened the door of the main shanty of no 6  forty creatures of the men kind sleep and house here he replied  to which the socks and things give evidence said field promptly pointing toward the huge stove which sat like a rustyred cheese in the center of the room above it hung scores of ragged gray and red socks and mackinac boots and jackets which had been washed by the men themselves  around were the grimy bunks where the forty men slept like tramps in a steamers hold the quilts were grimy and the posts greasy and shining with the touch of hands there were no chairsonly a kind of rude stool made of boards there were benches near the stove nailed to the rough floor in each bunk hanging to a peg was the poor little imitationleather handbag which contained the whole wardrobe of each man exclusive of the tattered socks and shirts hanging over the stove  the room was chill and cold and gray it had only two small windows its doors were low even mrs field was forced to stoop in entering this made it seem more like a den there were roller towels in the corner and washbasins and a grindstone which made it seem like a barn it was in fact more cheerless than the barn and less wholesome  doesnt that hay in the bunks get aasometimes asked field  well yes i shouldnt wonder though the men are pretty strict about that they keep pretty free from that i think however i shouldnt want to run no river chances on the thing myself ridgeley smiled at mrs fields shudder of horror  is this the place the men laughed she had asked that question so many times before  yes this is where mr williams hangs outsay field youll need to make some new move to hold your end up against williams  mrs field felt hurt and angry at his rough joke in the dim corner a cough was heard and a yellow head raised itself over the bunk board ghastily his big blue eyes fixed themselves on the lovely woman and he wore a look of childish wonder  hello gusdidnt see you whats the mattersick  yah ai baen hwick two days ai tank ai lack to hav doketer  all right ill send him up what seems the matter  as they talked mrs field again chilled with the cold gray comfortlessness of it all to be sick in such a place the strange appearance of the man out of his grim corner was startling she was glad when they drove out into the woods again where the clear sunshine fell and the pines stood against the blazing winter sky motionless as iron trees her pleasure in the ride was growing less to her delicate sense this life was sordid not picturesque she wondered how williams endured it they arrived at no 8 just as the men were trailing down the road to work after eating their dinner their gaycolored jackets of mackinac wool stood out like trumpet notes in the prevailing white and blue and bronze green  the boss and the scaler came out and met them and after introductions they went into the shanty to dinner the cook was a deft young norwegiana clean quick gentlemanly young fellow with a fine brown mustache he cleared a place for them at one end of the long table and they sat down  it was a large camp but much like the others on the table were the same cheap iron forks the tin plates and the small tin basins for tea which made up the dinner set basins of brown sugar stood about  good gracious do people still eat brown sugar why i havent seen any of that for ages cried mrs field  the stew was good and savory and the bread fair the tea was not all clover but it tasted of the tin mrs field said  beef beef everywhere beef one might suppose a menagerie of desert animals ate here edward we must make things more comfortable for our men they must have cups to drink out of these basins are horrible  it was humorous to the men this housewifely suggestion  oh make it napkins allie  you can laugh but i shant rest after seeing this if you thought i was going to say oh how picturesque youre mistaken i think its barbarous  she was getting impatient of their patronizing laughter as if she were a child they changed their manner to one of acquiescence but thought of her as a child just the same  after dinner they all went out to see the crew working it was the biggest crew anywhere in the neighborhood and they sat a long while and watched the men at work ridgeley got out and hitched the team to a tree and took field up to the skidway mrs field remained in the sleigh however  near her the swamping team a span of big deepred oxen came and went among the green tops of the fallen pines they crawled along their trails in the snow like some strange machinery and the boy in a blue jacket moved almost as listlessly somewhere in the tangle of refuse boughs the swampers axes clickclocked saws uttered their grating rhythmic snarl and great trees at intervals shivered groaned and fell with soft rushing cracking sweeps into the deep snow and the swampers swarmed upon them like lilliputians attacking a giant enemy  there was something splendid though tragic in the work but the thought of the homelessness of the men their terrible beds and their long hours of toil oppressed the delicate and refined woman she began to take on culpability she was partly in authority now and this system must be changed she was deep in plans for change in shanties and in sleeping places when the men returned  ridgeley was saying no we control about thirty thousand acres of pine as good as that it aint what it was twenty years ago but its worth money after all  it was getting near to dark as they reached no 6 again and ridgeley drew up and helped them out and into the cooks shanty  mrs field was introduced to the cook a short rather sullen but intelligent man he stood over the redhot stove laying great slices of beef in a huge drippingpan he had a taffler or assistant in the person of a halfgrown boy at whom he jerked rough orders like hunks of stove wood some hit the boy and produced noticeable effects others did not  meanwhile a triumphant sunset was making the west one splendor of purple and orange and crimson which came over the cool green rim of the pines like the valhalla march in wagner  mrs field sat there in the dim room by the window seeing that splendor flush and fade and thinking how dangerous it was to ask where ones wealth comes from in the world outside the voices of the men thickened they were dropping in by twos and fours with teams and on foot  the assistant arranged the basins in rows and put one of the iron forks and knives on each side of each plate and filled the sugarbasins and dumped in the cold beans and split the bread into slabs and put small pots of tea here and there ready for the hands of the men  at last when the big pans of toast the big plates of beef were placed steaming on the table the cook called field and ridgeley and said  set right here at the end he raised his arm to a ring which dangled on a wire now look out youll see em come sidewise he jerked the ring and disappeared into the kitchen  there came shouts trampling laughter and the door burst open and they streamed innorwegians french halfbreeds darkskinned fellows all of them save the norwegians they came like a flood but they fell silent at sight of a woman so beautiful and strange to them  all words ceased they sank into place beside the table with the thump of falling sandbags they were all in their shirt sleeves but they were cleanly washed and the most of them had combed their hair but they seemed very wild and hairy to mrs field she looked at her husband and ridgeley with a grateful pleasure it was so restful to have them on each side of her  the men ate like hungry dogs they gorged in silence nothing was heard but the clank of knives on tin plates the drop of heavy plates of food and the occasional muttered words of some one asking for the bread and the gravy  as they ate they furtively looked with great curiosity and admiration up at the dainty woman their eyes were bright and large and gleamed out of the obscure brown of their dimly lighted faces with savage intensityso it seemed to mrs field and she dropped her eyes upon her plate  her husband and ridgeley entered into conversation with those sitting near ridgeley seemed on good terms with them all and ventured a joke or word at which they laughed with terrific energy and fell as suddenly silent again  as mrs field looked up the second time she saw the dark strange face of williams a few places down and opposite her his eyes were fixed on her husbands hands with a singular intensity her eyes followed his and the beauty of her husbands hands came to her again with new force they were perfectly shaped supple warmcolored and strong their color and deftness stood out in vivid contrast to the heavy brown cracked and calloused pawlike hands of the men  why should williams study her husbands hands if he had looked at her she would not have been surprised the other men she could read they expressed either frank simple admiration or furtive desire but this man looked at her husband and his eyes fell often upon his own hands which trembled with fatigue he handled his knife clumsily and yet she could see he too had a fine handa slender powerful hand like that people call an artist handa craftsmanlike hand  he saw her looking at him and he flashed one enigmatical glance into her eyes and rose to go out  how you getting on williams ridgeley asked  williams resented his question oh im all right he said sullenly  the meal was all over in an incredibly short time one by one two by two they rose heavily and lumbered out with one last wistful look at mrs field she will never know how seraphic she seemed sitting there amid those rough surroundingsthe dim red light of the kerosene lamp falling across her clear pallor out of which her dark eyes shone with liquid softness made deeper and darker by her halfsorrowful tenderness for these homeless fellows  an hour later as they were standing at the door just ready to take to their sleigh they heard the scraping of a fiddle  oh some one is going to play mrs field cried with visions of the rollicking good times she had heard so much about and of which she had seen nothing so far cant i look in  ridgeley was dubious ill go and see he said and entered the door boys mrs field wants to look in a minute go on with your fiddling samonly i wanted to see that you werent sitting around in dishabill  this seemed a good joke and they all howled and hawhawed gleefully  so go right ahead with your evening prayers all butyou understand  all right captain said sam the man with the fiddle  when mrs field looked in two men were furiously grinding axes several were sewing on ragged garments all were smoking some were dressing chapped or bruised fingers the atmosphere was horrible the socks and shirts were steaming above the huge stove the smoke and stench for a moment were sickening but ridgeley pushed them just inside the door  its better out of the draught  sam jigged away on the violin the men kept time with the cranks of the grindstone and all hands looked up with their best smile at mrs field most of them shrank a little from her look like shy animals  ridgeley threw open the window in the old days he explained to mrs field we used a fireplace and that kept the air better  as her sense of smell became deadened the air seemed a little more tolerable to mrs field  oh we must change all this she said it is horrible  play us a tune said sam extending the violin to field he did not think field could play it was merely a shot in the dark on his part  field took it and looked at it and sounded it on every side the men turned face in eager expectancy  he can play that feller  ill bet he can he handles her as if he knew her  you bet your lifetune up cap  williams came from the obscurity somewhere and looked over the shoulders of the men  down in front somebody called and the men took seats on the benches leaving field standing with the violin in hand he smiled around upon them in a frank pleased way quite ready to show his skill he played annie laurie and a storm of applause broke out  hooray bully for you  sam youre out of it  sam your name is mud  give us another cap  it aint the same fiddle  he played again some simple tune and he played it with the touch which showed the skilled amateur as he played mrs field noticed a grave restlessness on williamss part he moved about uneasily he gnawed at his finger nails his eyes glowed with a singular fire his hands drummed and fingered at last he approached and said roughly  let me take that fiddle a minute  oh cheese it williams the men cried let the other man play  what do you want to do with the fiddlethink its a music box asked sam its owner  go to hell said williams as field gave the violin over to him his hands seemed to tremble with eagerness  he raised his bow and struck into an imposing brilliant strain and the men fell back in astonishment  well ill be damned gasped the owner of the violin  keep quiet sam  mrs field looked at her husband why ed he is playing sarasate  thats what he is he returned slangily too much astonished to do more than gaze williams played on  there was a faint defect in the high notes as if his fingers did not touch the strings properly but his bow action showed cultivation and breadth of feeling as he struck into one of those difficult octaveleaping movements his face became savage on the e string a squeal broke forth he flung the violin into sams lap with a ferocious curse and then extending his hands hard crooked to fit the axehelve calloused and chapped he said to field  look at my cursed hands lovely things to play with aint they  his voice trembled with passion he turned and went outside as he passed mrs field his head was bowed and he was uttering a groaning cry like one suffering acute physical agony  she went out quickly and field and ridgeley followed they were all movedbut the men made little of it seeing how deeply touched she was  thats what drink does for a man ridgeley said as they watched williams disappear down the swampers trail  that man has been a violinist said field whats he doing up here  came up to get away from himself ridgeley replied  im afraid hes failed said field as he put his arm about his wife and led her to the sleigh  the ride home was made mainly in silence oh the splendid silence the woman kept saying in her heart oh the splendid moonlight the marvelous radiance everywhere a heavenly serenitynot a footstep not a bell not a cry not a cracking treenothing but vivid light white snow dappled and lined with shadows and trees etched against a starlit sky splendor of light and sheen and shadow wide wastes of snow so white the stumps stood like columns of charcoal a night of natures making when she is tired of noise and blare of color  and in the midst of it stood the camps and the reek of obscenity foul odors and tobacco smoke to which a tortured soul must return   iv  the following saturday afternoon as ridgeley and field entered the office williams rose to meet them he looked different finer some way field imagined at any rate he was perfectly sober he was freshly shaven and though his clothes were rough he looked like a man of education his manner was cold and distant  id like to be paid off mr ridgeley he said i guess whats left of my pay will take me out of this  where do you propose to go ridgeley said kindly  williams must have perceived his kindliness for he answered im going home to my wife i am going to try it once more  after williams went out field said i wonder if hell do it  oh i shouldnt wonder ive seen men brace up just as mysteriously as that and stay right by their resolutions i thought he didnt look like a common lumber jack when he came in  oh how happy his wife will be mrs field cried when she heard of williamss resolution shell save him yet  well i dont know depends on what kind of a woman she is     the owner of the mill farm   beyond his necessity a tired man is not apt to be polite this mrs miner had generalized from long experience with her husband she knew at a distance by the way he wore his hat when he came in out of the field whether he was in a peculiarly savage mood or only in his usual state of sullen indifference  as he came in out of the barn on this spring day he turned to look up at the roof with a curse something had angered him he did not stop to comb his hair after washing at the pump but came into the neat kitchen and surlily took a seat at the table  mrs miner a slender little woman quite ladylike in appearance had the dinner all placed in steaming abundance upon the table and the children sitting side by side watched their father in silence there was an air of foreboding of apprehension over them all as if they feared some brutal outbreak on his part  he placed his elbows on the table his sleeves were rolled up displaying his red and much sunburned arms he wore no coat and his face was sullen and held besides a certain vicious quality like that of a badtempered dog  he had not spoken to his wife directly for many weeks for years it had been his almost constant habit to address her through the children by calling her she or your mother he had done this so long that even the little ones were startled when he said looking straight at her  say what are you going to do about that roof  mrs miner turned her large gray eyes upon him in sudden confusion excuse me tom i didnt  i said what you goin t do with that roof he repeated brutally  what roof she asked timidly  what roof he repeated after her why the barn of course its leakin and rottin my oats its none o my business he went on his voice containing an undercurrent of vicious insult only i thought youd like to know its worse than ever you can do as you like about it he said again and there was a peculiar tone in his voice as if by using that tone he touched her upon naked nerves somewhere i guess i can cover the oats up  a stranger would not have known what it all meant and yet there was something in what he said that made his wife turn white but she answered quietly  ill send word to the carpenter this forenoon im sorry she went on the tears coming to her eyes she turned away and looked out of the window while he ate on indifferently at last she turned with a sudden impulse o tom why cant we be friends again for the childrens sake you ought to  oh shut up he snarled good god cant you let a thing rest suits me well enough i aint complainin so just shut up  he rose with a slam and went out the two children sat with hushed breath they knew him too well to cry out  mrs miner sat for a long time at the table without moving at last she rose and went sighfully at work morty i want you to run down to mr wilbers and ask him to come up and see me about some work she stood at the window and watched the boy as he stepped lightly down the road how much he looks like his father in spite of his sunny temper she thought and it was not altogether a pleasant thing to think of though she did not allow such a thought to take definite shape  the young carpenter whom wilber sent to fill mrs miners order walked with the gay feet of youth as he passed out of the little town toward the river when he came to the bridge he paused and studied the scene with slow delighted eyes the water came down over its dam with a leap of buoyant joy as if leaping to freedom over the dam it lay in a quiet pool mirroring every bud and twig below it curved away between low banks with bushes growing to the waters edge where the pickerel lay  but the young man seemed to be saddened by the view of the mill which had burned some years before it seemed like the charred body of a living thing this heap of blackened and twisted shafts and pulleys lying half buried in tangles of weeds  it appealed so strongly to young morris that he uttered an unconscious sigh as he walked on across the bridge and clambered the shelving road which was cut out of the yellow sandstone of the hillside  the road wound up the sandy hillside and came at length to a beautiful broad terrace of farm land that stretched back to the higher bluffs the house toward which the young fellow turned was painted white and had the darkgreen blinds which transplanted newenglanders carry with them wherever they go  soldierly lombardy poplar trees stood in the yard and beds of flowers lined the walk mrs miner was at work in the beds when he came up  good day he said cordially glorious spring weather isnt it he smiled pleasantly is this mrs miner  yes sir she looked at him wonderingly  im one of wilbers men he explained he couldnt get away so he sent me up to see what needed doing  oh she said with a relieved tone very well will you go look at it  they walked side by side out toward the barn which had the look of great age in its unpainted decay it was gray as granite and worn fuzzy with sleet and snow the young fellow looked around at the grass the dandelions the vague and beautiful shadows flung down upon the turf by the scant foliage of the willows and apple trees and took off his hat as if in the presence of something holy what a lovely place he saidall but the mill down there it seems too bad it burnt up i hate to see a ruin most of all one of a mill she looked at him in surprise perceiving that he was not at all an ordinary carpenter he had a thoughtful face and the workmans dress he wore could not entirely conceal a certain delicacy of limb his voice had a touch of cultivation in it  the work i want done is on the barn she said at length do you think it needs reshingling  he looked up at it critically his head still bare she was studying him carefully now and admired his handsome profile there was something fine and powerful in the poise of his head  you havent been working for mr wilber long she said  he turned toward her with a smile of gratification as if he knew she had detected something out of the ordinary in him  no im just out of beloit he said with ready confidence you see that im one of these fellows who have to work my passage i put in my vacations at my trade he looked up at the roof again as if checking himself yes i should think from here that it would have to be reshingled  she sighed resignedly and he knew she was poor well i suppose you had better do it  she thought of him pleasantly as he walked off down the road after the lumber and tools that were necessary and in his turn he wondered whether she were a widow or not it promised to be a pleasant job she was quite handsome in a serious way he decidedvery womanly and dignified perhaps this was his romance he thought with the ready imagination upon this point of a youth of twentyone  he returned soon with a german teamster who helped him unload his lumber and erect his stagings when noon came he was working away on the roof tearing the old shingles off with a spade  he was a little uncertain about his dinner it was the custom to board carpenters when they were working on a farm but this farm was so near town possibly mrs miner would not think it necessary he decided however to wait till one oclock to be sure at half past twelve a man came in out of the field with a teama short man with curly hair curly chin beard and mustache he walked with a little swagger and his legs were slightly bowed morris called him a little feller and catalogued him by the slant on his hat  say called morris suddenly wont you come up here and help me raise my staging  the man looked up with a muttered curse of surprise who the hell y take me for hired man he asked and then after a moment continued in a tone which was an insult you dont want to rip off the whole broad side of that roof aint y got any sense come a rain itll raise hell with my hay  it aint going to rain morris replied he wanted to give him a sharp reply but concluded not to do so this was evidently the husband his romance was very short  tom wont you call the man in asked mrs miner as her husband came up to the kitchen door  no call im yourself youve got a gullet  mrs miners face clouded a little but she composed herself morty run out and tell the carpenter to come to dinner  boss is in a temper morris thought as he listened to miners reply he came up to the well where morty brought him a clean towel and waited to show him into the kitchen  miner was just sitting down to the table when morris entered his sleeves were rolled up he had his old white hat on his head he lounged upon one elbow on the table his whole bearing was swinish  what do i care he growled as if in reply to some lowvoiced warning his wife had uttered if he dont like it he can lump it and if you dont like my ways he said turning upon her all youve got to do is to say so and i git out  morris was amazed at all this he could not persuade himself that he had rightly understood what had been said there was something beneath the mans words which puzzled him and forbade his inquiry he sat down near the oldest child and opposite mrs miner miner began to eat and morris was speaking pleasantly to the child nearest him when he heard an oath and a slap he looked up to see miners hat falling from mrs miners cheek  she had begun a silent grace and her husband had thrown his hat in her face she kept her eyes upon her plate and her lips moved as if in prayer though a flush of red streamed up her neck and covered her cheek  morris leaped up his eyes burning into miners face hyere he shouted whats all this did you strike her  set down roared miner youre too fresh  ill let you know how fresh i am said the young fellow shaking his brawny fist in miners face  mrs miner rose with a ghastly smile on her face which was now as pale as it had been flushed please dont mind him hes only fooling morris looked at her and understood a little of her feeling as a wife and mother he sat down well ill let him know the weight of my fist if he does anything more of that business when im around he said looking at her and then at her husband i didnt grow up in a family where things like that go on if youll just say the word iill  please dont do anything she said and he saw that he had better not if he wished to shield her from further suffering the meal proceeded in silence miner apparently gloried in what he had done  the children were trembling with fear and could scarcely go on with their dinners they dared not cry their eyes were fixed upon their fathers face like the eyes of kittens accustomed to violence the wife tried to conceal her shame and indignation she thought she succeeded very well but the big tears rolling down from her wide unseeing eyes were pitiful to witness  morris ate his dinner in silence not seeing anything further to do or say his food choked him and he found it necessary to drink great draughts of water  at last she contrived to say how did you find the roof it was a pitiful attempt to cover the dreadful silence  it was almost as good as no roof at all he replied with the desire to aid her those shingles i suppose have been on there for thirty years i suppose those shingles must have been rived out by just such a machine as old man means used in the hoosier schoolmaster from this he went on to tell about some of the comical parts of the story and so managed to end the meal in a fairly presentable way  shes found another sympathizer sneered the husband returning to his habit of addressing his wife in the third person  after eating his dinner miner lit his pipe and swaggered out as if he had done an admirable thing morris remained at the table talking with the children after miner had passed out of earshot he looked up at mrs miner as if expecting her to say something in explanation of what had occurred but she had again forgotten him and sat biting her lips and looking out of the window her bosom heaved like that of one about to weep her wideopen eyes had unutterable sorrow in their beautiful depths  morris got up and went out in order to prevent himself from weeping too he hammered away on the roof like mad for an hour and wished that every blow fell on that little villains curly pate  he did not see mrs miner to speak to her again till the next forenoon when she came out to see how the work was getting on he came down from the roof to meet her and they stood side by side talking the job over and planning other work she spoke at last in a low hesitating voice and without looking at him  you mustnt mind what mr miner does hes very peculiar and youre likelythat is i mean  she could not finish her lie the young man looked down on her resolutely id like to lick him and id do it for a leather cent  she put out her hand with a gesture of dismay oh dont make trouble please dont  i wont if you dont want me to but that man needs a licking the worst of any one i ever saw mrs miner he said after a little pause i wish youd tell me why he acts that way now there must be some reason for it no sane man is going to do a thing like that  she looked away a hot flush rising upon her face she felt a distinct longing for sympathy there was something very engaging in this young mans candid manner  i do not know who is to blame she said at last as if in answer to a question ive tried to be a good wife to him for the childrens sake ive tried to be patient i suppose if id made the property all over to him as most wives do at first it would have avoided all trouble she paused to think a moment  but you see she went on suddenly father never liked him at all and he made me promise never to let the mill or the farm go out of my hands and then i didnt think it necessary it belonged to us both just as much as if id signed it over i considered he was my partner as well as my husband i knew how father felt especially about the mill and i couldnt go against his wish  she had the impulse to tell it all now and she sat down on a bunch of shingles as if to be able to state it better her eyes were turned away her hands pressed upon each other like timid living things seeking aid and looking at her trembling lips the young man felt a lump rise in his throat  it began all at once you see i mean the worst of it did of course wed had sharp words as all people who live together are apt to have i suppose but they didnt last long you see everything was mine and he had nothing at all when he came home with me hed had bad luck and hehe never was a good business man  the tears were on her face again she was retrospectively approaching that miserable time when her suffering began the droop of her head appealed to the young man with immense power he had an impulse to take her in his arms and comfort her as if she were his sister  she mastered herself at last and went on in low hesitating voice more touching than downright sobbing one day the same summer the mill burned one of the horses kicked at little morty and i said id sell it and he said it was all nonsense the horse wasnt to blame and i told him i wouldnt have a horse around that would kick and when he said i shouldnt sell it i said a dreadful thing i knew it would cut him but i said it i said the horse is mine the farm is mine i can do what i please with my own for all of you  she fell silent here and morris was forced to ask what did he do then  he looked at me a queer long look that made me shiver and then he walked off and he never spoke to me again directly for six months and from that day he almost never speaks to me except through the children he calls me names through them he cuts me every time he can he does everything he can to hurt me he never dresses up and he wears his hat in the house at all times and rolls up his sleeves at the table just because he knows it makes me suffer sometimes i think he is crazy and yet  oh no he aint crazy hes devilish morris blurted out great guns id like to lay my hands on him  she seemed to feel that a complete statement was demanded i cant invite anybody to the house for theres no knowing what hell do he may stay in the fields all day and never come in at all or he may come in and curse and swear at me or do somethingi never can tell what he is goin to do  havent you any relatives here morris asked  yes but im ashamed to let them know about it because they all said id repent and then hes my husband and hes the father of my children  a mighty poor excuse of one i call him said the young man with decision  i tried to give him the farm when i found it was going to make trouble but he wouldnt take it then he wont listen to me at all he keeps throwing it up to me that hes earning his living and if i dont think he is he will go any minute he works in the field but thats all he wont advise with me at all he says its none of his business he wont do a thing around the house or garden i tried to get him to oversee the mill for me but after our trouble he refused to do anything about it i hired a man to run it but it didnt pay that way and then it was idle for a while and at last it got afire some way and burned uptramps i suppose  oh dear she sighed rising i dont see how its going to end it must end some time sometimes it seems as if i couldnt stand it another day and then i think of my duty as a mother and wife and i think perhaps god intended this to be my cross  the young fellow was silent it was a great problem the question of divorce had never before been borne in upon him in this personal way it seemed to him a clear case the man ought to be driven off and the woman left in peace he thought of the pleasure it would give her to hear the sound of the mill again  they stood there side by side nearly the same age and yet the womans face was already lined with suffering and her eyes were full of shadow there seemed no future for her and yet she was young  please dont let him know ive said anything to you will you  ill try not to he said but he did not consider himself bound to any definite concealment  they ate dinner together without miner who had a fit of work on hand which made him stubbornly unmindful of any call to eat moreover he was sure it would worry his wife  the meal was a pleasant one on the whole and they found many things in common to talk about morris wanted to ask her a few more questions about her life but she begged him not to do so and started him off on the story of his college life he was an enthusiastic talker and told her his plans with boyish frankness he forgot his fatigue and she lost for a time her premature cares and despairs they were laughing together over some of his college pranks when miner came in at the door  oh i see he said with an insulting insinuating inflection now i understand the early dinner  morris sprang up and walking over to the sneering husband glared down at him with a look of ferocity that sat singularly upon his round fresh face now you shut up if you open your mouth to me again ill lick you till your hide wont hold pumpkins  miner shrank back turned on his heel and went off to the barn he did not return for his dinner  morris insisted on helping mrs miner clear up the yard and uncover the grapevine he liked her very much she appealed to the protector in him and she interested him besides because of the melancholy which was lined on her delicate face and voiced in her low soft utterances  he appealed to her because of his delicacy as well as strength he had something of the modern mans love for flowers and did not attempt to conceal his delight in thus tinkering about at womans work he ate supper with her and worked on until it was quite dark tired as he was and then shook hands and said good night  morris came back to his work the next day with a great deal of pleasure he had spent considerable thought upon the matter he had almost determined on a course of action he had thought of going directly to miner and saying  now look here miner if you was half a man youd pull out and leave this woman in peace how you can stand around here and occupy the position you do i dont see  but when he remembered mrs miners words about the children another consideration came in suppose he should take the children with himthat was the point that was the uncertain part of the problem it did not require any thought to remember that the law took very little consideration of the womans feelings he said to himself that if he ever became judge he would certainly give decisions that would send such a man as miner simply whirling out into space  miner was in the barn when morris clambered up the ladder with a bunch of shingles on his shoulder about seven oclock he came out and said  say you want to fix that window up there  get away from there shouted morris in uncontrollable rage or ill smash this bunch of shingles on your cursed head dont you open that ugly ptater trap at me you bowlegged little skunk im goin to lick you like a sock before im done with you  he would have done so then had he been on the ground but he disdained taking the trouble to climb down he planned to catch him when he came up to dinner the more he thought of it the more his indignation waxed as he grew to hate the man more he began to entertain the suspicions which wilber confessed to in confidence concerning the burning of the mill  they had a cheerful meal together again for miner did not come in until one oclock during the nooning morris finished spading the flower beds in spite of mrs miners entreaties that he should rest it gave him great pleasure to work there with her and the children  you see im lonesome here he explained just out of school and i miss the boys and girls i dont know anybody except a few of the carpenters here and sowell i kind of like it i always helped around the house at home its all fun for me so dont you say a word ive got lots o muscle to spare and youre welcome to it  he spaded away without many words the warm sun shone down upon them all and they made a pretty group mrs miner rake in hand was pulverizing the beds as fast as he spaded her face flushed and almost happy the children were wristdeep in the fresh earth planting twigs and pebbles their babble of talk some way akin to the cry of the woodpecker the laugh of the robin the twitter of the sparrow the smell of spring and the merry downpour of sunshine  mrs miner was silent she was thinking how different her life would have been if her husband had only taken an interest in her affairs she did not think of any one else as her husband but only miner in a different mood  morris went back to work as the work neared the end his determination to punish the scoundrel husband grew his inclination to charge him with burning the mill grew stronger he wondered if it wouldnt serve as a club now sir he said meeting miner as he came out of the barn that night im done on the barn but im not done on you im goin to whale you till you wont know yourself i ought o a done it that first day at dinner he advanced upon miner who backed away scared at something he saw in the young mans eyes and something he heard in his inflexible tone of voice  he thrust out his palm in a wild gesture keep away from me ill split your heart if you touch me  morris advanced another step his eyes looking straight into miners with the level look of a tigers no y wont youre too much of an infernal sneaky little whelp  at the word whelp he cuffed him with his hammerlike fist and miner went down in a heap he was so abject that the young man could only strike him with his open hand  he took him by the shirt collar with his left hand and began to cuff him leisurely and terribly with his right his blows punctuated his sentences youre a little whack villain ill thrash you till you wont see out of your blasted eyes for a month i cant stand a man here he jounced him up and down with his left hand apparently with infinite satisfaction who bullies his wife and children as you do here he cuffed him again and ill make it my business to even things up  the prostrate man began to scream for help he was livid with fear he fancied murder in the blaze of his assailants eye  help help minnie  call her by her first name now will yeh will yeh call her out to help yeh do you think she will i want to tell you besides i know something about that mill burning its just like your contemptible mustardseed of a soul to burn that mill  mrs miner came flying out she could not recognize her husband in the bleeding dirty abject thing squirming under the young mans knee  why mr morris whowhywhy its tom she gasped her eyes distended with surprise and horror  morris looked up at her coolly yes its tom he then gave his attention to the writhing figure under him crawl you infernal whelp lick the dust confound you quick he commanded growing each moment more savage  mrs miner clung to his arm please dont she pleaded youre killing him  morris did not look up oh no i aint im giving him a little taste of his own medicine he flopped miner over on his face and dragged him around in the dust like an old sack beg her pardon or ill thrash the ground with yeh  please dont pleaded the wife using her whole strength to stop him in his circuit with the almost insensible miner  beg he said again beg or ill cave your backbone in there was a terrible upward inflection in his voice now a halfjocular tone that was more terrible than the muffled snarl in which he had previously been speaking  i beg i beg cried miner  morris released him and he crawled to a sitting posture mrs miner fell on her knees by his side and began wiping the blood from his face she was breathless with sobbing and the children were screaming the tears streamed down her face which was white and drawn into ghastly wrinkles  youve killed him she gasped  morris put his hands in his pockets and looked down on them both with a curious feeling of having done something which he might repent of he felt in a way cut off from the satisfactory ending of the thing he had planned  oh youve killed him  oh no i havent hes all right he looked at them a moment longer to see if there were any rage remaining in the face of the husband and then at the wife to discover her feeling concerning his action then he looked back at the husband again and apparently justified himself for what he had done by the memory of the ineffable shame to which the wife had been subjected  now if i hear another word of your abuse he said as he shook the dust from his own clothes and prepared to go ill give you another that will make you think that this is all fooling more than that he said turning again i know something that will put you where the crows wont eat youif i can be of any service to you mrs miner at any time while im here i hope youll let me know goodby  mrs miner did not reply and when morris reached the gate and looked back she was still kneeling by the side of her husband the sunlight shining down upon her graceful head some way the problem had increased in complexity he felt a disgust of her weakness mingled with a feeling that he was losing something very fine and tender which had but just come into his life  he went back to his work on the other side of the river where his crew was working he was called home a few weeks later and he never saw husband or wife again he learned from wilber however in a short letter that things were going much the same as ever  dear sir i dont know much about miner hees purty quiet i guess dock moss thinks hees a little off his nut i dont i think its pur cussidness     of those who seek  i the prisoned soul   the capitol swarmed with people  groups of legislators tramped noisily along the corridors laughing loudly gesticulating with pointed fingers or closed fists  squads of ragged wondering and wistfuleyed negroes splashed with orangecolored mud from the fields moved timidly on from magnificence to magnificence keeping close to each other solemn and silent when they spoke they whispered others from the city streets laughed loudly and swaggered along to show their contempt for the place and their knowledge of its public character but their insolence was half assumed  lean and lank southerners with the imperial cut on their pale brown whiskers alternated with stalwart slouchhatted westerners cleanshaven pale clerks hurried to and fro groups of sightseers infested every nook and wore the look of those determined to see it all they were accompanied often by one whose certainty of accent gave evidence of his fitness to be their guide the sound of his voice proclaimed his judgments as he pushed his dazed wordless victims about  in a group in the center of the checkered marble floor of the rotunda a powerful indian dressed in semicivilized fashion was standing looking wonderingly down into the upturned face of a little girl the circle of bystanders silently studied both man and maid  she was about eleven years of age and was tastefully dressed and seemed a healthy child her face was solemn sweet and inquisitive she held one halfopened hand in the air with the other she touched the indians dark strongly molded cheek and pressed his long hair which streamed from beneath his broad white hat  no one smiled she was deaf and dumb and blind  in her raised rosy little palm with lightningswift motion fluttered the hand of her teacher by the teachers side stood an indian interpreter dressed in hunting shirt and broad hat  i am umatilla said the chief in answer to a question from the teacher his deep voice was like the mutter of a lion he stood with gentle dignity still looking wonderingly down into the girls sweet solemn and eager face  a bystander said poor child in a low tremulous tone followed by a sigh  the little ones hand light swift and seeking touched the indians ringed ears and pressed again his long hair while her teachers swift fingers said this strange man comes from a faroff land from vast mountains and forests away toward the western sea the wind and sun have made his face dark and the long hair is a protection from the cold he is a chief  under her broad hat the childs exquisite mouth with its dimpled corners remained calm but touchingly wistful her eyes were in shadow her chin was a perfect oval delicately beautiful like the curving lines of a peach with the clear transparency of color of a flowers chalice  but the bystander said again poor child as if a shudder of awe of wordless compassion and bitterness shook him  she was so beautiful so gifted in spirit to be thus shut in her inclosing flesh was so fine and sweet it seemed impossible it could be an impassable almost impenetrable wall  he thought she will soon be a woman with all the vague unutterable longings and passions of the woman her lithe body will be as beautiful as her soul and the warm oval of her face will flash and flame with her expanding struggling life her caged soul will struggle for light and companionship blindly vainly  life to her must remain a cruel fragment light and color she may not miss but wifehood maternity the touch of baby lips to her breastthese her soul will grope for in dumb maternal desire she must inhabit her dark and soundless cavern alone  again she touched the chieftains hair and earrings and let her hand drop down along his sleeve to his hard brown hand then her hand fell to her side with a resigned action  as she walked away a sweet smile of pleasure and gratitude flashed for an instant across the exquisite curving line of her lips and then the sad and wistful repose of her face came back again as if her loneliness had only been lightened not warmed  the young man drew a long breath of pain keen as a physical hurt the elderly gentleman said again poor child  the indian looked up again into the mighty dome soaring hundreds of feet above him and wondered how those forms came to be set flying in midair and his heart grew sad and wistful too as if a realization of the power and majesty of the white man fell like a poisonous fateful shadow over his people and himself   ii a sheltered one  the young man came in out of the cold dash of rain the negro man received his outside garments and ushered him into the drawingroom where a bright fire welcomed him like a smiling hostess  he sat down with a sudden relaxation of his muscles as he waited at his ease his senses absorbed the light and warmth and beauty of the house it was familiar and yet it had a new meaning to him a bird was singing somewhere in the upper chambers caroling with a joyous note that seemed to harmonize with the warmth and color of the room in which the caller sat  the young man stared at the fire his head leaning on his hand there were lines of gloomy thought in his face there were marks of bitter struggle on his hands his dress was strong and good but not in the mode he looked like a young lawyer with his lean dark face smoothly shaven save for a little tuft on either cheek his long hands were heavyjointed with toil  he listened to the bird singing and to the answering chirping call of a girls voice his head drooped forward in deep reverie  how beautiful her life is his thought was how absolutely without care or struggle she knows no uncertainty such as i feel daily hourly she has never a doubt of daily food the question of clothes has been a diversion for her a worry of choice merely dirt grime she knows nothing of here she lives sheltered in a glow of comfort and color while i hang by my fingerends over a bottomless pit she sleeps and dreams while i fight she is never weary while i sink into my bed each night as if it were my grave every hand held out to her is a willing handif it is paid for it is willing for she has no enemies even among her servants o god if i could only reach such a place to rest for just a yearfor just a month but such security such rest is out of my reach i must toil and toil and when at last i reach a place to pause and rest i shall be old and brutalized and deadened and my rest will be merelysleep  he looked once more about the lovely room the ocean wind tore at the windows with wolfish claws savage to enter  the world howling out there is as impotent to do her harm as is that wind at the window the young man added  the birds song again joined itself to the gay voice of the girl and then he heard quick footsteps on the stairs and as he rose to greet her the room seemed to glow like the heart of a ruby  they clasped hands and looked into each others eyes a moment he saw love and admiration in her face she saw only friendliness and some dark unsmiling mood in his  they sat down and talked upon the fringe of personalities which he avoided she fancied that she saw a personal sorrow in his face and she longed to comfort him she longed to touch his vexed forehead with her fingers  they talked on of late books and coming music he noticed how clear and sweet and intelligent were her eyes refinement was in the folds of her dress and in the faint perfume which exhaled from her drapery the firm flesh of her arms appealed to him like the limbs of a child so beautiful and tender  he saw in her face something wistful restless he tried to ignore it to seem unconscious of the adoration he saw there for it pained him it affected him as a part of the general misdirection of affection and effort in the world  she asked him about his plans he told her of them he grew stern and savage as he outlined the work which he had set himself to do his hands spread and clutched and his teeth set together involuntarily it is to be a fight he said but i shall win bribery blackmail the press and all other forces are against me but i shall win  he rose at length to a finer mood as he sketched the plan which he hoped to set in action  she looked at him with expanding eyes and quickened breath a globed light each soft eye seemed to him  he spoke more freely of the struggle outside in order to make her feel her own sweet securityhere where the grime of trade and the reek of politics never came  at last he rose to go smiling a little as if in apology for his dark mood he looked down at her slender body robed so daintily in gray and white she made him feel coarse and rough  her eyes appealed to him her glance was like a detaining hand he felt it and yet he said abruptly  good night  youll come to see me again  yes he answered very simply and gravely  and she looking after him as he went down the street with head bent in thought grew weak with a terrible weakness a sort of hunger and deep in her heart she cried out  oh the brave splendid life he leads out there in the world oh the big brave world  she clinched her pink hand  oh this terrible humdrum womans life it kills me it smothers me i must do something i must be something i cant live here in this wayuseless i must get into the world  and looking around the cushioned glowing beautiful room she thought bitterly  this is being a woman o god i want to be free of four walls i want to struggle like that  and then she sat down before the fire and whispered very softly i want to fight in the worldwith him   iii a fair exile  the train was ambling across the hot russet plain the wind strong and warm and dry sweeping up from the south carried with it the subtle odor of september grass and gathered harvests out of the unfenced roads the dust arose in long lines like smoke from some hidden burning which the riven earth revealed the fields were tenanted with thrashing crews the men diminished by distance to pygmies the long belt of the engine flapping and shining like a ribbon in the flaming sunlight  the freight cars on the accommodation train jostled and rocked about and heaved up laterally till they resembled a long line of awkward frightened galloping buffaloes the one coach was scantily filled with passengers mainly poorly clothed farmers and their families  a young man seated well back in the coach was looking dreamily out of the window and the conductor a keeneyed young fellow after passing him several times said in a friendly way  going up to boomtown i imagine  yesif we ever get there  oh well get there we wont have much more switching weve only got an empty car or two to throw in at the junction  well im glad of that im a little impatient because ive got a case coming up in court and im not exactly fixed for it  your name is allen i believe  yes j h allen of sioux city  i thought so ive heard you speak  the young lawyer was a tall slender darkeyed man rather somber in appearance he did not respond to the invitation in the conductors voice  when do you reach the junction  next stop were only a few minutes late expect to meet friends there  no thought id get a lunch thats all  at the junction the car became pretty well filled with people two or three norwegian families came clattering in the mothers clothed in heavy shawls and cheap straw hats the flaxenhaired children in faded cottonade and blue denims they filled nearly half the seats several drummers came in laughing loudly bearing heavy valises then allen heard above the noise the shrill but sweet voice of a girl and caught the odor of violets as two persons passed him and took a seat just before him  the man he knew by sight and reputation as a very brilliant young lawyer edward benson of heron lake the girl he knew instantly to be utterly alien to this land and people she was like a tropic bird seen amid the scant foliage of northern hills there was evidence of great care and taste in every fold of her modish dress her hat was simple but in the latest city fashion and her gloves were spotless she gave off an odor of cleanliness and beauty  she was very young and slender her face was piquant but not intellectual and scarcely beautiful it pleased rather by its life and motion and oddity than by its beauty she looked at her companion in a peculiar waytrustfully almost reverentlyand yet with a touch of coquetry which seemed perfectly native to every turn of her body or glance of her eyes  the young lawyer was a fine western type of selfmade man he was tall and broadshouldered but walked a little stooping like a man of fifty he wore a long prince albert frock coat hanging loosely from his rather square shoulders his white vest was a little soiled by his watch chain and his tie was disarranged  his face was very fine and good his eyes were grayblue deep and quiet but slightly smiling as were his lips which his goldenbrown mustache shaded but did not hide he was kept smiling in this quizzical way by the nervous chatter of the girl beside him his profile which was the view allen had of him was handsome the strong straight nose and abrupt forehead formed a marked contrast to the rather characterless nose and retreating forehead of the girl  the first words that allen distinguished out of the merry war in which they seemed engaged were spoken in the tone of pretty petulance such women use a coquettes defense  you did you did you did now you know you did you told me that you told me you despised girls like me  i said i despised women who had no object in life but dress he replied rather soberly  but you were hopping on me you meant me now you cant deny it you despise me i know you do she challenged his flattery in her pouting selfdepreciation  the young man tried to stop her in her course to change her mood which was descending to real feeling his low words could not be heard  yes yes try to smooth it over but you cant fool me any more but i dont want you to flatter me and lie to me the way judge stearns did she said with a sudden change of manner i like you because youre square  the phrase with which she ended seemed to take on a new meaning uttered by those red lips in childish pout  now why are you down on the judge i dont see said the man as if she had gone back to an old attack  well if youd seen what i have youd understand she turned away and looked out of the window oh this terrible country id die out here in six weeks i know i should  the young lawyer was not to be turned aside  of course im pleased to have you throw the judge over and employ me but all the same i think you do him an injustice hes a good square man  square man she said turning to him with a sudden fury in her eyes do you call it square for a manmarried and grayhaired tooto take up with a woman like mrs shellberg say do you now  well i dont quite believe  oh i lie do i she said with another swift change to reproach you cant take my word for mrs shellbergs visit to his office  but he was her lawyer  but you know what kind of a woman she is she didnt need to go there every day or two did she what did he always receive her in his private office for come now tell me that  i dont know that he did persisted the lawyer  a sort of convulsion passed over her face her little hands clinched and the tears started into her eyes her voice was very quiet  you think i lie then  i think you are mistaken just as other jealous women have  you think im jealous do you  you act like a jeal  jealous of that grayhaired old wretch no sir ii she struggled to express herself i liked him and i hated to lose all my faith in men i thought he was good and honest when he prayedoh ive seen him pray in church the old hypocrite her fury returned at the recollection  her companions face grew grave the smile went out of his eyes leaving them dark and sorrowful  i understand you now he said at last she turned to look at him my practice in the divorce business out here has almost destroyed my faith in women if it werent for my wife and sister  she broke in eagerly now i know you know what i mean sometimes i think men aredevils she thrust this word forth and her little face grew dark and strained but the judge kept me from thinkingi never loved my father he didnt care for me all he wanted to do was to make ten thousand barrels of beer a year and sell it and the judge seemed like a father to me till she came and destroyed my faith in him  butwell let mrs s go there are lots of good men and pure women in the world its dangerous to think there arentespecially for a handsome young woman like you you cant afford to keep in that kind of a mood long  she looked at him curiously thats what i like about you she said soberly you talk to me as if i had some senseas if i was a human being if you were to flatter me now and make love to me i never would believe in any man again  he smiled again in his frank good way and drew a picture from his pocket it was a picture of a woman bending down over a laughing naked child sprawling frogwise in her lap the womans face was broad and intellectual and handsome the look of splendid maternity was in her eyes they both looked at the picture in silence the girl sighed  i wish i was as good as that woman looks  you can be if you try  not with a big chicago brewer for a father and a husband that beats you whenever the mood takes him  i admit thats hard i think the atmosphere of that heron lake hotel isnt any great help to you  oh theyre a gay lot there we fight like cats and dogs a look of slyness and boldness came over her face mrs shellberg hates me as hard as i do her she used to go around telling its very peculiar you knowshe imitated her rivals voicebut no matter which end of the dining room i sit all the men look that way  the young lawyer laughed at her in spite of himself  but they dont now thats the reason she hates me she said in conclusion the men dont notice her when im around  to hear her fresh young lips utter those words with their vile inflections was like taking a sudden glimpse into the underworld where harlots dwell and the spirits of unrestrained lusts dance in the shadowy recesses of the human heart  allen hearing this fragmentary conversation fascinated yet uneasy looked at the pair with wonder they seemed unconscious of their public situation  the young lawyer looked straight before him while the girl swept on by her ignoble rage displayed still more of the moral ulceration which had been injected into her young life  i dont see what men find about her to likeunless it is her eyes shes got beautiful eyes but shes vulgarugh the stories she tellsright before men too shed kill any one that got ahead of her that woman would and yet shell come into my room and cry and cry and say dont take him away from me leave him to me ugh it makes me sick she stamped her foot then added irrelevantly she wears a wig too i suppose that old fool of a judge thinks its her own hair  the lawyer sat in stony silence his grave face was accusing in its set expression and she felt it and was spurred on to do still deeper injustice to herselfan insane perversity  not that i care a centim not jealous of her i aint so bad off for company as she is she cant take anybody away from me but she must go and break down my faith in the judge  she bit her lips to keep from crying out she looked out of the window again seeking control  the divorce colony never appeared more sickening in its inner corruptions than when delineated by this dainty young girl allen could see the swarming men about the hotels he could see their hot leering eyes and smell their liquorladen breaths as they named the latest addition to the colony or boasted of their associations with those already well known  the girl turned suddenly to her companion  how do those people live out here on their farms  she pointed at a small shanty where the whole family stood to watch the train go by  by eating boiled potatoes and salt pork  salt pork she echoed as if salt pork were old bootheels or bark or hay why it takes four hours for salt pork to digest  he laughed again at her childish irrelevancy so much the better for the poor whered you learn all that anyway  at school oh you neednt look so incredulous i went to boarding school i learned a good deal more than you think  well so i see now i should have said pork digested in three hours speaking from experience  well it dont what do the women do out here  they work like the men only more so  do they have any new things  not very often im afraid  she sighed after a pause she said  you were raised on a farm  yes in minnesota  did you do work like that she pointed at a thrashing machine in the field  yes i plowed and sowed and reaped and mowed i wasnt on the farm for my health  youre very strong arent you she asked admiringly  in a slabsided kind of a wayyes  her eyes grew abstracted  i like strong men ollie was a little man not any taller than i am but when he was drunk he was what men call aaholy terror he struck me with the water pitcher oncethat was just before baby was born i wish hed killed me she ended in a sudden reaction to hopeless bitterness it would have saved me all these months of life in this terrible country  it might have saved you from more than you think he said quietly tenderly  what do you mean  youve been brought up against women and men who have defiled you theyve made your future uncertain  do you think its so bad as that tell me she insisted seeing his hesitation  youre on the road to hell he said in a voice that was very low but it reached her it was full of pain and grave reprimand and gentleness youve been poisoned youre in need of a good mans help you need the companionship of good earnest women instead of painted harlots  her voice shook painfully as she replied  you dont think im all bad  youre not bad at allyoure simply reckless you are not to blame it depends upon yourself now though whether you keep a true woman or go to hell with mrs shellberg  the conductor eyed them as he passed with an unpleasant light in his eyes and the drummers a few seats ahead turned to look at them the tip had passed along from lip to lip they were like wild beasts roused by the presence of prey their eyes gleamed with relentless lust they eyed the little creature with ravening eyes her helplessness was their opportunity  allen sitting there saw the terror and tragedy of the girls life her reckless prodigal girlhood the coarse rich father the marriage when a thoughtless girl with a drunken dissolute boy the quarrels brutal beatings the haste to secure a divorce the contamination of the crowded hotels in heron lakeand this slender young girl naturally pure alert quick of impulseshe was like a lamb among lustful wolves his heart ached for her  the deep slow voice of the lawyer sounded on his eyes turned toward her had no equivocal look he was a brother speaking to a younger sister the tears fell down her cheeks upon her folded hands her widely opened eyes seemed to look out into a night of storms  oh what shall i do she moaned i wish i was deadand baby too  live for the babylet him help you out  oh he cant i dont care enough for him i wish i was like other mothers but im not i cant shut myself up with a baby im too young  he saw that she was seeking the love of a man not the care of a child she had the wifely passion but not the mothers love he was silent the case baffled him  oh i wish you could help me i wish i had you all the time i do i dont care what you think i do i do  our home is open to you and baby too he said slowly my wife knows about you and  who told herdid you she flashed out again angrily jealously  yes my wife is my other self he replied quietly  she stared at him breathing heavily then looked out of the window again at last she turned to him she seemed to refer to his invitation  oh this terrible land oh i couldnt stay here id go insane perhaps im going insane anyway dont you think so  no i think youre a little nervous thats all  oh do you think ill get my divorce  certainly without question  can i wait and go back with you  i shall not return for several days perhaps you couldnt bear the wait in this little town its not much like the city  oh dear but i cant go about alone i hate these men they stare at me so i wish i was a man its awful to be a woman dont you think so please dont laugh  the young lawyer was far from laughing but this was her only way of defending herself these pert birdlike ways formed her shield against ridicule and misprision  he said slowly yes its an awful thing to be a woman but its an awful responsibility to be a man  what do you mean  i mean that we are responsible as the dominant sex for every tragic incomplete womans life  dont you blame mrs shellberg she said forcing him to a concrete example with savage swiftness  no she had a poor father and a poor husband and she must earn her own living some way  she could cook or nurse or something like that  it isnt easy to find opportunity to cook or nurse if it were as easy to earn a living in a pure way as it is in a vicious way all men would be rich and virtuous but what had you planned to do after your divorce  oh im going to travel for two years then ill try to settle down  what you need is a good husband and a little cottage where youd have to cook your own foodand tend the baby  i wouldnt cook for any man living she broke in to express her bitterness that he could so coldly dispose of her future oh this terrible train cant it go faster if id realized what a trip this was i wouldnt have started  this is the route you all go he replied with grim humor and his words pictured a ceaseless stream of divorcées  she resented his classing her with the rest but she simply said you despise me dont you but what can we do you cant expect us to live with men we hate can you that would be worse than mrs shellberg  no i dont expect that of you id issue a divorce coupon with every marriage certificate and done with it he said in desperate disgust then this whole cursed business would be done away with it isnt a question of our laxity of divorce laws he said after a pause its a question of the senseless severity of the laws in other states thats what throws this demoralizing business into our hands here  it pays dont it i know ive paid for everything ive had  yes thats the demoralizing thing it draws a gang of conscienceless attorneys here and it draws us who belong here off into dirty work and it brings us into contact with men and womenim sick of the whole business  she had hardly followed him in his generalizations she brought him back to the personal  youre sick of me i know you are she leaned her head on the window pane her eyes closed oh i wish my heart would stop beating she said in a low tone  allen sitting so close behind them was forced to hear her so piercingly sweet was her voice he trembled for fear some one else might hear her it seemed like profanation that any one but the womans god should hear this outcry of a quivering writhing soul  she faced her companion again youre the only man i know now that i respect and you despise me  no i dont i pity you  thats worse i want you to help me oh if you could go with me or if i could be with you her gloved hands strained together in the agony of her desire  his calm lips did not waver he did not smile even about the eyes he knew her cry sprang from her need of a brother not from the passion of a woman  our home is yours just as long as you can bear the monotony of our simple lives he said in his quiet way but it was deepthroated and unmistakable in its sincerity  she laid her hand on his arm and clasped it hard then turned away her head and they rode in silence  after they left the car allen sat with savage eyes and grimly set mouth going over the problem again and again he saw that young and helpless creature walking the gantlet between endless ranks of lustful remorseless men snatching at her in selfish bestial desire  it made him bitter and despairing to think that women should be helplessthat they should need some man to protect them against some other man he cursed the laws and traditions that had kept women subordinate and trivial and deceptive and vacillating he wished they could be raised to the level of the brutes till like the tigress or shewolf they could not only defend themselves but their young  he tried to breathe a sigh of relief that she had gone out of his life buthe could not it was not so easy to shake off the shadow of his responsibility he followed her on her downward path till he saw her stretching out her hands in pitiful need to casual acquaintancesalone and without hope still petite still dainty in spite of all still with flashes of wit and then  he shuddered o my god upon whom does the burden of guilt lie                                       on the night of his return he sat among his romping babes debating whether he should tell the story to his wife or not as the little ones grew weary the noise of the autumn windthe lonely woeful moaning prairie windcame to his ears and he shuddered his wife observed it  what is it joe did you get a chill  oh no the wind sounds a little lonesome tonight thats all but he took his little girl into his arms and held her close   iv the passing stranger  this was the story the mystic told  it was about eleven oclock of an october night the street was one of the worst of the city but it was mondayone of its quiet nights  the saloons flared floods of feverish light upon the walk and breathed their terrible odors like caverns leading downward into hell restless loitering crowds moved to and fro with rasping uncertain footsteps out of which the click of health had gone  policemen occasionally showed themselves menacingly and the crowd responded to their impact by action quickened like a python touched with a redhot rod  it was nearly time to close and the barkeepers were beginning to betray signs of impatience with their most drunken customers  a dark tall man in cloak and fez moved slowly down the street his face was serene but somber in passing the window of a brilliantly lighted drinking place he stopped and looked in  in the small stall near the window and behind the counter sat three women and two men all had mugs of beer in their hands the women were all young and one of them was handsome they were dressed nattily jauntily in modish girlish hats and their dainty jackets fitted closely to their slight figures  their liquor had just been served and their voices were ringing with wild laughter their white teeth shone from their rouged faces with a mirth which met no answering smile from the strange young man without he stood like a shadow against the pane  the smile on the face of the youngest girl stiffened into a strange contortion her eyes looked straight ahead into the eyes of the stranger  her smile smoothed out her face paled her eyes expanded with wonder till they lost their insane glitter and grew sad and soft and dark  what is it nell the others asked  she did not hear them she seemed to listen her eyes seemed to see mountainsor clouds a land like her childhoods home with the sunset light over it her mug fell with a crash to the table she rose her hand silenced them with beautiful finger raised  listen dont you hear him his eyes are calling me it is christ  the others looked but they saw only a tall figure moving away he wore a long black cloak like a priest  some foreign duffer lookin in let im look said one of the other girls  one o them egyptian jugglers said another  whats the matter of ye nell you look as if youd seen a ghost of yr grandmother set down an drink yr beer  the girl brushed her hand over her eyes im going home she said in a low voice from which all individuality had passed her face seemed anxious her manner hurried  whats the matter nell my god look at her eyesim going with her  the girl put him aside with a gesture her look awed him  one of the others began to laugh  stop you fool one of the girls cried they sat in silence as the younger girl went out putting aside every hand stretched out to touch her she walked like one in stuporher face ghastly the arch of her beautiful eyebrows was like that of ophelia in her bitterest moment  the others watched her go in silence  one of them drew a sigh and said im going home too i dont feel well  ill go with ye one of the men said  stay where you are said the girl sharply                                       once on the street the younger girl hurried on the way the stranger had gone his face seemed before her  she could see it she should always see it it was the face of a young man a firm chin a strong mouth with a feminine curve in it a face with a clear pallor that seemed foreign somehow but the eyesoh the eyes  they were deep and brown and filled with an infinite sadnessfor her she felt it and the knot of pain in the forehead that was also for her something sweet and terrible went out from his presence a knowledge of infinite space and infinite time and infinite compassion  no man had ever looked at her like that there was something divine in the penetrating power of his eyes  some way she knew he was not a priest though his cloak and turban cap looked like it he seemed like a scholar from some strange landa man above passion a man who knew god  his eyes accused her and pitied her while they called her  no smile no shrinking of lips into a sneernothing but pity and wonder and something else  and a voice seemed to say you are too good to be there follow me  as she thought of him he seemed to stand on an immeasurable height looking down at her  she had laughed at himo godshe flushed hot with shame from head to footbut his eyes had not changed his lips had kept their pitying droop and his somber eyes had burned deep into the sacred places of her thought where something sweet and girlish lay unwasted and untrampled  he called me he called me                                       under the trees where the moonlight threw tracing of shadows she came upon him standing waiting for her she held out her hand to him like a babe he was taller than she thought  he took her hands silently and she grew calm at once all shame left her she forgot her city life she remembered only the sweet merry life of the village where she was born the sound of sleigh bells and song and the lisp of wind in the grass and songs of birds in the maples came to her  his voice began softly  you are too good and sweet to be so devoured of beasts in your little northern home they are waiting for you tomorrow you will go back to them  he placed his hand which was soft and warm and broad over her eyes his voice was like velvet soft yet elastic  when you wake you will hate what you have been no power can keep you here you will go back to the simple life from which you should never have departed you will love simple things and the pleasures of your native place  her face was turned upward but her eyelids had fallen  when you wake you will not remember your life here you will be a girl again unstained and ready to begin life without remorse and without accusing memory when i leave you at your door tonight you will belong to the kingdom of good and not to the kingdom of evil  he dropped her hands and pointed across the park  now go to that gray house ring the bell and you will be housed for the night remember you are mine when the bell rings you will wake  she moved away without looking backmoved mechanically like one still in sleep  the man watched her until the door opened and admitted her then he passed on into the shadow of the narrow street  and this the listener gravely asked  one was chosen the other left were the others less in need of grace     before the low green door   matilda bent was dying there was no doubt of that now if there had been before the gruff old physicianone of the many overworked and underpaid country doctorsshook his head and pushed by joe bent her husband as he passed through the room which served as dining room sitting room and parlor the poor fellow slouched back to his chair by the stove as if dazed and before he could speak again the doctor was gone  mrs ridings was just coming up the walk as the doctor stepped out of the door  o doctor how is she  she is a dying woman madam  oh dont say that doctor whats the matter  cancer  then the news was true  i dont know anything of the news mrs ridings but mrs bent is dying from the effects of a cancer primarily which she has had for yearssince her last child which died in infancy you remember  but doctor she never told me  neither did she tell me but no matter now i have done all i can for her if you can make death any easier for her go and do it you will find some opiate powders there with directions keep the pain down at all hazards dont let her suffer that is useless she is likely to last a day or twobut if any change comes tonight send for me  when the good matron entered the dowdy suffocating little room where matilda bent lay gasping for breath she was sick for a moment with sympathetic pain there the dying woman lay her world narrowed to four close walls propped up on the pillows near the one little window her eyes seemed very large and bright and the brow made prominent by the sinking away of the cheeks gave evidence that it was an uncommon woman who lay there quietly waiting the death angel  she smiled and lifted her eyebrows in a ghastly way  o marthy she breathed  matildy i didnt know you was so bad or id a come before why didnt you let me know said mrs ridings kneeling by the bed and taking the ghostly hands of the sufferer in her own warm and soft palms she shuddered as she kissed the thin lips  i think youll soon be around agin she added in the customary mockery of an attempt at cheer the other woman started slightly turned her head and gazed on her old friend long and intently the hollowness of her neighbors words stung her  i hope not marthyim ready to go i want to go i dont care to live  the two women communed by looking for a long time in each others eyes as if to get at the very secretest desires and hopes of the heart tears fell from marthas eyes upon the cold and nerveless hands of her friendpoor faithful hands hacked and knotted and worn by thirty years of ceaseless daily toil they lay there motionless upon the coverlet pathetic protest for all the world to see  o matildy i wish i could do something for you i want to help you so i feel so bad that i didnt come before aint they somethin  yes marthyjest set theretill i dieit wont be long whispered the pale lips the sufferer as usual was calmer than her visitor and her eyes were thoughtful  i will i will but oh must you go cant somethin be done dont yo want the minister to be sent for  no im all ready i aint afraid to die i aint worth savin now o marthy i never thought id come to thisdid you i never thought id dieso early in lifeand dieunsatisfied  she lifted her head a little as she gasped out these words with an intensity of utterance that thrilled her hearera powerful penetrating earnestness that burned like fire  are you satisfied pursued the steady lips my lifes a failure marthyive known it all alongall but my children o marthy whatll become o them this is a hard world  the amazed martha could only chafe the hands and note sorrowfully the frightful changes in the face of her friend the weirdly calm slow voice began to shake a little  im dyin marthy without ever gittin to the sunny place we girlsused to thinkwed git to by an by ive been agittin deeper n deeperin the shadetill its most dark they aint been no restnr hope fr me marthynone i aint  there there tillie dont talk sodont dear try to think how bright

we used to runo mattie if i was only there the world was all bright thenwasnt it we didnt expectto work all our days life looked like a meadow full of daisies and pinks and the nicest ones and the sweetest birds was just a little ways onwhere the sun wasit didnt lookwasnt we happy  yes yes dear but you mustnt talk so much the good woman thought matildas mind was wandering dont you want some medcine aint your fever risin  but the daisies and pinks all turned to weeds she went on waiting a little when we picked em an the sunny placehas been always behind me and the dark before me oh if i was only therein the sunwhere the pinks and daisies are  you mustnt talk so mattie think about your children you aint sorry y had them theyve been a comfort to y you aint sorry you had em  i aint glad was the unhesitating reply of the failing woman and then she went on in growing excitement theyll haf to grow old jest as i havegit bent and gray an die they aint ben much comfort to me the boys are like their father and julyies weak they aint no happinessfor such as me and them  she paused for breath and mrs ridings not knowing what to say did better than speak she fell to stroking the poor face and the hands getting more restless each moment it was as if matilda fletcher had been silent so long had borne so much without complaint that now it burst from her in a torrent not to be stayed all her most secret doubts and her sweetest hopes seemed trembling on her lips or surging in her brain racking her poor emaciated frame for utterance now that death was sure she was determined to rid her bosom of its perilous stuff martha was appalled  i used to thinkthat when i got married id be perfectly happybut i never have been happy sence it was the beginning of trouble to me i never found things better than they looked they was always worse ive gone further an further from the sunshiny meadow an the birds an flowers and ill never git back to em again never she ended with a sob and a low wail  her face was horrifying with its intensity of pathetic regret her straining wideopen eyes seemed to be seeing those sunny spots in the meadow  mattie sometimes when im asleep i think i am back there aginand you girls are therean were pullin off the leaves of the wild sunflowerrich man poor man beggar manand i hear you all laugh when i pull off the last leaf an when i come to myselfand im an old driedup woman dyin unsatisfied  ive felt that way a little myself matildy confessed the watcher in a scared whisper  i knew it mattie i knew youd know how i felt things have been better for you you aint had to live in an old log house all your life an work yourself to skin an bone for a man you dont respect nor like  matildy bent take that back take it back for mercy sake dont you dare die thinkin thatdont you dare  bent hearing her voice rising came to the door and the wife knowing his step cried  dont let him in dont i cant bear himkeep him out i dont want to see him agin  who do you mean not joe  yes him  had the dying woman confessed to murder good martha could not have been more shocked she could not understand this terrible revulsion in feeling for she herself had been absolutely loyal to her husband through all the trials which had come upon them  but she met bent at the threshold and closing the door went out with him into the summer kitchen where the rest of the family were sitting a gloomy silence fell on them all after the greetings were over the men were smoking all were seated in chairs tipped back against the wall joe bent a smallish man with a weak goodnatured face asked in a hoarse whisper  how is she mis ridings  she seems quite strong mr bent i think you had all better go to bed if i want you i can call you doctor give me directions  all right responded the relieved man ill sleep on the lounge in the other room if you want me just rap on the door  when after making other arrangements martha went back to the bedroom she was startled to hear the sick woman muttering to herself or perhaps because she had forgotten marthas absence  but the shadows on the meadow didnt stay they passed on and then the sun was all the brighter on the flowers we used to string sweetwilliams on spears of grassdont you remember  martha gave her a drink of the opiate in the glass adjusted her on the pillow and threw open the window even to the point of removing the screen and the gibbous moon flooded the room with light she did not light a lamp for its flame would heat the room besides the moonlight was sufficient it fell on the face of the sick woman till she looked like a thing of marbleall but her dark eyes  does the moon hurt you tilly shall i put down the curtain  the woman heard with difficulty and when the question was repeated said slowly  no i like it after a littledont you remember mattie how beautiful the moonlight seemed it seemed to promise happinessand lovebut it never come for us it makes me dream of the past nowjust as it did o future then an the whippoorwills too  the night was perfectly beautiful such a night as makes dying an infinite sorrow the summer was at its liberalest innumerable insects of the nocturnal sort were singing in unison with the frogs in the pools a whippoorwill called and its neighbor answered it like an echo the leaves of the trees glossy from the late rain moved musically to the light west wind and the exquisite perfume of many flowers came in on the breeze  when the failing woman sank into silence martha leaned her elbow on the window sill and gazing far into the great deeps of space gave herself up to unwonted musings upon the problems of human life she sighed deeply at times she found herself at moments in the almost terrifying position of a human soul in space not a wife not a mother but just a soul facing the questions which harass philosophers as she realized her condition of mind she apprehended something of the thinking of the woman on the bed matilda had gone beyond or far back of the wife and mother  the hours wore on the dying woman stirred uneasily now and then whispering a word or phrase which related to her girlhoodnever to her later life once she said  mother hold me im so tired  martha took the thin form in her arms and laying her head close beside the sunken cheek sang in half breath a lullaby till the sufferer grew quiet again  the eastern moon passed over the house leaving the room dark and still the patient watcher sat beside the bed listening to the slow breathing of the dying one the cool air grew almost chill the east began to lighten and with the coming light the tide of life sank in the dying body the head hitherto restlessly turning ceased to move the eyes grew quiet and began to soften like a sleepers  how are you now dear asked the watcher several times bending over the bed and bathing back the straying hair  im tiredtired motherturn me she murmured drowsily with heavy lids drooping  martha adjusted the pillows again and turned the face to the wall the poor tortured restless brain slowly stopped its grinding whirl and the thin limbs heavy with years of hopeless toil straightened out in an endless sleep  matilda fletcher had found rest     upon impulse   the seminary buildings stood not far from the low lodgelike railway station and a path led through a gap in the fence across the meadow people were soberly converging toward its central building as if proceeding to church  among the people who alighted from the two oclock train were professor blakesly and his wife and a tall dark man whom they called ware  mrs blakesly was plump and pretty plainly the mother of two or three children and the sovereign of a modest suburban cottage blakesly was as evidently a teacher even the casual glances of the other visitors might discover the character of these people  ware was not so easy to be read his face was lean and brown and his squarely clipped mustache gave him a stern look his body was well rounded with muscle and he walked alertly his manner was direct and vigorous manifestly of the open air  as they entered the meadow he paused and said with humorous irresolution i dont know what i am out here for  to see the pretty girls of course said mrs blakesly  they may be plain after all he said  theyre always pretty at graduation time and at marriage blakesly interpreted  then theres the ice cream and cake mrs blakesly added  where do all these people come from ware asked looking about its all farm land here  they are the fathers mothers and brothers of the seminary girls they come from everywhere see the dear creatures about the door lets hurry along  they do not interest me i take off my hat to the beauty of the day however  ware had evidently come under protest for he lingered in the daisied grass which was dappled with shadows and tinkling with bobolinks and catbirds  a broad path led up to the central building whose double doors were swung wide with most hospitable intent ware ascended the steps behind his friends a bored look on his dark face  two rows of flushed excited girls with two teachers at their head stood flanking the doorway to receive the visitors who streamed steadily into the wide cool hall  mrs blakesly took ware in hand mr ware this is miss powell miss powell this is mr jenkin ware lawyer and friend to the blakeslys  im very glad to see you said a cool voice in which gladness was entirely absent  ware turned to shake hands mechanically but something in the steady eyes and clasp of the hand held out turned his listless manner into surprise and confusion he stared at her without speaking only for a second and yet so long she colored and withdrew her hand sharply  i beg your pardon i didnt get the name  miss powell answered mrs blakesly who had certainly missed this little comedy which would have been so delicious to her  ware moved on shaking hands with the other teachers and bowing to the girls he seized an early moment to turn and look back at miss powell his listless indifference was gone she was a fine figure of a womana strong lithe figure dressed in a wellordered lightcolored gown her head was girlish with a fluff of brown hair knotted low at the back her profile was magnificent the head had the intellectual poise but the proud bosom and strong body added another quality she is a modern type ware said remembering a painting of such a head he had seen in a recent exhibition  as he studied her she turned and caught him looking and he felt again a curious fluttering rush at his heart he fancied she flushed a little deeper as she turned away  as for him it had been a very long while since he had felt that singular weakness in the presence of a young woman he walked on trying to account for it it made him feel very boyish he had a furtive desire to remain in the hall where he could watch her and when he passed up the stairs it was with a distinct feeling of melancholy as if he were leaving something very dear and leaving it forever  he wondered where this feeling came from and he looked into the upturned faces of the girls as if they were pansies he wandered about the rooms with the blakeslys being bored by introductions until at last miss powell came up the stairway with the last of the guests  while the girls sang and went through some pretty drills ware again studied miss powell her appeal to his imagination was startling he searched for the cause of it it could not be in her beauty certainly she was fine and womanly and of splendid physique but all about her were lovely girls of daintier flesh and warmer color he reasoned that her power was in her eyes steady frank as sunlight clear as water in a mountain brook she seemed unconscious of his scrutiny  at last they began moving down the stairs and on to the other buildings ware and blakesly waited for the ladies to come down and when they came they were in the midst of a flood of girls and ware had no chance to speak to them as they moved across the grass he fell in behind mrs blakesly who seemed to be telling secrets to miss powell who flushed and shook her head  mrs blakesly turned and saw ware close behind her and said o mr ware where is my dear dear husband  back in the swirl ware replied  mrs blakesly artfully dropped miss powells arm and fell back i must not desert the poor dear as she passed ware she said take my place  with pleasure he replied and walked on after miss powell who seemed not to care to wait  how simply she was dressed she moved like an athlete without effort and without constraint as he walked quickly to overtake her a finer light fell over the hills and a fresher green came into the grass the daisies nodding in the wind blurred together in a dance of light and loveliness which moved him like a song  how beautiful everything is today he said as he stepped to her side he felt as if he had said how beautiful you are  she flashed a quick inquiring glance at him  yes june can be beautiful with us still there is a beauty more mature when the sickle is about to be thrust into the grain  he did not hear what she said he was thinking of the power that lay in the oval of her face in the fluffy tangle of her hair ah now he knew with that upward glance she brought back his boy love his teacher whom he had worshiped as boys sometimes will with a love as pure as winter starlight yes now it was clear there was the same flex of the splendid waist the same slow lift of the head and steady beautiful eyes  as she talked he was a youth of seventeen he was lying at his teachers feet by the river while she read wonderful love stories there were others there but they did not count then the tears blurred his eyes he remembered walking behind her dead body as it was borne to the hillside burying ground and all the world was desolate for him  he became aware that miss powell was looking at him with startled eyes he hastened to apologize and explain pardon me you look so much like a schoolboy idolii seem to see her again i didnt hear what you said you brought the past back so poignantly  there was something in his voice which touched her but before he could go on they were joined by mr and mrs blakesly and one of the other teachers there was a dancing light in mrs blakeslys eyes as she looked at ware she had just been saying to her husband what a splendid figure miss powell is how well they look together wouldnt it be splendid if  oh my dear youre too bad please dont matchmake any more today let nature attend to these things mr blakesly replied with manifest impatience nature attended to our case  i have no faith in nature any more i want to have at least a finger in the pie myself nature dont work in all cases im afraid nature cant in his case  careful hell hear you my dear  where do we go now miss powell asked blakesly as they came to a halt on the opposite side of the campus  i think they are all going to the gymnasium building wont you come that is my dominion  they answered by moving off mrs blakesly taking miss powells arm as they streamed away in files she said isnt he goodlooking weve known him for years hes all right she said significantly and squeezed miss powells arm  well lou blakesly youre the same old irrepressible  blushing already you dear i tell you hes splendid i wish hed take to you and she gave miss powell another squeeze it would be such a match brains and beauty too  oh hush  they entered the cool wide hall of the gymnasium with its red brick walls its polished floor and the yellowred wooden beams lining the ceiling  there were only a few people remaining in the hall most of them having passed on into the museum as they came to the various appliances miss powell explained them  what are these things for inquired mrs blakesly pointing at the row of iron rings depending from long ropes  they are for swinging on and she leaped lightly upward and caught and swung by one hand  mercy do you do that  she seems to be doing it now blakesly said  i am one of the teachers miss powell replied dropping to the floor  it was glorious to see how easily she seized a heavy dumbbell and swung it above her head the front line of her body was majestic as she stood thus  gracious i couldnt do that exclaimed mrs blakesly  no not with your style of dress replied her husbandi have to pin her hat on this year he said to ware  i love it said miss powell as she drew a heavy weight from the floor and stood with the cord across her shoulder it adds so much to life it gives what browning calls the wild joy of living do you know few women know what that means its been denied us only the men have known      the wild joys of living the leaping from rock       up to rock     the strong rending of boughs from the fir tree       the cool silver shock     of a plunge in the pools living water  i try to teach my girls how good is mans life the mere living  the men cheered as she paused for a moment flushed and breathless  she went on we women have been shut out from the sports too longi mean sports in the sun the men have had the best of it all the swimming all the boating wheeling all the grand wild life now were going to have a part  the young ladies clustered about with flushed excited faces while their teacher planted her flag and claimed new territory for women  miss powell herself grew conscious and flushed and paused abruptly  mrs blakesly effervesced in admiring astonishment well well i didnt know you could make a speech  i didnt mean to do so she replied  go on go on everybody called out but she turned away to show some other apparatus  wasnt she fine exclaimed mrs blakesly to ware  beyond praise he replied she went at once to communicate her morsel of news to her husband and at length to miss powell  the company passed out into other rooms until no one was left but mrs blakesly the professor and ware miss powell was talking again and to ware mainly ware was thoughtful miss powell radiant  i didnt know what life was till i could do that she took up a large dumbbell and extending it at arms length whirled it back and forth her forearm white and smooth swelled into strong action and her supple hands had the unwavering power and pressure of an athlete and withal ware thought she is feminine her physical power has not coarsened her it has enlarged her life but left her entirely womanly  in some adroit way mrs blakesly got her husband out of the room and left ware and miss powell together she was showing him the view from the windows and they seemed to be perfectly absorbed she looked around once and saw that mrs blakesly was showing her husband something in the farther end of the room after that she did not think of them  the sun went lower in the sky and flamed along the sward he spoke of the mystical power of the waving daisies and the glowing greens which no painter ever seems to paint while they looked from the windows their arms touched and they both tried to ignore it she shivered a little as if a cold wind had blown upon her at last she led the way out and down the stairs to the campus they heard the gay laughter of the company at their cakes and ices up at the central building  he stopped outside the hallway and as she looked up inquiringly at him he said quietly suppose we go down the road it seems pleasanter there  she acquiesced like one in a pleasure which made duty seem absurd  strong and fine as she was she had never found a lover to whom she yielded her companionship with unalloyed delight she was thirty years of age and her girlhood was past she looked at this man and a suffocating band seemed to encircle her throat she knew he was strong and good he was a little saddened with lifethat she read in his deepset eyes and unsmiling lips  the road led toward the river and as they left the campus they entered a lane shaded by natural oaks he talked on slowly he asked her what her plans were  to teach and to live she said her enthusiasm for the work seemed entirely gone  once he said this is the finest hour of my life  on the bank of the river they paused and seated themselves on the sward under a tree whose roots fingered the stream with knuckled hands  yes every time you look up at me you bring back my boyish idol he went on she was older than i it is as if i had grown older and she had not and that she were you or you were she i cant tell you how it has affected me every movement you make goes deep down into my sweetest tenderest recollections its always june there always sweet and sunny her death and burial were mystical in their beauty i looked in her coffin she was the grandest statue that ever lay in marble the greek types are insipid beside that vision youll say i idealized her possibly i did but there she is o god it was terrible to see one die so young and so lovely  there was a silence tears came to her eyes he could only exclaim weeping was denied him his voice trembled but grew firmer as he went on  and now you come i dont know exactly in what way you resemble her i only know you shake me as no other human being has done since that coffinlid shut out her face he lifted his head and looked around but nature is beautiful and full of light and buoyancy i am not going to make you sad i want to make you happy i was only a boy to her she cared for me only as a mature woman likes an apt pupil but she made all nature radiant for me as you do now  he smiled upon her suddenly his somber mood passed like one of the shadows of the clouds floating over the campus it was only a recollected mood as he looked at her the old hunger came into his heart but the buoyancy and emotional exaltation of youth came back also  miss powell are you free to marry me he said suddenly  she grew very still but she flushed and then she turned her face away from him she had no immediate reply  that is an extraordinary thing to ask you i know he went on but it seems as if i had known you a long time and then sitting here in the midst of nature with the insects singing all about uswell conventions are not so vital as in drawing rooms remember your browning  she who had declaimed browning so blithely now sat silent but the color went out of her face and she listened to the multitudinous stir and chirp of living things and her eyes dreamed as he went on steadily his eyes studying her face  browning believed in these impulses ill admit i never have ive always reasoned upon things at least since i became a man it has brought me little and im much disposed to try the virtue of an impulse i feel as certain that we can be happy together as i am of life so i come back to my question are you free to marry me  she flushed again i have no other ties if that is what you mean  that is what i mean precisely i felt that you were free like myself i might ask blakesly to vouch for me but i prefer not i ask for no ones opinion of you cant you trust to that insight of which women are supposed to be happily possessed  she smiled a little i never boasted of any divining power  he came nearer come you and i have gone by rule and reason long enough here we have a magnificent impulse let us follow dont ask me to wait that would spoil it all considerations would come in  ought they not to come in  no he replied and his low voice had the intensity of a trumpet if this magnificent moment passes by this chance for a pure impulsive choice it is lost forever you know browning makes much of such lost opportunities seeing you there with bent head and blowing hair i would throw the world away to become the blade of grass you break there will that do he smiled  that speech should bring back youth to us both she said  right action now will he quickly answered  but i must consider  do not take the impulse  it may be wayward  weve both got beyond the wayward impulse this impulse rises from the profound deeps come the sun sinks the insect voices thicken a star passes behind the moon and life hastens come into my life cant you trust me  she grew very white but a look of exaltation came into her face she lifted her clear steady eyes to his she reached her hand to his i will she said and they rose and stood together thus  he uncovered his head a sort of awe fell upon him a splendid human life was put into his keeping  a pure choice he said exultinglya choice untouched by considerations it brings back the youth of the world  the sun lay along the sward in level lines the sky was full of clouds sailing in file like mighty purple cranes in saffron seas of flame the wind wavered among the leaves and the insects sang in sudden ecstasy of life  the two looked into each others faces they seemed to be transfigured each to the other  you must not go back he said they would not understand you nor me we will never be so near a great happiness a great holiday it is holiday time let us go to the mountains  she drew a sigh as if all her cares and duties dropped from her then she smiled and a comprehending light sparkled in her eyes  very well to the clouds if you will     the end of love is love of love   they lay on the cliff where the warm sun fell beneath them were rocks lichenspotted above and orange and russet and pink beneath  around the headland the ocean ravened with roaring breath flinging itself ceaselessly on the land only to fall back with clutching snarl over the pebbles  the smell of hot cedars was in the air the distant ships drove by with huge sails bellying occasional crickets chirped faintly sandpipers skimmed the beach  the man and woman were both gray he lay staring at the sky she sat with somber eyes fixed on the distant sea whose crawling lines glittered in everchanging designs on its purple sweep  they were man and wife both were older than their years they were far past the land of youth and love  o wife he cried let us forget we are old let us forget we are disillusioned of life let us try to be boy and girl again  the woman shivered with a powerful vague emotion but she did not look at him  o esther im tired of life the man went on im tired of my children im tired of you do you know what i mean  the woman looked into his eyes a moment and said in a low voice  no charles but the man knew she meant yes the touch of her hand grew cold  im tired of it all i want to feel again the wonder and mystery of life its all gone the love we have now is good and sweet and true that of the old time was sweeter it was so marvelous i trembled when i kissed you dear i dont now it had more of truth of pure unconscious passion and less of habit oh teach me to forget  he crept nearer to her and laid his head in her lap his face was knotted with his passion and pain  the wife and mother sighed and looked down at his hair which was getting white  well charles she said and caressingly buried her fingers in his hair ill try to forget for your sake  he could not understand her he did not try he lay with closed eyes tired purposeless the sweet sea wind touched his cheek white with the indoor pallor of the desk worker the sound of the sea exalted him the beautiful clouds above him carried him back to boyhood there were tears on his face as he looked up at her  im forgetting he said with a smile of exultation  but the woman looked away at the violetshadowed sails afar on the changeful purple of the sea and her throat choked with pain  the end    d appleton and companys publications  by a conan doyle  uniform edition 12mo cloth 150 per volume  uncle bernac a romance of the empire  illustrated
