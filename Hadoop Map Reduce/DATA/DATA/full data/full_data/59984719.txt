59984719	little blue book no 215  edited by e haldemanjulius   the miraculous revenge  bernard shaw  haldemanjulius company girard kansas     printed in the united states of america     the miraculous revenge  illustration bernard shaw     the miraculous revenge   i arrived in dublin on the evening of the fifth of august and drove to the residence of my uncle the cardinal archbishop he is like most of my family deficient in feeling and consequently averse to me personally he lives in a dingy house with a sidelong view of the portico of his cathedral from the front windows and of a monster national school from the back my uncle maintains no retinue the people believe that he is waited upon by angels when i knocked at the door an old woman his only servant opened it and informed me that her master was then officiating at the cathedral and that he had directed her to prepare dinner for me in his absence an unpleasant smell of salt fish made me ask her what the dinner consisted of she assured me that she had cooked all that could be permitted in his holinesss house on friday on my asking her further why on friday she replied that friday was a fast day i bade her tell his holiness that i had hoped to have the pleasure of calling on him shortly and drove to the hotel in sackvillestreet where i engaged apartments and dined  after dinner i resumed my eternal searchi know not for what it drives me to and fro like another cain i sought in the streets without success i went to the theatre the music was execrable the scenery poor i had seen the play a month before in london with the same beautiful artist in the chief part two years had passed since seeing her for the first time i had hoped that she perhaps might be the longsought mystery it had proved otherwise on this night i looked at her and listened to her for the sake of that bygone hope and applauded her generously when the curtain fell but i went out lonely still when i had supped at a restaurant i returned to my hotel and tried to read in vain the sound of feet in the corridors as the other occupants of the hotel went to bed distracted my attention from my book suddenly it occurred to to me that i had never quite understood my uncles character he father to a great flock of poor and ignorant irish an austere and saintly man to whom livers of hopeless lives daily appealed for help heavenward who was reputed never to have sent away a troubled peasant without relieving him of his burden by sharing it whose knees were worn less by the altar steps than by the tears and embraces of the guilty and wretched he refused to humor my light extravagances or to find time to talk with me of books flowers and music had i not been mad to expect it now that i needed sympathy myself i did him justice i desired to be with a truehearted man and mingle my tears with his  i looked at my watch it was nearly an hour past midnight in the corridor the lights were out except one jet at the end i threw a cloak upon my shoulders put on a spanish hat and left my apartment listening to the echoes of my measured steps retreating through the deserted passages a strange sight arrested me on the landing of the grand staircase through an open door i saw the moonlight shining through the windows of a saloon in which some entertainment had recently taken place i looked at my watch again it was but one oclock and yet the guests had departed i entered the room my boots ringing loudly on the waxed boards on a chair lay a childs cloak and a broken toy the entertainment had been a childrens party i stood for a time looking at the shadow of my cloaked figure on the floor and at the disordered decorations ghostly in the white light then i saw there was a grand piano still open in the middle of the room my fingers throbbed as i sat down before it and expressed all i felt in a grand hymn which seemed to thrill the cold stillness of the shadows into a deep hum of approbation and to people the radiance of the moon with angels soon there was a stir without too as if the rapture were spreading abroad i took up the chant triumphantly with my voice and the empty saloon resounded as though to the thunder of an orchestra  hallo sir confound you sir do you suppose that this what the deuce  i turned and silence followed six men partially dressed with disheveled hair stood regarding me angrily they all carried candles one of them had a bootjack which he held like a truncheon another the foremost had a pistol the night porter was behind trembling  sir said the man with the revolver coarsely may i ask whether you are mad that you disturb people at this hour with such unearthly noise  is it possible that you dislike it i replied courteously  dislike it said he stamping with rage whydamn everythingdo you suppose we were enjoying it  take care hes mad whispered the man with the bootjack  i began to laugh evidently they did think me mad unaccustomed to my habits and ignorant of the music as they probably were the mistake however absurd was not unnatural i rose they came closer to one another and the night porter ran away  gentlemen i said i am sorry for you had you lain still and listened we should all have been the better and happier but what you have done you cannot undo kindly inform the night porter that i am gone to visit my uncle the cardinal archbishop adieu  i strode past them and left them whispering among themselves some minutes later i knocked at the door of the cardinals house presently a window opened and the moonbeams fell on a grey head with a black cap that seemed ashy pale against the unfathomable gloom of the shadow beneath the stone sill  who are you  i am zeno legge  what do you want at this hour  the question wounded me my dear uncle i exclaimed i know you do not intend it but you make me feel unwelcome come down and let me in i beg  go to your hotel he said sternly i will see you in the morning goodnight he disappeared and closed the window  i felt that if i let this rebuff pass i should not feel kindly towards my uncle in the morning nor indeed at any future time i therefore plied the knocker with my right hand and kept the bell ringing with my left until i heard the door chain rattle within the cardinals expression was grave nearly to moroseness as he confronted me on the threshold  uncle i cried grasping his hand do not reproach me your door is never shut against the wretched let us sit up all night and talk  you may thank my position and my charity for your admission zeno he said for the sake of the neighbors i had rather you played the fool in my study than upon my doorstep at this hour walk upstairs quietly if you please my housekeeper is a hardworking woman the little sleep she allows herself must not be disturbed  you have a noble heart uncle i shall creep like a mouse  this is my study he said as we entered an illfurnished den on the second floor the only refreshment i can offer you if you desire any is a bunch of raisins the doctors have forbidden you to touch stimulants i believe  by heaven he raised his finger pardon me i was wrong to swear but i had totally forgotten the doctors at dinner i had a bottle of grave  humph you have no business to be traveling alone your mother promised that bushy should come over here with you  pshaw bushy is not a man of feeling besides he is a coward he refused to come with me because i purchased a revolver  he should have taken the revolver from you and kept to his post  why will you persist in treating me like a child uncle i am very impressionable i grant you but i have gone around the world alone and do not need to be drynursed through a tour in ireland  what do you intend to do during your stay here  i had no plans and instead of answering i shrugged my shoulders and looked round the apartment there was a statue of the virgin upon my uncles desk i looked at its face as he was wont to look in the midst of his labor i saw there eternal peace the air became luminous with an infinite network of the jeweled rings of paradise descending in roseate clouds upon us  uncle i said bursting into the sweetest tears i had ever shed my wanderings are over i will enter the church if you will help me let us read together the third part of faust for i understand it at last  hush man he said half rising with an expression of alarm control yourself  do not let tears mislead you i am calm and strong quick let us have goethe      das unbeschreibliche     hier ist gethan     das ewigweibliche     zieht uns hinan  come come dry your eyes and be quiet i have no library here  but i havein my portmanteau at the hotel i said rising let me go for it i will return in fifteen minutes  the devil is in you i believe cannot  i interrupted him with a shout of laughter  cardinal i said noisily you have become profane and a profane priest is always the best of good fellows let us have some wine and i will sing you a german beer song  heaven forgive me if i do you wrong he said but i believe god has laid the expiation of some sin on your unhappy head will you favor me with your attention for awhile i have something to say to you and i have also to get some sleep before my hour of rising which is halfpast five  my usual hour for retiringwhen i retire at all but proceed my fault is not inattention but oversusceptibility  well then i want you to go to wicklow my reasons  no matter what they may be said i rising again it is enough that you desire me to go i shall start forthwith  zeno will you sit down and listen to me  i sank upon my chair reluctantly ardor is a crime in your eyes even when it is shewn in your service i said may i turn down the light  why  to bring on my sombre mood in which i am able to listen with tireless patience  i will turn it down myself will that do  i thanked him and composed myself to listen in the shadow my eyes i felt glittered i was like poes raven  now for my reasons for sending you to wicklow first for your own sake if you stay in town or in any place where excitement can be obtained by any means you will be in swifts hospital in a week you must live in the country under the eye of one upon whom i can depend and you must have something to do to keep you out of mischief and away from your music and painting and poetry which sir john richard writes to me are dangerous for you in your present morbid state second because i can entrust you with a task which in the hands of a sensible man might bring discredit on the church in short i want you to investigate a miracle  he looked attentively at me i sat like a statue  you understand me he said  nevermore i replied hoarsely pardon me i added amused at the trick my imagination had played me i understand you perfectly proceed  i hope you do well four miles distant from the town of wicklow is a village called four mile water the resident priest is father hickey you have heard of the miracles at knock  i winked  i did not ask you what you think of them but whether you have heard of them i see you have i need not tell you that even a miracle may do more harm than good to the church in this country unless it can be proved so thoroughly that her powerful and jealous enemies are silenced by the testimony of followers of their heresy therefore when i saw in a wexford newspaper last week a description of a strange manifestation of the divine power which was said to have taken place at four mile water i was troubled in my mind about it so i wrote to father hickey bidding him give me an account of the matter if it were true and if it were not to denounce from the altar the author of the report and contradict it in the paper at once this is his reply he says well the first part is about church matters i need not trouble you with it he goes on to say  one moment is this his own handwriting it does not look like a mans  he suffers from rheumatism in the fingers of his right hand and his niece who is an orphan and lives with him acts as his amanuensis well  stay what is her name  her name kate hickey  how old is she  tush man she is only a little girl if she were old enough to concern you i should not send you into her way have you any more questions to ask about her  i fancy her in a white veil at the rite of confirmation a type of innocence enough of her what says reverend hickey of the apparitions  they are not apparitions i will read you what he says ahem in reply to your inquiries concerning the late miraculous event in this parish i have to inform you that i can vouch for its truth and that i can be confirmed not only by the inhabitants of the place who are all catholics but by every persons acquainted with the former situation of the graveyard referred to including the protestant archdeacon of baltinglas who spends six weeks annually in the neighborhood the newspaper account is incomplete and inaccurate the following are the facts about four years ago a man named wolfe tone fitzgerald settled in this village as a farrier his antecedents did not transpire and he had no family he lived by himself was very careless of his person and when in his cups as he often was regarded the honor neither of god nor man in his conversation indeed if it were not speaking ill of the dead one might say that he was a dirty drunken blasphemous blackguard worse again he was i fear an atheist for he never attended mass and gave his holiness worse language even than he gave the queen i should have mentioned that he was a bitter rebel and boasted that his grandfather had been out in 98 and his father with smith obrien at last he went by the name of brimstone billy and was held up in the village as the type of all wickedness  you are aware that our graveyard situate on the north side of the water is famous throughout the country as the burialplace of the nuns of st ursula the hermit of four mile water and many other holy people no protestant has ever ventured to enforce his legal right of interment there though two have died in the parish within my own recollection three weeks ago this fitzgerald died in a fit brought on by drink and a great hullabaloo was raised in the village when it became known that he would be buried in the graveyard the body had to be watched to prevent its being stolen and buried at the crossroads my people were greatly disappointed when they were told i could do nothing to stop the burial particularly as i of course refused to read any service on the occasion however i bade them not interfere and the interment was effected on the 14th of july late in the evening and long after the legal hour there was no disturbance next morning the graveyard was found moved to the south side of the water with the one newlyfilled grave left behind on the north side and thus they both remain the departed saints would not lie with the reprobate i can testify to it on the oath of a christian priest and if this will not satisfy those outside the church everyone as i said before who remembers where the graveyard was two months ago can confirm me  i respectfully suggest that a thorough investigation into the truth of this miracle be proposed to a committee of protestant gentlemen they shall not be asked to accept a single fact on hearsay from my people the ordnance maps shew where the graveyard was and anyone can see for himself where it is i need not tell your eminence what a rebuke this would be to those enemies of the holy church that have sought to put a stain on her by discrediting the late wonderful manifestations at knock chapel if they come to four mile water they need crossexamine no one they will be asked to believe nothing but their own senses  awaiting your eminences counsel to guide me further in the matter                    i am etc  well zeno said my uncle what do you think of father hickey now  uncle do not ask me beneath this roof i desire to believe everything the reverend hickey has appealed strongly to my love of legend let us admire the poetry of his narrative and ignore the balance of probability between a christian priest telling a lie on his own oath and a graveyard swimming across a river in the middle of the night and forgetting to return  tom hickey is not telling a lie you may take my word on that but he may be mistaken  such a mistake amounts to insanity it is true that i myself awakening suddenly in the depth of night have found myself convinced that the position of my bed had been reversed but on opening my eyes the illusion ceased i fear mr hickey is mad your best course is this send down to four mile water a perfectly sane investigator an acute observer one whose perceptive faculties at once healthy and subtle are absolutely unclouded by religious prejudice in a word send me i will report to you the true state of affairs in a few days and you can then make arrangements for transferring hickey from the altar to the asylum  yes i had intended to send you you are wonderfully sharp and you would make a capital detective if you could only keep your mind to one point but your chief qualifications for this business is that you are too crazy to excite the suspicion of those whom you have to watch for the affair may be a trick if so i hope and believe that hickey has no hand in it still it is my duty to take every precaution  cardinal may i ask whether traces of insanity have ever appeared in our family  except in you and in my grandmother no she was a pole and you resemble her personally why do you ask  because it has often occurred to me that you are perhaps a little cracked excuse my candor but a man who has devoted his life to the pursuit of a red hat who accuses everyone else beside himself of being mad and is disposed to listen seriously to a tale of a peripatetic graveyard can hardly be quite sane depend upon it uncle you want rest and change the blood of your polish grandmother is in your veins  i hope i may not be committing a sin in sending a ribald on the churchs affairs he replied fervently however we must use the instruments put into our hands is it agreed that you go  had you not delayed me with the story which i might as well have learned on the spot i should have been there already  there is no occasion for impatience zeno i must send to hickey and find a place for you i shall tell him you are going to recover your health as in fact you are and zeno in heavens name be discreet try to act like a man of sense do not dispute with hickey on matters of religion since you are my nephew you had better not disgrace me  i shall become an ardent catholic and do you infinite credit uncle  i wish you would although you would hardly be an acquisition to the church and now i must turn you out it is nearly three oclock and i need some sleep do you know your way back to your hotel  i need not stir i can sleep in this chair go to bed and never mind me  i shall not close my eyes until you are safely out of the house come rouse yourself and say goodnight                                       the following is a copy of my first report to the cardinal        four mile water county wicklow                   10th august  my dear uncle  the miracle is genuine i have affected perfect credulity in order to throw the hickeys and countryfolk off their guard with me i have listened to their method of convincing the sceptical strangers i have examined the ordnance maps and crossexamined the neighboring protestant gentlefolk i have spent a day upon the ground on each side of the water and have visited it at midnight i have considered the upheaval theories subsidence theories volcanic theories and tidal wave theories which the provincial savants have suggested they are all untenable there is only one scoffer in the district an orangeman and he admits the removal of the cemetery but says it was dug up and transplanted in the night by a body of men under the command of father tom this is also out of the question the interment of brimstone billy was the first which had taken place for four years and his is the only grave which bears the trace of recent digging it is alone on the north bank and the inhabitants shun it after night fall as each passerby during the day throws a stone upon it it will soon be marked by a large cairn the graveyard with a ruined stone chapel still standing in its midst is on the south side you may send down a committee to investigate the matter as soon as you please there can be no doubt as to the miracle having actually taken place as recorded by hickey as for me i have grown so accustomed to it that if the county wicklow were to waltz off with me to middlesex i should be quite impatient of any expression of surprise from my friends in london  is not the above a businesslike statement away then with this stale miracle if you would see for yourself a miracle which can never pall a vision of youth and health to be crowned with garlands for ever come down and see kate hickey whom you suppose to be a little girl illusion my lord cardinal illusion she is seventeen with a bloom and a brogue that would lay your asceticism in ashes at a flash to her i am an object of wonder a strange man bred in wicked cities she is courted by six feet of farming material chopped off a spare length of coarse humanity by the almighty and flung into wicklow to plough the fields his name is phil langan and he hates me i have to consort with him for the sake of father tom whom i entertain vastly by stories of your wild oats sown at salamanca i exhausted my authentic anecdotes the first day and now i invent gallant escapades with spanish donnas in which you figure as a youth of unstable morals this delights father tom infinitely i feel that i have done you a service by thus casting on the cold sacerdotal abstraction which formerly represented you in kates imagination a ray of vivifying passion  what a country this is a hesperidean garden such skies adieu uncle                    zeno legge                                       behold me at four mile water in love i had been in love frequently but not oftener than once a year had i encountered a woman who affected me so seriously as kate hickey she was so shrewd and yet so flippant when i spoke of art she yawned when i deplored the sordidness of the world she laughed and called me poor fellow when i told her what a treasure of beauty and freshness she had she ridiculed me when i reproached her with her brutality she became angry and sneered at me for being what she called a fine gentleman one sunny afternoon we were standing at the gate of her uncles house she looking down the dusty road for the detestable langan i watching the spotless azure sky when she said  how soon are you going back to london  i am not going back to london miss hickey i am not yet tired of four mile water  i am sure that four mile water ought to be proud of your approbation  you disapprove of my liking it then or is it that you grudge me the happiness i have found here i think irish ladies grudge a man a moments peace  i wonder you have ever prevailed on yourself to associate with irish ladies since they are so far beneath you  did i say they were beneath me miss hickey i feel that i have made a deep impression on you  indeed yes youre quite right i assure you i cant sleep at night for thinking of you mr legge its the best a christian can do seeing you think so mightly little of yourself  you are triply wrong miss hickey wrong to be sarcastic with me wrong to discourage the candor with which you think of me sometimes and wrong to discourage the candor with which i always avow that i think constantly of myself  then you had better not speak to me since i have no manners  again did i say you had no manners the warmest expressions of regard from my mouth seem to reach your ears transformed into insults were i to repeat the litany of the blessed virgin you would retort as though i had been reproaching you this is because you hate me you never misunderstand langan whom you love  i dont know what london manners are mr legge but in ireland gentlemen are expected to mind their own business how dare you say i love mr langan  then you do not love him  it is nothing to you whether i love him or not  nothing to me that you hate me and love another  i didnt say i hated you youre not so very clever yourself at understanding what people say though you make such a fuss because they dont understand you here as she glanced down the road she suddenly looked glad  aha i said  what do you mean by aha  no matter i will now show you what a mans sympathy is as you perceived just then langanwho is too tall for his age bythebyis coming to pay you a visit well instead of staying with you as a jealous woman would i will withdraw  i dont care whether you go or stay im sure i wonder what you would give to be as fine a man as mr langan  all i possess i swear it but solely because you admire tall men more than broad views mr langan may be defined geometrically as length without breadth altitude without position a line on the landscape not a point in it  how very clever you are  you dont understand me i see here comes your lover stepping over the wall like a camel and here go i out through the gate like a christian good afternoon mr langan i am going because miss hickey has something to say to you about me which she would rather not say in my presence you will excuse me  oh ill excuse you he said boorishly i smiled and went out before i was out of hearing kate whispered vehemently to him i hate that fellow  i smiled again but i had scarcely done so when my spirits fell i walked hastily away with a coarse threatening sound in my ears like that of the clarionets whose sustained low notes darken the woodland in der frieschutz i found myself presently at the graveyard it was a barren place enclosed by a mud wall with a gate to admit funerals and numerous gaps to admit peasantry who made short cuts across it as they went to and fro between four mile water and the market town the graves were mounds overgrown with grass there was no keeper nor were there flowers railings or any other conventionalities that make an english graveyard repulsive a great thornbush near what was called the grave of the holy sisters was covered with scraps of cloth and flannel attached by peasant women who had prayed before it there were three kneeling there as i enterd for the reputation of the place had been revived of late by the miracle and a ferry had been established close by to conduct visitors over the route taken by the graveyard from where i stood i could see on the opposite bank the heap of stones perceptibly increased since my last visit marking the deserted grave of brimstone billy i strained my eyes broodingly at it for some minutes and then descended the river bank and entered the boat  good evenin tyour honor said the ferryman and set to work to draw the boat over hand by a rope stretched across the water  good evening is your business beginning to fall off yet  faith it never was as good as it might a been the people that comes from the south side can see billys gravelord have mercy on himacross the wather and they think bad of payin a penny to put a stone over him its them that lives towrst dublin that makes the journey your honor is the third ive brought from the south to north this blessed day  when do most people come in the afternoon i suppose  all hours sur except afther dusk there isnt a sowl in the counthry ud come within sight of the grave wanst the sun goes down  and you do you stay here all night by yourself  the holy heavens forbid is it me stay here all night no your honor i tether the boat at siven ohlyock and lave brimstone billygod forgimmeto take care of it tll mornin  it will be stolen some night im afraid  arra whod dar come next or near it let alone stale it faith id think twice before lookin at it meself in the dark god bless your honor an granche long life  i had given him sixpence i went on to the reprobates grave and stood at the foot of it looking at the sky gorgeous with the descent of the sun to my english eyes accustomed to giant trees broad lawns and stately mansions the landscape was wild and inhospitable the ferryman was already tugging at the rope on his way back i had told him that i did not intend to return that way and presently i saw him make the painter fast to the south bank put on his coat and trudge homeward i turned to the grave at my feet those who had interred brimstone billy working hastily at an unlawful hour and in fear of molestation by the people had hardly dug a grave they had scooped out earth enough to hide their burden and no more a stray goat had kicked away the corner of the mound and exposed the coffin it occurred to me as i took some of the stones from the cairn and heaped them to repair the breach that had the miracle been the work of a body of men they would have moved the one grave instead of the many even from a supernatural point of view it seemed strange that the sinner should have banished the elect when by their superior numbers they might so much more easily have banished him  it was almost dark when i left the spot after a walk of half a mile i recrossed the water by a bridge and returned to the farm house in which i lodged here finding that i had enough of solitude i only stayed to take a cup of tea then i went to father hickeys cottage  kate was alone when i entered she looked up quickly as i opened the door and turned away disappointed when she recognized me  be generous for once i said i have walked about aimlessly for hours in order to avoid spoiling the beautiful afternoon for you by my presence when the sun was up i withdrew my shadow from your path now that darkness has fallen shed some light on mine may i stay half an hour  you may stay as long as you like of course my uncle will soon be home he is clever enough to talk to you  what more sarcasm come miss hickey help me to spend a pleasant evening it will only cost you a smile i am somewhat cast down four mile water is a paradise but without you it would be lonely  it must be very lonely for you i wonder why you came here  because i heard that the women here were all zerlinas like you and the men masettos like mr philwhere are you going to  let me pass mr legge i had intended never speaking to you again after the way you went on about mr langan today and i wouldnt either only my uncle made me promise not to take any notice of you because you wereno matter but i wont listen to you any more on the subject  dont go i swear never to mention his name again i beg your pardon for what i said you shall have no further cause for complaint will you forgive me  she sat down evidently disappointed by my submission i took a chair and placed myself near her she tapped the floor impatiently with her foot i saw that there was not a movement that i could make not a look not a tone of voice which did not irritate her  you were remarking i said that your uncle desired you take no notice of me because  she closed her lips and did not answer  i fear that i have offended you again by my curiosity but indeed i had no idea that he had forbidden you to tell me the reason  he did not forbid me since you are so determined to find out  no excuse me i do not wish to know i am sorry i asked  indeed perhaps you would be sorrier if you were told i only made a secret of it out of consideration for you  then your uncle has spoken ill of me behind my back if that be so there is no such thing as a true man in ireland i would not have believed it on the word of any woman alive save yourself  i never said my uncle was a backbiter just to shew you what he thinks of you i will tell you whether you want to know or not that he bid me not mind you because you were only a poor mad creature sent down here by your family to be out of harms way  oh miss hickey  there now you have got it out of me and i wish i had bit my tongue out first i sometimes thinkthat i maynt sinthat you have a bad angel in you  i am glad you told me this i said gently do not reproach yourself for having done so i beg your uncle has been misled by what he has heard of my family who are all more or less insane far from being mad i am actually the only rational man named legge in the three kingdoms i will prove this to you and at the same time keep your indiscretion in countenance by telling you something i ought not to tell you it is this i am not here as an invalid or a chance tourist i am here to investigate the miracle the cardinal a shrewd and somewhat erratic man selected mine from all the long heads at his disposal to come down here and find out the truth of father hickeys story would he have entrusted such a task to a madman think you  the truth ofwho dared to doubt my uncles word and so you are a spy a dirty informer  i started the adjective she had used though probably the commonest expression of contempt in ireland is revolting to an englishman  miss hickey i said there is in me as you have said a bad angel do not shock my good angelwho is a person of tastequite away from my heart lest the other be left undisputed monarch of it hark the chapel bell is ringing the angelus can you with that sound softening the darkness of the village night cherish a feeling of spite against one who admires you  you come between me and my prayers she said hysterically and began to sob she had scarcely done so when i heard voices without then langan and the priest entered  oh phil she cried running to him take me away from him i cant bear i turned towards him and shewed him my dogtooth in a false smile he felled me at one stroke as he might have felled a poplartree  murdher exclaimed the priest what are you doin phil  hes an informer sobbed kate he came down here to spy on you uncle and to try and show that the blessed miracle was a makeshift i knew it long before he told me by his insulting ways he wanted to make love to me  i rose with difficulty from beneath the table where i had lain motionless for a moment  sir i said i am somewhat dazed by the recent action of mr langan whom i beg the next time he converts himself into a fullingmill to do so at the expense of a man more nearly his equal in strength than i what your niece has told you is partly true i am indeed the cardinals spy and i have already reported to him that the miracle is a genuine one a committee of gentlemen will wait on you tomorrow to verify it at my suggestion i have thought that the proof might be regarded by them as more complete if you were taken by surprise miss hickey that i admire all that is admirable in you is but to say that i have a sense of the beautiful to say that i love you would be mere profanity mr langan i have in my pocket a loaded pistol which i carry from a silly english prejudice against your countrymen had i been the hercules of the ploughtail and you in my place i should have been a dead man now do not redden you are safe as far as i am concerned  let me tell you before you leave my house for good said father hickey who seemed to have become unreasonably angry that you should never have crossed my threshold if i had known you were a spy no not if your uncle were his holiness the pope himself  here a frightful thing happened to me i felt giddy and put my hand on my head three warm drops trickled over it i instantly became murderous my mouth filled with blood my eyes were blinded with it my hand went involuntarily to the pistol it is my habit to obey my impulses instantaneously fortunately the impulse to kill vanished before a sudden perception of how i might miraculously humble the mad vanity in which these foolish people had turned upon me the blood receded from my ears and i again heard and saw distinctly  and let me tell you langan was saying that if you think yourself handier with cold lead than you are with your fists ill exchange shots with you and welcome whenever you please father toms credit is the same to me as my own and if you say a word against it you lie  his credit is in my hands i said i am the cardinals witness do you defy me  there is the door said the priest holding it open before me until you can undo the visible work of gods hand your testimony can do no harm to me  father hickey i replied before the sun rises again upon four mile water i will undo the visible work of gods hand and bring the pointing finger of the scoffer upon your altar  i bowed to kate and walked out it was so dark that i could not at first see the garden gate before i found it i heard through the window father hickeys voice saying i wouldnt for ten pounds that this had happened phil hes as mad as a march hare the cardinal told me so  i returned to my lodging and took a cold bath to cleanse the blood from my neck and shoulder the effect of the blow i had received was so severe that even after the bath and a light meal i felt giddy and languid there was an alarumclock on the mantle piece i wound it set the alarum for halfpast twelve muffled it so that it should not disturb the people in the adjoining room and went to bed where i slept soundly for an hour and a quarter then the alarum roused me and i sprang up before i was thoroughly awake had i hesitated the desire to relapse into perfect sleep would have overpowered me although the muscles of my neck were painfully stiff and my hands unsteady from my nervous disturbance produced by the interruption of my first slumber i dressed myself resolutely and after taking a draught of cold water stole out of the house it was exceedingly dark and i had some difficulty in finding the cowhouse whence i borrowed a spade and a truck with wheels ordinarily used for moving sacks of potatoes these i carried in my hands until i was beyond earshot of the house when i put the spade on the truck and wheeled it along the road to the cemetery when i approached the water knowing that no one would dare come thereabout at such an hour i made greater haste no longer concerning myself about the rattling of the wheels looking across to the opposite bank i could see a phosophorescent glow marking the lonely grave of brimstone billy this helped me to find the ferry station where after wandering a little and stumbling often i found the boat and embarked with my implements guided by the rope i crossed the water without difficulty landed made fast the boat dragged the truck up the bank and sat down to rest on the cairn at the grave for nearly a quarter of an hour i sat watching the patches of jackolantern fire and collecting my strength for the work before me then the distant bell of the chapel clock tolled one i arose took the spade and in about ten minutes uncovered the coffin which smelt horribly keeping to windward of it and using the spade as a lever i contrived with great labor to place it on the truck i wheeled it without accident to the landing place where by placing the shafts of the truck upon the stern of the boat and lifting the foot by main strength i succeeded in embarking my load after twenty minutes toil during which i got covered with clay and perspiration and several times all but upset the boat at the southern bank i had less difficulty in getting the coffin ashore dragging it up to the graveyard  it was now past two oclock and the dawn had begun so that i had no further trouble for want of light i wheeled the coffin to a patch of loamy soil which i had noticed in the afternoon near the grave of the holy sisters i had warmed to my work my neck no longer pained me and i began to dig vigorously soon making a shallow trench deep enough to hide the coffin with the addition of a mound the chill pearlcoloured morning had by this time quite dissipated the darkness i could see and was myself visible for miles around this alarmed and made me impatient to finish my task nevertheless i was forced to rest for a moment before placing the coffin in the trench i wiped my brow and wrists and again looked about me the tomb of the holy women a massive slab supported on four stone spheres was grey and wet with dew near it was the thornbush covered with rags the newest of which were growing gaudy in the radiance which was stretching up from the coast on the east it was time to finish my work i seized the truck laid it alongside the grave and gradually pried the coffin off with the spade until it rolled over into the trench with a hollow sound like a drunken remonstrance from the sleeper within i shovelled the earth round and over it working as fast as possible in less than a quarter of an hour it was buried ten minutes more sufficed to make the mound symmetrical and to clear the adjacent ward then i flung down the spade threw up my arms and vented a sigh of relief and triumph but i recoiled as i saw that i was standing on a barren common covered with furze no product of mans handiwork was near me except my truck and spade and the grave of brimstone billy now as lonely as before i turned towards the water on the opposite bank was the cemetery with the tomb of the holy women the thornbush with its rags stirring in the morning breeze and the broken mud wall the ruined chapel was there too not a stone shaken from its crumbling walls not a sign to shew that it and its precinct were less rooted in their place than the eternal hills around  i looked down at the grave with a pang of compassion for the unfortunate wolf tone fitzgerald with whom the blessed would not rest i was even astonished though i had worked expressly to this end but the birds were astir and the cocks crowing my landlord was an early riser i put the spade on the truck again and hastened back to the farm where i replaced them in the cowhouse then i stole into the house and took a clean pair of boots an overcoat and a silk hat these with a change of linen were sufficient to make my appearance respectable i went out again bathed in four mile water took a last look at the cemetery and walked to wicklow whence i traveled by the first train to dublin                                       some months later at cairo i received a packet of irish newspapers and a leading article cut from the times on the subject of the miracle father hickey had suffered the meed of his inhospitable conduct the committee arriving at four mile water the day after i left had found the graveyard exactly where it formerly stood father hickey taken by surprise had attempted to defend himself by a confused statement which led the committee to declare finally that the miracle was a gross imposture the times commenting on this after adducing a number of examples of priestly craft remarked we are glad to learn that the rev mr hickey has been permanently relieved of his duties as the parish priest of four mile water by his ecclesiastical superior it is less gratifying to have to record that it has been found possible to obtain two hundred signatures to a memorial embodying the absurd defence offered to the committee and expressing unabated confidence in the integrity
