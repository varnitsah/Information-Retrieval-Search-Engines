80416865	the late mrs null  by  frank r stockton  1886     chapter i   there was a wide entrance gate to the old family mansion of midbranch but it was never opened to admit the family or visitors although occasionally a load of wood drawn by two horses and two mules came between its tall chestnut posts and was taken by a roundabout way among the trees to a spot at the back of the house where the chips of several generations of sturdy woodchoppers had formed a ligneous soil deeper than the arable surface of any portion of the nine hundred and fifty acres which formed the farm of midbranch this seldom opened gate was in a corner of the lawn and the driving of carriages or the riding of horses through it to the porch at the front of the house would have been the ruin of the short thick grass which had covered that lawn it was generally believed ever since virginia became a state  but there had to be some way for people who came in carriages or on horseback to get into the house and therefore the fence at the bottom of the lawn at a point directly in front of the porch was crossed by a set of broad wooden steps five outside and five inside with a platform at the top these stairs were wide enough to accommodate eight people abreast so that if a large carriage load of visitors arrived none of them need delay in crossing the fence at the outside of the steps ran the narrow road which entered the plantation a quarter of a mile away and passed around the lawn and the garden to the barns and stables at the back  on the other side of the road undivided from it by hedge or fence stretched like a sea gently moved by a groundswell a vast field sometimes planted in tobacco and sometimes in wheat in the midst of this field stood a tall persimmon tree which yearly dropped its halfcandied fruit upon the first light snow of the winter it is true that persimmons quite fit to eat were to be found on this tree at an earlier period than this but such fruit was never noticed by the people in those parts who would not rudely wrench from jack frost his one little claim to rivalry with the sun as a fruitripener to the right of the field was a wide extent of pasture land running down to a small stream or branch which flowing between two other streams of the same kind a mile or two on either side of it had given its name to the place in front to the left lay a great forest of chestnut oak sassafras and sweet gum with here and there a clump of tall pines standing up straight and stiff with an air of puritanic condemnation of the changing fashions of the foliage about them  on one side of the platform of the broad stile which has been mentioned sat one summer afternoon the lady of the house she was a young woman and although her face was a good deal shadowed by her farspreading hat it was easy to perceive that she was a handsome one she was the niece of mr robert brandon the elderly bachelor who owned midbranch and her mother long since dead had called her roberta which was as near as she could come to the name of her only brother  miss robertas father was a man whose mind and time were entirely given up to railroads and although he nominally lived in new york he was for the greater part of the year engaged in endeavors to forward his interests somewhere west of the mississippi two or three months of the winter were generally spent in his city home at these times he had his daughter with him but the rest of the year she lived with her uncle whose household she directed with much good will and judgment the old gentleman did not keep her all the summer at midbranch he knew what was necessary for a young lady who had been educated in germany and switzerland and who had afterwards made a very favorable impression in paris and london and so during the hot weather he took her with him to one of the fashionable southern resorts where they always stayed exactly six weeks  the gentleman who was sitting on the other side of the platform with his face turned towards her had known miss roberta for a year or more having met her at the north and also in the virginia mountains and being now on a visit to the green sulphur springs about four miles from midbranch he rode over to see her nearly every day there was nothing surprising in this because the green sulphur once a much frequented resort had seen great changes and now although the end of the regular season had not arrived it had mr lawrence croft for its only guest there was a spacious hotel there there was a village of cottages of varying sizes there were buildings for servants and managers there was a tenpin alley and a quiet ground there were arbors and swings and a square hole in a stone slab through which a little pool of greenish water could be seen with a tin cup somewhat rusty lying by it but all was quiet and deserted except one cottage in which the man lived who had charge of the place and where mr croft boarded it was very pleasant for him to ride over to midbranch and take a walk with miss roberta and this was what they had been doing today  horseback rides had been suggested but mr brandon objected to these he knew mr croft to be a young man of good family and very comfortable fortune and he liked him very much when he had him there to dinner but he did not wish his niece to go galloping around the country with him to quiet walks in the woods and through the meadows he could of course have no objection a good many of mr brandons principles like certain of his books were kept upon a top shelf but miss roberta always liked to humor the few which the old gentleman was wont to have within easy reach  this afternoon they had rambled through the woods where the hard smooth road wound picturesquely through the places in which it had been easiest to make a road and where the great trunks of the trees were partly covered by clinging vines which miss roberta knew to be either virginia creeper or poison oak although she did not remember which of these had clusters of five leaves and which of three  the horse on which mr croft had ridden over from the springs was tied to a fence near by and he now seemed to indicate by his restless movements that it was quite time for the gentleman to go home but with this opinion mr croft decidedly differed he had had a long walk with the lady and plenty of opportunities to say anything that he might choose but still there was something very important which had not been said and which mr croft very much wished to say before he left miss roberta that afternoon his only reason for hesitation was the fact that he did not know what he wished to say  he was a man who always kept a lookout on the bows of his daily action in storm or in calm in fog or in bright sunshine that lookout must be at his post and upon his reports it depended whether mr croft set more sail put on more steam reversed his engine or anchored his vessel a report from this lookout was what he hoped to elicit by the remark which he wished to make he desired greatly to know whether miss roberta march looked upon him in the light of a lover or in that of an intimate acquaintance whose present intimacy depended a good deal upon the propinquity of midbranch and the green sulphur springs he had endeavored to produce upon her mind the latter impression if he ever wished her to regard him as a lover he could do this in the easiest and most straightforward way but the other procedure was much more difficult and he was not certain that he had succeeded in it how to find out in what light she viewed him without allowing the lady to perceive his purpose was a very delicate operation  i wish said miss roberta poking with the end of her parasol at some halfwithered wild flowers which lay on the steps beneath her that you would change your mind and take supper with us  mr crofts mind was very busy in endeavoring to think of some casual remark some observation regarding man nature or society or even an anecdote or historical incident which if brought into the conversation might produce upon the ladys countenance some shade of expression or some variation in her tone or words which would give him the information he sought for but what he said was are they really suppers that you have or are they only teas  now i know said the lady why you have sometimes taken dinner with us but never supper you were afraid that it would be a tea  lawrence croft was thinking that if this girl believed that he was in love with her it would make a great deal of difference in his present course of action if such were the case he ought not to come here so often or in fact he ought not to come at all until he had decided for himself what he was going to do but what could he say that would cause her for the briefest moment to unveil her idea of himself i never could endure he said those meals which consist of thin shavings of bread with thick plasters of butter aided and abetted by sweet cakes preserves and tea  you should have reserved those remarks she said until you had found out what sort of evening meal we have  he could certainly say something he thought perhaps it might be some little fanciful story which would call up in her mind without his appearing to intend it some thought of his relationship to her as a loverthat is if she had ever had such a notion if this could be done her face would betray the fact but not being ready to make such a remark he said i beg your pardon but do you really have suppers in the english fashion  oh no answered miss roberta we dont have a great cold joint with old cheese and pitchers of brown stout and ale but neither do we content ourselves with thin bread and butter and preserves we have coffee as well as tea hot rolls fleecy and light hot batter bread made of our finest corn meal hot biscuits and stewed fruit with plenty of sweet milk and buttermilk and if anybody wants it he can always have a slice of cold ham  if i could only feel sure thought mr croft that she looked upon me merely as an acquaintance i would cease to trouble my mind on this subject and let everything go on as before but i am not sure and i would rather not come here again until i am and at what hour he asked do you partake of a meal like that  in summer time said miss roberta we have supper when it is dark enough to light the lamps my uncle dislikes very much to be deprived by the advent of a meal of the outdoor enjoyment of a late afternoon or as we call it down here the evening  it would be easy enough thought mr croft for me to say something about my being suddenly obliged to go away and then notice its effect upon her but apart from the fact that i would not do anything so vulgar and commonplace it would not advantage me in the slightest degree she would see through the flimsiness of my purpose and no matter how she looked upon me would show nothing but a wellbred regret that i should be obliged to go away at such a pleasant season i think the hour for your supper said he is a very suitable one but i am not sure that such a variety of hot bread would agree with me  did you ever see more healthylooking ladies and gentlemen than you find in virginia asked miss march  it is not that i want to know if she looks favorably upon me said lawrence croft to himself for when i wish to discover that i shall simply ask her what i wish now to know is whether or not she considers me at all as a lover there surely must be something i can say which will give me a clew the virginians as a rule he replied are certainly a very wellgrown and vigorous race  in spite of the hot bread she said with a smile  just then mr croft believed himself struck by a happy thought you are not prepared i suppose to say in consequence of it and that recalls the fact that so much in this world happens in spite of things instead of in consequence of them  i dont know that i exactly understand said miss roberta  well for instance said mr croft take the case of marriage dont you think that a man is more apt to marry in spite of his belief that he would be much better off as a bachelor than in consequence of a conviction that a benedicts life would suit him better  that said she depends a good deal on the woman  as she said this lawrence glanced quickly at her to observe the expression of her countenance the countenance plainly indicated that its owner had suddenly been made aware that the afternoon was slipping away and that she had forgotten certain household duties that devolved upon her  here comes peggy she said and i must go into the house and give out supper dont you now think it would be well for you to follow our discussion of a virginia supper by eating one  at this moment there arrived at the bottom of the inside steps a small girl very black very solemn and very erect with her hands folded in front of her very straight upanddown calico frock her features expressive of a wooden stolidity which nothing but a hammer or chisel could alter and with large eyes fixed upon a faraway which apparently had disappeared leaving the eyes in a condition of idle outgo  miss rob said this wooden peggy aun judy says its moren time to come housekeep  which means said miss roberta rising that i must go and get my key basket and descend into the storeroom wont you come in we shall find uncle on the back porch  mr croft declined with thanks and took his leave and the lady walked across the smooth grass to the house followed by the rigid peggy  the young man approached his impatient horse and not without some difficulty got himself mounted he had not that facility of sympathetically combining his own will and that of his horse which comes to men who from their early boyhood are wont to consider horses as objects quite as necessary to locomotion as shoes and stockings but lawrence croft was a fair graduate of a riding school and he went away in very good style to his cottage at the green sulphur springs i believe he said to himself as he rode through the woods that miss march expects no more of me than she would expect of any very intimate friend i shall feel perfectly free therefore to continue my investigations regarding two points first is she worth having and second will she have me and i must be very careful not to get the position of these points reversed  when miss roberta went into the storeroom it was peggy who under the supervision of her mistress measured out the fine white flour for the biscuits for supper peggy was being educated to do these things properly and she knew exactly how many times the tin scoop must fill itself in the barrel for the ordinary needs of the family miss roberta stood her eyes contemplatively raised to the narrow window through which she could see a flush of sunset mingling itself with the outer air and peggy scooped once twice thrice four times then she stopped and raising her head there came into the faraway gloom of her eyes a quick sparkle like a flash of black lightning she made another and entirely supplementary scoop and then she stopped and let the tin utensil fall into the barrel with a gentle thud  that will do said miss roberta  that night when she should have been in her bed peggy sat alone by the hearth in aunt judys cabin baking a cake it was a peculiar cake for she could get no sugar for it but she had supplied this deficiency with molasses it was made of miss robertas finest white flour and eggs there were in it and butter and it contained besides three raisins an olive and a prune when the outside of the cake had been sufficiently baked and every portion of it had been scrupulously eaten the good little peggy murmured to herself its powful comfortin for miss rob to have sumfin on her min     chapter ii   about a week after mr lawrence croft had had his conversation with miss march on the stile steps at midbranch he was obliged to return to his home in new york he was not a man of business but he had business and besides this he considered if he continued much longer to reside in the utterly attractionless cottage at the green sulphur springs and rode over every day to the very attractive house at midbranch that the points mentioned in the previous chapter might get themselves reversed he was a man who was proud of being under all circumstances frank and honest with himself he did not wish if it could be avoided to deceive other people but he was prudent and careful about exhibiting his motives and intended course of action to his associates himself however he took into his strictest confidence he was fond of the idea that he went into the battle of life covered and protected by a great shield but that the inside of the shield was a mirror in which he could always see himself looking into this mirror he now saw that if he did not soon get away from miss roberta he would lay down his shield and surrender and it was his intent that this should not happen until he wished it to happen  it was very natural when lawrence reached new york that he should take pleasure in talking about miss roberta march and her family with any one who knew them he was particularly anxious if he could do so delicately and without exciting any suspicion of his object to know as much as possible about sylvester march the ladys father in doing this he did not feel that he was prying into the affairs of others but he could not be true to himself unless he looked well in advance before he made the step on which his mind was set it was in this way that he happened to learn that about two years before miss march had been engaged to be married but that the engagement had been broken off for reasons not known to his informants and he could find out nothing about the gentleman except that his name was junius keswick  the fact that the lady had had a lover put her in a new light before lawrence croft he had had an idea suggested by the very friendly nature of their intercourse that she was a woman whose mind did not run out to love or marriage but now that he knew that she was susceptible of being wooed and won because these things had actually happened to her he was very glad that he had come away from midbranch  the impression soon became very strong upon the mind of lawrence that he would like to know what kind of man was this former lover he had known miss march about a year and at the time of his first acquaintaince with her she must have come very fresh from this engagement to study the man to whom roberta march had been willing to engage herself was to lawrences mode of thinking if not a prerequisite procedure in his contemplated course of action at least a very desirable one  but he was rather surprised to find that no one knew much about mr junius keswick or could give him any account of his present whereabouts although he had been at the time when his engagement was in force a resident of new york to consult a directory was therefore an obvious first step in the affair and with this intent mr croft entered one morning an apothecarys shop in a street which though a busy one was in a rather outoftheway part of the city  we havent any directory sir said the clerk but if you will step across the street you can find one at that little shop with the green door everybody goes there to look at the directory  the green door on the opposite side of the street approached by a single flat step of stone had a tin sign upon it on which was painted  information of every variety furnished within  pushing open the door lawrence entered a long narrow room not very well lighted with a short counter on one side and some desks partially screened by a curtain at the farther end a boy was behind the counter and to him lawrence addressed himself asking permission to look at a city directory  one cent if you look yourself three cents if we look said the boy producing a thick volume from beneath the counter  one cent said lawrence smiling at the oddity of this charge as he opened the book and turned to the letter k  yes said the boy and if the fine print hurts your eyes well look for three cents  at this moment a man came from one of the desks at the other end of the room and handed the boy a letter with which that young person immediately departed the newcomer a smoothshaven man of about thirty with the air of the proprietor or head manager very strong upon him took the boys position behind the counter and remarked to lawrence most people when they first come here think it rather queer to pay for looking at the directory but you see we dont keep a directory to coax people to come in to buy medicines or anything else we sell nothing but information and part of our stock is what you get out of a directory but its the best plan all round for we can afford to give you a clean good book instead of one all jagged and worn and as you pay your money you feel you can look as long as you like and come when you please  it is a very good plan said lawrence closing the book but the name i want is not here  perhaps it is in last years directory said the man producing another volume from under the counter  that wouldnt do me much good said lawrence i want to know where some one resides this year  it will do a great deal of good said the other for if we know where a person has lived inquiries can be made there as to where he has gone sometimes we go back three or four years and when we have once found a mans name we follow him up from place to place until we can give the inquirer his present address what is the name you wanted sir you were looking in the ks  keswick said lawrence junius keswick  the man ran his finger and his eyes down a column and remarked there is keswick but it is peter laborer i suppose that isnt the party  lawrence smiled and shook his head  we will take the year before that said the man with cheerful alacrity heaving up another volume heres two keswicks he said in a moment one john and the other stephen w neither of them right  no said lawrence my man is junius and we need not go any farther back i am afraid the person i am looking for was only a sojourner in the city and that his name did not get into the directory i know that he was here year before last  all right sir said the other pushing aside the volume he had been consulting well find the man for you from the hotel books and what is more we can see those two keswicks that i found last perhaps they were relations of his and he was staying with them if you put the matter in our hands well give you the address tomorrow night provided its an ordinary case but if he has gone to australia or japan of course itll take longer is it crime or relationship  neither replied lawrence  it is generally one of them said the man and if its crime we carry it on to a certain point and then put it into the hands of the detectives for weve nothing to do with police business private or otherwise but if its relationship well go right through with it to the end any kind of information you may want well give you here scientific biographical business healthfulness of localities genuineness of antiquities age and standing of individuals purity of liquors or teas from sample bible items localized china verified in fact anything you want to know we can tell you of course we dont pretend that we know all these things but we know the people who do know or who can find them out by coming to us and paying a small sum the most valuable information which it would take you years to find out can be secured with certainty and generally in a few days we know what to do and where to go and thats the point if its a new bug or a microscope insect we put it into the hands of a man who knows just what high scientific authority to apply to if its the middle name of your next door neighbor well give it to you from his baptismal record im getting up a pamphletcircular which will be ready in about a week and which will fully explain our methods of business with the charges for the different items etc  well said lawrence taking out his pocketbook i want the address of junius keswick and i think i will let you look it up for me what is your charge  it will be two dollars said the man ordinary and if we find inquiries run into other countries we will make special terms and then theres seven cents one for your look and two threes for ours you shall hear from us tomorrow night at your hotel or residence unless you prefer to call here  i will call the day after tomorrow said lawrence producing a fivedollar note  very good replied the proprietor will you please pay the cashier pointing at the same time to a desk behind lawrence which the latter had not noticed  approaching this desk the top of which except for a small space in front was surrounded by short curtains he saw a young girl busily engaged in reading a book he proffered her the note the proprietor at the same time calling out two seven  the girl turned the book down to keep the place then she took the note and opened a small drawer in which she fumbled for some moments closing the drawer she rose to her feet and waved the note over the curtain to her right havent any change eh said the man coming from behind the counter and putting on his hat as the boys not here ill step out and get it  the girl turned up her book and began to read again and lawrence stood and looked at her wondering what need there was of a cashier in a place like this she appeared to be under twenty rather thinfaced and was plainly dressed in a few moments she raised her eyes from her book and said wont you sit down sir i am sorry you have to wait but we are short of change today and sometimes it is hard to get it in this neighborhood  lawrence declined to be seated but was very willing to talk was it the proprietor of this establishment he asked who went out to get the money changed  yes sir she answered that is mr candy  a queer name said lawrence smiling  the girl looked up at him and smiled in return there was a very perceptible twinkle in her eyes which seemed to be eyes that would like to be merry ones and a slight movement of the corners of her mouth which indicated a desire to say something in reply but restrained probably by loyalty to her employer or by prudent discretion regarding conversation with strangers she was silent  lawrence however continued his remarks the whole business seems to me very odd suppose i were to come here and ask for information as to where i could get a fivedollar note changed would mr candy be able to tell me  he would do in that case just as he does in all others she said first he would go and find out and then he would let you know giving information is only half the business finding things out is the other half thats what hes doing now  so when he comes back said lawrence hell have a new bit of information to add to his stock on hand which must be a very peculiar one i fancy  the cashier smiled yes she said and a very useful one too if people only knew it  dont they know it asked lawrence dont you have plenty of custom  at this moment the door opened mr candy entered and the conversation stopped  sorry to keep you waiting sir said the proprietor passing some money to the cashier over the curtain who thereupon handed two dollars and ninetythree cents to lawrence through the little opening in front  if you call the day after tomorrow the information will be ready for you said mr candy as the gentleman departed  on the appointed day lawrence came again and found nobody in the place but the cashier who handed him a note  mr candy left this for you in case he should not be in when you called she said  the note stated that the search for the address of junius keswick had opened very encouragingly but as it was quite evident that said person was not now in the city the investigations would have to be carried on on a more extended scale and a deposit of three dollars would be necessary to meet expenses  lawrence looked from the note to the cashier who had been watching him as he read does mr candy want me to leave three dollars with you he asked  thats what he said sir  well said lawrence i dont care about paying for unlimited investigation in this way if the gentleman i am in search of has left the city and mr candy has been able to find out to what place he went he should have told me that and i would have decided whether or not i wanted him to do anything more  the face of the cashier appeared troubled i think sir she said that if you leave the money mr candy will do all he can to discover what you wish to know and that it will not be very long before you have the address of the person you are seeking  do you really think he has any clew asked lawrence  this question did not seem to please the cashier and she answered gravely though without any show of resentment that is a strange question after i advised you to leave the money  lawrence had a kind heart and it reproached him i beg your pardon said he i will leave the money with you but i desire that mr candy will in his next communication give me all the information he has acquired up to the moment of writing and then i will decide whether it is worth while to go on with the matter or not  he thereupon took out his pocketbook and handed three dollars to the cashier who with an air of deliberate thoughtfulness smoothed out the two notes and placed them in her drawer then she said if you will leave your address sir i will see that you receive your information as soon as possible that will be better than for you to call because i cant tell you when to come  very well said lawrence and i will be obliged to you if you will hurry up mr candy as much as you can and handing her his card he went his way  the way of lawrence croft was generally a very pleasant one for the fortunate conditions of his life made it possible for him to go around most of the rough places which might lie in it his family was an old one and a good one but there was very little of it left and of its scattered remnants he was the most important member but although circumstances did not force him to do anything in particular he liked to believe that he was a rigid master to himself and whatever he did was always done with a purpose when he travelled he had an object in view when he stayed at home the case was the same  his present purpose was the most serious one of his life he wished to marry and if she should prove to be the proper person he wished to marry roberta march and as a preliminary step in the carrying out of his purpose he wanted very much to know what sort of man miss march had once been willing to marry  when five days had elapsed without his hearing from mr candy he became impatient and betook himself to the green door with the tin sign entering he found only the boy and the cashier addressing himself to the latter he asked if anything had been done in his business  yes sir she said and i hoped mr candy would write you a letter this morning before he went out but he didnt he traced the gentleman to niagara falls and i think youll hear something very soon  if inquiries have to be carried on outside of the city said lawrence they will probably cost a good deal and come to nothing i think i will drop the matter as far as mr candy is concerned  i wish you would give us a little more time said the girl i am sure you will hear something in a few days and you need not be afraid there will be anything more to pay unless you are satisfied that you have received the full worth of the money  lawrence reflected for a few moments and then concluded to let the matter go on tell mr candy to keep me frequently informed of the progress of the affair said he and if he is really of any service to me i am willing to pay him but not otherwise  that will be all right said the cashier and if mr candy isis prevented from doing it ill write to you myself and keep you posted  as soon as the customer had gone the boy who had been sitting on the counter thus spoke to the cashier you know very well that old mintstick has given that thing up  i know he has said the girl but i have not  you havent anything to do with it said the boy  yes i have she answered i advised that gentleman to pay his money and im not going to see him cheated out of it of course mr candy doesnt mean to cheat him but he has gone into that business about the origin of the tame blackberry and theres no knowing when hell get back to this thing which is not in his line anyway  i should say it wasnt exclaimed the boy with a loud laugh sendin me to look up them two keswicks who was both put down as cordwainers in year before lasts directory and askin em if there was any juniuses in their families  junius keswick did you say is that the name of the gentleman mr candy was looking for  yes said the boy  presently the cashier remarked i am going to look at the books and she betook herself to the desk at the back part of the shop  in about half an hour she returned and handed to the boy a memorandum upon a scrap of paper you go out now to your lunch she said and while you are out stop at the st winifred hotel where mr candy found the name of junius keswick and see if it is not down again not long after the date which i have put on this slip of paper i think if a person went to niagara falls hed be just as likely to make a little trip of it and come back again as to keep travelling on which mr candy supposes he did if you find the name again put down the date of arrival on this and see if there was any memorandum about forwarding letters  all right said the boy but ill be gone an hour and a half cant cut into my lunch time  in the course of a few days lawrence croft received a note signed candy  co per some illegible initials which stated that mr junius keswick had been traced to a boardinghouse in the city but as the establishment had been broken up for some time endeavors were now being made to find the lady who had kept the house and when this was done it would most likely be possible to discover from her where mr keswick had gone  lawrence waited a few days and then called at the information shop again was mr candy absent and so was the boy the cashier informed him that she had foundthat is that the lady who kept the boardinghouse had been foundand she thought she remembered the gentlemen in question and promised as soon as she could to look through a book in which she used to keep directions for the forwarding of letters and in this way another clew might soon be expected  this seems to be going on better said lawrence but mr candy doesnt show much in the affair who is managing it you  the girl blushed and then laughed a little confusedly i am only the cashier she said  and the laborious duties of your position would of course give you no time for anything else remarked lawrence  oh well said the girl of course it is easy enough for any one to see that i havent much to do as cashier but the boy and mr candy are nearly always out looking up things and i have to do other business besides attending to cash  if you are attending to my business said lawrence i am very glad especially now that it has reached the boardinghouse stage where i think a woman will be better able to work than a man are you doing this entirely independent of mr candy  well sir said the cashier with an honest straightforward look from her gray eyes that pleased lawrence i may as well confess that i am but theres nothing mean about it he has all the same as given it up for hes waiting to hear from a man at niagara who will never write to him and probably hasnt any thing to write and as i advised you to pay the money i feel bound in honor to see that the business is done if it can be done  have you a brother or a husband to help you in these investigations and searches asked lawrence  no said the cashier with a smile sometimes i send our boy and as to boarding houses i can go to them myself after we shut up here  i wish said lawrence that you were married and that you had a husband who would not interfere in this matter at all but who would go about with you and so enable you to follow up your clew thoroughly you take up the business in the right spirit and i believe you would succeed in finding mr keswick but i dont like the idea of sending you about by yourself  i wont deny said the cashier that since i have begun this affair i would like very much to carry it out so if you dont object i wont give it up just yet and as soon as anything happens ill let you know     chapter iii   autumn in virginia especially if one is not too near the mountains is a season in which greenness sails very close to christmas although generally veering away in time to prevent its verdant hues from tingeing that happy day with the gloomy influence of the prophetic proverb about churchyards long after the time when the people of the regions watered by the hudson and the merrimac are beginning to button up their overcoats and to think of weather strips for their windowsashes the dwellers in the land through which flow the appomattox and the james may sit upon their broad piazzas and watch the growing glories of the forests where the crimson stars of the sweet gum blaze among the rich yellows of the chestnuts the lingering green of the oaks and the enduring verdure of the pines the insects still hum in the sunny air and the sun is now a genial orb whose warm rays cheer but not excoriate  the orb just mentioned was approaching the horizon when in an adjoining county to that in which was situated the hospitable mansion of midbranch a little negro boy about ten years old was driving some cows through a gateway that opened on a public road the cows as they were going homeward filed willingly through the gateway which led into a field at the far end of which might be dimly discerned a house behind a mass of foliage but the boy whose head and voice were entirely too big for the rest of him assailed them with all manner of reproaches and impellent adjectives addressing each cow in turn as you sah when the compliant beasts had hustled through the youngster got upon the gate and giving it a push with one bare foot he swung upon it as far as it would go then lifting the end from the surface of the ground he shut it with a bang fastened it with a hook and ran after the cows his wild provocatives to bovine haste ringing high into the evening air  this youth was known as plez his whole name being pleasant valley an inspiration to his mother from the label on a grape box which had drifted into that region from the north he had just stooped to pick up a clod of earth with which to accentuate his vociferations when on rising he was astounded by the apparition of an elderly woman wearing a purple sunbonnet and carrying a furled umbrella of the same color behind the spectacles which were fixed upon him blazed a pair of fiery eyes and the soul of plez shrivelled and curled up within him his downcast eyes were bent upon his upturned toes the clod dropped from his limp fingers and his mouth which had been opened for a yell remained open but the yell had apparently swooned  the words of the old lady were brief but her umbrella was full of jerky menace and when she left him and passed on toward the outer gate plez followed the cows to the house with the meekness of a suspected sheep dog  the cows had been milked some by a rotund black woman named letty and some much to their discomfort by plez himself and it was beginning to grow dark when an open spring wagon driven by a colored man and with a white man on the back seat came along the road and stopped at the gate the driver having passed the reins to the occupant on the back seat got down opened the gate and stood holding it while the other drove the horse into the road which ran by the side of the field to the house behind the trees at this time a passerby if there had been one might have observed partly protruding from behind some bushes on the other side of the public road and at a little distance from the gate the lower portion of a purple umbrella as the spring wagon approached and during the time that it was turning into the gate and while it was waiting for the driver to resume his seat this umbrella was considerably agitated so much so indeed as to cause a little rustling among the leaves when the gate had been shut and the wagon had passed on toward the house the end of the umbrella disappeared and then on the other side of the bush there came into view a sunbonnet of the same color as the umbrella this surmounted the form of an old lady who stepped into the pathway by the side of the road and walked away with a quick active step which betokened both energy and purpose  the house before which not many minutes later this spring wagon stopped was not a fine old family mansion like that of midbranch but it was a comfortable dwelling though an unpretending one the gentleman on the back seat and the driver who was an elderly negro both turned toward the hall door which was open and lighted by a lamp within as if they expected some one to come out on the porch but nobody came and after a moments hesitation the gentleman got down and taking a valise from the back of the wagon mounted the steps of the porch while he was doing this the face of the negro man which could be plainly seen in the light from the hall door grew anxious and troubled when the gentleman set his valise on the porch and stood by it without making any attempt to enter the old man put down the reins and quickly descending from his seat hurried up the steps  dunno whar ole miss is but i reckon she done gone to look after de tukkies she dreffle keerful dat dey all go to roos ebery night walk right in mahs junius and taking up the valise he followed the gentleman into the hall  there near the back door stood the rotund black woman and behind her plez look hyar letty said the negro man whar ole miss  dunno said the woman she done gib out supper an i aint seed her sence is dis mahs junius reckon you don member letty  yes i do said the gentleman shaking hands with her but the letty i remember was a rather slim young woman  dats so said letty with a respectful laugh but shuh nuf my foods been blessed to me mahs junius  but whars ole miss persisted the old man you letty cant you go look her up  now was heard the voice of plez who meekly emerged from the shade of letty ole miss done gone out to de road gate said he i seen her when i brung de cows  bress my soul ejaculated letty out to de road gate an spectin you too mahs junius  didnt she say nuffin to you

yoursef comfble ole miss boun to be back dreckly ill go put up de hoss  as the old man went heavily down the porch steps he muttered to himself i was feared o sumfin like dis i done feel it in my bones  the gentleman took a seat in the parlor where letty had preceded him with a lamp reckon ole miss didnt spec you quite so soon mahs junius cos de sorrel hoss is powful slow and uncle isham is mighty keerful ob rocks in de road reckon shes done gone ober to see ole aun patsy whos gwine to die in two or free days to take her some red an yaller pieces for a crazy quilt i know shes got some

exclaimed master junius two hundred  yes sah answered letty doctor peters old jim was moren a hunnerd when he died an we all knows aun patsy is twice as ole as ole jim  ill wait here said master junius taking up a book i suppose she will be back before long  in about half an hour uncle isham came into the kitchen his appearance indicating that he had had a hurried walk and told letty that she had better give master junius his supper without waiting any longer for her mistress she aint at aun patsys said the old man and shes jus done gone somewhar else and shell come back when shes a mind to an dar aint nuffin else to say bout it  supper was eaten a pipe was smoked on the porch and master junius went to bed in a room which had been carefully prepared for him under the supervision of the mistress but the purple sunbonnet and the umbrella of the same color did not return to the house that night  master junius was a quiet man and fond of walking and the next day he devoted to long rambles sometimes on the roads sometimes over the fields and sometimes through the woods but in none of his walks nor when he came back to dinner and supper did he meet the elderly mistress of the house to which he had come that evening as he sat on the top step of the porch with his pipe he summoned to him uncle isham and thus addressed the old man  i think it is impossible isham that your mistress started out to meet me and that an accident happened to her i have walked all over this neighborhood and i know that no accident could have occurred without my seeing or hearing something of it  uncle isham stood on the ground his feet close to the bottom step his hat was in his hand and his upturned face wore an expression of earnestness which seemed to set uncomfortably upon it mahs junius said he dar aint no acciden come to ole miss shes done gone cos she wanted to an she aint come back cos she didnt want to dats ole miss right fru  i suppose said the young man that as she went away on foot she must be staying with some of the neighbors if we were to make inquiries it certainly would not be difficult to find out where she is  mahs junius said uncle isham his black eyes shining brighter and brighter as he spoke dars culled people an white folks too in dis yer county whod put on dere bes clothes an black dere shoes an skip off wid alacrousness to do de wus kin o sin dat dey knowed for sartin would send em down to de deepes and hottes gullies ob de lower regions but nuffin in dis worl could make one o dem people go quirin bout ole miss when she didnt want to be quired about  the smoker put down his pipe on the top step beside him and sat for a few moments in thought then he spoke isham he began i want you to tell me if you have any notion or idea  mahs junius exclaimed the old negro scuse me fur intruptin but i cant help it don you go an ax an ole man like me if i tinks dat ole miss went away cos you was comin an if its my true blief dat shell neber

comin back i begs you mahs junius don ax me dat  master junius rose to his feet all right isham he said i shall not worry your good old heart with questions and he went into the house  the next day this quiet gentleman and good walker went to see old aunt patsy who had apparently consented to live a day or two longer gave her a little money in lieu of pieces for her crazy bedquilt and told her he was going away to stay he told uncle isham he was going away to stay away and he said the same thing to letty and to plez and to two colored women of the neighborhood whom he happened to see then he took his valise which was not a very large one and departed he refused to be conveyed to the distant station in the spring wagon saying that he much preferred to walk uncle isham took leave of him with much sadness but did not ask him to stay and letty and plez looked after him wistfully still holding in their hands the coins he had placed there with the exception of these coins the only thing he left behind him was a sealed letter on the parlor table directed to the mistress of the house  toward the end of that afternoon two women came along the public road which passed the outer gate one came from the south and rode in an open carriage evidently hired at the railroad station the other was on foot and came from the north she wore a purple sunbonnet and carried an umbrella of the same color when this latter individual caught sight of the approaching carriage then at some distance she stopped short and gazed at it she did not retire behind a bush as she had done on a former occasion but she stood in the shade of a tree on the side of the road and waited as the carriage came nearer to the gate the surprise upon her face became rapidly mingled with indignation the driver had checked the speed of his horses and without doubt intended to stop at the gate this might not have been sufficient to excite her emotions but she now saw clearly having not been quite certain of it before that the occupant of the carriage was a lady and apparently a young one for she wore in her hat some brightcolored flowers the driver stopped got down opened the gate and then mounting to his seat drove through leaving the gate standing wide open  this contempt of ordinary proprietary requirements made the old lady spring out from the shelter of the shade brandishing her umbrella she was about to cry out to the man to stop and shut the gate but she restrained herself the distance was too great and besides she thought better of it she went again into the shade and waited in about ten minutes the carriage came back but without the lady this time the driver got down shut the gate after him and drove rapidly away  if blazing eyes could crack glass the spectacles of the old lady would have been splintered into many pieces as she stood by the roadside the end of her umbrella jabbed an inch or two into the ground after standing thus for some five minutes she suddenly turned and walked vigorously away in the direction from which she had come  uncle isham letty and the boy plez were very much surprised at the arrival of the lady in the carriage she had asked for the mistress of the house and on being assured that she was expected to return very soon had alighted paid and dismissed her driver and had taken a seat in the parlor her valise rather larger than that of the previous visitor was brought in and put in the hall she waited for an hour or two during which time letty made several attempts to account for the nonappearance of her mistress who she said was away on a visit but was expected back every minute and when supper was ready she partook of that meal alone and after a short evening spent in reading she went to bed in the chamber which letty prepared for her  before she retired letty who had shown herself a very capable attendant said to her wots your name miss i allus likes to know the names o ladies i waits on  my name said the lady is mrs null     chapter iv   the autumn sun was shining very pleasantly when about nine oclock in the morning mrs null came out on the porch and standing at the top of the steps looked about her she had on her hat with the red flowers and she wore a short jacket into the pockets of which her hands were thrust with an air which indicated satisfaction with the circumstances surrounding her the old dog lying on the grass at the bottom of the steps looked up at her and flopped his tail upon the ground mrs null called to him in a cheerful tone and the dog arose and hesitatingly put his forefeet on the bottom step then when she held out her hand and spoke to him again he determined that come what might he would go up those forbidden steps and let her pat his head this he did and after looking about him to assure himself that this was reality and not a dog dream he lay down upon the doormat and with a sigh of relief composed himself to sleep a black turkey gobbler who looked as if he had been charred in a fire followed by five turkey hens also suggesting the idea that water had been thrown over them before anything but their surfaces had been burned came timidly around the house and stopped before venturing upon the greensward in front of the porch then seeing nobody but mrs null they advanced with bobbing heads and swaying bodies to look into the resources of this seldom explored region plez who was coming from the spring with a pail of water on his head saw the dog on the porch and the turkeys on the grass and stopped to regard the spectacle he looked at them and he looked at mrs null and a grin of amused interest spread itself over his face  mrs null went down the steps and approached the boy plez said she if your mistress or anybody should come here this morning you must run over to pine top hill and call me im going there to read  don you want me to go wid yer and show you de way miss null asked plez preparing to set down his pail  oh no said she i know the way and with her hands still in her pockets from one of which protruded a rolledup novel she walked down to the little stream which ran from the spring crossed the plank and took the path which led by the side of the vineyard to pine top hill  this lady visitor had now been here two days waiting for the return of the mistress of the little estate and the sojourn had evidently been of benefit to her good air the good meals with which letty had provided her and a sort of sympathy which had sprung up in a very sudden way between her and everything on the place had given brightness to her eyes she even looked a little plumper than when she came and certainly very pretty she climbed pine top hill without making any mistake as to the best path and went directly to a low piece of sunwarmed rock which cropped out from the ground not far from the bases of the cluster of pines which gave the name to the hill an extended and very pretty view could be had from this spot and mrs null seemed to enjoy it looking about her with quick turns of the head as if she wanted to satisfy herself that all of the scenery was there apparently satisfied that it was she stretched out her feet withdrew her gaze from the surrounding country and regarded the toes of her boots now she smiled a little and began to speak  freddy said she i must think over matters and have a talk with you about them nothing could be more proper than this since we are on our wedding tour you keep beautifully in the background which is very nice of you for thats what i married you for but we must have a talk now for we havent said a word to each other nor perhaps thought of each other during the whole three nights and two days that we have been here i expect these people think it very queer that i should keep on waiting for their mistress to come back but i cant help it i must stay till she comes or he comes and they must continue to think it funny and as for mr croft i suppose i should get a letter from him if he knew where to write but you know freddy we are travelling about on this wedding tour without letting anybody especially mr croft know exactly where we are he must think it an awfully wonderful piece of good luck that a young married couple should happen to be journeying in the very direction taken by a gentleman whom he wants to find and that they are willing to look for the gentleman without charging anything but the extra expenses to which they may be put we wouldnt charge him a cent you know freddy null but for the fear that he would think we would not truly act as his agents if we were not paid and so would employ somebody else we dont want him to employ anybody else we want to find junius keswick before he does and then maybe we wont want mr croft to find him at all but i hope it will not turn out that way he said it was neither crime nor relationship and of course it couldnt be what i hope is that it is good fortune but thats doubtful at any rate i must see junius first if i can possibly manage it if she would only come back and open her letter there might be no more trouble about it for i dont believe he would go away without leaving her his address isnt all this charming freddy and dont you feel glad that we came here for our wedding tour of course you dont enjoy it as much as i do for it cant seem so natural to you but you are bound to like it the very fact of my being here should make the place delightful in your eyes mr null even if i have forgotten all about you ever since i came  that afternoon as mrs null was occupying some of her continuous leisure in feeding the turkeys at the back of the house she noticed two colored men in earnest conversation with isham when they had gone she called to the old man uncle isham she said what did those men want  tell you what tis miss null said isham removing his shapeless felt hat dis yere place is gittin wus an wus on de careen an wats gwine to happen if ole miss don come back is moren i kin tell dars no groun ploughed yit for wheat an dem two hans been gaged to come do it an dey put it off an put it off till ole miss got as mad as hot coals an now at las deyve come an shes not hyar an nuffin can be done de wheatll be free inches high on ebery oder farm fore ole miss git dem plough hans agin  that is too bad uncle isham said mrs null when land that ought to be ploughed isnt ploughed it all grows up in old field pines dont it  it don do dat straight off miss null said the old negro his gray face relaxing into a smile  no i suppose not said she i have heard that it takes thirty years for a whole forest of old field pines to grow up but they will do it if the land isnt ploughed now uncle isham i dont intend to let everything be at a standstill here just because your mistress is away that is one reason why i feed the turkeys if they died or the farm all went wrong i should feel that it was partly my fault  yaasm said uncle isham passing his hat from one hand to the other as he delivered himself a little hesitatinglyyaasm if you wasnt hyar praps ole miss mought come back  now uncle isham said mrs null you mustnt think your mistress is staying away on account of me she left home as letty has told me over and over because your master junius came of course she thinks hes here yet and she dont know anything about me but if her affairs should go to rack and ruin while i am here and able to prevent it i should think it was my fault thats what i mean uncle isham and now this is what i want you to do i want you to go right after those men and tell them to come here as soon as they can and begin to plough do you know where the ploughing is to be done  oh yaasm said uncle isham dar aint ony one place fur dat its de clober fiel ober dar on de udder side ob de gyarden  and what is to be planted in it asked mrs null  ob course deys gwine to plough for wheat answered uncle isham a little surprised at the question  i dont altogether like that said mrs null her brows slightly contracting ive read a great deal about the foolishness of southern people planting wheat they cant compete with the great wheat farms of the west which sometimes cover a whole county and of course having so much they can afford to sell it a great deal cheaper than you can here and yet you go on year after year paying every cent you can rake and scrape for fertilizing drugs and getting about a teacupful of wheatthat is proportionately speaking i dont think this sort of thing should continue uncle isham it would be a great deal better to plough that field for pickles now there is a steady market for pickles and so far as i know there are no pickle farms in the west  pickles ejaculated the astonished isham do you mean miss null to put dat fiel down in kukumbers at dis time o yeah  well said mrs null thoughtfully i dont know that i feel authorized to make the change at present but i do know that the things that pay most are small fruits and if you people down here would pay more attention to them you would make more money but the land must be ploughed and then well see about planting it afterward your mistress will probably be home in time for that you go after the men and tell them i shall expect them to begin the first thing in the morning and if there is anything else to be done on the farm you come and tell me about it tomorrow im going to take the responsibility on myself to see that matters go on properly until your mistress returns  letty and her son plez occupied a cabin not far from the house while uncle isham lived alone in a much smaller tenement near the barn and chicken house that evening he went over to lettys taking with him as a burnt offering a partially consumed and still glowing log of hickory wood from his own hearthstone jes lemme tell you dis hyar letty said he after making up the fire and seating himself on a stool near by ef you want to see ole miss come back rarin an chargin jes you let her know dat miss null is gwine

mighty little  does you reckon she kill her ef she come back an fin her no kin asked letty  uncle isham pushed his stool back and started to his feet with a noise which woke plez who had been soundly sleeping on the other side of the fireplace and striding to the door the old man went out into the open air returning in less than a minute he put his head into the doorway and addressed the astonished woman who had turned around to look after him look hyar you letty i don want to hear no sech fool talk bout ole miss you dunno ole miss nohow you only come hyar seben year ago when dat plez

come back an fin me dar lone     chapter v   when lawrence croft now took his afternoon walks in the city he was very glad to wear a light overcoat and to button it too but although the air was getting a little nipping in new york he knew that it must still be balmy and enjoyable in virginia he had never been down there at this season but he had heard about the virginia autumns and besides he had seen a lady who had had a letter from roberta march in this letter miss march had written that as her father intended making a trip to texas and therefore would not come to new york as early as usual she would stay at least a month longer with her uncle brandon and she was glad to do it for the weather was perfectly lovely and she could stay outofdoors all day if she wanted to  lawrences walks although very invigorating on account of the fine sharp air were not entirely cheering for they gave him an opportunity to think that he was making no progress whatever in his attempt to study the character of junius keswick he had entrusted the search for that gentlemans address to mr candys cashier who had informed him most opportunely that she was about to set out on a wedding tour and that she had possessed herself of clues of much value which could be readily followed up in connection with the projected journey but a fortnight or more had elapsed without his hearing anything from her and he had come to the conclusion that hymeneal joys must have driven all thoughts of business out of her little head  after hearing that roberta march intended protracting her stay in the country the desire came to him to go down there himself he would like to have the novel experience of that region in autumn and he would like to see roberta but he could not help acknowledging to himself that the proceeding would scarcely be a wise one especially as he must go without the desired safeguard of knowing what kind of man miss march had once been willing to accept he felt that if he went down to the neighborhood of midbranch one of the battles of his life would begin and that when he held up before him his figurative shield he would see in its inner mirror that on account of his own disposition toward the lady he was in a condition of great peril but for all that he wanted very much to go and no one will be surprised to learn that he did go  he was a little embarrassed at first in regard to the pretext which he should make to himself for such a journey whatever satisfactory excuse he could make to himself in this case would of course do for other people although he was not prone to make excuses for his conduct to other people in general he knew he would have to give some reason to mr brandon and miss roberta for his return to virginia so soon after having left it he determined to make a visit to the mountains of north carolina and as midbranch would lie in his way of course he would stop there this he assured himself was not a subterfuge it was a very sensible thing to do he had a good deal of time on his hands before the city season at least for him would begin and he had read that the autumn was an admirable time to visit the country of the french broad how long a stop he would make at midbranch would be determined by circumstances he was sorry that he would not be able to look upon miss roberta with the advantage of knowing her former lover but it was something to know that she had had a lover with this fact in his mind he would be able to form a better estimate of her than he had formed before  the man who lived in the cottage at the green sulphur springs was somewhat surprised when mr croft arrived there and desired to make arrangements as before for board and the use of a saddle horse but although it was not generally conceded this man knew very well that there was no water in the world so suitable to remedy the wear and tear of a city life as that of the green sulphur springs and therefore nobody could consider the young gentleman foolish for coming back again while the season permitted  lawrence arrived at his cottage in the morning and early in the afternoon of the same day he rode over to midbranch he found the country a good deal changed and he did not like the changes his road which ran for much of its distance through the woods was covered with leaves some green and some red and yellow and he did not fancy the peculiar smell of these leaves which reminded him in some way of that gathering together of the characters in oldfashioned comedies shortly before the fall of the curtain in many places where there used to be a thick shade the foliage was now quite thin and through it he could see a good deal of the sky the virginia creepers or poison oaks whichever they were were growing red upon the trunks of the trees as if they had been at table too long and showed it and when he rode out of the woods he saw that the fields which he remembered as wide swelling slopes of green with cattle and colts feeding here and there were now being ploughed into corrugated stretches of monotonous drab and brown if he had been there through all the gradual changes of the season he probably would have enjoyed them as much as people ordinarily do but coming back in this way the altered landscape slightly shocked him  when he had turned into the midbranch gate but was still a considerable distance from the house he involuntarily stopped his horse he could see the broad steps which crossed the fence of the lawn and on one side of the platform on the top sat a lady whom he instantly recognized as miss roberta and on the other side of the platform sat a gentleman these two occupied very much the same positions as lawrence himself and miss march had occupied when we first became acquainted with them lawrence looked very sharply and earnestly at the gentleman could it be mr brandon no it was a much younger person  his first impulse was to turn and ride away but this would be silly and unmanly and he continued his way to the stile his disposition to treat the matter with contempt made him feel how important the matter was to him the gentleman on the platform first saw lawrence and announced to the lady that some one was coming miss march turned around and then rose to her feet  upon my word she exclaimed elevating her eyebrows a good deal more than was usual with her if that isnt mr croft  who is he asked the other also rising  he is a new york gentleman whom i know very well he was down here last summer but i cant imagine what brings him here again  lawrence dismounted tied his horse and approached the steps miss roberta welcomed him cordially coming down a little way to shake hands with him then she introduced the two gentlemen  mr croft she said let me make you acquainted with mr keswick  the afternoon or the portion of it that was left was spent on the porch mr brandon joining the party it was to him that lawrence chiefly talked for the most part about the game and scenery of north carolina with which the old gentleman was quite familiar but lawrence had sufficient regard for himself and his position in the eyes of this family to help make a good deal of general conversation what he said or heard however occupied only the extreme corners of his mind the main portion of which was entirely filled with the chilling fear that that man might be the keswick he was looking for of course there was a bare chance that it was not for there might be a numerous family but even this little stupid glimmer of comfort was extinguished when mr brandon familiarly addressed the gentleman as junius  lawrence took a good look at the man he was anxious to study and as far as outward appearances were concerned he could find no fault with roberta for having accepted him he was taller than croft and not so correctly dressed he seemed to be a person whom one would select as a companion for a hunt a sail or a talk upon political economy there was about him an air of present laziness but it was also evident that this was a disposition that could easily be thrown off  lawrences mind was not only very much occupied but very much perturbed it must have been all a mistake about the engagement having been broken off if this had been the case the easy friendliness of the relations between keswick and the old gentleman and his niece would have been impossible once or twice the thought came to lawrence that he should congratulate himself for not having avowed his feelings toward miss roberta when he had an opportunity of doing so but his predominant emotion was one of disgust with his previous mode of action if he had not weighed and considered the matter so carefully and had been willing to take his chances as other men take them he would at least have known in what relation he stood to roberta and would not have occupied the ridiculous position in which he now felt himself to be  when he took his leave roberta went with him to the stile as they walked together across the smooth short grass a new set of emotions arose in lawrences mind which drove out every other they were grief chagrin and even rage at not having won this woman as to actual speech there was nothing he could say although his soul boiled and bubbled within him in his desire to speak but if he had anything to say now was his chance for he had told them that he would proceed with his journey the next day  miss roberta had a way of looking up and looking down at the same time particularly when she had asked a question and was waiting for the answer her face would be turned a little down but her eyes would look up and give a very charming expression to those upturned eyes and if she happened to allow the smile with which she ceased speaking to remain upon her pretty lips she generally had an answer of some sort very soon if for no other reason it would be given that she might ask another question it was in this manner she said to lawrence do you really go away from us tomorrow  yes said he i shall push on  do you not find the country very beautiful at this season asked miss roberta after a few steps in silence  i dont like autumn answered lawrence everything is drying up and dying i would rather see things dead  roberta looked at him without turning her head but it will be just as bad in north carolina she said  there is an autumn in ourselves he answered just as much as there is in nature i wont see so much of that down there  in some cases said roberta slowly autumn is impossible  they had reached the bottom of the steps and lawrence turned and looked toward her do you mean he asked when there has been no real summer  roberta laughed of course said she if there has been no summer there can be no autumn but you know there are places where it is summer all the time would you like to live in such a clime  lawrence croft put one foot on the step and then he drew it back miss march said he my train does not leave until the afternoon and i am coming over here in the morning to have one more walk in the woods with you may i  certainly she said i shall be delighted that is if you can overlook the fact that it is autumn  when miss roberta returned to the house she found junius keswick sitting on a bench on the porch she went over to him and took a seat at the other end of the bench  so your gentleman is gone he said  yes she answered but only for the present he is coming back in the morning  what for asked keswick a little abruptly  miss roberta took off her hat for there was no need of a hat on a shaded porch and holding it by the ribbons she let it gently slide down toward her feet he is coming she said speaking rather slowly to take a walk with me and i know very well that when we have reached some place where he is sure there is no one to hear him he is going to tell me that he loves me that he did not intend to speak quite so soon but that circumstances have made it impossible for him to restrain himself any longer and he will ask me to be his wife  and what are you going to say to him asked keswick  i dont know replied roberta her eyes fixed upon the hat which she still held by its long ribbons  the next morning junius keswick who had been up a long long time before breakfast sat after that meal looking at roberta who was reading a book in the parlor she is a strange girl thought he i cannot understand her how is it possible that she can sit there so placidly reading that volume of huxley which i know she never saw before and which she has opened just about the middle on a morning when she is expecting a man who will say things to her which may change her whole life i could almost imagine that she has forgotten all about it  peggy who had just entered the room to inform her mistress that aunt judy was ready for her stood in rigid uprightness her torpid eyes settled upon the lady i reckon so ran the thought within the mazes of her dark little interior dat miss robs wuss disgruntled dan she was dat ebenin when i make my cake fur she got two difent kinds o shoes on  the morning went on and keswick found that he must go out again for a walk although he had rambled several miles before breakfast after her household duties had been completed miss roberta took her book out to the porch and about noon when her uncle came out and made some remarks upon the beauty of the day she turned over the page at which she had opened the volume just after breakfast an hour later peggy brought her some luncheon and felt it to be her duty to inform miss rob that she still wore one old boot and a new one when roberta returned to the porch after making a suitable change she found keswick there looking a little tired  has your friend gone he asked in a very quiet tone  he has not come yet she answered  not come exclaimed keswick thats odd however there are two hours yet before dinner  the two hours passed and no lawrence croft appeared nor came he at all that day about dusk the man at the green sulphur springs rode over with a note from mr croft the note was to miss march of course and it simply stated that the writer was very sorry he could not keep the appointment he had made with her but that it had suddenly become necessary for him to return to the north without continuing the journey he had planned that he was much grieved to be deprived of the opportunity of seeing her again but that he would give himself the pleasure at the earliest possible moment of calling on miss march when she arrived in new york  when miss roberta had read this note she handed it to keswick who when he returned it asked does that suit you  no said she it does not suit me at all     chapter vi   it was mail day at the very small village known as howletts and to the fence in front of the postoffice were attached three mules and a horse inside the yard tied to the low bough of a tree was a very lean and melancholy horse on which had lately arrived wesley green the negro man who twice a week brought the mail from pocohontas a railway station twenty miles away there was a station not six miles from howletts but for some reason the mail bag was always brought from and carried to pocohontas wesley green requiring a whole day for a deliberate transit between the two points  in the postoffice which was the front room of a small wooden house approached by a high flight of steps was the postmistress miss harriet corvey who sat on the floor in one corner while before her extended a semicircle of men and boys in this little assemblage certain elderly men occupied seats which were considered to belong to them quite as much as if they had been hired pews in a church and behind them stood up a row of tall young men and barefooted boys of the neighborhood while farthest in the rear were some quiet little darkies with mail bags slung across their shoulders  on a chair to the right and most convenient to  miss harriet sat old madison chalkley the biggest and most venerable citizen of the neighborhood mr chalkley never by any chance got a letter the only mail matter he received being the southern baptist recorder which came on saturdays but like most of the people present he was at the postoffice every mail day to see who got anything next to him sat colonel iston a tall lean quiet old gentleman who had for a long series of years occupied the position of a last apple on a tree he had no relatives no friends with whom he corresponded no business that was not conducted by word of mouth in the last fifteen years he had received but one letter and that had so surprised him that he carried it about with him three days before he opened it and then he found that it was really intended for a gentleman of the same name in another county and yet everybody knew that if colonel iston failed to appear in his place on mail day it would be because he was dead or prostrated by sickness  with the mail bag on the floor at her left miss harriet totally oblivious of any law forbidding the opening of the mails in public would put her hand into its open mouth draw forth a letter or a paper hold it up in front of her spectacles and call out the name of its owner most of the letters went to the black boys with the mail bags who came from country houses in the neighborhood but whoever received letter journal or agricultural circular received also at the same time the earnest gaze of everybody else in the room sometimes there was a letter for which there was no applicant present and then miss harriet would say is anybody going past mrs willis summerses and if anybody was he would take the letter and it is to be hoped he remembered to deliver it in the course of a week  in spite of the precautions of the postmistress uncalled for letters would gradually accumulate and there was a little bundle of these in one of the few pigeon holes in a small desk in the corner of the room in the drawer of which the postage stamps were kept now and then a registered letter would arrive and this always created considerable sensation in the room and if the legal recipient did not happen to be present miss harriet never breathed a quiet breath until he or she had been sent for had taken the letter and given her a receipt sometimes she sat up as late as eleven oclock at night on mail days hoping that some one who had been sent for would arrive to relieve her of a registered letter  all the mail matter had been distributed everybody but mr madison chalkley had left the room and when the old gentleman as was his wont on the first day of the month had gone up to the desk untied the bundle of uncalledfor letters the outer ones permanently rounded by the tightness of the cord and after carefully looking over them one by one had made his usual remark about the folly of people who wouldnt stay in a place until their letters could get to them had tied up the bundle and taken his departure then miss harriet put the empty mail bag under the desk and went upstairs where an old lady sat by the window sewing in the fading light  no letters for you today mrs keswick said she  of course not was the answer i didnt expect any  dont you think said miss harriet taking a seat opposite the old lady that it is about time for you to go home and attend to your affairs  well upon my word said mrs keswick letting her hands and her work fall in her lap thats truly hospitable i didnt expect it of you harriet corvey  i wouldnt have said it returned the postmistress if i hadnt felt dead certain that you knew you were always welcome here but tony miles told me just before the mail came in that the lady whos at your place is running it herself and that shes going to use pickle brine for a fertilizer  very likely said mrs keswick her face totally unmoved by this intelligencevery likely thats the way they used to do in ancient times or something of the same kind they used to sow salt over their enemys land so that nothing would ever grow there that womans family has sowed salt over the lands of me and mine for three generations and its quite natural she should come here to finish up  there was a little silence after this and then miss  harriet remarked your people must know where you are why dont they come and tell you about these things  they know better answered mrs keswick with a grim smile i went away once before and uncle isham hunted me up and he got a lesson that hell never forget when i want them to know where i am ill tell them  but really and trulysaid miss harriet and you know i only speak to you for your own good for you pay your board here and if you didnt youd be just as welcomedo you intend to keep away from your own house as long as that lady chooses to stay there  exactly so long answered the old lady i shall not keep them out of my house if they choose to come to it no member of my family ever did that there is the house and they are free to enter it but they shall not find me there if there was any reason to believe that everything was dropped and done with i would be as glad to see him as anybody could be but i knew from his letter just what he was going to say when he came and as things have turned out i see that it was all worse than i expected he and roberta march were both coming and they thought that together they could talk me down and make me forgive and be happy and all that stuff but as i wasnt there of course he wouldnt stay and so there she is now by herself she thinks i must come home after a while and the minute i do that back hell come and then theyll have just what they wanted but i reckon shell find that i can stick it out just as long as she can if roberta march turns things upside down there itll be because she cant keep her hands out of mischief and that proves that she belongs to her own family if theres any harm done it dont matter so much to me and it will be worse for him in the end and now harriet corvey if youve got to make up the mail to go away early in the morning youd better have supper over and get about it  meanwhile at mrs keswicks house mrs null was acting just as conscientiously as she knew how she had had some conversations with freddy on the subject and she had assured him and at the same time herself that what she was doing was the only thing that could be done it was dreadfully hard for me to get the money to come down here she said to himyou not helping me a bit as ordinary husbands doand i cant afford to go back until i have accomplished something its very strange that she stays away so long without telling anybody where she has gone to but i know she is queer and i suppose she has her own reasons for what she does she cant be staying away on my account for she doesnt know who i am and wouldnt have any objections to me if she did know i suspect it is something about junius which keeps her away and i suppose she thinks he is still here but one of them must soon come back and if i can see him or find out from her where he is it will be all right it seems to me freddy that if i could have a good talk with junius things would begin to look better for you and me and then i want to put him on his guard about this gentleman who is looking for him by the way i suppose i ought to write a letter to mr croft or hell think i have given up the job and will set somebody else on the track and that is what i dont want him to do i cant say that i have positively anything to report but i can say that i have strong hopes of success considering where i am as soon as i found that junius had really left the north i concluded that this would be the best place to come to for him and now freddy theres nothing for us to do but to wait and if we can make ourselves useful here im sure we will be glad to do it we both hate being lazy and a little housekeeping and farm managing will be good practice for us during our honeymoon  putting on her hat she went down into the garden where uncle isham was at work she could find little to do there for he was merely pulling turnips and she could see nothing to suggest in regard to his method of work she had found too that the old negro had not much respect for her agricultural opinions he attended to his work as if his mistress had been at home and although in regard to the ploughing he had carried out the orders of mrs null he had done it because it ought to be done and because he was very glad for some one else to take the responsibility  uncle isham said she after she had watched the process of turnip pulling for a few minutes if you havent anything else to do when you get through with this you might come up to the house and i will talk to you about the flower beds i suppose they ought to be made ready for the winter  miss null said the old man slowly unbending his back and getting himself upright dars allus sumfin else to do eber sence i was fus bawn dar was sumfin else to do an i specs itll keep on dat ar way till de day i dies  of course there will be nothing else to do then but to die observed mrs null but i hope that day is far off uncle isham  dunno bout dat miss null said he but den some people do lib dreffle long look at ole aun

again im going straight off to see her  when she had reached the house and had informed letty where she was going the rotund maid expressed high approbation of the visit and offered to send plez to show miss null the way  i dont need any one to go with me said that lady and away she started  she don neber want nobody to show her nowhar said plez returning with looks of much disapprobation to his business of peeling potatoes for dinner  when mrs null reached the cabin of aunt patsy after about fifteen minutes walk she entered without ceremony and found the old woman sitting on a very low chair by the window with the muchtalkedof manycolored quilt in her lap her white woolly head was partially covered with a red and yellow handkerchief and an immense pair of ironbound spectacles obstructed the view of her small black face lined and seamed in such a way that it appeared to have shrunk to half its former size in her long bony fingers rusty black on the outside and a very pale tan on the inside she held a coarse needle and thread and a corner of the quilt near by in front of a brickpaved fireplace was one of her greatgranddaughters a girl about eighteen years old who was down upon her hands and knees engaged with lungs more powerful than ordinary bellows in blowing into flame a coal upon the hearth  how dye aunt patsy said mrs null i didnt expect to see you looking so well  dats miss null said the girl raising her eyes from the fire and addressing her ancestor  the old woman stuck her needle into the quilt and reached out her hand to her visitor who took it cordially  how dye miss said aunt patsy in a thin but quite firm voice while the young woman got up and brought mrs null a chair very short in the legs very high in the back and with its splitoak bottom very much sunken  how are you feeling today aunt patsy asked mrs null gazing with much interest on the aged face  bout as common replied the old woman i didnt spec to be libin dis week but i aint got my quilt done yit

patsy said mrs null i hope it wont be done for a long time  don do to be waitin too long miss de fus thing you know some udder culled pussonll be dyin wrop up in a quilt like dis and git dar fus  mrs null now looked about her with much interest and asked many questions in regard to the old womans comfort and ailments to these the answers though on the whole satisfactory were quite short aunt patsy apparently much preferring to look at her visitor than to talk to her and a very pretty young woman she was to look at with a face which had grown brighter and plumper during every day of her country sojourn  when mrs null had gone promising to send aunt patsy something nice to eat the old woman turned to her greatgranddaughter and said did anybody come wid her  nobody comed said the girl reckon she done git hersef los some o dese days  the old woman made no answer but folding up the maniac coverlid she handed it to the girl and told her to put it away  that night uncle isham by mrs nulls orders carried to aunt patsy a basket containing various good things considered suitable for an aged colored woman without teeth  miss annie sen dese hyar asked the old woman taking the basket and lifting the lid  miss annie exclaimed uncle isham who she  git out uncle isham said aunt patsy somewhat impatiently she was hyar dis mawnin  dat was miss null said isham  miss annie all de same said

dar was sumfin crooked when miss annie didnt tole me who she was ise not feared to tell ole miss an you jes carry me up dar uncle isham  ill do dat said the old man much delighted with the idea of

exclaimed aunt patsy angrily i aint gwine to hab no hosses to run away an chuck me out on de road ef you kin fotch de oxen an de cart i go long wid you but i don want no hosses  dats fus rate said isham ill fotch de ox cart an carry you ober when you want ter go  dunno jes now said aunt patsy pushing away a block of wood which served for a footstool and making elaborate preparations to rise from her chair ill sen fur you when is ready  the next morning was a very busy one for aunt patsys son toms yellow boy bobs child and by afternoon it was necessary to send for two colored women from a neighboring cabin to assist in the preparations which aunt patsy was making for her projected visit an old hair covered trunk which had not been opened for many years was brought out and the contents exposed to the unaccustomed light of day two coarse cotton petticoats were exhumed and ordered to be bleached and ironed a yellow flannel garment of the same nature was put aside to be mended with some red pieces which were rolled up in it out of several yarn stockings of various ages and lengths two were selected as being pretty much alike and laid by to be darned an old black frock with full bishop sleeves a good deal mended and dreadfully wrinkled was given to one of the neighbors expert in such matters to be ironed and the propriety of making use of various other ancient duds was eagerly and earnestly discussed aunt patsy whose vitality had been wonderfully aroused now that there was some opportunity for making use of it spent nearly two hours turning over examining and reflecting upon a pair of oldfashioned corsets which although they had been long cherished she had never worn she now hoped that the occasion for their use had at last arrived but the utter impossibility of getting herself into them was finally made apparent to her and she mournfully returned them to the trunk  washing starching ironing darning patching and an immense deal of talk and consultation occupied that and a good deal of the following day the rest of which was given up to the repairing of an immense pair of green baize shoes without which aunt patsy could not be persuaded to go into the outer air it was saturday morning when she began to dress for the trip and although isham wearing a high silk hat and a long black coat which had once belonged to a clergyman arrived with the ox cart about noon the old woman was not ready to start till two or three hours afterward her assistants who had increased in number were active and assiduous aunt patsy was very particular as to the manner of her garbing and gave them a great deal of trouble it had been fifteen years since she had set foot outside of her house and ten more since she had ridden in any kind of vehicle this was a great occasion and nothing concerning it was to be considered lightly  taint right she said to uncle isham when he arrived fur a powful ole pusson like me to set out on a jarney ob dis kin thout ligious sarvices taint spectable  uncle isham rubbed his head a good deal at this remark dunno wot we gwine to do bout dat he said brudder jeemes lib free miles off an mos like hes out ditchin couldnt git him hyar dis ebenin nohow  well den said aunt patsy you conduc sarvices yoursef uncle isham an we kin have prar meetin anyhow  uncle isham having consented to this he put his oxen under the care of a small boy and collecting in aunt patsys room the five colored women and girls who were in attendance upon her he conducted prars making an extemporaneous petition which comprehended all the probable contingencies of the journey even to the accident of the right wheel of the cart coming off which the old man very reverently asserted that he would have lynched with a regular pin instead of a broken poker handle if he could have found one after the prayer with which aunt patsy signified her entire satisfaction by frequent amens the company joined in the vigorous singing of a hymn in which they stated that they were gwine down to jurdun an tho the road is rough when once we shuh we git dar we all be glad enough de rocks an de stones an de jolts to de bones will be nuffin to de glory an de jiy  the hymn over uncle isham clapped on his hat and hurried menacingly after the small boy who had let the oxen wander along the roadside until one wheel of the cart was nearly in the ditch aunt patsy now partook of a collation consisting of a piece of hoecake dipped in pork fat and a cup of coffee which having finished she declared herself ready to start a chair was put into the cart and secured by ropes to keep it from slipping and then with two women on one side and uncle isham on the other while another woman stood in the cart to receive and adjust her she was placed in position  once properly disposed she presented a figure which elicited the lively admiration of her friends whose number was now increased by the arrival of a couple of negro boys on mules who were going to the postoffice it being saturday and mail day around aunt patsys shoulders was a bright blue worsted shawl and upon her head a voluminous turban of vivid red and yellow since their emancipation the negroes in that part of the country had discarded the positive and gaudy colors that were their delight when they were slaves and had transferred their fancy to delicate pinks pale blues and similar shades but aunt patsys ideas about dress were those of bygone days and she was too old now to change them and her brightest handkerchief had been selected for her head on this important day above her she held a parasol which had been graciously loaned by her descendant of the fourth generation it was white and lined with pink and on the edges still lingered some fragments of cotton lace  uncle isham now took his position by the side of his oxen and started them and slowly creaking aunt patsys vehicle moved off followed by the two boys on mules three colored women and two girls on foot and by two little black urchins who were sometimes on foot but invariably on the tail of the cart when they could manage to evade the backward turn of uncle ishams eye  ef i should go to glory on de road uncle isham said aunt patsy as the right wheel of the cart emerged from a rather awkward rut i don want no fuss made bout me you kin jes bury me in de clothes i got on cepn de pararsol ob course which is lizas jes wrop de quilt all roun me an hab a extry size coffin you neednt do nuffin moren dat  oh yous not gwine to glory dis time aun patsy replied uncle isham who did not want to encourage the idea of the old womans departure from life while in his ox cart but after this remark of the old woman he was extraordinarily careful in regard to jolts and bumps  when the procession reached the domain of miss harriet corvey there was gathered inside the yard quite a number of the usual attendants on mail days awaiting the arrival of wesley green with his waddling horse and leather bag but all interest in the coming of the mail was lost in the surprise and admiration excited by the astounding apparition of old aunt patsy in the ox cart attended by her retinue as the oxen skilfully guided by uncle ishams long prod turned into the yard everybody came forward to find out the reason of this unlookedfor occurrence even old madison chalkley his stout legs swaddled in homemade overalls dismounted from his horse and colonel iston raised his tall form from the porch step where he had been sitting and approached the cart  upon my word said a young fellow with high boots slouched hat and a riding whip if here aint old aunt patsy come after a letter where do you expect a letter from aunt patsy  the old woman fixed her spectacles on him for an instant and then said in a clear voice which could be heard by all the little crowd taint from nobody dat i owes any money to nohow mahs bill trimble  a general laugh followed this rejoinder and uncle isham grinned with gratified pride in the enduring powers of his charge the old woman now put down her parasol and made as if she would descend from the cart  you neednt git out aun patsy said several negro boys at once well fotch your letters to you  git long wid you said the old woman angrily i didnt come here fur no letters ef i wanted letters id sen liza fur em git out de way  a chair was now brought and placed near the cart a woman mounted into the vehicle to assist her uncle isham and another colored man stood ready to receive her and aunt patsy began her descent this to her mind was a much more difficult and dangerous proceeding than getting into the cart and she was very slow and cautious about it first one of her great green baize feet was put over the tail of the cart and resting her weight upon the two men aunt patsy allowed it to descend to the chair where it was gradually followed by the other foot having safely accomplished this much the old woman ejaculated bress de lor when in the same prudent manner she had reached the ground she heaved a sigh of relief and fervently exclaimed de lor be bressed  supported by uncle isham and the other man aunt patsy now approached the steps she was so old so little so bowed and so apparently feeble that several persons remonstrated with her for attempting to go into the house when anything she wanted would be gladly done for her much bliged said the old woman but i don want no letters nor nuffin is come to make a call on de white folks an is gwine in  this announcement was received with a laugh and she was allowed to proceed without further hindrance she got up the porch steps without much difficulty her supporters taking upon themselves most of the necessary exertion but when she reached the top she dispensed with their assistance shuffling to the front door she there met miss harriet corvey who greeted the old woman with much surprise but shook hands with her very cordially  ebenin miss haret said aunt patsy and then lowering her voice she asked is ole miss hyar  miss harriet hesitated a moment and then she answered yes she is but i dont believe shell come down to see you  oh ill go upstars said aunt patsy whar she  shes in the spare chamber said miss harriet and aunt patsy with a nod of the head signifying that she knew all about that room crossed the hall and began slowly but steadily to ascend the stairs miss harriet gazed upon her with amazement for aunt patsy had been considered chairridden when the postmistress was a young woman arrived at the end of her toilsome ascent aunt patsy knocked at the door of the spare chamber and as the voice of her old mistress said come in she went in     chapter vii   when lawrence croft reached the green sulphur springs after his interview with miss march his soul was still bubbling and boiling with emotion and it continued in that condition all night at least during that great part of the night of which he was conscious the sight of the lady he loved under the new circumstances in which he found her had determined him to throw prudence and precaution to the winds and to ask her at once to be his wife  but the next morning lawrence arose very late his coffee had evidently been warmed over and his bacon had been cooked for a long long time the world did not appear to him in a favorable light and he was obliged to smoke two cigars before he was at all satisfied with it while he was smoking he did a good deal of thinking and it was then that he came to the conclusion that he would not go over to midbranch and propose to roberta march such precipitate action would be unjust to himself and unjust to her in her eyes it would probably appear to be the act of a man who had been suddenly spurred to action by the sight of a rival and this if roberta was the woman he believed her to be would prejudice her against him and yet he knew very well that these reasons would avail nothing if he should see her as he intended he had found that he was much more in love with her than he had supposed and he felt positively certain that the next time he was alone with her he would declare his passion  another thing that he felt he should consider was that the presence of keswick if looked upon with a philosophic eye was not a reason for immediate action if the old engagement had positively been broken off he was at the house merely as a family friend while on the other hand if the rupture had not been absolute and if roberta really loved this tall southerner and wished to marry him there was a feeling of honor about lawrence which forbade him to interfere at this moment when she came to new york he would find out how matters really stood and then he would determine on his own action  and yet he would have proposed to roberta that moment if he had had the opportunity her personal presence would have banished philosophy and even honor  lawrence was a long time in coming to these conclusions and it was late in the afternoon when he despatched his note having now given up his north carolina tripone object of which had been still another visit to midbranch on his returnhe was obliged to wait until the next day for a train to the north and consequently he had another evening to devote to reflections these after a time became unsatisfactory he had told the exact truth in his note to roberta for he felt that it was necessary for him to leave that part of the country in order to make impossible an interview for which he believed the proper time had not arrived he was consulting his best interests and also no doubt those of the lady and yet in spite of this reasoning he was not satisfied with himself he felt that his note was not entirely honest and true there was subterfuge about it and something of duplicity this he believed was foreign to his nature and he did not like it  lawrence had scarcely finished his breakfast the next morning when mr junius keswick arrived at the door of his cottage this gentleman had walked over from midbranch and was a little dusty about his boots and the lower part of his trousers lawrence greeted him politely but was unable to restrain a slight indication of surprise it being more pleasant on the porch than in the house mr croft invited his visitor to take a seat there and the latter very kindly accepted the cigar which was offered him although he would have preferred the pipe he had in his pocket  i thought it possible said keswick as soon as the two had fairly begun to smoke that you might not yet have left here and so came over in the hope of seeing you  very kind said lawrence  keswick smiled i must admit said he that it was not solely for the pleasure of meeting you again that i came although i am very glad to have an opportunity for renewing our acquaintance i came because i am quite convinced that miss march wished very much to see you at the time arranged between you and that she was annoyed and discomposed by your failure to keep your engagement considering that you did not and probably could not know this i deemed i would do you a service by informing you of the fact  did miss march send you to tell me this exclaimed lawrence  miss march knows nothing whatever of my coming was the answer  then i must say sir exclaimed lawrence that you have taken a great deal upon yourself  keswick leaned forward and after knocking off the ashes of his cigar on the outside of the railing he replied in a tone quite unmoved by the reproach of his companion it may appear so on the face of it but in fact i am actuated only by a desire to serve miss march for whom i would do any service that i thought she desired and looking at it from your side i am sure that i would be very much obliged to any one who would inform me if i did not know it that a lady greatly wished to see me  why does she want to see me asked croft what has she to say to me  i do not know said keswick i only know that she was very much disappointed in not seeing you yesterday  if that is the case she might have written to me said lawrence  i do not think you quite understand the situation observed his companion miss march is not a lady who would even intimate to a gentleman that she wished him to come to her when it was obvious that such was not his desire but it seemed to me that if the gentleman should become aware of the ladys wishes through the medium of a third party the matter would arrange itself without difficulty  by the gentleman going to her i suppose remarked croft  of course said keswick  there is no of course about it was lawrences rather quick reply  at that moment some letters were brought to him from a little postoffice near by to which he had ordered his mail to be forwarded as the address on one of these letters caught his eye the somewhat stern expression on his face gave place to a smile and begging his visitor to excuse him he put his other letters into his pocket and opened this one it was very short and was from mr candys cashier it was written from howletts virginia a place unknown to him and stated that the writer expected in a very short time to give him some accurate information in regard to mr keswick and expressed the hope that he would allow the affair to remain entirely in her hands until she should write again it was quite natural that under the circumstances lawrence should smile broadly as he folded up this note the man in question was sitting beside him and in a measure was turning the tables upon him lawrence had been very anxious to find out what sort of a man was keswick and the latter now seemed in the way of making some discoveries in the same line in regard to lawrence one thing he must certainly do he must write as soon as possible to his enterprising agent and tell her that her services were no longer needed she must have pushed the matter with a great deal of energy to have brought her down to virginia and he could not help hoping that her discretion was equal to her investigative capacity  when after this little interruption lawrence again addressed junius keswick his manner was so much more affable that the other could not fail but notice it  mr keswick he said as our conversation seems to be based upon personalities perhaps you will excuse me if i ask you if i am mistaken in believing that you were once engaged to be married to miss march  you are entirely correct said junius i was engaged to her and i hope to be engaged to her again  indeed exclaimed croft turning in his chair with a start  yes continued keswick our engagement was dissolved in consequence of a certain family complication and as i said before i hope in time to be able to renew it  lawrence threw away his cigar and sat for a few moments in thought the engagement then did not exist roberta was free recollections came to him of his own intercourse with her during the past summer and his heart gave a bound mr keswick said he upon consideration of the matter i think i will call upon miss march this morning  if keswick had expressed himself entirely satisfied with this decision he would have done injustice to his feelings the service he had taken upon himself to perform for miss march he had considered a duty but if his mission had failed he would have been better pleased than with its success he made however a courteous reply to crofts remark and rose to depart but this the other would not allow  you told me said croft that you walked over here but it is much warmer now and you must not think of such a thing as walking back the man here has a horse and buggy i will get him to harness up and i will drive you over to midbranch  as there was no good reason why he should decline this offer junius accepted it and in half an hour the two were on their way     chapter viii   old mr brandon of midbranch was not in a very happy frame of mind and he had good reasons for dissatisfaction he was an ardent supporter of a marriage between his niece and junius keswick and when the engagement had been broken off he had considered that both these young people had acted in a manner very foolish and contrary to their best interests there was no opposition to the match except from old mrs keswick who was the aunt of junius but who considered herself as occupying the position of a mother junius was the son of a sister who had also married into the keswick family and his parents having died while he was a boy his aunt had taken him under her charge and her house had then became his home although of late years some of his absences had been long ones mrs keswick had no personal objections to roberta never having seen that lady and knowing little of her but an alliance between her junius and any member of that branch of the brandons which to use the old ladys own words had for four generations cheated stripped and scornfully used my people scattering their atoms over the face of three counties was monstrous nothing could make her consent to such an enormity and she had informed junius that if he married that march girl three of them should live togetherhimself his wife and her undying curse in order that miss march might not fail to hear of this postconnubial arrangement she had been informed of it by letter of course this had broken off the engagement for roberta would not live under a curse nor would she tear a man from the only near relative he had in the world keswick himself like most men would have been willing to have this tearing take place for the sake of uniting himself to such a charming creature as roberta march but the lady on one side was as inflexible as the lady on the other and the engagement was definitely and absolutely ended  mr brandon considered all this as stuff and nonsense he could not deny that his branch of the brandons had certainly got a good deal out of mrs keswicks family but here was a chance to make everything all right again and he would be delighted to see junius a relative although a distant one come into possession of midbranch as for the old ladys opposition that should not be considered at all he thought it was his opinion that her mind had been twisted by her bad temper and nothing she could say could hurt anybody  of late mr brandon had been much encouraged by the fact that junius had begun to resume his position as a friend of the family this was all very well if the young people by occasional meetings could keep alive their sentiments toward each other the time would come when all opposition would cease and the marriage would become an assured fact he did not believe either of the young people would care enough for a postmortem curse if there should be one to keep themselves separated from each other on its account for the rest of their lives  but the recent quite unexpected return of lawrence croft to midbranch combined with the evident discomposure into which roberta had been thrown by his failure to come the next day had given the old gentleman some unpleasant ideas his niece had mentioned that she expected mr croft that day and although she said nothing in regard to her subsequent disappointment and vexation his mind was quite acute enough to perceive it exactly what it all meant he knew not but it augured danger for the first time he began to look upon mr croft in the light of a suitor for roberta if a jealous feeling at finding another person on the ground was the cause of his not coming again it showed that he was in earnest and this added to the evident disturbance of mind of both roberta and junius was enough to give mr brandon most serious fears that an obstacle to his cherished plan was arising roberta was fond of city life of society of travel and if she had really made up her mind that her union with junius was no longer to be thought of the advent of a man like croft who had been making her acquaintance all summer and who had now returned to virginia no doubt for the sole purpose of seeing her again was to say the least exceedingly ominous one thing only could correct this deplorable state of affairs the absurd bar to the union of junius and roberta should be removed and they should be allowed to enter upon the happiness that was their right  above all the estate of midbranch should not be suffered to go into the possession of an outsider who might be good enough but who was of no earthly moment or interest to the brandons he would go himself and see the widow keswick and talk her out of her nonsense it was a long time since he had met the old wild cat as he termed her and his recollection of the last interview was not pleasant but he was not afraid of her and he hoped that the common sense of what he would say would bring her to reason  mr brandon made up his mind during the night and when he came down to breakfast he was very glad to find that junius had already gone out for a walk the distance to the widow keswicks house was about fifteen miles a pleasant days ride for the old gentleman and as he did not expect to return until the next day he felt obliged to inform roberta of his destination although of course he said nothing about the object of his visit he told his niece that he was obliged to see the widow keswick on business to which remark she listened without reply  soon after breakfast he mounted his good horse albemarle and early in the afternoon he arrived at the widow keswicks gate he had looked for a stormy reception in which the thunderbolts of rage should burst around him and he was surprised therefore to be received with the frigidity of the north pole  i never expected she said without any previous courtesy to see one of your people under my roof and it is not very long ago since i would have gone away from it the moment any one of you came near it  i am happy madam said mr brandon in his most courteous manner that that day is past  my staying wont do you any good said the old lady whose purple sunbonnet seemed to heave with the uprisal of her hair except perhaps to get you a better meal than the servants would have given you but i want a lawyer and i cant afford to pay for one either and when i saw you coming i just made up my mind to get something out of you and if i do it itll be the first red mark for my side of the family  mr brandon assured her that nothing would give him more pleasure than to assist her in any way in his power  very well then said mrs keswick just sit down on that bench and when we have got through your horse can be taken and you can rest a while though it seems a very curious thing that you should want to stop here to rest  well madam said mr brandon seating himself as comfortably as possible on a wooden bench i shall be happy to hear anything you have to say  the old lady did not sit down but stood up in front of him leaning on her umbrella with which faithful companion she had been about to set out on her walk when my son junius came home a while ago she began  do you still call him your son interrupted mr brandon  indeed i do was the very prompt answer thats just what he is and as i was going to say when he wrote me a short time ago that he was coming here i believed from his letter that he had some scheme on hand in regard to your niece and i made up my mind i wouldnt stay in the house to hear anything more said on that subject i had told him that i never wanted him to say another word about it and it made my blood boil sir to think that he had come again to try to cozen me into the vile compact  madam exclaimed mr brandon  the next day continued mrs keswick a lady arrived and as soon as i saw her drive into the gate i felt sure it was roberta march and that the two had hatched up a plot to come and work on my feelings and so i wouldnt come near the house  madam exclaimed mr brandon how could you dream such a thing of my niece you dont know her madam  no said the old lady i dont know her but i knew she belonged to your family and so i was not to be surprised at anything she did but i found out i was mistaken an old negro woman recognized this young person as the daughter of my younger sister you know there were three of us the child was born and raised here but i have not seen and have scarcely heard of her since she was eight years old  thats very extraordinary madam said mr brandon  no it isnt when you consider the stubbornness the obstinacy and the wickedness of some people my sister sickened when the child was about six years old and her husband harvey peyton  i have frequently heard of him madam said mr brandon  and i wish i never had said she well he was travelling most of the time a thing my sister couldnt do but he came here then and stayed off and on till she died and not long afterward just because i told him that i intended to consider the child as my child and that she should have the name of keswick instead of his name and should know me as her mother and live with me always he got angry and flared up and actually took the child away i gave it to him hot i can tell you before he left and i never saw him again he was so eaten up with rage because i wanted to take the little annie for my own that he filled her mind with such prejudices against me that when he died a year or two ago she actually went to work to get her own living instead of applying to me for help but now she has come down here and i was really filled with joy to have her again and carry out the plan on which my heart had long been setthat is to marry her to her cousin junius and let them have this farm when i am gone  at this mr brandon raised his eyebrows and lowered the corners of his mouth  but i suddenly discover continued the old lady that the little wretch is marriedactually married  at this mr brandon lowered his eyebrows and raised the corners of his mouth did her husband come with her he asked pleasantly and he gave a few long free breaths as if he had just passed in safety a very dangerous and unsuspected rock  no he didnt replied the old lady i dont know where he is and from what i can make out he is an utterly goodfornothing fellow allowing his wife to go where she pleases and take care of herself now this abominable marriage stands square in the way of the plan which again rose up in my mind the moment i heard that the girl was in my house if junius and she should marry there would be no more dangers for me to look out for  but the existence of a husband said mr brandon blandly puts an end to all thoughts of such an alliance  no it dont said the old lady bringing her umbrella down with force on the porch not a bit of it such an outrageous marriage should not be suffered to exist they should be divorced he does nothing for her and neglects and deserts her absolutely theres every ground for a divorce or enough grounds at any rate all thats necessary is for a lawyer to take it up i dont know any lawyers and when i saw you riding up from the road gate i said to myself heres the very man i wantand its full time i should get something from people who have taken nearly everything from me  mr brandon bowed  and now continued the old lady i am going to put the case into your hands the man is evidently a goodfornothing scoundrel and has probably spent the little money that her miserable father left her its a clear case of desertion and there should be no trouble at all in getting the divorce  mr brandon looked down upon the floor of the porch and smiled this was a pretty case he thought to put into his hands here was a marriage which was the strongest protection in the promotion of his own plan and he was asked to annul it very good thought mr brandon very good and he smiled again but he was an oldfashioned gentleman and not used to refuse requests made to him by ladies i will look into it madam said he i will look into it and see what can be done  something must be done said the old lady and the right thing too how long do you intend to stay here  i thought of spending the night madam as my horse and myself are scarcely in condition to continue our journey today  stay as long as you like said mrs keswick i turn nobody from my doors even if they belong to the brandon family i want you to talk to my niece and get all you can out of her about this thing and then you can go to work and blot out this contemptible marriage as soon as possible  the first thing said mr brandon will be to talk to the lady  this reply being satisfactory to mrs keswick uncle isham was called to take the horse and attend to him while the master was invited into the house  mr brandon first met mrs null at supper time and her appearance very much pleased him it is not likely he said to himself that the man lives who would willingly give up such a charming young creature as this they were obliged to introduce themselves to each other as the lady of the house had not yet appeared after a while letty who was in attendance advised them to sit down as de light bread an de batterbread was gittin cole  we could not think of such a thing as sitting at table before mrs keswick arrives said mr brandon  oh dars no knowin when shell come said the blooming letty she may be hyar by breakfus time but dar aint nobuddy in dis yere worl kin tell shes down at de bahn now blowin up plez fur gwine to sleep when he was a shellin de cohnfiel peas an when shes got froo wid him shes got a bone to pick wid uncle isham bout de gyardin taint no use waitin fur ole miss she nebber do come when de bell rings she come when she git ready an not afore  mr brandon now felt quite sure that it was the intention of his hostess not to break bread with one of his family and so he seated himself mrs null taking the head of the table and pouring out the tea and coffee  it has been a long time madam since you were in this part of the country said the old gentleman as he drew the smoking batterbread toward him and began to cut it  yes said mrs null not since i was a little girl i suppose you have heard sir that aunt keswick and my father were on very bad terms and would not have anything to do with each other  oh yes said mr brandon i have heard that  but my father is not living now and i am down here again  and your husband he did not accompany you said mr brandon  no replied mrs null very quickly we were both very sorry that it was not possible for him to come with me  mr brandons spirits began to rise this did not look quite like desertion i have no doubt you have a very good husband i am sure you deserve such a one he said with the air of a father and the purpose of a lawyer  good exclaimed mrs null her eyes sparkling  he couldnt be better if he tried will you have sweet milk or buttermilk  buttermilk if you please said mr brandon of course your aunt was delighted to have you with her again  oh said mrs null with a laugh she was not at home when i arrived but when she returned nothing could be too good for me why she had been here scarcely half an hour and hadnt taken off her sunbonnet before she told me i was to marry junius and we two were to have this farm  a very pleasant plan truly said mr brandon  but then you see continued the young girl mr null stood dreadfully in the way of such an arrangement and when aunt keswick heard about him you cant imagine what a change came over her  oh yes i can yes i can exclaimed mr brandoni can imagine it very well  but she didnt give up a bit said mrs null i dont think she ever does give up  you are right there said mr brandon quite right but what does she propose to do  i dont know im sure but she said i had no right to marry without the consent of my surviving relatives and that she was going to look into it i cant think what she means by that  mr brandon made no immediate answer he gave mrs null some damson preserves and he took some himself and then he helped himself to a great hot roll from a plate that letty had just brought in and carefully opening it he buttered it on the inside and covered onehalf of it with the damson preserves this he began slowly to eat drinking at times from the foaming glass of buttermilk at the side of his plate from which the coffeecup had been removed when he had finished the half roll he again spoke i think my dear young lady that your aunt is desirous of having your marriage set aside  how can she do that exclaimed the girl her face flushing has she been talking to you about it  i cannot deny that she has spoken to me on the subject he answered i being a lawyer but i will say to you in strict confidence please that if you and your husband are sincerely attached to each other there is nothing on earth she can do to separate you  attached exclaimed mrs null it would be impossible for us to be more attached than we are we never have had the slightest difference even of opinion since our wedding day why i believe that we are more like one person than any married couple in the world  i am very glad to hear it said mr brandon finishing his buttermilkvery glad indeed and feeling as you do i am certain that nothing your aunt can say will make any impression on you in regard to seeking a divorce  i should think not said mrs null sitting up very straight divorce indeed  i fully uphold you in the stand you have taken said mr brandon but i beg you will not mention this conversation to your aunt it would only annoy her is your cousin expected here shortly  i believe so she said to be sure my aunt left the house the last time he came but she has his address and has written for him i think she wants us to get acquainted as soon as possible so that no time will be lost in marrying us after poor mr null is disposed of  very good very good said mr brandon with a laugh and now my dear young friend i want to give you a piece of advice stay here as long as you can your aunt will soon perceive the absurdity of her ideas in regard to your husband and will cease to annoy you make a friend of your cousin junius whom i know and respect highly and he certainly will be of advantage to you above all things endeavor to thoroughly reconcile him and mrs keswick so that she will cease to oppose his wishes and to interfere with his future fortune if you can bring back good feeling between these two you will be the angel of the family  thank you said mrs null as they rose from the table  the next morning after mr brandon and mrs null had breakfasted together the mistress of the house having apparently finished the performance of the duties which had kept her from the breakfasttable had some conversation with her visitor in this he repeated very little of what he had said to the younger lady the night before but he assured mrs keswick that he had discovered that it would be a very delicate thing to propose to her niece a divorce from her husband a thing to which she was not at all inclined as he had found  of course not of course not exclaimed mrs keswick she cant be expected to see what a wretched plight she has got herself into by marrying this straggler from nobody knows where  but madam said mr brandon if you worry her about it she will leave you and then all will be at an end now let me advise you as your lawyer keep her here as long as you can do everything possible to foster friendship and good feeling between her and junius and to do this you must forget as far as possible all that has gone by and be friendly with both of them yourself  humph said the widow keswick i didnt ask you for advice of that sort  it is all a part of the successful working of the case madam said mr brandon a thorough good feeling must be established before anything else can be done  i suppose so said the old lady she must learn to like us before she begins to hate him and how about your niece are you going to send her down here to help on in the good feeling  i have not brought my niece into this affair replied mr brandon with dignity  well then see that you dont was the widow keswicks reply and the interview terminated  when mr brandon rode away on his good horse albemarle he looked at the post of the road gate from which he was lifting the latch by means of the long wooden handle arranged for the convenience of riders and said to himself john keswick was a good man but i dont wonder he came out here and shot himself it is a great pity though that it wasnt his wife who did it instead of him that would have been a blessing to all of us but he added contemplatively as he closed the gate the people in this world who ought to blow out their brains never do  soon after he had gone mrs null went up pine top hill and sat down on the rock to have a think now then freddy she said everything depends on you if you dont stand by me i am lostthat is to say i must go away from here before junius comes and you know i dont want to do that i want to see him on my account and on his account too but i dont want him crammed down my throat for a husband the moment he arrives and that is just what will happen if you dont do your duty mr null even if it wasnt for you i dont want to look at him from the husband point of view because of course he is a very different person from what he used to be and is a total stranger to me  it is actually more than twelve years since i have seen him and besides that he is just as good as engaged to that niece of mr brandons who is a horrible mixture of a shewolf and a female mule if i am to believe aunt keswick but i expect she is truly a very nice girl though to be sure she cant have much spirit if she consented to break off her marriage just on account of the backhanded benediction which aunt keswick told me she offered her as a wedding gift if i had wanted to marry a man i would have let the old lady curse the heels off her boots before i would have paid any attention to her cursing dont hurt anybody but the curser  what i want of junius is to make a friend of him if he turns out to be the right kind of a person and to tell him about this mr croft who is so anxious to find him the only person i have met yet who seems like an ordinary christian is old mr brandon and hes a sly one im afraid aunt keswick thinks he stopped here on his way somewhere but i dont believe a word of it i believe he came for reasons of his own and went right straight back again you are almost as much to him freddy as you are to me it would have made you laugh if you could have seen how his face lighted up when he heard we were happy together and that i would not listen to a divorce and yet i am sure he has promised aunt keswick to see what he can do about getting one he wants me to stay here and make friends of aunt keswick and junius but he wouldnt like that if it were not for you mr null you make everything safe for him  and now freddy i tell you again that all depends upon you if im to stay hereand i want to do that for a time any way for although aunt keswick is so awfully queer shes my own aunt and thats more than i can say for anybody else in the worldyou must stiffen up and stand by me it wont do to give way for a minute if necessary you must take tonics and have a steel rod down your back if you cant keep yourself erect without it you must have your legs padded and your chest thrown out and you must stand up very strong and sturdy freddy and not let them push you an inch this way or that and now that we have made up our minds on this subject well go down for its getting a little cool on the top of this hill     chapter ix   on the morning of her uncles departure from midbranch roberta came out on the porch and took her seat in a large wooden armchair putting down her key basket on the floor beside her the day was bright and sunny and the shadows of two or three turkey buzzards who were circling in the air moved over the field in front of the house in this field also moved not so fast nor so gracefully as the shadows two ploughs one near by and the other at quite a distance the woods which shut out a great part of the horizon showed many a bit of color but the scene although bright enough in some of its tones was not a cheering one to roberta and she needed cheering  had it not been for the delay of her father in making his winter visit to new york she would now be in that city but if things had gone on as she expected they would she would have been perfectly satisfied to remain several weeks longer at midbranch junius keswick who had not visited the house for a long time had come to them again and now that the subject of love and marriage had been set aside it was charming to have him there as a friend they not only walked in the woods but they took long rides over the country mr brandon having waived his objections in regard to his niece riding about with gentlemen she had even been pleased with the unexpected return of lawrence croft for for reasons of her own she wished very much to have a talk with him but he had not fulfilled his promise to her and had gone away in a very unsatisfactory manner  this morning she felt a little lonely too for junius had left the place before breakfast and she did not know where he had gone and her uncle had actually ridden away to see that horrible widow keswick merely stating that his errand was a business one and that he would be back the next day roberta knew that there had been a great deal of business particularly that of an unpleasant kind between the two families but she did not believe that there was any ordinary affair concerning dollars and cents which would require the presence of her uncle at the house of his old enemy she was very much afraid that he had gone there to try to smooth up matters in regard to junius and herself the thought of this made her indignant she did not know what her uncle would say and she did not want him to say anything he could not make the horrible old creature change her mind in regard to the marriage and if this was not done there was no use discussing the matter at all and she did not wish people to think she was anxious for the match  it was plain however that her uncles desire for it had experienced a strong revival and the unexpected return of lawrence croft had probably had a great effect on him he had not objected to the visits of that gentleman during the summer but he had never shown any strong liking for him and roberta said to herself that she could not see for her part why this should be mr croft was a thorough gentleman an exceedingly well educated and agreeable man  as to junius she was afraid that he had not the spirit which she used to think he possessed there was something about him she could not understand in former days when junius was in new york she compared him with the young men there very much to his advantage but now mr croft seemed to throw him somewhat in the background when croft wanted to do anything he did it even his failure to come to her when he said he would do so showed strength of will if junius had promised to come he would have come even if he had not wanted to do so and there would have been something weak about that  while she thus sat thinking and gazing over the landscape she saw afar off on a portion of the road which ran alongside the woods a vehicle slowly making its way to the house roberta had large and beautiful eyes but they were not of the kind which would enable her to discover at so great a distance what sort of vehicle this was and who was in it as the road led nowhere but to midbranch she was naturally desirous to know who was coming she stepped into the hall and taking a small bell rang it vigorously and in a moment her youthful handmaiden peggy appeared upon the scene peggys habit of projecting her eyes into the far away could often be turned to practical account for her vision was in a measure telescopic  what is that coming here along the road asked miss roberta stepping upon the porch and pointing out the distant vehicle  peggy stood up straight let her arms hang close to her sides and looked steadfastly forth wots comin miss rob said she is the buggy longin to mister michaels at de springs an his ole mudcolored hoss is haulin it dem dats in it is mahs junius an mister crof  are you sure of that exclaimed miss roberta in astonishment look again  yaasm replied peggy is sartin shuh but dey jes gwine behin de trees now  the road was not again visible for some distance but when the buggy reappeared peggy gave a start and exclaimed dars ony one pusson in it now miss rob  which is it exclaimed her mistress quickly shading her eyes and endeavoring to see for herself  its mister crof said peggy mahs junius mus done gone back  it is too bad exclaimed miss roberta i will not see him peggy she said snatching up the key basket and stepping toward the hall door when that gentleman mr croft comes you must tell him that i am upstairs lying down that i am not well and cannot see him and that your master robert is not at home  ef mahs junius come does you want me to tell him de same thing  but you said he was not in the buggy said her mistress  nom answered peggy but praps he done cut acrost de plough fiel an git hyar fus  if he comes first said miss roberta a shade of severity pervading her handsome features i want to see him and with this she went upstairs  peggy with her shoes on possessed the stolid steadiness of a wooden grenadier for the heaviness of the massive boots seemed to permeate her whole being and communicated what might be considered a slow and heavy footfall to her intellect peggy without shoes was a panther on two legs and her mind like her body was capable of enormous leaps slipping off her heavy brogans she made a single bound and stood upon the railing of the porch and throwing her arm around a post gazed forth from this point of vantage  bress my eberlastin soul she exclaimed if mister crof aint got ter de road gate and is a waitin dar fur somebody to come open it does he think anybody gwine to see him all de way from de house and come open de gate reckin he don know dat ole mudcolor hoss he mought git out and let down de whole fence an dat ole hoss ud nebber move bress my soul moh pintedly ef mahs junius aint comin long ter open de gate  for a few moments peggy stood and stared her mind not capable of grasping this astounding situation no he aint nudder she presently exclaimed with an air of relief mahs junius done tole him dat ef he want dat gate open he better git down and open it hesef dats right mahs junius stick up to dat dar go mahs junius into de woods an mister crof he git out an go after him deys gwine to fight sartin shuh lordee wot fur dey low dem bushes ter grow long de fence to keep folks from seein wots gwine on  there was nothing now to be seen from the railing and peggy jumped down on the porch her activity seemed to pervade her being she ran down the front steps crossed the lawn and mounted the stile here she could catch sight of the two men who seemed to be disputing this was too much for peggy if there was to be a fight she wanted to see it and apart from her curiosity she had a loyal interest in the event down the steps and along the road she went at the top of her speed and soon reached the gate her arrival was not noticed by any one except the mudcolored horse who gazed at her inquiringly and looking through the bars without opening the gate peggy had a good view of the gentlemen  the situation was a more simple one than peggy had imagined the road for the last half mile had been an uphill one and keswick as much to stretch his own legs as to save those of the horse had alighted to walk while lawrence as in duty bound had waited for him at the gate here a little argument had arisen keswick who did not wish to be at the house or indeed about the place while roberta was having her conference with mr croft had said that he had concluded not to go up to the house at present but would take a walk through the woods instead lawrence who thought he divined his reason felt an honorable indisposition to accept this advantage at the hands of a man who was most indisputably his rival if they went together it would not appear as if he had waited for keswicks absence to return and there would still be no reason why he should not have his private walk and talk with miss march  at all events it seemed to him unfair to leave keswick at the gate while he went up to the house by himself and the notion of it did not please him at all keswick however was very resolute in his opposition he objected even to seeing roberta and croft together he thought besides if he and croft came to the house at the same time it would appear very much as if he junius had brought the other and this was an appearance he wished very much to avoid he had walked away and lawrence had jumped from the buggy to continue the friendly argument which was not finished when peggy arrived almost immediately after this event keswick positively insisted that he would go for a walk and lawrence reluctantly turned toward the vehicle  peggys mind was filled with horror master junius had been frightened away and the other man was coming up to the house she could not stand there and allow such a catastrophe jerking open the gate she rushed into the road and confronted keswick  mahs junius she exclaimed miss robs orful sick wid her back an her jints an she say she cant see no kumpny folks an mahs robert he done gone away to see ole miss keswick i jes run down hyar to tell you to hurry up  keswick started where did you say your master robert had gone  to ole miss keswicks he went dis mawnin  junius turned slightly pale and addressing mr croft said something very strange must have happened here miss march is ill and mr brandon has gone to a place to which i think nothing but a matter of the utmost importance could take him  in that case said mr croft it will be highly improper for me to go to the house just now i am very glad that i heard the news before i got there i will return to the springs and will call tomorrow and inquire after miss marchs health do not let me detain you as your presence is evidently much needed at the house  thank you said keswick hurriedly shaking hands with him i am afraid something very unexpected has happened and so beg you will excuse me goodmorning and passing through the gateway he rapidly strode toward the house while lawrence prepared to turn his horses head toward the springs  but although junius keswick walked rapidly peggy who had started first for the house kept well in advance of him away she went skipping running dancing once she stopped and turned and saw that the buggy with the mudcolored horse was being driven away and that master junius was coming along the road to the house then she started off and ran steadily the rapid show of the lightcolored soles of her feet behind her suggestive of a steamers wake up the broad stile she went two steps at a time and down the other side in a couple of jumps a dozen skips took her across the lawn and she bounded up to the porch as if each wooden step had been a springing board she rushed upstairs and stood at the open door of miss robertas room where that lady reclined upon a lounge  hi miss rob she exclaimed involuntarily snapping her fingers as she spoke mahs junius comin all by hesef an i done sent de udder gemman clean off kitin     chapter x   junius keswick was received by miss roberta in the parlor her face was colder and sterner than he had ever seen it before and his countenance was very much troubled each wished to speak first and ask questions but the lady went immediately to the front  how did it happen that you and mr croft were coming here together where had you been  we came from the green sulphur springs where i called on him this morning  i thought he was obliged to return immediately to the north what made him change his mind  perhaps it will be better not to discuss that now said junius  i wish to discuss it was the reply what induced him not to go  i did answered junius looking steadfastly at her did you not wish to see him  for a moment miss roberta did not answer but her face grew pale and she threw herself back in the chair in which she was sitting never in my life she said have i been subjected to such mortification of course i wished him to come but to come of his own accord and not at my bidding how do you suppose i would have felt if he had presented himself and asked me what i wished to say to him it is an insult you have offered me  it is not an insult said keswick quietly it was a service ofof affection i saw that you were annoyed and troubled by mr crofts failure to keep his engagement and what i did was simply  stop said roberta peremptorily i do not wish to talk of it any more  junius stood before her a moment in silence and then he said will you tell me if my aunt keswick is ill or dead and why did mr brandon go there  she is neither answered roberta and he went there on business and with this she arose and left the room  peggy who had been in the hall now made a bolt down the back stairs into the basement regions where was situated the kitchen in this spacious apartment she found aunt judy the cook sitting before a large wood fire and holding in her hand a long iron ladle there was nothing near her which she could dip or stir with a ladle and it was probably retained during her period of leisure as a symbol of her position and authority  peggy squatted on her heels close to aunt judys side and thus addressed her aun judy ef i tell you sumfin soul

peggy an aun judy dat ar piece ob pie aint no count to nobuddy  you kin hab it chile said aunt judy rising and taking from a shelf a large piece of cold apple pie an bressed be de foots ob dem wot fotch good tidins  junius keswick did not see miss roberta again that day and early in the morning he borrowed one of the midbranch horses and rode away he did not wish to be at the house when mr croft should come and besides he was very anxious and disturbed in regard to matters at the keswick farm of all places in the world why should mr brandon go there  it was not a very pleasant ride that junius keswick took that morning he had anxieties in regard to what he would meet with at his aunts house and he had even greater anxieties as to what he was leaving behind him at midbranch it was quite evident that roberta was angry with him and this was enough to sadden the soul of a man who loved her as he loved her who would have married her at any moment in spite of all opposition all threats all curses he was not in the habit of looking at himself after the manner of lawrence croft but on this occasion he could not help a little selfsurvey  was it a purely disinterested motive he asked himself that took him over to the springs to bring back lawrence croft did he not believe in his soul that roberta would never have spoken so freely to him in regard to what the gentleman from the north would probably say to her if she had not intended to decline that gentlemans offer and was there not a wish in his heart that this matter might be definitely and satisfactorily settled before roberta and mr croft went to new york for the winter he could not deny that this issue to the affair had been in his mind and yet he felt that he could conscientiously assure himself that if he had thought things would turn out otherwise he still would have endeavored to make the man perform the duty expected of him by roberta in whose service junius always felt himself to be but apparently he had not benefited himself or anybody else except perhaps croft by this service which he had performed  it was late in the forenoon when junius met mr brandon returning to midbranch in answer to his expressions of surprise mr brandon who appeared in an exceptionally good humor informed junius of his reasons for the visit to the widow keswick and what he had found when he arrived there  your little cousin said he is a most charming young creature and on interested motives i should oppose your going to your aunts house were it not for the fact that she is married and therefore of no danger to you i was very glad to find her there her influence over your aunt will i think be highly advantageous and the first fruit of it is that the old lady will now welcome you with open arms would you believe it she has already announced that she wishes to make a match between you and this little cousin and in order to do so has actually engaged me to endeavor to bring about a divorce between the young lady and her absent husband the widow keswick has as many cranks and crotchets in her head as there are seeds in a tobacco pod but this is the queerest and the wildest of them all the couple seem very much attached to each other and nothing can be said against the husband except that he did not accompany his wife on her visit to her relatives and if he knew anything about the old lady i dont blame him a bit now your course my dear boy is perfectly plain let your aunt talk as much as she pleases about this divorce and your union with the little annie it wont hurt anybody and she must talk herself out in time in the mean time take advantage of the present circumstances to mollify and tone down so to speak the good old lady make her understand that we are all her friends and that there is no one in the connection who would wish to do her the slightest harm this would be our christian duty at any time but it is more particularly our duty now i would like you to bring your cousin over to see us before roberta goes away i invited her to come and told her that my niece would first call upon her were it not for the peculiar circumstances but if the families can be in a measure brought togetherand i shall make it a point to ride over there occasionallyif your aunt can be made to understand the kindly feelings we really have toward her and can be induced to set aside even in a slight degree the violent prejudice she now holds against us all may yet turn out well now go my boy and may the best of success go with you dont trouble yourself about sending back the horse keep him as long as you want him  mr brandon rode on leaving junius to pursue his way it is very pleasant thought the young man who had said scarcely a word during the interview to hear mr brandon talk about all turning out well but when he gets home he may discover that there is something to be done at midbranch as well as on the keswick place  mr brandons reflections were very different from those of junius it appeared to him that a reconciliation between the two families even though it should be a partial one was reasonably to be expected that newly arrived cousin was an angel she was bound to do good a marriage between his niece and junius keswick was the great object of the old gentlemans heart and he longed to see the former engagement between them reestablished before roberta went to new york where her beauty and attractiveness would expose his cherished plan to many dangers  the road he was on led directly north and it was joined about a quarter of a mile above by the road which ran through the woods to the green sulphur springs on this road at a point nearly opposite to him he could see through the foliage a horseman riding toward the point of junction something about this person attracted his attention and mr brandon took out a pair of eyeglasses and put them on as soon as he had obtained another good view of the horseman he recognized him as mr croft the old gentleman took off his glasses and returned them to his vest pocket and his face began to flush in his early acquaintance with mr croft he had not objected to him because he wished his niece to have company and he had a firm belief in the enduring quality of her affection for junius but latterly his ideas in regard to the new york gentleman had changed he had thought him somewhat too assiduous and when he had unexpectedly returned from the north mr brandon had not been at all pleased although he had been careful not to show his displeasure this condition of things made him feel uneasy and had prompted his visit to the widow keswick and now that everything looked so fair and promising here was that man whom he had supposed to have left this part of the country riding toward his house  mr brandon was an easygoing man but he had a backbone which could be greatly stiffened on occasion he sat up very straight on his horse and urged the animal to a better pace so that he arrived first at the point where the roads met here he awaited mr croft who soon rode up the old gentlemans greeting was very courteous  you are on the way to my house i presume he said  mr croft assured him that he was and hoped that miss march was quite well  i have been from home for a little while said mr brandon but i believe my niece enjoys her usual health i have had a long ride this morning he continued and feel a little tired would it inconvenience you sir if we should dismount and sit for a time on yonder log by the roadside it would rest me and i would like to have a little talk with you  lawrence wondered very much that the old gentleman should want to rest when he was not a mile from his own house but of course he consented to the proposed plan and imitated mr brandon by riding under a large tree and fastening his bridle to a lowhanging bough the two gentlemen seated themselves on the log and mr brandon without preface began his remarks  may i be pardoned for supposing sir he said that your present visit to my house is intended for my niece  lawrence looked at him a little earnestly and replied that it was so intended  then sir i think i have the right to ask as my nieces present guardian and almost indeed as her father whether or not your visit is connected in any way with matrimonial overtures toward that lady  not wishing to foolishly and dishonorably deny that such was his purpose in going to midbranch and feeling that it would be as unwise to decline answering the question as it would be unmanly to resort to subterfuge about it lawrence replied that his object in visiting miss march that day was to make matrimonial overtures to her  i think said mr brandon that you will be obliged to me if i make you acquainted with the present condition of affairs between miss march and mr junius keswick  has not their engagement been broken off interrupted lawrence  only conditionally answered the old gentleman they love each other they wish to be married with one exception all their relatives desire that they should marry it would be a union not only congenial in the highest degree to the parties concerned but of the greatest advantage to our family and our family fortunes there is but a single obstacle to this most desirable union and that is the unwarrantable opposition of one person but i am happy to say that this opposition is on the point of being removed i consider it to be but a matter of days when my niece and mr keswick with the full approbation of the relatives on either side will renew in the eyes of the world that engagement which i consider still exists in fact  if this is so said lawrence grinding his heel very deeply into the ground why was i not told of it  my dear sir exclaimed mr brandon have you ever intimated to me or to any of my family that your intentions in visiting midbranch were other than those of an ordinary friend or acquaintance  lawrence admitted that he had never made any such intimation  then sir said mr brandon what reason could we have for mentioning this subject to youa subject that would not have been referred to now had it not been for your admission of your intended object in visiting my house  lawrence had no answer to make to this but it was not easy to turn him from his purpose excuse me sir he said but i think a matter of this sort should be left to the lady if she is not inclined to receive my addresses she will say so and there is an end of it  the face of mr brandon slightly reddened but his voice remained as quiet and courteous as before you do not comprehend sir the state of affairs or you would see that a procedure of that kind would be extremely illjudged at this time were it known that at this critical moment miss march was addressed by another suitor it would seriously jeopardize the success of plans which we all have very much at heart  lawrence did not immediately reply to this crafty speech his teeth were very firmly set and he looked steadfastly before him i do not understand all this he said presently nor do i see that there is any need for my understanding it in fact i have nothing to do with it i wish to propose marriage to miss march if she declines my offer there is an end of the matter if she accepts me then it is quite proper that all your plans should fall to the ground she is the principal in the affair and it is due to her and due to me that she should make the decision in this case  mr brandon had not quite so many teeth as his younger companion but the very fair number which remained with him were set together quite as firmly as those of lawrence had been he remarked speaking very distinctly but without any show of emotion i see sir that it is quite impossible for us to think alike on this subject and there is therefore nothing left for me to do but to ask youand i assure you sir that the request is as destitute of any intention of discourtesy as if it were based upon the presence of sickness or family afflictionthat you will not visit my house at present  lawrence rose to his feet with a good deal of color in his face that settles the matter for the present he said of course i shall not go to a house which is forbidden to me i wish you goodmorning sir and he stalked to his horse and endeavored to pull down the limb to which its bridle was attached  mr brandon followed him you must mount before you can unfasten your bridle he said and allow me to assure you sir that as soon as this little affair is settled i shall be very happy indeed to see you again at my house   lawrence having succeeded in loosening his bridle from the tree made answer with a bow and galloped away to the green sulphur springs  mr brandon now mounted and rode home this was the first time in his life that he had ever forbidden any one to visit midbranch and yet he did not feel that he had been either discourteous or inhospitable there are times he said to himself when a man must stand up for his own interest and this is one of the times     chapter xi   in the little diningroom of the cottage at the green sulphur springs sat that evening lawrence croft a perturbed and angry but a resolute man he had been quite a long time coming to the conclusion to propose to roberta march and now that he had made up his mind to do so even in spite of certain convictions it naturally aroused his indignation to find himself suddenly stopped short by such an insignificant person as mr brandon a gentleman to whom in this affair he had given no consideration whatever the fact that the lady wished to see him added much to his annoyance and discomfiture he had no idea what reason she had for desiring an interview with him but whatever she should say to him he intended to follow by a declaration of his sentiments he had not the slightest notion in the world of giving up the prosecution of his suit but having been requested not to come to midbranch what was he to do he might write to miss march but that would not suit him in a matter like this he would wish to adapt his words and his manner to the moods and disposition of the lady and he could not do this in a letter when he wooed a woman he must see her and speak to her to any clandestine approach any whispered conversation beneath her window he would give no thought having been asked by the master of the house not to go there he would not go but he would see her and tell his love and more than that he would win her  that morning while waiting for the time to approach when it would be proper for him to go to midbranch he had been reading in a bound volume of an old english magazine which was one of the five books the cottage possessed an account of a battle which had interested him very much the commander of one army had massed his forces along and below the crest of a line of low hills the extreme right of his line being occupied by a strong force of cavalry the army opposed to him was much stronger than his own and it was not long before the battle began to go very much against him his positions on the left were carried by the combined charge of the larger portion of the enemys forces and in spite of a vigorous resistance his lines were forced back down the hill and into the valley it was quite evident he could make no stand and was badly beaten thereupon he sent orders to his generals on the left to retreat in as good order as possible across a small river in their rear while this movement was in progress and the enemy was making the greatest efforts to prevent it the commander put himself at the head of his cavalry and led them swiftly from the scene of battle he took them diagonally over the crest of the hill down the other side and then charging with this fresh body of horse upon the rear and camp of the enemy he swiftly captured the generalinchief his staff and the minister of war who had come down to see how things were going on with these important prisoners he dashed away leaving the acephalous enemy to capture his broken columns if he could  this was the kind of thing lawrence croft would like to do for an hour or more he puzzled his brains as to how he should make such a cavalry charge and at last he came to a determination he would ask junius keswick to assist him there was something odd about this plan which pleased croft keswick was his rival with the powerful backing of mr brandon and a whole tribe of relatives and it might naturally be supposed that he was the last man in the world of whom he would ask assistance but looking at it from his point of view lawrence thought that not only would he be taking no undue advantage of the other in asking him to help him in this matter but that keswick ought not and would not object to it if miss march really preferred croft keswick should feel himself bound in honor to do everything he could to let the two settle the affair between themselves this was drawing the point very fine but lawrence persuaded himself that if the case were reversed he would not marry a girl who had not chosen another man simply because she had had no opportunity of doing so he had a strong belief that keswick was of his way of thinking and before he went to bed he wrote his rival a note asking him to call upon him the following day  early the next morning the note was carried over to midbranch by a messenger who returned saying that mr keswick had gone away and that his present address was howletts in the same county this piece of information caused lawrence croft to open his eyes very wide a few days before he had received a letter from mrs null written at howletts and now keswick had gone there he had been very much surprised when he found that the cashier had so successfully carried on the search for keswick as to come into the very county in virginia where he was and he intended to write to her that he had no further occasion for her services but he had not done so and here were the pursuer and the pursued in the same town or village or whatever howletts was he gave mrs null credit for being one of the best detectives he had ever heard of for apparently she had not only been able to successfully track the man she was in search of but to find out where he was going and had reached the place in question before he did but he also berated her soundly in his mind for her overofficiousness he had not wished her to swoop down upon the man but only to inform him of his whereabouts the next thing that would probably happen would be the appearance of mrs null at the green sulphur springs holding keswick by the collar he deeply regretted that he had ever intrusted this young woman with the investigation not because he had since met keswick himself but for the reason that she was entirely too energetic and imprudent if keswick should find out from her that she had been in search of him and why it might bring about a very unpleasant state of affairs  croft saw now quite plainly what he must do he must go to howletts as quickly as possible perhaps keswick and the cashier had not yet met and in that case all he would have to do would be to remunerate the young woman and her husbandfor she had informed him that she intended to combine this business with a wedding tourand send them off immediately he could then have his conference with keswick there as well as at the springs if any mischief had already been done he did not know what course he might have to pursue but it was highly necessary for him to be on the spot as soon as possible he greatly disliked to leave the neighborhood of roberta march but his absence would only be temporary  after an early dinner he mounted the horse which he had hired from his host of the springs and with a valise strapped behind him set out for howletts he had made careful inquiries in regard to the road and after a ride somewhat tiresome to a man not used to such protracted horseback exercise arrived at his destination about sundown when he reached the scattered houses which formed as he supposed the outskirts of the village for such he had been told it was he rode on but soon found that he had left howletts behind him and that those supposed outskirts were the place itself hewletts was nothing in fact but a collection of eight or ten houses quite widely separated from each other and the only one of them which exhibited any public character whatever was the store a large frame building standing a little back from the road turning his horse lawrence rode up to the store and inquired if there was any house in the neighborhood where he could get lodging for the night  the storekeeper who came out to him was a very little man whose appearance recalled to croft the fact that he had noticed in this part of the state a great many men who were extremely tall and a great many who were extremely small which peculiarity he thought might assist a physiologist in discovering the different effects of hot bread upon different organizations he was quite as cordial however as the biggest burliest and jolliest host who ever welcomed a guest to his inn as he informed mr croft that there was no house in the village which made a business of entertaining strangers but if he chose to stop with him he would keep him and his horse for the night and do what he could to make him comfortable  lawrence ate supper that night with the storekeeper his wife and five of his children but as he was very hungry and the meal was a plentiful one he enjoyed the experience  i suppose youre goin on to westerville in the mornin said the little host  no replied croft i am not going any farther than this place do you know if a gentleman named keswick arrived here recently  why yaas said the man if you mean junius keswick  certainly he did said mrs storekeeper he rode through here yesterday and he stopped at the store to see if we had any of that lynchburg tobacco he used to smoke when he lived here hes gone on to his aunts  where is that asked croft  its about two miles out on the westerville road said the little man if id knowed you wanted to see him id a told you to keep right on and you could a stopped with mrs keswick over night  lawrence wished to ask some questions about mrs null but he was afraid to do so lest he might excite suspicions by connecting her with keswick if the latter had gone two miles out of town perhaps she had not yet seen him  the room in which lawrence slept that night was to him a very odd one it was a long apartment at one end of which was a clean comfortable bed a couple of chairs and a table on which was a basin and pitcher at the other end were piles of newlooking boxes containing groceries of various kinds rolls of cotton cloth and other dry goods and what attracted his attention more than anything else a vast number of bright tin cans bearing on their sides brilliant pictures of tomatoes peaches green corn and other preservable eatables these were evidently the reserved stores of the establishment and they were so different from the bedroom decorations to which he was accustomed that it quite pleased lawrence to think that with all his experience in life he was now lodged in a manner entirely novel to him as he lay awake looking at the moonlight glittering on the sides of the multitude of cans the thought came into his mind that this had probably been the room of the nulls when they were here  as this is the only house in the place where travellers are entertained he said to himself of course they must have come to it and as they are not here now it is quite plain that they must have gone away i am very glad of it especially if they left before keswick arrived for their departure probably prevented an awkward situation but i shall ask the storekeeper no questions about these people there is no better way of giving inquisitive folk the entrée to your affairs than by asking questions of course there was no reason why they should stay here after they had successfully traced keswick to this part of the country and every reason if they wanted to enjoy themselves why they should go away but i cant help being sorry that i did not meet the young woman and have an opportunity of paying her for her trouble and giving her a few words of advice in regard to her action or rather nonaction in this matter she has a fine head for business but i should like to feel certain that she understands that her business with me is over  and he turned his eyes from the glittering cans and slept  the next morning lawrence croft rode on to mrs keswicks house and when he reached the second or inner gate he saw on the other side of it an elderly female wearing a purple sunbonnet and carrying a purple umbrella there was something very eccentric about the garb of this elderly personage and many an inexperienced city man would have taken her for a retired nurse or some other domestic retainer of the family but there was a steadfastness in her gaze and a fire in her eye which indicated to lawrence that she was one much more accustomed to give orders than to take them he raised his hat very politely and asked if mr keswick was to be found there  if the commander of the army about whom mr croft had recently been reading had beheld in the earlier stages of the battle a strong friendly force advancing to his aid he would not have been more delighted than lawrence would have been had he known what a powerful ally to his cause stood beneath that purple sunbonnet  do you mean junius keswick said the old lady  yes madam answered croft  he is here and you will find him at the house  the gate was partly open and lawrence rode in the old lady stepped aside to let him pass  do you want to see him on business she said how did you know he was here   i inquired at howletts madam  mrs keswick would have liked to ask some further questions but there was something about lawrences appearance that deterred her  you can tie your horse under that tree over there she said pointing to a spot more trampled by hoofs than the old lady wished any other portion of her houseyard to be  when lawrence had tied his bridle to a hook suspended by a strap from one of the lower branches of the indicated tree he advanced to the house and a very much astonished man was he to see sitting side by side on the porch junius keswick and mr candys cashier they were seated in the shade of a mass of honeysuckle vines and were so busily engaged in conversation that they had not perceived his approach even now lawrence had time to look at them for a few moments before they turned their eyes upon him  equally astonished were the two people on the porch who now arose to their feet junius keswick naturally wondered very much why mr croft should come to see him here and as for the young lady she was almost as much terrified as surprised had this man come down from new york to swoop upon her cousin had it been possible that she could have given him any idea of the whereabouts of junius in her last note to him she had been very careful to promise information but not to give any hoping thus to gain time to get an insight into the matter and to keep her cousin out of danger if indeed any danger threatened but here the pursuer had found junius in less than a day after she had first met him herself but when she saw junius advance and shake hands in a very friendly way with mr croft her terror began to decrease although her surprise continued at the same highwater mark and keswick found himself in a flood of the same emotion when croft very politely saluted his cousin by name which salutation was returned in a manner which indicated that the parties were acquainted  at first croft had been prompted to ignore all knowledge of the cashier and meet her as a stranger but his better sense prevented this for how could he know what she had been saying about him  i was about to introduce you to my cousin said keswick but i see that you already know each other  i have had the pleasure of meeting mrs null in new york said lawrence to whom the word cousin gave what might be called a more important surprise than anything with which this threesided interview had yet furnished its participants he gave a quick glance at the lady and discovered her very steadfastly gazing at him i hope he said that you and your husband have had a very pleasant trip  mr null did not come with me she quietly replied  lawrence croft was a man to whom it gave pleasure to deal with problematic situations unexpected developments and the like but this was too much of a conundrum for him that the man whose address he had employed this girl to find out should prove to be her cousin and that she should start on her bridal trip without her husband were points on which his reason had no power to work one thing however he quickly determined upon he would have an interview with madam cashier and have her explain these mysteries she was virtually his agent and had no right to conceal from him what she had been doing and why she had done it  it was necessary however that he should waste no time in thoughts of this kind but should immediately state to mr keswick the reason of his visit for it could not be supposed he had called in a merely social way i wish to speak to you he said on a little matter of business  at these words mrs null excused herself and went into the house her mind was troubled as she wondered what the business was which had made this new york gentleman so extraordinarily desirous to find her cousin was it anything that would injure junius she looked back as she entered the door but the object of her solicitude was sitting with a face so calm and composed that it showed very plainly he did not expect any communication which would be harmful to him  it is a satisfaction thought mr croft a very great satisfaction that i can enter upon the object of my visit knowing that my affairs and my actions have not been discussed by this gentleman and mrs null     chapter xii   old mrs keswick would willingly have followed the strange gentleman to the house in order to know the object of his visit but as he had come to see junius she refrained for she knew her nephew would not like any appearance of curiosity on her part her reception of junius had been very different indeed from that she had previously accorded him when she declined to be found under the same roof with him now he was here under very different auspices and for him the very plumpest poultry was slain and everything was done to make him comfortable and willing to stay and become acquainted with his cousin mrs null a match between these two young people was the present object of the old ladys existence and she set about making it with as much determination and confidence as if there had been no such person as mr null of this individual she had the most contemptible opinion she had never asked many questions about him because in her intercourse with her niece she wished as far as possible to ignore him having mentally pictured him in various mean conditions of life she had finally settled it in her mind that he was an agent for some patent fertilizer a man of this kind being a very obnoxious person to her this avocation however constituted in the old ladys mind no excusable reason for his protracted absence and if ever a wife was deserted she believed that her niece annie was such a wife  if he should stay away much longer she said to herself we shall have no more trouble in getting a divorce than to have his funeral sermon preached and if there is any talk of his coming here or of her going to him ill put my foot down on that sort of thing if ive a foot left to do it with  when she had first perceived the approach of mr croft a fear had seized her that this might be the recreant husband but the gentlemanly appearance of the stranger soon dispelled this idea from her prejudiced mind apart from the fact that she had no business at the house with her nephews visitor she had positive business in the garden with old uncle isham and there she repaired there was some work to be done in regard to a flower pit in which some of her choicest plants were to be domiciled during the winter and this she wished personally to oversee although the autumn was well advanced the day was somewhat warm and as the pair whom mr croft had seen on the porch had been glad to shelter themselves in the shade of the honeysuckle vines so mrs keswick seated herself on a little bench behind a large arbor still covered by heavy vines which stood on the boundary line between the garden and the front yard and opened on the latter this bench which was always shady in the morning she had had placed there that she might comfortably direct the labors of old isham the boy plez or whoever for the time being happened to be her gardener  mr croft did not immediately begin the statement of the business which had brought him to see junius keswick several windows of the house opened on the porch and he did not wish what he had to say to be heard by any one except the person he was addressing i desire to talk to you on some private matters he said could we not walk a little away from the house  certainly said junius rising we will step over to that arbor by the garden we shall be quite comfortable and secluded there this is the place said junius as they seated themselves in the arbor where when a boy i used to come to smoke my aunt did not allow this diversion but i managed to do a good deal of puffing before i was found out  then you used to live here asked croft  oh yes said keswick my parents died when i was quite a little fellow and my aunt had charge of me until i had grown up  was that your aunt whom i met at the gate there was something about her bearing and general appearance which greatly interested me  she is a most estimable lady returned junius and not wishing further to discuss his relative he added and now what is it sir that i can have the pleasure of doing for you  the matter regards miss march said croft  i presumed so remarked the other i will state it as briefly as possible continued croft in consequence of your visit to me at the the springs i set out the day before yesterday to make another attempt to call on miss march the first one having been frustrated as you may remember by the information we received at the gate in regard to miss marchs indisposition which as i have heard nothing more of it i hope was of no importance  of none whatever said junius  when i was within a mile or so of midbranch continued croft i met mr brandon who requested me not to come to his house and in fact to cease my visits altogether  what cried keswick very much surprised that is not at all like mr brandon what reason could he have for treating you in such a manner  the very best in the world said croft having as the guardian of his niece asked me the object of my visit to miss march and having been informed by me that it was my intention to propose matrimony to the lady he requested that i would not visit at his house on what ground did he base his objection to your visit asked keswick  he made no objection to me he simply stated that he did not desire me to come because he wished his niece to marry you  quite plainly spoken remarked keswick  nothing could be more so replied croft i could not expect any one to be franker with me than he was he went on to inform me that a match between the lady and yourself was greatly desired by the whole family connection with a single exception which however he did not name and while he gave me to understand that he had no reason to fear that so far as the lady was concerned my proposal would interfere with your prospects still were it known that there was another aspirant in the field a very undesirable state of things might ensue what this state of affairs was he did not state but i presume it had something to do with the exceptional opposition to which he referred  and what did you say to all that asked junius  i said very little when a man asks me not to come to his house i dont go but nevertheless i have fully made up my mind to propose to miss march as soon as i can get an opportunity i have nothing to do with family arrangements or family opposition you have told me that you are not engaged to her and i am going to try to be engaged to her she is the one to decide this matter and now i have called upon you mr keswick to see if there is any way in which you can assist me in obtaining an interview with miss march  dont you think said junius that it is rather cool in you to ask me to assist you in this matter  not at all replied the other if it had not been for you i should now be in new york with no thought of present proposals of marriage but you came to me and insisted that i should see the lady that was simply because she had expressed a strong desire to see you  very good said lawrence i tried to go to her as you know and was prevented now all i ask of you is to help me to do what you so strongly urged me to do there is nothing particularly cool in that i think  keswick did not immediately reply i am not sure he said that miss march still wishes to see you  that may be replied croft speaking a little warmly none of us exactly know what she thinks or wishes but i want to find out what she thinks about me by distinctly asking her and i should suppose you would consider it to your advantage as well as mine that i should do so i have my own opinion on that point said keswick which it is not necessary to discuss at present if i were to assist you to an interview with miss march it would be on the ladys account not on yours or mine but apart from the fact that i do not know if she now desires an interview i would not do anything that would offend or annoy mr brandon  i dont ask that of you said croft but couldnt you use your influence with him to give me a fair chance with the lady that is all i ask and whether she accepts me or rejects me i am sure everybody ought to be satisfied  keswick smiled you dont leave any margin for sentiment he said but i suppose it is just as well to deal with this matter in a practical way i do not think however that any influence i can exert on mr brandon would induce him to allow you to address his niece if he is opposed to it and i am sure he would have a very strange opinion of me if i attempted such a thing at present i do not see that i can help you at all but i will think over the matter and we will talk of it again  thank you said croft rising and when shall i call upon you to hear your decision  it was rather difficult for junius keswick to answer a question like this on the spur of the moment he arose and walked with croft out of the arbor his first impulse as a virginia gentleman was to invite his visitor to stay at the house until the matter should be settled but he did not know what extraordinary freak on the part of his aunt might be caused by such an invitation but before he had decided what to say they were met by mrs keswick coming from the garden junius thereupon presented mr croft who was welcomed by the old lady with extended hand and exceeding cordiality  i am very glad she said to meet a friend of my nephew but where are you going sir certainly not toward your horse you must stay and dine with us  lawrence hesitated he had no claims on the hospitality of these people but he wished very much to have an opportunity to speak to mrs null thank you he said but i am staying down here at the village and it is but a short ride staying at hewletts exclaimed mrs keswick at which hotel may i ask  lawrence laughed i am stopping with the storekeeper he said  that settles it said the old lady giving her umbrella a jab into the ground tom pecketts accommodations may be good enough for pedlers and travelling agents but they are not fit for gentlemen especially one of my nephews friends you must stay with us sir as long as you are in this neighborhood i insist upon it junius was very much astonished at his aunts speech and manner the old lady was not at all inhospitable so far was it otherwise the case that rather than deprive an objectionable visitor of the shelter of her roof she would go from under it herself but he had never known her to gush in this manner upon a stranger he now felt at liberty however to obey his own impulses and urged mr croft to stay with them  you are very kind indeed said lawrence and i shall be glad to defer for the present my return to my hotel this will give me the additional pleasure of renewing my acquaintance with mrs null  what exclaimed mrs keswick do you know her too and to think of you stopping at pecketts your home sir while you stay in these parts is here  before the three reached the house mrs keswick had inquired how long mr croft had known her niece and had discovered much to her disappointment that he had never met mr null shortly after the arrival at the house of the gentleman on horseback little plez ran into the kitchen where letty was engaged in preparing vegetables for dinner  who dye think is done come he exclaimed miss annies husband jes rid up to de house  dat so cried letty dropping into her lap the knife and the potato she was peeling well truly when things does happen in dis worl dey comes all in a lump none ob de famly been nigh de house for ebber so long an den long comes mahs junius hissef

hind de bushes till yous got ter de cohn fiel an den you cut cross dar to aun patsys an don you stop no time dar fur if ole miss finds yous done gone shell chop you up wid dem knives  plez was quite ready for a reckless dash of this kind and in less than twenty minutes old patsy was informed that mr null had arrived the old woman was much affected by the information she was uneasy and restless and talked a good deal to herself occasionally throwing out a moan or a lament in the direction of her son toms yaller boy bobs chile the crazy quilt which was not yet finished though several pieces had been added since we last saw it was laid aside and by the help of the above mentioned great granddaughter the old hair trunk was hauled out and opened over this hoard of treasures aunt patsy spent nearly two hours slowly taking up the various articles it contained turning them over mumbling over them and mentally referring many of them to periods which had become historic at length she pulled out from one of the corners of the trunk a pair of very little blue morocco shoes tied together by their strings these she took into her lap and shortly afterward had the trunk locked and pushed back into its place the shoes having been thoroughly examined through her great ironbound spectacles were thrust under the mattress of her bed  that evening uncle isham stepped in to see the old woman who was counteracting the effects of the cool evening air by sitting as close as possible to the remains of the fire which had cooked the supper she was very glad to see him she wanted somebody to whom she could unburden her mind wot you got to say bout miss annies husband she asked wot done come today  was dat him exclaimed the old man nobody tole me dat  this was true for the goodnatured letty having discovered the mistake that had been made had concluded to say nothing about it and to keep away from aunt patsys for a few days until the matter should be forgotten  well i spec miss annies mighty glad to git him back agin continued the old man after a moments reflection hes right much of a nice lookin gemman i seed him this ebenin a ridin wid mahs junius  praps miss annie is glad said

not to do no kunjerin to miss annies husban she gwine to hurt dat little gal moren she hurt anybody else  old isham sat looking into the fire with a very worried and anxious expression on his face he was intensely loyal to his mistress aware as he was of her shortcomings or rather her longgoings although he felt a good deal of fear that there might be some truth in aunt patsys words he was very sure that if she took it upon herself to give warning or reproof to old mrs keswick a storm would ensue and where the lightning would strike he did not know you better look out aun patsy he said you an ole miss been mighty good frens fur a powful long time an now don you go gittin yoursef in no fraction wid her jus as you bout to die  aint gwine to die said the old woman till i done tole her wots

shet  is dat your melia county parble asked the old woman  dats it answered isham  reckon dat countrys better fur bacca dan fur parbles grunted aunt patsy     chapter xiii   lawrence croft had no idea of leaving the neighborhood of howletts until keswick had made up his mind what he was going to do and until he had had a private talk with mrs null and as it was quite evident that the family would be offended if a visitor to them should lodge at pecketts store he accepted the invitation to spend the night at the keswick house and in the afternoon junius rode with him to howletts where he got his valise and paid his account  but no opportunity occurred that day for a têteatête with mrs null keswick was with him nearly all the afternoon and in the evening the family sat together in the parlor where the conversation was a general one occasionally very much brightened by some of the caustic remarks of the old lady in regard to particular men and women as well as society at large of course he had many opportunities of judging to the best of his capacity of certain phases of character appertaining to mr candys cashier and among other things he came to the conclusion that probably she was a young woman who would get up early in the morning and he therefore determined to do that thing himself and see if he could not have a talk with her before the rest of the family were astir  early rising was not one of crofts accustomed habits but the next morning he arose a good hour before breakfast time he found the lower part of the house quite deserted and when he went out on the porch he was glad to button up his coat for the morning air was very cool while walking up and down with his hands in his pockets and looking in at the front door every time he passed it in hopes that he might see mrs null coming down the stairs he was greeted with a cheery good morning by a voice in the front yard turning hastily he beheld mrs keswick wearing her purple sunbonnet but without her umbrella  glad you like to be up betimes sir said she thats my way and i find it pays nobody works as well and i dont believe the plants and stock grow as well while we are asleep  lawrence replied that in the city he did not get up so early but that the morning air in the country was very fine  and pretty sharp too said mrs keswick come down here in the sunshine and you will find it pleasanter step back a little this way sir she said when lawrence had joined her and give me your opinion of that locust tree by the corner of the porch i am thinking of having it cut down locusts are very apt to get diseased inside and break off and i am afraid that one will blow over some day and fall on the house lawrence said he thought it looked like a very good tree and it would be a pity to lose the shade it made  i might plant one of another sort said the old lady but trees grow too slow for old people though plenty fast enough for young ones i reckon ill let it stand awhile yet you were talking last night of midbranch sir there used to be fine trees there though its many years since ive seen them have you been long acquainted with the family there  lawrence replied that he had known miss march a good while having met her in new york  she is said to be a right smart young lady said mrs keswick well educated and has travelled in europe i am told that she is not only a regular town lady but that she makes a firstrate housekeeper when she is down here in the country  lawrence replied that he had no doubt that all this was very true  i have never seen her continued the old lady for there has not been much communication between the two families of late years although they used to be intimate enough but my nephew and niece have been away a great deal and old people cant be expected to do much in the way of visiting but i have a notion she said after gazing a few moments in a reflective way at the corner of the house that it would be well now to be a little more sociable again my niece has no company here of her own sex except me and i think it would do her good to know a young lady like miss march mr brandon has asked me to let annie come there but i think it would be a great deal better for his niece to visit us mrs null is the latest comer  lawrence speaking much more earnestly than when discussing the locust tree replied that he thought this would be quite proper  i think i may invite her to come here next week said mrs keswick still meditatively and without apparent regard to the presence of croft probably on friday and ask her to spend a week and by the way sir she said turning to her companion if you are still in this part of the country i would be glad to have you ride over and stay a day or two while miss march is here i will have a little party of young folks in honor of mrs null i have done nothing of the kind for her so far  lawrence said he had no doubt that he would stay at the green sulphur a week or two longer and that he would be most happy to accept mrs keswicks kind invitation  they then moved toward the house but suddenly stopping as if she had just thought of something mrs keswick remarked i shall be obliged to you sir if you will not say anything about this little plan of mine just now i have not spoken of it to any one having scarcely made up my mind to it and i suppose i should not have mentioned it to you if we had not been talking about midbranch there is nothing i hate so much as to have people hear i am going to give them an invitation or that i am going to do anything in fact before i have fully made up my mind about it  lawrence assured her that he would say nothing on the subject and she promised to send him a note to the green sulphur in case she finally determined on having the little company at her house  now triumphantly thought croft it matters not what keswick decides to do for i dont need his assistance an elderly angel in a purple sunbonnet has come to my aid she is about to do ever so much more for me than i could expect of him and i prefer her assistance to that of my rival altogether it is the most unexpected piece of good luck  after breakfast there came to lawrence the opportunity of a private conference with mrs null he was standing alone on the porch when she came out of the door with her hat on and a basket in her hand and said she was going to see a very old colored woman who lived in the neighborhood who was considered a very interesting personage and perhaps he would like to go there with her nothing could suit croft better than this and off they started  as soon as they were outside the yard gate the lady remarked i have been trying hard to give you a chance to talk to me when the others were not by i knew you must be perfectly wild to ask me what this all meant why i never told you that mr keswick was my cousin and the rest of it i cant say said lawrence that i am absolutely untamed and ferocious in regard to the matter but i do really wish very much that you would give me some explanation of your very odd doings in fact that is the only thing that now keeps me here  i thought so said mrs null as i supposed you had got through with your business with junius i did not wish to detain you here any longer than was necessary  thank you said lawrence  you are welcome she said and when i saw you standing on the porch by yourself the idea of being generous to old aunt patsy came into my mind and here we are now what do you want to know first  well said mr croft i would like very much to know how a young lady like you came to be mr candys cashier  i supposed you would want to know that she said its a dreadfully long story and as it is a strictly family matter i had almost made up my mind last night that i ought not to tell it to you at all but as i dont know how much you are mixed up with the family i afterward thought it best for my own sake to explain the matter to you so i will give you the principal points my mother was a sister of mrs keswick and junius mother was another sister both his parents died when he was a boy and aunt keswick brought him up my mother died here when i was quite small and i stayed until i was eight years old aunt keswick and my father were not very good friends and when she came to look upon me as entirely her own child and wished to deprive him of all rights and privileges as a parent he resented it very much and at last took me away i dont remember exactly how this was done but i know there was a tremendous quarrel and my father and aunt never met again  he took me to new york and there we lived very happily until about two years ago when my father died he was a lawyer by profession but at that time held a salaried position in a railroad company and when he died of course our income ceased the money that was left did not last very long and then i had to decide what i was to do it would have been natural for me to go to my only relatives aunt keswick and junius but my father had been so opposed to my aunt having anything to do with me that i could not bear to go to her he had really been so much afraid that she would try to win me away from him or in some way gain possession of me that he would not even let her know our address and never answered the few letters from her which reached him and which he told me were nothing but demands that her sisters child should be given back to her junius had written to me how many times i do not know but two letters had come to me that were very good and affectionate quite different from my aunts but even these my father would not let me answer it would be all the same thing he said as if i opened communication with my aunt keswick therefore out of respect to my father and also in accordance with my own wishes i gave up all idea of coming down here and went to work to support myself i tried several things and at last through a friend of my father who was a regular customer of mr candy i got the position of cashier in the information shop it was an awfully queer place but the work was very easy and i soon got used to it then you came making inquiries for an address at first i did not know that the person you wanted was junius keswick and my cousin but after i began to look into the matter i found that it must be he who you were after then i became very much troubled for i liked junius who was the only one of my blood whom i had any reason to care for and when one sees a person setting a detectivefor it is all the same thingupon the track of another person one is very apt to think that some harm is intended to the person that is being looked up i did not know what business junius was in nor what his condition was but even if he had been doing wrong i did not wish you to find him until i had first seen him and then if i found you could do him any harm i would warn him to keep out of your way  do you think that was fair treatment of me asked croft  you were nothing to me and junius was a great deal she answered and yet i think i was fair enough the only money you paid was what mr candy charged and when i spoke of receiving money for my services when the affair was finished i only did it that it might all be more business like and that you should not drop me and set somebody else looking after junius that was the great thing i was afraid of so i did all i could to make you satisfied with me  i dont see how your conscience could allow you to do all this said croft  my conscience was very much pleased with me was the answer what i did was a stratagem and perfectly fair too if i had found that it was right for you to see junius i would have done everything i could to help you communicate with him but when i did at last see him down you swooped upon us before i had an opportunity of saying a word about you  your marriage was a very fortunate thing for you said mr croft for if it had not been for that i should never have allowed you to go about the country looking up a gentleman in my behalf but how did you get over your repugnance to your aunt  i didnt get over it she said i conquered it for i found that this was the most likely place to meet junius and aunt keswick has certainly treated me in the kindest manner although she is very angry about mr null but when i first came and she did not know who i was she behaved in the most extraordinary manner  what did she do asked croft  never you mind she answered with a little laugh you cant expect to know all the family affairs  they had now arrived at aunt patsys cabin and mrs null entered followed at a little distance by croft the old woman had seen them as they were walking along the road and her little black eyes sparkled with peculiar animation behind her great spectacles her granddaughter happened not to be at home but aunt patsy got up and with her apron rubbed off the bottoms of two chairs which she placed in convenient positions for her expected visitors when they came in they found her in a very perturbed condition she answered mrs nulls questions with a very few words and a great many grunts and kept her eyes fixed nearly all the time upon mr croft endeavoring to find out perhaps if he had yet been subjected to any kind of conjuring  when all the questions which young people generally put to old servants had been asked by mrs null and croft had made as many remarks as might have been expected of him in regard to the age and recollections of this interesting old negress aunt patsy began to be much more disturbed fearing that the interview was about to come to an end she actually got up and went to the back door to look for eliza  do you want her anxiously inquired mrs null going to the old womans side  yaas i wants her said aunt patsy i spec she at aggys housedat cabin ober darbut i cant holler loud nuf to make her hyere me ill run over there and tell her you want her said mrs null stepping out of the door  dats a good chile said aunt patsy with more warmth than she had yet exhibited dats your own mudders good chile and then she turned quickly into the room  croft had risen as if he were about to follow mrs null or at least to see where she had gone but aunt patsy stopped him jus you stay hyar one little minute she said hurriedly i got one word to say to you sah and she stood up before him as erect as she could fixing her great spectacles directly upon him you look out sah fur ole miss she said in a voice naturally shrill but now heavily handicapped by age and emotion ole miss keswick i means she boun to do you harm sah she tole me so wid her own mouf  mrs keswick exclaimed croft why you must be mistaken good aunty she can have no ill feelings towards me  don you blieve dat said the old woman don you blieve one word ob dat she hate you sah she hate you she not gwine to tell you dat she make you think she like you fus rate an den de nex thing you knows she kunjer you an shribble up de siners ob your legs an gib you misry in your back wot you neber git rid of no moh cant tell you nuffin else now for hyar comes miss annie she added hurriedly and stepping to the bedside she drew from under the mattrass a pair of little blue shoes tied together by their strings jes you take dese hyar shoes she said an ef eber you think ole miss gwine ter kunjer you jes you hol up dem shoes right afore her face dar now stuff em in your pocket don you tell miss annie wot i done say to you member dat sah it ud kill her shuh  at this moment mrs null entered just as the shoes had been slipped into the sidepocket of mr crofts coat by the old woman and as she did so she whispered in a tone that could not but have its effect upon him now nebber tell her honey  here is eliza said mrs null as she came in followed by the great granddaughter and i think she said to mr croft it is time for us to go goodbye aunt patsy you can send back the basket by eliza  when the two left the cabin croft walked thoughtfully for a few moments wondering what in the world the old woman could have meant by her strange words and gift to him concluding however that they could have been nothing but the drivelings of weakminded old age he dismissed them from his mind and turned his attention to his companion we were speaking he said of mr null do you expect him shortly  well no said the lady i cant say that i do  that is odd said lawrence i thought this was your wedding journey  so it is in a measure said she but there is no necessity of his coming here didnt i tell you that my aunt was opposed to the marriage but she might as well make up her mind to it now he said  she is not in the habit of making up her mind to things she dont like do you know she added looking around with a half smile as if she took pleasure in astonishing him that aunt keswick is going to try to have us divorced  what exclaimed croft divorced is there any ground for it  she has other matrimonial plans for me thats all  what an extraordinary individual she must be he exclaimed but she can never carry out such a ridiculous scheme as that  i dont know she said she has already consulted mr brandon on the subject  what nonsense cried croft if you and mr null are satisfied nobody else has anything to do with it  mr null and i are of one mind said she and agree perfectly but dont you think it is a terrible thing to know you must always face an irritated aunt  oh said croft looking around at her very coldly and sternly i begin to see i suppose a separation would improve your prospects in life but it cant be done if your husband is opposed to it  mr croft said the lady her face flushing a good deal you have no right to speak to me in that way and attribute such motives to me no matter whom i had married i would never give him up for the sake of money or a farm or anything you think my aunt could give me  i beg your pardon said croft if i made a mistake but i dont see what else i could infer from your remarks  my remarks said she werewell they have a different meaning from what you supposed she walked on in silence for a few moments and then looking up to her companion she said i have a great mind to tell you something if you will promise at least for the present not to breathe it to a living soul  instantly the lookout on the bow of lawrence crofts life action called out breakers ahead and almost instantly its engine was stopped and every faculty of its commander was on the alert i do not know he said that i am entitled to your confidence would it be of any advantage to you to tell me what you propose  it would be of advantage and you are entitled she added quickly it is about mr null and you ought to know it for you instigated my wedded life  i instigatedexclaimed mr croft and then he stopped short both in his speech and walk  yes said the lady stopping also and turning to face him you did and you ought to remember it you said if i had a husband to travel about with me you would like very much to employ me in the search for mr keswick and it was solely on that account that i went and got married observing the look of blank and utter amazement on his face she smiled and said please dont look so horribly astonished mr null is void  as she made this remark the lady looked up at her companion with a smile and an expression of curiosity as to how he would take the announcement lawrence gazed blankly at her for a moment and then he broke into a laugh you dont mean to say he exclaimed that mr null is an imaginary being  entirely so she replied my dear freddy is nothing but a fanciful idea with no attribute whatever except the name  you are a most extraordinary young person said lawrence almost as extraordinary as your aunt what in the world made you think of doing such a thing and why do you wish to keep up the delusion among your relatives even so far as to drive your aunt to the point of getting you divorced from your airy husband and he laughed again i told you how i came to think of it she said as they walked on again it was very plain that if i wanted to travel about as your agent i must be married and i have found a husband quite a protection and an advantage even when he doesnt go about with me and as to keeping up the delusion as you call it in my own family i have found that to be absolutely necessary at least for the present my aunt even when i was a little girl determined to take my marriage into her own hands and since i have returned to her this desire has come up again in the most astonishing way it is her principal subject of conversation with me were it not for the protection which my dear freddy null gives me i should be thrown bodily into the arms of the person whom my aunt has selected and he would be obliged to take me whether he wanted to or not or be cast forth forever so you see how important it is that my aunt should think i am married and i do hope you will not tell anybody about mr null  of course i will keep your secret said croft you may rely upon that but dont you thinkdo you believe that this sort of thing is altogether right  she did not answer for a few moments and then she said i suppose you must consider me a very deceptive sort of person but you should remember that these things were not done for my own good and as far as i can see they were the only things that could be done do you suppose i was going to let you pounce down on my cousin and do him some injury for as you kept your object such a secret i did not suppose it could be anything but an injury you intended him  a fine opinion of me said croft  and then do you suppose she continued that i would allow my aunt to quarrel with junius and disinherit him as she says she will should he decline to marry me i expected to drop my married name when i came here but i had not been with my aunt fifteen minutes before i saw that it would never do for me to be a single woman while i stayed with her and so i kept my freddy by me i did not intend at all to tell you all these things about my cousin and i only did it because i did not wish you to think that i was a sly mean creature deceiving others for my own good  well said croft although i cant say you are right in making your relatives believe you are married when you are not still i see you had very fair reasons for what you did and you certainly showed a great deal of ingenuity and pluck in carrying out your remarkable schemes bytheway he continued somewhat hesitatingly i am in your debt for your services to me  not a bit of it she exclaimed quickly i never did a thing for you it was all for myself or rather for my cousin the only money due was that which you paid to mr candy before i took charge of the matter lawrence felt that this was rather a sore subject with his companion and he dropped it do you still hold the position of cashier in the information shop  no she said when i started out on my lonely wedding tour i gave up that and if i should go back to new york i do not think i should want to take it again  do you propose soon to return to new york he asked  no at least i have made no plans in regard to it i think it would grieve my aunt very much if i were to go away from her now and as long as i have mr null to protect me from her matrimonial schemes i am glad to stay with her she is very kind to me  i think you are entirely right in deciding to stay here he said looking around at her and contrasting in his mind the brightfaced and somewhat plump young person walking beside him with the thinfaced girl in black whom he had seen behind the cashiers desk  now said she with a vivacious little laugh i have poured out my whole soul before you and in return i want you to gratify a curiosity which is fairly eating me up why were you so anxious to find my cousin junius and how did you happen to come here the very day after he arrived and more than that how was it that you had seen him at midbranch so recently you were talking about it last night it couldnt have been my letter from howletts that brought you down here  no said lawrence my meeting with mr keswick at midbranch was entirely accidental when i arrived there a few days ago i had no reason to suppose that i should meet him but i must ask you to excuse me from giving my reasons for wishing to find your cousin and for coming to see him here the matter between us has now become one of no importance and will be dropped  the ladys face flushed oh indeed she said and during the short remainder of their walk to the house she made no further remark     chapter xiv   when lawrence and his companion reached the house they found on the porch mrs keswick and her nephew and after a little general conversation the latter remarked to mr croft that he had found it would not be in his power to attend to that matter he had spoken of to which croft replied that he was very much obliged to him for thinking of it and that it was of no consequence at all as he would probably make other arrangements he then stated that he would be obliged to return to the green sulphur springs that day and that as it was a long ride he would like to start as soon as his horse could be brought to him but this procedure was condemned utterly by the old lady who insisted that mr croft should not leave until after dinner which meal should be served earlier than usual in order to give him plenty of time to get to the springs before dark and as lawrence had nothing to oppose to her very urgent protest he consented to stay before dinner was ready he found out why the protest was made the old lady took him aside and made inquiries of him in regard to mr null he had already informed her that he was not acquainted with that gentleman but she thought as mr croft seemed to be going about the country a good deal he might possibly meet with her nieces husband and if he should do so she would be very glad to have him become acquainted with him  to this lawrence replied with much gravity that he would be happy to do so  mr null has not yet come to my house said mrs keswick and it is very natural that one should desire to know the husband of her only niece who is or should be the same as a daughter to her  a very natural wish indeed said lawrence  i am not quite sure in what business mr null is engaged she continued and although i asked my niece about it she answered in a very evasive way which makes me think his occupation is one she is not proud of i have reason to suppose however that he is an agent for the sale of some fertilizing compound  at this lawrence could not help smiling very broadly  it may appear very odd and ridiculous to you she said that a person connected with my family should be engaged in a business like that for those fertilizers as you ought to know are all humbugs of the vilest kind the only time i bought any it took my whole wheat crop to pay for it and as for the clover i got afterward a grasshopper could have eaten the whole of it i am afraid he didnt tell her his business before he married her and im glad shes ashamed of it as far as i can find out it does not seem as if mr null has any intention of coming here for some time and as i said before i do very much want to know something about himthat is from a disinterested outsider one cannot expect a recently married young woman to give a correct account of her husband  i do not believe said mr croft that there is any probability that i shall ever meet the gentlemanour walks in life being so different  i should hope so indeed interrupted mrs keswick but people of all sorts do run across each other  but if i do meet with him he continued i shall take great pleasure in giving you my impressions by letter or in person of your nephewinlaw dont call him that exclaimed the old lady with much asperity i dont acknowledge the title but i wont say any more about him with a grim smile or you may think i dont like him  some of these days he said you may come to be of the opinion that he is exactly the husband you would wish your niece to have  never she cried if he were an angel in broadcloth but i mustnt talk about these things i mentioned mr null to you because you are the only person of my acquaintance who i suppose is likely to meet with him in regard to that little company i spoke of to you i have not quite made up my mind about it and therefore havent mentioned it but if i carry out the plan i will write to you at the springs and shall certainly expect you to be one of us that would give me great pleasure said lawrence in a tone which indicated to the quick brain of the old lady that he would like to make a condition but was too polite to do so  if miss march should agree to come she said it might be pleasant for you to make one of her party and ride over at the same time however ill let you know if she is coming and then you can join her or not as suits your convenience  thank you very much said lawrence in a tone which betrayed no reserves  as he rode away that afternoon lawrence croft as his habit was on such occasions revolved in his mind what he had heard and said and done during this little visit to the keswick family nothing could have turned out better he thought to be sure the young man could not or would not be of any assistance to me which is probably what i ought to have expected but the strongtempered old lady his aunt promises to be of tenfold more service than he could possibly be as to that very odd young lady mrs keswicks niece i imagine that she does not regard me very favorably for she was quite cool after i refused to let her into the secret of my desire to find her cousin but as i did not ask for her confidences she had no right to expect a return for them and bytheway its odd how many confidences have been reposed in me since ive been down here keswick begins it then old brandon takes up the strain after that mr candys excashier tells me the story of her life and entrusts me with the secret of her marriage with a man of windthat most useful mr null after that her aunt makes me understand how much she hates mr null and how she would like me to find out something disreputable about him and then by george i forgot the old negro woman in the cabin at this he put his hand in the sidepocket of his coat and drew out the pair of little blue shoes why in the name of common sense did the old hag give me these and why should she suppose that mrs keswick intended me a harm the old lady never saw or heard of me until yesterday and her manner certainly indicated no dislike of me but of course aunt patsys brain is cracked and she didnt know what she was talking about i shall keep the shoes however and if ever the venerable purple sunbonnet runs afoul of me i shall hold them up before it and see what happens  and so very well satisfied with the result of his visit to hewletts he rode on to the green sulphur springs  on the afternoon of the next day miss march received an invitation from mrs keswick to spend a few days with her and make the acquaintance of her niece who had recently returned to the home of her childhood the letter for it was much more than a note of invitation was cordial and in parts pathetic it dwelt upon the sundered pleasant relations of the two families and expressed the hope that mr brandons visit to her might be the beginning of a renewal of the old intimacy mrs keswick took occasion to incidentally mention that the house would be particularly dull for her niece just now as junius was on the point of starting for washington where he would be detained some weeks on business and she hoped most earnestly that miss roberta would accept this invitation to make her acquaintance and that of her niece and she designated thursday of the following week as the day on which she would like her to come  as may reasonably be supposed this letter greatly astonished miss march who carried it to her uncle and asked him to explain if he could what it meant the old gentleman was a good deal surprised when he read it but it delighted him in a far greater degree he perceived in it the first fruits of his diplomacy mrs keswick saw that it would be to her interest for a time at least to make friends with him and this was the way she took to do it she would not come to midbranch herself and bring the niece but she would have roberta come to her in the pathos and cordiality mr brandon believed not at all what the old hypocrite probably wanted was to enlist his grateful sympathy in that ridiculous divorce case but whatever her motives might be he would be very glad to have his niece go to her for if anything could make an impression upon that timehardened and seasoned old choppingblock of a woman it was robertas personal influence if mrs keswick should come to know roberta that knowledge would do more than anything else in the world to remove her objections to the marriage he so greatly desired  he said nothing of all this to his niece but he most earnestly counselled her to accept the invitation and make a visit to the two ladies of course roberta did not care to go but as her uncle appeared to take the matter so much to heart she consented to gratify him and wrote an acceptance she found also when she had thought more on the matter that she had a good deal of curiosity to see this mrs keswick of whom she had heard so much and who had had such an important influence on her life     chapter xv   on the afternoon of the day on which mrs keswicks letter arrived at midbranch peggy had great news to communicate to aunt judy the cook miss robs gwine to mahs junius house in de kerridge an is gwine long wid her to set in front wid sam  mahs junius aint got no house said aunt judy turning around very suddenly does you mean she gwine ter

you like dat  to this peggy made no reply but with her eyes steadfastly fixed on aunt judy and her lower jaw very much dropped she mentally resolved to keep herself as straight as possible during her stay at the keswicks  dars ole aun patsy continued the speaker its a mighty long time sence ive seen aun patsy dat was when i went ober dar wid miss robs mudder when de two famlys was frens i was her

peggy  yaas said aunt judy dat same one an dey tells me dat on third chewsdays which is coht day de same as when he took de gray colt as soon as it git dark he ghos climb up to de top ob dat pos an set dar all night  with a conjuring old woman in the house and a monthly ghost on the gatepost outside the keswick residence did not appear as attractive to peggy as it had done before but she mentally determined that while she was there she would be very careful to look put sharp for herself a performance for which she was very well adapted  it was on a pleasant autumn morning that mr brandon very carefully ensconced his niece in the family carriage with peggy and a trusty negro man sam on the outside front seat i would gladly go with you my dear he said even without the formality of an invitation but it is far better for you to go by yourself my very presence would provoke an antagonism in the old lady while with you personally it is impossible that any such feeling should exist i hope your visit may do away with all ill feeling between our families  i want you to understand uncle said miss roberta that i am making this visit almost entirely to please you and i shall do everything in my power to make mrs keswick feel that you and i are perfectly well disposed toward her but you cant expect me to exhibit any great warmth of friendship toward a person who once used such remarkable and violent expressions in regard to me  but those feelings my dear said mr brandon if we are to believe mrs keswicks letter have entirely disappeared  it is quite natural that they should do so said roberta as there is no longer any reason for them and there is another thing i want to impress on your mind uncle robert you must expect no result from this visit except a renewal of amity between yourself and mrs keswick  i understand it perfectly said the old gentleman feeling quite confident that if his family and mrs keswick should once again become friendly the main object of his desires would not be difficult of accomplishment and now my dear i will not detain you any longer i hope you may have a very pleasant visit and i advise you to cultivate that young mrs null whom i take to be a very sensible and charming person and then he kissed her goodbye and shut the carriage door  it was about the middle of the afternoon when sam drove through the outer keswick gate and peggy who had jumped down to open said gate had made herself positively sure that at present there was no ghost sitting upon the post before she reached the house roberta began to wonder a good deal if she should find mrs keswick the woman she had pictured in her mind but when the carriage drew up in front of the porch there came out to meet her not the mistress of the estate but a much younger lady who tripped down the steps and reached roberta as she descended from the carriage  we are very glad to see you miss march she said my aunt is not here just now but will be back directly  this is mrs null isnt it said roberta and as the other smiled and answered with a slight flush that it was roberta stooped just the little that was necessary and kissed her mrs keswicks niece had not expected so warm a greeting from this lady to whom she was almost a stranger and instantly she said to herself in that kiss freddy dies to you for some days she had been turning over and over in her mind the question whether or not she should tell roberta march that she was not mrs null she greatly disliked keeping up the deception where it was not necessary and with roberta if she would keep the secret there was no need of this aerial matrimony besides her natural desire to confide in a person of her own sex and age she did not wish mr croft to be the only one who shared her secret and so she had determined that her decision would depend on what sort of girl roberta proved to be if i like her ill tell her if i dont i wont was the final decision and when roberta march looked down upon her with her beautiful eyes and kissed her freddy null departed this life so far as those two were concerned  mrs keswick had apparently made a very great miscalculation in regard to the probable time of arrival of her guest for miss march and peggy and even sam and the horses had been properly received and cared for and miss march had been sitting in the parlor for some time and still the old lady did not come into the house her niece had grown very anxious about this absence and had begun to fear that her aunt had treated miss march as she had treated her on her arrival and had gone away to stay but plez whom she had sent to tell his mistress that her visitor was in the house returned with the information that ole miss was in one of the lower fields directing some men who were digging a ditch and that she would return to the house in a very short time thus assured that no permanent absence was intended she went into the parlor to entertain miss march and to explain as well as she could the state of affairs when as she entered the door she saw that lady suddenly arise and look steadfastly out of the window  can that be mr croft miss march exclaimed  the younger girl made a dash forward and also looked out of the window yes there was mr croft riding across the yard toward the tree where horses were commonly tied  did you expect him asked roberta quickly  no more than i expected the man in the moon was the impulsive and honest answer of her companion  i am very glad to see you mrs null said lawrence when that lady met him on the porch and when he was shown into the parlor he greeted miss march with much cordiality but no surprise but when he inquired after other members of the family he was much surprised to find that mr keswick had gone to washington was not this very unexpected mrs null he asked  why no she answered junius told us almost as soon as he came here that he would have to be in washington by the first of this week  mr croft did not pursue this subject further but presently remarked are you and i the first comers miss march  roberta looked from one of her companions to the other and remarked i do not understand you  lawrence now perceived that he was treading a very uncertain and perhaps dangerous path of conversation and the sooner he got out of it the better but before he could decide what answer to make a silent and stealthy figure appeared at the door beckoning and nodding in a very mysterious way this proved to be the plump black maid letty who having attracted the attention of the company whispered loudly miss annie whereupon that young lady immediately left the room  what other comers did you expect then asked roberta of mr croft  i certainly supposed there would be a small company here he said probably neighborhood people but if i was mistaken of course i dont wish to say anything more about it to the family  were you invited yourself asked roberta  croft wished very much that he could say that he had accidentally dropped in but this he could not do and he answered that mrs keswick asked him to come about this time he did not consider it necessary to add that she had written to him at the springs renewing her invitation very earnestly and mentioning that miss march had consented to make one of the party  this was as far as roberta saw fit to continue the subject on the present occasion and she began to talk about the charming weather and the pretty way in which the foliage was reddening on the side of a hill opposite the window mr croft was delighted to enter into this new channel of speech and discussed with considerable fervor the attractiveness of autumn in virginia miss annie found letty in a very disturbed state of mind the dinner had been postponed until the arrival of miss march and now it had been still further delayed by the nonarrival of the mistress of the house and everything was becoming dried up and unfit to eat this will never do exclaimed miss annie i will go myself and look for aunt she must have forgotten the time of day and everything else  putting on her hat she ran out of the back door but she did not have to go very far for she found the old lady in the garden earnestly regarding a bed of turnips where have you been my dear aunt cried the girl miss march has been here ever so long and mr croft has come and dinner has been waiting until it has all dried up i was afraid that you had forgotten that company was coming today  forgotten said the old lady glaring at the turnips it isnt an easy thing to forget i invited the girl and i expected her to come but i tell you annie when i saw that carriage coming along the road all the old feeling came back to me i remembered what its owners had done to me and mine and what they are still trying to do and i felt i could not go into the house and give her my hand it would be like taking hold of a snake  a snake cried her niece with much warmth she is a lovely woman and her coming shows what kindly feelings she has for you but no matter what you think about it aunt you have asked her here and you must come in and see her dinner is waiting and i dont know what more to say about your absence  go in and have dinner said mrs keswick  dont wait for me ill come in and see her after a while but i havent yet got to the point of sitting down to the table and eating with her  oh aunt exclaimed annie you ought never to have asked her if you are going to treat her in this way and what am i to say to her what excuse am i to make are you not sick isnt something the matter with you  you can tell them im flustrated said the old lady and that is all thats the matter with me but im not coming in to dinner and there is no use of saying anything more about it  annie looked at her the tears of mortification still standing in her eyes i suppose i must go and do the best i can she said but aunt please tell me one thing did you invite any other people here mr croft spoke as if he expected to see other visitors and if they ask anything more about it i dont know what to say  the only other people i invited said the old lady with a grim grin were the king of norway and the prime minister of spain and neither of them could come annie said no more but hurrying back to the house she ordered dinner to be served immediately at first the meal was not a very lively one the young hostess pro tempore explained the absence of the mistress of the house by stating that she had had a nervous attackwhich was quite trueand that she begged them to excuse her until after dinner the two guests expressed their regret at this unfortunate indisposition but each felt a degree of embarrassment at the absence of mrs keswick roberta who had heard many stories of the old woman guessed at the true reason and if the distance had not been so great she would have gone home that afternoon lawrence croft of course could imagine no reason for the old ladys absence except the one that had been given them but he suspected that there must be some other he did his best however to make pleasant conversation and roberta who began to have a tender feeling for the little lady at the head of the table who she could easily see had been placed in an unpleasant position seconded his efforts with such effect that when the little party had concluded their dinner with a course of hot pound cake and cream sauce they were chatting together quite sociably  in about ten minutes after they had all gone into the parlor miss annie excused herself and presently returned with a message to miss march that mrs keswick would be very glad to see her in another room this was a very natural message from an elderly lady who was not well but roberta arose and walked out of the parlor with a feeling as if she were about to enter the cage of an erratic tigress but she met with no such creature she saw in the back room into which she was ushered a small old woman dressed very plainly who came forward to meet her extending both hands into one of which roberta placed one of her own  i may as well say at once roberta march said mrs keswick that the reason i didnt come to meet you when you first arrived was that i couldnt get over all of a sudden the feelings i have had against your family for so many years  why then mrs keswick said roberta very coldly did you ask me to come  because i wanted you to come said mrs keswick and because i thought i was stronger than i turned out to be but you must make allowances for the stiffness which gets into old peoples dispositions as well as their backs i want you to understand however that i meant all i said in that letter and i am very glad to see you if anything in my conduct has seemed to you out of the way you must set it down to the fact that i was making a very sudden turn and starting out on a new track in which i hope we shall all keep for the rest of our lives  roberta could not help thinking that the sudden turn in the new track began with the visit of her uncle to this house and that the old lady need not have inflicted upon her the disagreeable necessity of witnessing a hostess taking a very repulsive cold plunge but all she said was that she hoped the families would now live together in friendly relations and that she was sure that if this were to be it would give her uncle a great deal of pleasure she very much wanted to ask mrs keswick how mr croft happened to be here at this time but she felt that her very brief acquaintance with the lady would not warrant the discussion of a subject like that  she is very much the kind of woman i thought she was said roberta to herself when after some further hospitable remarks from mrs keswick the two went to the parlor together to find mr croft but that gentleman having been deserted by all the ladies was walking up and down the greensward in front of the house smoking a cigar mrs keswick went out to him and greeted him very cordially begging him to excuse her for not being able to see him as soon as he came  lawrence set all this aside in his politest manner but declared himself very much disappointed in not seeing mr keswick and also remarked that from what she had said to him on his last visit he had expected to find quite a little party here  i am sorry said the old lady that junius is away for he would be very glad to see you and it never came into my mind to mention to you that he was obliged to be in washington at this time and as for the party i thought afterwards that it would be a great deal cosier just to have a few persons here  oh yes said lawrence most certainly a great deal cosier  mrs keswick ate supper with her guests and behaved very well during the evening she sustained the main part of the conversation giving the company a great many anecdotes and reminiscences of old times and old families relating them in an odd and peculiar way that was very interesting especially to croft to whom the subject matter was quite new but although her three companions listened to the old lady with deferential attention interspersed with appropriate observations each one made her the object of severe mental scrutiny and endeavored to discover the present object of her scheming old mind roberta was quite sure that her invitation and that of mr croft was a piece of artful management on the part of the old lady and imagined though she was not quite sure about it that it was intended as a bit of matchmaking to get her married to somebody else would be of course the best possible method of preventing her marrying junius and this she had reason to believe was the prime object of old mrs keswicks existence but why should mr croft be chosen as the man with whom she was to be thrown she had learned that the old lady had seen him before but was quite certain that her acquaintance with him was slight could junius have told his aunt about the friendship between herself and mr croft it was not like him but a great many unlikely things take place  as for lawrence he knew very well there was a trick beneath his invitation but he could not at all make out why it had been played he had been given an admirable opportunity of offering himself to miss march but there was no reason apparent to him why this should have been done  miss annie watching her aunt very carefully and speaking but seldom quite promptly made up her mind in regard to the matter she knew very well the bitter opposition of the old woman to a marriage between junius and miss march and saw as plainly as she saw the lamp on the table that roberta had been brought here on purpose to be sacrificed to mr croft everything had been made ready the altar cleared and as well as the old ladys grindstone would act the knife sharpened but said miss annie to herself she neednt suppose that i am going to sit quiet and see all this going on with junius away off there in washington knowing nothing about any of it  miss roberta retired quite early to her room having been fatigued by her long drive and she was just about to put out her light when she heard a little knock at the door opening it slightly she saw there junius keswicks cousin who also appeared quite ready for bed  may i come in for a minute said annie  certainly replied miss march admitting her and closing the door after her  i have something to tell you said the younger lady admiring as she spoke the length of her companions braided hair i intended to keep it until tomorrow but since i came up stairs i felt i could not let you sleep a night under the same roof with me without knowing it i am not mrs null  what exclaimed roberta in a tone which made annie lift up her hands and implore her not to speak so loud for fear that her aunt should hear her i know she hasnt come up stairs yet for she sits up dreadfully late but she can hear things almost anywhere no i am not mrs null there is no such person as mr null or at least he is a mere gaseous myth whom i married for the sake of the protection his name gave me  this is the most extraordinary thing i ever heard said roberta you must tell me all about it  i dont want to keep you up said annie you must be tired  i am not tired said roberta for every particle of fatigue has flown away and with this she made annie sit down beside her on the lounge now you must tell me what this means she said can it be that your aunt does not know about it  indeed she does not said annie i married freddy null in new york for reasons which we need not talk of now for that matter is all past and gone but when i came here i found almost immediately that he would be more necessary to me in this house than anywhere else  i cannot imagine said roberta why a gaseous husband should be necessary to you here  it is not a very easy thing to explain said the other that is it is easy enough but  oh said roberta catching the reason of her companions hesitation i dont think you ought to object to tell me your reason does it relate to your cousin junius  well said annie not altogether and not so much to him as to my aunt i think i see said roberta a marriage between you two would suit her very well are you afraid that she would try to force him on you  oh no said annie that would be bad enough but it would not be so embarrassing and so dreadfully unpleasant as forcing me on him and that is what aunt wants to do and you can easily see that in that case i could not stay in this house at all i scarcely know my cousin as a man my strongest recollection of him being that of a big and very nice boy who used to climb up in the appletrees to get me apples and then come down to the very lowest branch where he could drop the ripest ones right into my apron and not bruise them but even if i had been acquainted with him all these years and liked him ever so much i couldnt stay here and have aunt make him take me whether he wanted to or not and unless you knew my aunt very well you could not conceive how unscrupulously straightforward she is in carrying out her plans  and so said roberta you have quite baffled her by this little ruse of a marriage  not altogether said annie with a smile for she vows she is going to get me divorced from mr null  that is funnier than the rest of it said roberta laughing and they both laughed together but in a subdued way so as not to attract the attention of the old lady below stairs and now you see said annie why i must be mrs null while i stay here and you will promise me that you will never tell any one  you may be sure i shall keep your queer secret but have you not told it to any one but me  yes said annie but i have only told it to one other mr croft but please dont speak of it to him  mr croft exclaimed roberta how in the world did you come to tell him do you know him so well as that  well said annie it does seem out of the way i admit that i should tell him but i cant give you the whole story of how i came to do it it wouldnt interest youat least it would but i oughtnt to tell it it is a twisty sort of thing  twisty said roberta drawing herself up and a little away from her companion  annie looked up and caught the glance by which this word was accompanied and the tone in which it was spoken went straight to her soul now said she if you are going to look at me and speak in that way ill tell you every bit of it and she did tell the whole story from her first meeting with mr croft in the information shop down to the present moment  what is your name anyway said roberta when the story had been told  my name said the other is annie peyton  and now do you know annie peyton said roberta passing her fingers gently among the short lightbrown curls on her companions forehead that i think you must have a very very kindly recollection of the boy who used to come down to the lowest branches of the tree to drop apples into your apron     chapter xvi   shortly after peggy arrived with her mistress at the keswick residence her mind began to be a good deal disturbed she had been surprised when the carriage drew up to the door that mahs junius had not rushed down to meet his intended bride and when she found he was not in the house and had indeed gone away from home she did not at all know what to make of it if miss rob took the trouble to travel all the way to the home of the man that the midbranch people had decided she should marry it was a very wonderful thing indeed that he should not be there to meet her and while these thoughts were turning themselves over in the mind of this meditative girl of color and the outgoing look in her eyes was extending itself farther and farther as if in search of some solution of the mystery up rode mr croft  dar he exclaimed peggy as she stood at the corner of the house where she had been pursuing her meditations he she continued in a voice that would have been quite audible to any one standing near upon my libin soul wot brung him hyar miss rob don wan him round nohow i done druv him off wunst upon my libin soul hes done brung his bag behin him on de saddle an i reckon hes gwine to stay  as mr croft dismounted and went into the house peggy glowered at him sundry expressions sounding very much like odds and ends of imprecations which she had picked up in the course of a short but investigative existence gurgling from her lips i wish dat ole miss keswick kunjer him ef she knew how miss rob hate him she curl he legs up an gib him misry spranglin down he back  the hope of seeing this intruder well kunjered by the old lady was the only thing that gave a promise of peace to the mind of peggy and though her nature was by no means a social one she determined to make the acquaintance of some one or other in the house hoping to find out how mrs keswick conducted her conjurations at what time of day or night they were generally put into operation and how persons could be brought under their influence  the breakfast hour in the keswick house was a variable one sometimes the mistress of the establishment rose early and wanted her morning meal before she went out of doors at other times she would go off to some distant point on the farm to see about something that was doing or ought to be done and breakfast would be kept waiting for her the delays however were not all due to the old ladys irregular habits very often letty would come up stairs with the information that the bread aint riz and as a virginia breakfast without hot bread would be an impossibility the meal would be postponed until the bread did conclude to rise or until some substitute such as beaten biscuit had been provided  on the morning after his arrival lawrence croft came down stairs about eight oclock and found the lower part of the house deserted and glancing into the diningroom as he passed its open door he saw no signs of breakfast the house was cool but the sun appeared to be shining warmly outside and he stepped out of the open back door into a small flower garden with a series of broad boards down the walk which lay along the middle of it up and down this board walk lawrence strode breathing the fresh air and thinking over matters he was not at all satisfied at being here during keswicks absence feeling that he was enjoying an advantage which although it was quite honorable did not appear so what he had to do was to get an interview with miss march as soon as possible and have that matter over when he had been definitely accepted or rejected he would go away and whatever the result might be he would write to his rival as soon as he returned to the springs and inform him of it and would also explain how he had happened to be here with miss march while he was engaged in planning these honorable intentions there came from the house mrs keswicks niece with a basket in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other and she immediately applied herself to cutting some geraniums and chrysanthemums which were about the last flowers left blooming at that season in the garden good morning said croft from the other end of the walk i am glad to see you out so early  good morning she replied with a look which indicated that she was not at all glad to see him but i dont think it is early  croft had noticed on the preceding day that her coolness towards him still continued but it did not suit him to let her know that he perceived it he went up to her and in a very friendly way remarked there is something i wish very much you would tell me what is your name it is very odd that during all the time i have been acquainted with you i have never known your name  you must have taken an immense interest in it she said as she snipped some dried leaves off a twig of geranium she had cut  it was not that i did not take any interest said croft but at first your name never came forward and i soon began to know you by the title which your remarkable condition of wedlock gave you  and that is the name said the lady very decidedly by which i am to be known in this house i am very proud of my maiden name but i am not going to tell it to you for fear that some time you will use it  oh ejaculated mr croft then i suppose i am to continue even to think of you as mrs null  you neednt think of me at all said she but when you speak to me i most certainly expect you to use that name it was only by a sort of accident that you came to know it was not my name i dont consider it an accident at all said croft i look upon it as a piece of very kindly confidence  miss annie gave a little twist to her mouth which seemed to indicate that if she spoke she should express her contempt of such an opinion and croft continued  i am very sorry that upon that occasion i should have felt myself obliged to refuse your request that i should make you acquainted with my reasons for desiring to know mr keswicks whereabouts but i am sure if you understood the matter you would not be in the least degree  oh you need not trouble yourself about that she interrupted i dont want you to tell me anything at all it is quite easy now to see why you wished to know where my cousin was  it is impossible that you should know exclaimed croft  we will say no more about it replied annie i am quite satisfied  i would give a good deal said lawrence after looking steadily at her for a few moments to know what you really do think  annie had cut all the flowers she wanted or rather all she could get and she now stood up and looked her companion full in the face mr croft she said it has been necessary and it is necessary now for me to have some concealments and i am sorry for it but it isnt at all necessary for me to conceal my opinion of your reasons for wanting to know about junius you were really in pursuit of miss march and knowing that he was in love with her you wanted to make sure that when you went to her he wouldnt be there it is my firm opinion that is all there is about it and the fact of your turning up here just after my cousin left proves it  miss annie exclaimed crofti have heard you called by that name and i vow i wont call you mrs null when there is no need for ityou were never more mistaken in your life and i am very sorry that you should have such a low opinion of me as to think i would wish to take advantage of your cousin during his absence  then why do you do it asked miss annie with a little upward pitch of her chin  at this moment the breakfastbell rang and mrs keswick appeared in the back door evidently somewhat surprised to see these two conversing in the garden  i am very much vexed said lawrence as he followed his companion who had suddenly turned towards the house that you should think of me in this way  but to this remark miss annie had no opportunity to reply  after breakfast mrs keswick proved the truth of what her niece had said about her unscrupulous straightforwardness when carrying out her projects she had invited mr croft and miss march to her house in order that the former might have the opportunity which she had discovered he wanted and could not get of offering himself in marriage to the lady and she now made it her business to see that mr crofts opportunity should stand up very clear and definite before him and that all interfering circumstances should be carefully removed she informed her niece that she wished her to go with her to a thicket on the other side of the wheat field which that young lady had advised should be ploughed for pickles to look for a turkeyhen which she had reason to believe had been ridiculous enough to hatch out a brood of young at this improper season annie demurred for she did not want to go to look for turkeys nor did she want to give mr croft any opportunities but the old lady insisted and carried her off croft felt that there was something very bare and rawboned about the position in which he was left with miss march and he thought that lady might readily suppose that mrs keswicks object was to leave them together he imagined that himself though why she should be so kind to him he could not feel quite certain however his path lay straight before him and if the old lady had whitewashed it to make it more distinct he did not intend to refuse to walk in it  i have been looking at that hill over yonder said he with a cluster of pine trees on the brow of it i should think there would be a fine view from that hill would you not like to walk up there  lawrence felt that this proposition was quite in keeping with the bareness of the previous proceedings but he did not wish to stay in the house and be subject to the unexpected return of the old lady and her niece  certainly said miss march nothing would please me better and so they walked up pine top hill  when they reached this elevated position they sat down on the rock on which mrs null had once conversed with freddy and admired the view which was indeed a very fine one after about five minutes of this which lawrence thought was quite enough he turned to his companion and said  miss march i do not wish you to suppose that i brought you up here for the purpose of viewing those rolling hills and distant forests  you didnt exclaimed roberta in a tone of surprise  no said he i brought you here because it is a place where i could speak freely to you and tell you i love you  that was not at all necessary said miss march we had the lower floor of the house entirely to ourselves and i am sure that mrs keswick would not have returned until you had waved a handkerchief or given some signal from the back of the house that it was all over  croft looked at her with a troubled expression miss march said he do you not think i am in earnest do you not believe what i have said i have not the slightest doubt you are in earnest she answered the magnitude of the preparation proves it i am glad you said that for it gives me the opportunity for making an explanation said lawrence our meeting at this place may be a carefully contrived stratagem but it was not contrived by me i am very well aware that mr keswick also wishes to marry you  did you see that in the richmond dispatch or in one of the new york papers interrupted miss march  that is a point said lawrence overlooking the ridicule which we need not discuss i am perfectly aware that mr keswick is my rival but i wish you to understand that i am not voluntarily taking any undue advantage of his absence i believe him to be a very fair and generous man and i would wish to be as open and generous as he is when i came i expected to find him here and standing on equal ground with him i intended to ask you to accept my love  well then said roberta would it not be more fair and generous for you to go away now and postpone this proposal until some time when you would each have an equal chance  no it would not said lawrence vehemently i have now an opportunity of telling you that i love you ardently passionately and nothing shall cause me to postpone it will you not consider what i say will you make no answer to this declaration of most true and honest love  i am considering what you have said she answered and i am very glad to hear that you did not know of this cunning little trap that mrs keswick has laid for me it is all very plain to me but i do not know why she should have selected you as one of the actors in the plot have you ever told her that you are a suitor for my hand  never exclaimed lawrence she may have imagined it for she heard i was a frequent visitor to midbranch but let us set all that aside i am on fire with love for you will you tell me that you can return that love or that i must give up all hope this is the most important question of my whole life i beg you from the bottom of my heart to decide it  mr croft said she when you used to come nearly every day to see me at midbranch and we took those long walks in the woods you never talked in this way i considered you as a gentleman whose prudence and good sense would not allow him to step outside of the path of perfectly conventional social intercourse this is not conventional and not prudent  i loved you then and i love you now exclaimed lawrence you must have known that i loved you for my declaration does not in the least surprise you  onceit was the last time you visited midbranchi suspected just a little that your mind might be affected somewhat in the way you speak of but i supposed that attack of weakness had passed away  i know what you mean said lawrence but i cant endure to talk of such trifles i love you roberta  miss march she interrupted  and i want you to tell me if you love me in return  miss march rose from the rock where she had been sitting and her companion rose with her after a moments silence during which he watched her with intense eagerness she said mr croft i am going to give you your choice would you prefer being refused under a cherry tree or under a sycamore  there was a little smile on her lips as she said this which lawrence could not interpret  i decline being refused under any tree he said with vehemence  i prefer the cherry tree said she there is a very pretty one over there on the ridge of this hill and its leaves are nearly all gone which would make it quite appropriatebut what is the meaning of this there comes peggy it isnt possible that she thinks its time for me to give out something to aunt judy  croft turned and there was the wooden peggy marching steadily up the hill and almost upon them  what do you want peggy asked miss roberta  dars a man down to de house dat wants him pointing to mr croft  lawrence was very much surprised a man who wants me he exclaimed you must be mistaken  no sah replied peggy yous de one  for a moment lawrence hesitated his disposition was to let any man in the world be he president or king wait until he had settled this matter with miss march but with peggy present it was impossible to go on with the lovemaking he might indeed send her back with a message but the thought came to him that it would be well to postpone for a little the pressing of his suit for the lady was certainly in a very untoward humor and he was not altogether sorry to have an excuse for breaking off the interview at this point he had not yet been discarded and he would like to think over the matter and see if he could discover any reason for the very disrespectful manner to say the least of it with which miss march had received his amatory advances i suppose i must go and see the man he said though i cant imagine who it can possibly be will you return to the house  no said miss roberta i will stay here a little longer and enjoy the view     chapter xvii   as lawrence croft walked down pine top hill his mind was in a good deal of a hubbub the mind of almost any lover would be stirred up if he came fresh from an interview in which his lady had pinned him to use a cruel figure in various places on the wall to see how he would spin and buzz in different lights but the disdainful pin had not yet gone through a vital part of lawrences hopes and they had strength to spin and buzz a good deal yet as soon as he should have an opportunity he would rack his brains to find out what it was that had put roberta march into such a strange humor no one who simply desired to decline the addresses of a gentleman would treat her lover as miss march had treated him it was quite evident that she wished to punish him but what had been his crime  but the immediate business on his hands was to go and see what man it was who wished to see him ordinarily the fact that a man had called upon him would not be considered by lawrence a matter for cogitation but as he walked toward the house it seemed to him very odd that any one should call upon him in such an outoftheway place as this where so few people knew him to be he was not a business man but a large portion of his funds were invested in a business concern and it might be that something had gone wrong and that a message had been sent him his address at the green sulphur springs was known and the man in charge there knew that he was visiting mrs keswick  these considerations made him a little anxious and helped to keep his mind in the hubbub which has been mentioned  when he reached the front of the house lawrence saw a lean gray horse tied to a tree and a man sitting upon the porch and as soon as he made his appearance the latter came down the steps to meet him  i didnt go into the house sir he said because i thought youd just as lief have a talk outside  what is your business asked croft  the man moved a few steps farther from the house and lawrence followed him  is it anything secret you have to tell me he asked  well yes sir i should think it was replied the other a tall man with sandy hair and beard and dressed in a checkered business suit which had lost a good deal of the freshness of its early youth i may as well tell you at once who i am i am an antidetective never heard of that sort of person i suppose  never said lawrence curtly  well sir the organization which i belong to is one which is filling a long felt want you know very well sir that this country is full of detective officers not only those who belong to a regular police force but lots of private ones who if anybody will pay them for it will go to jericho to hunt a man up now sir our object is to protect society against these people when we get information that a man is going to be hounded down by any of these detectivesand we have private ways of knowing these thingswe just go to that man and if he is willing to become one of our clients we take him into our charge and our business after that is to keep him informed of just what is being done against him he can stay at home in comfort with his wife settle up his accounts and do what he likes and the day before he is to be swooped down on he gets notice from us and comfortably goes to chicago or jacksonville where he can take his ease until we post him of the next move of the enemy if he wants to take extra precautions and writes a letter to anybody in the place where he lives dated from london or hong kong and sends that letter under cover to us well see that it is mailed from the place it is dated from and that it gets into the hands of the detectives there have been cases where a gentleman has had six months or a year of perfect comfort by the detectives being thrown off by a letter like this that is only one of the ways in which we help and protect persons in difficulties who if it wasnt for us would be dragged off handcuffed from the bosom of their families and who even if they never got convicted would have to pay a lot of money to get out of the scrape now i have put myself a good deal out of the way sir to come to you and offer you our assistance  me exclaimed croft what are you talking about  the man smiled of course its all right to know nothing about it and its just what we would advise but i assure you we are thoroughly posted in your affair and to let you know that we are ill just mention that the case is that of croft after keswick through candy  stuff and nonsense exclaimed lawrence getting red in the face there is no such case  he was about to say more when a few words from the antidetective stopped him suddenly  look here mr keswick said the man leveling a long forefinger at him and speaking very earnestly dont you go and flatter yourself that this thing has been dropped because you havent heard of it for a month or two and if youll take my advice youll make up your mind on the spot either to let things go on and be nabbed or to put yourself under our protection and live in entire safety until this thing has blown over without any trouble except a little travelling at the mention of keswicks name lawrence had seen through the whole affair at a single mental glance the man was after junius keswick and his business was to lawrence more startling and repugnant than it could possibly be to any one else it was necessary to be very careful if he immediately avowed who he was the man might yet find keswick before warning and explanation could be got to him and not only put that gentleman in a very unpleasant state of mind but do a lot of mischief besides he did not believe that mr candy had recommenced his investigations without consultation with him but this person evidently knew that such an investigation had been set on foot and that would be sufficient for his purposes lawrence decided to be very wary and he said to the man did you ask for me here by name  no sir said the other i had information that you were here and that you were the only gentleman who lived here and although you are in your own home i did not know but this was one of those cases in which names were dropped and servants changed to suit an emergency i asked the little darkey i saw at the front of the house if she lived here and she told me she had only just come that put me on my guard and so i merely asked if the gentleman was in and she went and got you were very careful about calling names and you neednt be afraid that any of our people will ever give you away on that line  lawrence reflected for a moment and then he said what are your terms and arrangements for carrying on an affair of this kind  they are very simple and moderate said the man taking a wallet from his pocket there is one of our printed slips which we show but dont give away to become a client all you have to do is to send fifteen dollars to the office or to pay it to me if you think no time should be lost that will entitle you to protection for a year after that we make the nominal charge of five dollars for each letter sent you giving you information of what is going on against you for extra services such as mailing letters from distant points of course there will be extra charges  lawrence glanced over the printed slip which contained information very similar to that the man had given him and as he did so he came to the conclusion that there would be nothing dishonest in allowing the fellow to continue in his mistake and to endeavor to find out what mischief was about to be done in his lawrences name and under his apparent authority i will become a subscriber said he taking out his pocketbook and request that you give me all the information you possess here and immediately  that is the best thing to do said the man taking the money for in my opinion no time is to be lost ill give you a receipt for this  dont trouble yourself about that said lawrence let me have your information  youre very right said the man its a great deal better not to have your name on anything and now for the points candy who has charge of crofts job is going more into the detective business than he used to be and we have information that he has lately taken up your affair in good solid earnest he found out that croft had put somebody else on your track without regularly taking the business out of his hands and this made him mad and i dont wonder at it for croft as i understand has plenty of money and if he concluded to throw candy over he ought to have done it fair and square and paid him something handsome in consideration for having taken the job away but he didnt do anything of the kind and candy considers himself still in his employment and vows hes going to get hold of you before the other party does so you see you have got two sets of detectives after you and theyll be mighty sharp for the first one that gets you will make the money  where are candys detectives now asked lawrence  that i cant tell you positively as i am so far from our new york office to which all information comes but now that you are a subscriber ill communicate with headquarters and the necessary points will be immediately sent to you by telegraph if necessary all that you have to do is to stay here until you hear from us  from the way you spoke just now said lawrence i supposed the detective would be here today or tomorrow  oh no said the other candy has not the facilities for finding people that we have but it takes some time for me to communicate with headquarters and for you to hear from there and so as i said before there isnt an hour to be lost but youre all right now  i expected you to give me more definite information than this said lawrence but now i suppose i must wait until i hear from new york at five dollars a message  my business is to enlist subscribers said the other you couldnt expect me to tell you anything definite when i am in an outoftheway place like this  did you come down to virginia on purpose to find me asked lawrence  no said the man i am on my way to mobile and i only lose one train by stopping here to attend to your business  how did you know i was here  ah said the antidetective with a smile as i told you we have facilities i knew you were at this house and i came here straight as a die  it is truly wonderful said lawrence how accurate your information is and now i will tell you something you can have gratis you have made one of the most stupid blunders that i ever heard of mr keswick went away from here nearly a week ago and i am the mr croft whom you supposed to be in pursuit of him  the man started and gave vent to an unpleasant ejaculation  to prove it said lawrence there is my card and putting his hand into his pocket here are several letters addressed to me and i want to let you know that i am not in pursuit of mr keswick that he and i are very good friends and that i have frequently seen him of late and so you can just drop this business at once and as for candy he has no right to take a single step for which i have not authorized him i merely employed him to get mr keswicks address which i wished for a very friendly motive i shall write to candy at once  the mans face was not an agreeable study he looked angry he looked baffled and yet he looked incredulous now come said he if you are not keswick what did you pay me that money for  i paid it to you said lawrence because i wanted to find out what dirty business you were doing in my name i have had the worth of my money and you can now go  the man did not go but stood gazing at lawrence in a very peculiar way if mr keswick isnt here he said i believe you are here waiting for him and i am going to stay and warn him people dont set private detectives on other mens tracks just for friendly motives  lawrences face flushed and he made a step forward but suddenly checking himself he looked at the man for a moment and then said i suppose you want me to understand that if i become one of your subscribers in my own name you will be willing to withhold the information you intended to give mr keswick  well said the man relapsing into his former confidential tones business is business if i could see mr keswick i dont know whether he would employ me or not i have no reason to work for one person more than another and of course if one man comes to me and another doesnt im bound to work for the man who comes thats business  you have said quite enough said lawrence now leave this place instantly  no i wont said the man shutting his mouth very tightly as he drew himself up and folded his arms on his chest  lawrence was young wellmade and strong but the other man was taller heavier and perhaps stronger to engage in a personal contest to compel a fellow like this to depart would be a very unpleasant thing for lawrence to do even if he succeeded he was a visitor here the ladies would probably be witnesses of the conflict and although the natural impulse of his heart predominant over everything else at that moment prompted him to spring upon the impudent fellow and endeavor to thrash him still his instincts as a gentleman forbade him to enter into such a contest which would probably have no good effect no matter how it resulted never before did he feel the weakness of the moral power of a just cause when opposed to brutal obstinacy still he did not retreat from his position did you hear what i said he cried leave this place  you are not master here said the other still preserving his defiant attitude and you have no right to order me away i am not going  despite his inferiority in size despite his gentlemanly instincts and despite his prudent desire not to make an exhibition of himself before miss march and the household it is probable that lawrences anger would have assumed some form of physical manifestation had not mrs keswick appeared suddenly on the porch it was quite evident to her from the aspect of the two men that something was wrong and she called out whos that  that madam said lawrence stepping a little back is a very impertinent man who has no business here and whom ive ordered off the place and as he has refused to go i propose  stop cried the old lady and turning she rushed into the house before either of the men could recover from their surprise at her sudden action she reappeared upon the porch carrying a doublebarreled gun taking her position on the top of the flight of steps with a quick movement of her thumb she cocked both barrels then drawing herself up and resting firmly on her right leg with the left advanced she raised the gun her right elbow well against her side and with her extended left arm as steady as one of the beams of the roof above her she hooked her forefinger around one of the triggers her eagle eye glanced along the barrels straight at the head of the antidetective and in a clarion voice she sang out go  the man stared at her he saw the open muzzles of the gun barrels beyond them he saw the bright tops of the two percussion caps and still beyond them he saw the bright and determined eye that was taking sight along the barrels all this he took in at a glance and without word or comment he made a quick dodge of his head jumped to one side made a dash for his horse and untying the bridle with a jerk he mounted and galloped out of the open gate turning as he did so to find himself still covered by the muzzles of that gun when he had nearly reached the outer gate and felt himself out of range he turned in his saddle and looking back at lawrence who was still standing where he had left him he violently shook his fist in the air  which means said lawrence to himself that he intends to make trouble with keswick  that settled him said the old lady with a grim smile as she lowered the muzzle of the gun and gently let down the hammers madam said lawrence advancing toward her may i ask if that gun is loaded  i should say so replied the old lady in each barrel are two thimblefuls of powder and halfabox of windfalls teaberry tonic pills each one of them as big and as hard as a buckshot they were brought here by a travelling agent who sold some of them to my people and i tell you sir that those pills made them so sick that one man wasnt able to work for two days and another for three i vowed if that agent ever came back id shoot his abominable pills into him and ive kept the gun loaded for the purpose was this a pill man i scarcely think he was a fertilizer because it is rather late in the season for those bandits  he is a man said lawrence coming up the steps who belongs to a class much worse than those you have mentioned he is what is called a blackmailer  is that so cried the old lady her eyes flashing as she brought the butt of the gun heavily upon the porch floor im very glad i did not know it very glad indeed for i might have been tempted to give him what belonged to another without waiting for him to disobey my order to go i am very much troubled sir that this annoyance should have happened to you in my house pray do not allow it to interfere with the enjoyment of your visit here which i hope may continue as long as you can make it convenient the words and manner convinced lawrence that that they did not merely indicate a conventional hospitality the old lady meant what she said she wanted him to stay  that morning he had become convinced that he had been invited there because mrs keswick wished him to marry miss march and she had done this not out of any kind feeling toward him because that would be impossible considering the shortness of their acquaintance but because she was opposed to her nephews marriage with miss march and because he lawrence was the only available person who could be brought forward to supplant him but whatever her motive is thought lawrence her invitation comes in admirably for me and i hope i shall get the proper advantage from it  shortly after this lawrence sat in the parlor by himself writing a letter it was to junius keswick and in it he related the facts of his search for him in new york and the reason why he desired to make his acquaintance he concealed nothing but the fact that keswicks cousin had had anything to do with the affair if she wants him to know that he thought she can tell him herself it is not my business to make any revelations in that quarter he concluded the letter by informing mr keswick of the visit of the antidetective and warning him against any attempts which that individual might make upon his pocket assuring him that the man could tell him nothing in regard to the affair that he now did not know  after dinner during which meal miss march appeared in a very good humor and talked rather more than she had yet done in the bosom of that family lawrence had his horse saddled and rode to the railroad station about six miles distant where he posted his letter and also sent a telegram to mr junius keswick warning him to pay no attention to any man who might call upon him on business connected with croft and keswick and stating that an explanatory letter had been sent  the antidetective had left on a train an hour before but lawrence felt certain that the telegram would reach keswick before the man could possibly get to him especially as the latter had probably not yet found out his intended victims address     chapter xviii   as lawrence croft rode back to mrs keswicks house after having posted to his rival the facts in the case of croft after keswick he did not feel in a very happy or triumphant mood the visit of the antidetective had compelled him to write to keswick at a time when it was not at all desirable that he should make any disclosures whatever in regard to his love affair with miss march except that very important disclosure which he had made to the lady herself that morning of course there was no great danger that any intimation would reach miss march of mr crofts rather eccentric search for his predecessor in the position which he wished to occupy in her affections but the matter was particularly unpleasant just now and lawrence wished to occupy his time here in business very different from that of sending explanations to rivals and warding off unfriendly entanglements threatened by a blackmailer  it was absolutely necessary for him to find out what he had done to offend miss march offended that lady certainly was and he even felt that she was glad of the opportunity his declaration gave her to inflict punishment upon him but still he did not despair when she had made him pay the penalty she thought proper for whatever error he had committed she might be willing to listen to him he had not said anything to her in regard to his failure to make her the promised visit at midbranch for during the only time he had been alone with her here the subject of an immediate statement of his feelings toward her had wholly occupied his mind but it now occurred to him that she had reason to feel aggrieved at his failure to keep his promise to her and she must have shown that feeling for otherwise her most devoted friend mr junius keswick would never have made that rather remarkable visit to him at the green sulphur springs of course he would not allude to that visit nor to her wish to see him for she had sent him no message nor did he know what object she had in desiring an interview but it was quite possible that she might have taken umbrage at his failure to come to her when expected and that this was the reason for her present treatment of him to this treatment lawrence might have taken exception but now he did not wish to judge her in any way his only desire in regard to her was to possess her and therefore instead of condemning her for her unjust method of showing her resentment he merely considered how he should set himself right with her cruel or kind just or unjust he wanted her  and then as he slowly trotted along the lonely and uneven road it suddenly flashed upon him as if in mounting a hill a farreaching landscape hitherto unseen had in a moment spread itself out before him that perhaps miss march had divined the reason of his extremely discreet behavior toward her was it possible that she had seen his motives and knew the truth and that she resented the prudence and caution he had shown in his intercourse with her  if she had read the truth he felt that she had good reason for her resentment and lawrence did not trouble himself to consider if she had shown too much of it or not he remembered the story of the defeated general and feeling that so far he had been thoroughly defeated he determined to admit the fact and to sound a retreat from all the positions he had held but at the same time to make a bold dash into the enemys camp and if possible capture the commanderinchief and the minister of war  he would go to roberta tell her all that he had thought and explain all that he had done there should be no bit of truth which she could have reasoned out which he would not plainly avow and set before her then he would declare to her that his love for her had become so great that rushing over every barrier whether of prudence doubt or indecision it had carried him with it and laid him at her feet when he had come to this bold conclusion he cheered up his horse with a thump of his heel and cantered rapidly over the rest of the road  peggy having nothing else to do was standing by the yard gate when he came in sight and she watched his approach with feelings of surprise and disgust she had seen him ride away and not considering the fact that he did not carry his valise with him she supposed he had taken his final departure she had conceived a violent dislike to mr croft looking upon him in the light of an interloper and a robber who had come to break up that expected marriage between master junius and miss rob which the servants at midbranch looked forward to as necessary for the prosperity of the family and the preliminary stages of which she had taken upon herself the responsibility of describing with so much minuteness of detail with the politeness natural to the southern negro she opened the gate for the gentleman but as she closed it behind him she cast after him a look of earnest malevolence ef dot ole miss keswick don kunjer you sah she said in an undertone is gwine to do it mysef so dar and she gave her foot a stamp on the ground  lawrence all ignorant of the malignant feeling he had excited in this to him very unimportant and uninteresting black girl tied his horse and went into the house as he passed the open door of the parlor he saw a lady reading by a window in the farthest corner hanging up his hat he entered hoping that the reader whose form was partially concealed by the back of the large rocking chair in which she was sitting was miss march but it was not it was mrs keswicks niece deeply engrossed by a largepaged novel she turned her head as he entered and said good evening  good evening miss annie said lawrence seating himself in a chair opposite her on the other side of the window  mr croft said she laying her book on her lap and inclining herself slightly toward him you have no right to call me miss annie and i wish you would not do it the servants in the south call ladies by their first names whether they are married or not but people would think it very strange if you should imitate them my name in this house is mrs null and i wish you would not forget it  the trouble with me is said lawrence with a smile that i cannot forget it is not mrs null but of course if you desire it i will give you that name  i told you before how much i desired it said she and why when my aunt finds out the exact state of this affair i shall wish to stay no longer in this house and i dont want my stay to come to an end at present i am very happy here with the only relatives i have in the world who are ever so much nicer people than i supposed they were and you have no right to come here and drive me away  my dear young lady said croft i wouldnt do such a thing for the world i admit that i am very sorry that it is necessary or appears to you to be so that you should be here under false colors but  appears to be said she with much emphasis on the first word why cant you see that it would be impossible for me as a young unmarried woman to come to the house of a man whose proprietor as aunt keswick considers herself to be has been trying to marry to me even before i was grown up for the letters that used to make my father most angry were about this i hate to talk of these family affairs and i only do it so that you can be made understand things  mrs null said lawrence do not think i wish to blame you you have had a hard time of it and i can see the peculiarities of your residence here dont be afraid of me i will not betray your secret while i am here i will address you and will try to think of you as a very grave young matron but i wish very much that you were not quite so grave and severe when you address me when i was here last week your manner was very different we were quite friendly then  i see no particular reason said annie why we should be friendly  mrs null said lawrence after a little pause during which he looked at her attentively i dont believe you approve of me  no said she i dont  he could not help smiling at the earnest directness of her answer though he did not like it i am sorry he said that you should have so poor an opinion of me and now let me tell you what i was going to say this morning that my only object in finding your cousin was to know the man who had been engaged to miss march  so that you could find out what she probably objected to in him and could then try and not let her see anything of that sort in you  mrs null said lawrence you are unjust there is no reason why you should speak to me in this way  i would like to know she said what cause there could possibly be for your wanting to become acquainted with a man who had been engaged to the lady you wished to marry if you didnt intend to study him up and try to do better yourself  my motive in desiring to become acquainted with mr keswick said lawrence is one you could scarcely understand and all i can say about it is that i believed that if i knew the gentleman who had formerly been the accepted lover of a lady i should better know the lady  you must be awfully suspicious said she  no i am not he answered and i knew you would not understand me my only desire in speaking to you upon this subject is that you may not unreasonably judge me  but i am not unreasonable said annie you are trying to get miss march away from my cousin and i dont think it is fair and i dont want you to do it when you were here before i thought you two were good friends but now i dont believe it  how friendly might be the relations between himself and keswick when the latter should read his letter about the candy affair and should know that he was in this house with miss march lawrence could not say but he did not allude to this point in his companions remarks i do not think he said that you have any reason to object to my endeavoring to win miss march even if she accepts me it will be to the advantage of your cousin because if he still hopes to obtain her the sooner he knows he cannot do so the better it will be for him my course is perfectly fair i am aware that the lady is not at present engaged to any one and i am endeavoring to induce her to engage herself to me if i fail then i step aside  entirely aside and out of the way asked mrs null  entirely answered lawrence  well said annie leaning back in her chair in which before she had been sitting very upright you have at last given me a good deal of your confidence almost as much as i gave you some of the things you say i believe others i dont  lawrence was annoyed but he would not allow himself to get angry i am not accustomed to being disbelieved he said gravely it is a very unusual experience i assure you which of my statements do you doubt  i dont believe said annie that you will give her up if she rejects you while you are here you are too wilful you will follow her and try again  mrs null said lawrence i do not feel justified in speaking to a third person of these things but this is a peculiar case and therefore i assure you and request you to believe me that if miss march shall now positively refuse me i shall feel convinced that her affections are already occupied and that i have no right to press my suit any longer  would you like to begin now said annie she is coming down stairs  you are entirely too matteroffact said lawrence smiling in spite of himself and in a moment roberta entered the room  if the young lady in the highbacked rockingchair had any idea of giving mr croft and miss march an opportunity of expressing their sentiments toward each other she took no immediate steps to do so for she gently rocked herself she talked about the novel she had been reading she blamed miss march for staying so long in her room on such a beautiful afternoon and she was the primary cause of a conversation among the three upon the differences between new york weather and that of virginia and this continued until old mrs keswick joined the party and changed the conversation to the consideration of the fact that a fertilizer agent a pill man or a blackmailer would find out a persons whereabouts even if he were attending the funeral of his grandmother on a desert island  the next morning about an hour after breakfast lawrence was walking up and down on the grass in front of the house smoking a cigar and troubling his mind he had had no opportunity on the previous evening to be alone with miss march for the little party sat together in the parlor until they separated for bed and so of course nothing was yet settled he was overstaying the time he had expected to spend here and he felt nervous about it he had hoped to see miss march after breakfast but she seemed to have withdrawn herself entirely from observation perhaps she considered that she had sufficiently rejected him on the previous morning and that she now intended except when she was sure of the company of the others to remain in her room until he should go away but he had no such opinion in regard to their interview on pine top hill he believed that he had been punished not rejected and that when he should be able to explain everything to her he would be forgiven that at least was his earnest hope and hope makes us believe almost anything  but although there were so many difficulties in his way lawrence had a friend in that household who still remained true to him mrs keswick with sunbonnet and umbrella came out upon the porch and said cheerily i should think a gentleman like you would prefer to be with the ladies than to be walking about here by yourself they have gone to take a walk in the woods i should have said that miss march has gone on ahead with her little maid peggy my niece was going with her but i called her back to attend to some housekeeping matters for me and i think she will be kept longer than she expected for i have just sent letty to her to be shown how to cut out a frock but you neednt wait you can go right through the flowergarden and take the path over the fields into the woods and having concluded this bit of conscienceless and transparent management the old lady remarked that she herself was going for a walk and left him  lawrence lost no time in following her suggestions throwing away his cigar he hurried through the house and the little flowergarden a gate at the back of which opened into a wide pasturefield this field sloped down gently to a branch or little stream which ran through the middle of it and then the ground ascended until it reached the edge of the woods following the welldefined path he looked across the little valley before him and could see just inside the edge of the woodsthe trees and bushes being much more thinly attired than in the summer timethe form of a lady in a lightcolored dress with a red scarf upon her shoulders sometimes moving slowly sometimes stopping this was roberta and those woods were a far better place than the exposed summit of pine top hill in which to plight his troth if it should be so that he should be able to do it and there were doubtless paths in those woods through which they might afterwards wander if things should turn out propitiously at all events in those woods would he settle this affair  his intention was still strong to make a very clean breast of it to roberta if she had blamed him for his prudent reserve she should have full opportunity to forgive him all that he had been she should know but far more important than that he would try to make her know better than he had done before what he was now abandoning all his previous positions and mounted on these strong resolutions thus would he dash into her camp and hope to capture her  reaching the little ravine at the bottom of which flowed the branch now but two or three feet wide he ran down the rather steep slope and stepped upon the stout plank which bridged the stream the instant he did so the plank turned beneath him as if it had been hung on pivots and he fell into the stony bed of the branch it was an awkward fall for the leg which was undermost came down at an angle and his foot striking a slippery stone turned under him in a moment he was on his feet and scrambled up the side of the ravine down which he had just come when he reached the top he sat down and put both his hands on his right ankle in which he felt considerable pain in a few minutes he arose and began to walk toward the house but he had not taken a dozen steps before he sat down again the pain in his ankle was very severe and he felt quite sure that he had sprained it he knew enough about such things to understand that if he walked upon this injured joint he would not only make the pain worse but the consequences might be serious he was very much annoyed not only that this thing had happened to him but that it had happened at such an inauspicious moment of course he could not now go on to the woods and he must get somebody to help him to the house looking about he saw at a distance uncle isham and he called loudly to him as soon as lawrence was well away from the edge of the ravine there emerged from some thick bushes on the other side of it and at a short distance from the crossingplace a negro girl who slipped noiselessly down to the branch moved with quick steps and crouching body to the plank removed the two round stones on which it had been skilfully poised and replaced it in its usual firm position this done she slipped back into the bushes and by the time isham had heard the call of mr croft she was slowly walking down the opposite hill as if she were coming from the woods to see why the gentleman was shouting  miss march also heard the call and came out of the woods and when she saw lawrence sitting on the grass on the other side of the branch with one hand upon his ankle she knew that something had happened and came down toward him lawrence saw her approaching and before she was even near enough to hear him he began to shout to her to be careful about crossing the branch as the board was unsafe peggy joined her and walked on in front of her and when miss march understood what lawrence was saying she called back that she would be careful when they reached the ravine peggy ran down stepped upon the plank jumped on the middle of it walked over it and then back again and assured her mistress that it was just as good as ever it was and that she reckoned the city gentleman didnt know how to walk on planks and that he jes done fall off  miss march crossed stepping a little cautiously and reached lawrence just as uncle isham with strong arms and many words of sympathy had assisted him to his feet what has happened to you mr croft she exclaimed  i was coming to you he said and in crossing the stream the plank turned under me and i am afraid i have sprained my ankle i cant walk on it  i am very sorry she said  because i was coming to you he said grimly or because i hurt myself  you ought to be ashamed to speak in that way she answered but i wont find fault with you now that you are in such pain is there anything i can do for you  no thank you said lawrence i will lean on this good man and i think i can hop to the house  peggy said miss roberta walk on the other side of the gentleman and let him lean upon your shoulder i will go on and have something prepared to put on his ankle  with one side supported by the stout isham and his other hand resting on the shoulder of the good little peggy who bore up as strongly under it as if she had been a big walkingstick lawrence slowly made his way to the house miss march got there sometime before he did and was very glad to find that mrs keswick had not yet gone out on the walk for which she was prepared that circumspect old lady had found this and that to occupy her while she so managed her household matters that one thing should follow another to detain her niece but when she heard what had happened all other impulses gave way to those which belonged to a head nurse and a mistress of emergencies she set down her umbrella shouted an order to letty to put a kettle of water on the fire brought from her own room some flannel and two bottles of embrocation and then stopping a moment to reflect ordered that the office should be prepared for mr croft for it would be a shame to make a gentleman with a sprained ankle clamber up stairs  the office was a small building in the wide front yard not very far from the house and opposite to the arbor which has been before mentioned it was one story high and contained one large and comfortable room such buildings are quite common on virginian farms and although called offices are seldom used in an official way being generally appropriated to the bachelors of the family or their gentleman visitors this one was occupied by junius keswick when he was at home and a good many of his belongings were now in it but as it was at present unoccupied nothing could be more proper than that mr croft should have it     chapter xix   about noon of the day of mr crofts accident uncle isham had occasion to go to the cabin of the venerable aunt patsy and of course he told her what had happened to the gentleman whom he and aunt patsy still supposed to be miss annies husband the news produced a very marked effect upon the old woman she put down the crazy quilt upon the unfinished corner of which she was making a few feeble stitches and looked at uncle isham with a troubled frown she was certain that this was the work of old mrs keswick who had succeeded at last in conjuring the young husband and the charm she had given him and upon which she had relied to avert the ill will of ole miss had proved unavailing the conjuring had been accomplished so craftily and slyly the bewitched plank in one place and mrs keswick far off in another that there had been no chance to use the counteracting charm and yet aunt patsy had thought it a good charm a very good one indeed  early in her married life mrs keswick had been the mother of a little girl it had died when it was very small and it was the only child she ever had of this infant she preserved as a memento a complete suit of its clothes which she regarded with a feeling almost religious years ago however aunt patsy in order to protect herself against the conjuring powers of the mistress of the house in which she then served as a sort of supervising cook had possessed herself of the shoes belonging to the cherished suit of clothes she knew the sacred light in which they were regarded by their owner and she felt quite sure that if ole miss ever attempted in one of her fits of anger to exercise her power of limb twisting or back contortion upon her that the sight of those little blue shoes would create a revulsion of feeling and as she put it to herself stop her mighty short the shoes had never been missed for the box containing the suit was only opened on one day of the year and then all the old lady could endure was a peep at the little white frock which covered the rest of the contents and aunt patsy well knew that the sight of those little blue shoes would be to her mistress like two little feet coming back from the grave  patsy had been much too old to act as nurse to the infant annie peyton then regarded as the daughter of the house but she had always felt for the child the deepest affection and now that she herself was so near the end of her career that she had little fear of being bewitched she was willing to give up the safeguards she had so long possessed in order that they might protect the man whom miss annie had loved and married but they had failed or rather it had been impossible to use them and miss annies husband had been stricken down its powful hard to git roun ole miss she groaned she too much fur ole folks like i is  at this remark uncle isham fired up although the conduct of his mistress troubled him at times very much he was intensely loyal to her and he instantly caught the meaning of this aspersion against her now look hyar aun patsy he exclaimed wot you talkin bout wot ole miss got to do wid mister crof sprainin he ankle ole miss warnt dar an when i done fotch him up to de house she cut roun an do more fur him dan anybody else she got de hot water an she dipped de flannels in it an she wrop up de ankle all hersef an when she got him all fixed comfable in de offis she says to me says she now isham you wait on mister crof an you gib him eberything he want an when de cool ob de ebenin comes on you make a fire in dat fireplace an stay whar he kin call you wheneber he wants you to wait on him i didnt eben come down hyar till i axed him would he want me fur half an hour  well said aunt patsy her eyes softening a little praps she didnt do it dis time it mout a been his own orkardness i hopes to mussiful goodness dat dat was so but wot fur you call him mister crof is dat he fus name  i reckon so said isham he one ob de famly now an i reckon dey calls him by he fus name an now look hyar aun patsy i wants you not to disremember dis hyar don you go imaginin ebery time anything happens to folks that ole miss done been kunjerin em dat aint pious an taint suitable fur a ole pusson like you aun patsy wots jus settin on de poach steps ob heaben a waitin till somebody finds out yous dar an lets you in  aunt patsy turned her great spectacles full upon him and then she said you isham ef eber you gits a call to preach to folks you jus sing out oh lor i aint fit and den you go crack your head wid a millstone fur fear you git called agin fru mistake  uncle isham made no answer to this piece of advice but taking up some clothes which aunt patsys great granddaughter had washed and ironed for him he left the cabin he was a man much given to attending to his own business and paying very little attention to those affairs of his mistresss household with which he had no personal concern when mr croft first came to the house he as well as aunt patsy had been told that it was mr null the husband of miss annie and although not thinking much about it he had always supposed this to be the case but now it struck him as a very strange thing that miss annie did not attend to her husband but allowed his mistress and himself to do everything that was done for him it was a question which his mind was totally incapable of solving but when he reached the house he spoke to letty on the subject bress your soul exclaimed that wellnourished person dats not mister null wot married miss annie dats mister crof an he aint married to nobody mister null he aint come yet but i reckon hell be along soon  well den exclaimed isham much surprised how come aun patsy to take he for miss annies husband  oh git out contemptuously exclaimed letty don you go put no count on dem fool notions wot aun patsy got in she old head nobody knows how dey come dar no moren how dey eber manage to git out taint no use splainin nothin to aun patsy an if she blieves dats miss annies husband you cant make her blieve its anybody else jes you lef her alone nuffin she blieves aint gwine to hurt her  and isham remembering his frequent ill success in endeavoring to make aunt patsy think as she ought to think concluded that this was good advice  at the time of the conversation just mentioned lawrence was sitting in a large easy chair in front of the open door of the room of which he had been put in possession his injured foot was resting upon a cushioned stool a small table stood by him on which were his cigar and match cases a pitcher of iced water and a glass and a late copy of a semiweekly paper through the doorway which was but two steps higher than the grass sward before it his eyes fell upon a very pleasing scene to the right was the house with its vinecovered porch and several great oak trees overhanging it which still retained their heavy foliage although it was beginning to lose something of its summer green in front of him at the opposite end of the grassy yard was the pretty little arbor in which he had told mr junius keswick of the difficulties in the way of his speaking his mind to miss march beyond the large garden at the back of this arbor stretched a wide field with a fringe of woods at its distant edge gay with the colors of autumn the sky was bright and blue and fair white clouds moved slowly over its surface the air was sunny and warm with bumblebees humming about some lateflowering shrubs and high in the air floated two great turkeybuzzards with a beauty of motion surpassed by no other flying thing with never a movement of their widespread wings except to give them the necessary inclination as they rose with the wind and then turned and descended in a long sweep only to rise again and complete the circle sailing thus for hours around and around their shadows moving over the fields below them  fearing that he had sustained some injury more than a mere sprain lawrence had had the howletts doctor summoned and that general practitioner had come and gone after having assured mr croft that no bones had been broken that mrs keswicks treatment was exactly what it should be and that all that was necessary for him was to remain quiet for a few days and be very careful not to use the injured ankle thus he had the prospect of but a short confinement he felt no present pain and there was nothing of the sickroom atmosphere in his surroundings for his position close to the door almost gave him the advantage of sitting in the open air of this bright autumnal day  but lawrences mind dwelt not at all on these ameliorating circumstances it dwelt only upon the fact that he was in one house and miss march was in another it was impossible for him to go to her and he had no reason to believe that she would come to him under ordinary circumstances it would be natural enough for her to look in upon him and inquire into his condition but now the case was very different she knew that he desired to see her that he had been coming to her when he met with his accident and she knew too exactly what he wanted to say and it was not to be supposed that a lady would come to a man to be wooed especially this lady who had been in such an unfavorable humor when he had wooed her the day before  but it was quite impossible for lawrence at this most important crisis of his life to sit without action for three or four days during which time it was not unlikely that miss march might go home but what was he to do it would be rediculous to think of sending for her she knowing for what purpose she was wanted and as for writing a letter that did not suit him at all there was too much to be explained too much to be urged too much to be avowed and probably too many contingencies to be met for him to even consider the subject of writing a letter a proposal on paper would most certainly bring a rejection on paper he could think of no plan he must trust to chance if his lucky star and it had shone a good deal in his life should give him an opportunity of speaking to her he would lose not an instant in broaching the important subject he was happy to think he had a friend in the old lady perhaps she might bring about the desired interview but although this thought was encouraging he could not but tremble when he remembered the very plain and unvarnished way she had of doing such things  while these thoughts were passing through his mind a lady came out upon the porch and descended the steps at the first sight of her through the vines lawrence had thought it might be miss march and his heart had given a jump but it was not it was mrs null and she came over the grass toward him and stopped in front of his door how are you feeling now she asked does your foot still hurt you  oh no said lawrence i am in no pain the only thing that troubles me is that i have to stay just here  it might have been better on some accounts said she if you had been taken into the house but it would have hurt you dreadfully to go up stairs unless uncle isham carried you on his back which i dont believe he could do  of course its a great deal better out here said lawrence in fact this is a perfectly charming place to be laid up in but i want to get about i want to see people many people asked she with a significant little smile  lawrence smiled in return you must know mrs null from what i have told you he said that there is one person i want to see very much and that is why i am so annoyed at being kept here in this chair  you must be of an uncommonly impatient turn of mind she said for you havent been here three hours altogether and hundreds of persons sit still that long just because they want to  i dont want to sit still a minute said lawrence i very much wish to speak to miss march couldnt you contrive an opportunity for me to do so  it is possible that i might she said but i wont havent i told you that i dont approve of this affair of yours my cousin is in love with miss march and all i should do for you would be directly against him aunt so managed things this morning that i was actually obliged to give you an opportunity to be with her but i had intended going with roberta to the woods as she had asked me to do  you are very cruel said lawrence  no i am not said she i am only just i explained to you yesterday said he that your course of thinking and acting is not just and is of no possible advantage to anybody how can it injure your cousin if miss march refuses me and i go away and never see her again and if she accepts me then you should be glad that i had put an end to your cousins pursuit of a woman who does not love him  that is nonsense said she i shouldnt be glad at all to see him disappointed i should feel like a traitor if i helped you but i did not come to talk about these things i came to ask you what you would have for dinner  i had an idea said lawrence not regarding this remark that you were a young lady of a kindly disposition  and you dont think so now she said  no answered lawrence i cannot i cannot think a woman kind who will refuse to assist a man situated as i am to settle the most important question of his life especially as i have told you before that it is really to the interest of the one you are acting for that it should be settled  miss annie still standing in front of the door now regarded lawrence with a certain degree of thoughtfullness on her countenance which presently changed to a half smile if i were perfectly sure she said that she would reject you i would try to get her here and have the matter settled but i dont know her very well yet and cant feel at all certain as to what she might do  i like your frankness said lawrence but as i said before you are very cruel  not at all said she i am very kind only  you dont show it interrupted lawrence  at this miss annie laughed kindness isnt of much use if it is shut up is it she said i suppose you think it is one of those virtues that we ought to act out as well as feel if we want any credit and now isnt there something i can do for you besides bringing another mans sweetheart to you  lawrence smiled i dont believe she is his sweetheart he said and i want to find out if i am right  it is my opinion said miss annie that you ought to think more about your sprained ankle and your general health than about having your mind settled by miss march i should think that keeping your blood boiling in this way would inflame your joints  the doctor didnt tell me what to think about said lawrence he only said i must not walk  i havent heard yet said miss annie what you would like to have to eat i dont wish to give the slightest trouble answered lawrence what do you generally give people in such scrapes as this tea and toast  annie laughed nonsense said she what you want is the best meal you can get aunt said if there was anything you particularly liked she would have it made for you  do not think of such a thing said lawrence give me just what the family has  would you like miss march to bring it out to you she asked  the word cruel cannot express your disposition said lawrence i pity mr null poor man said she but it would be a good thing for you if you could keep your mind as quiet as his is and with that she went into the house  after dinner miss march did come out to inquire into mr crofts condition but she was accompanied by mrs keswick lawrence invited the ladies to come in and be seated but roberta stood on the grass in front of the door as miss annie had done while mrs keswick entered the room looked into the icewater pitcher and examined things generally to see if uncle isham had been guilty of any sins of omission  do you feel quite at ease now said miss march  my ankle dont trouble me said lawrence but i never felt so uncomfortable and dissatisfied in my life and with these latter words he gave the lady a look which was intended to be and which probably was full of meaning to her  wouldnt you like some books said mrs keswick now appearing from the back of the room you havent anything to read there are plenty of books in the house but they are all old  i think those are the most delightful of books said miss march i have been looking over the volumes on your shelves mrs keswick i am sure there are a good many of them mr croft would like to read even if he has read them before there are lots of queer oldtime histories and biographies and sets of bound magazines some of them over a hundred years old would you like me to select some for you mr croft or shall i write some of the titles on a slip of paper and let you select for yourself  i shall be delighted said lawrence to have you make a choice for me and i think the list would be the better plan because books would be so heavy to carry about  i will do it immediately said miss march and she walked rapidly to the house  now then said mrs keswick ill put a chair out here on the grass close to the door its shady there and i should think it would be pleasant for both of you if she would sit there and read to you out of those books she is a fine woman that miss marcha much finer woman than i thought she could be before i knew her  she is indeed said lawrence  i suppose you think she is the finest woman in the world said the old lady with a genial grin  what makes you suppose so asked lawrence  havent i eyes said mrs keswick but you neednt make any excuses you have made an excellent choice and i hope you may succeed in getting her perhaps you have succeeded she added giving lawrence an earnest look with a question in it  lawrence did not immediately reply it was not in his nature to confide his affairs to other people and yet he had done so much of it of late that he did not see why he should make an exception against mrs keswick who was indeed the only person who seemed inclined to be friendly to his suit he might as well let her know how matters stood no he said i have not yet succeeded and i am very sorry that this accident has interfered with my efforts to do so  dont let it interfere said the old lady her eyes sparkling while her purple sunbonnet was suddenly and severely bobbed you have just as good a chance now as you ever had and all you have to do is to make the most of it when she comes out here to read to you you can talk to her just as well as if you were in the woods or on top of a hill nobodyll come here to disturb you ill take care of that  you are very kind said lawrence somewhat wondering at her enthusiasm  i intended to go away and leave her here with you continued mrs keswick if i could find a good opportunity to do so but she hit on the best plan herself and now ill be off and leave the coast clear i will come again before dark and put some more of that stuff on your ankle if you want anything ring this bell and if isham doesnt hear you somebody will call him he has orders to keep about the house  you are putting me under very great obligations to you madam said lawrence  but the old lady did not stop to hear any thanks and hastened to clear the coast  lawrence had to wait a long time for his list of books but at last it came and much to his surprise and chagrin mrs null brought it miss march asked me to give you this she said so that you can pick out just what books you want  lawrence took the paper but did not look at it he was deeply disappointed and hurt his whole appearance showed it  you dont seem glad to get it said miss annie lawrence looked at her his face darkening did you persuade miss march he said to stay in the house and let you bring this  now mr croft said the young lady a very decided flush coming into her face that is going too far you have no right to accuse me of such a thing i am not going to help in your love affairs but i dont intend to be mean about it either miss march asked me to bring that list and at first i wouldnt do it for i knew just as well as i know anything that you expected her to come to you with it and i was very sure you wanted to see her more than the paper i refused two or three times but she said at last that if i didnt take it shed send it by some one in the house so i just picked it up and brought it right along i dont like her as much as i did  why not asked lawrence  you neednt accept a man if you dont want him said miss annie but there is no need of being cruel to him especially when he is laid up if she didnt intend to come out to you again she ought not to have made you believe so you did expect her to come didnt you  most certainly said lawrence in rather a doleful tone yes and there is the chair she was to sit in said miss annie while you said seven words about the books and ten thousand about the way your heart was throbbing i see aunt keswicks hand in that as plain as can be i dont say id put her in that chair if i could do it but i certainly am sorry she disappointed you so would you like to have any of those books if you would ill get them for you  i am much obliged mrs null said lawrence but i dont think i care for any books and let me say that i am very sorry for the way i spoke to you just now  oh dont mention that said she if id been in your place i should have been mad enough to say anything but its no use to sit here and be grumpy youd better let me go and get you a book the critical magazine for 1767 and 1768 is on that list and i know there are lots of queer interesting things in it but it takes a good while to hunt them out from the other things for which you would not care at all and then there are all the spectators and ramblers and the world displayed in eight volumes which from what i saw when i looked through it seems to be a different kind of world from the one i live in and there are others that you will see on your list but there is one book which i have been reading lately which i think you will find odder and funnier than any of the rest it is the geographical grammar by mr salmon suppose i bring you that it is a description of the whole world written more than a hundred years ago by an irish gentleman who i think never went anywhere  thank you said lawrence i shall be obliged to you if you will be kind enough to bring me that one he was glad for her to go away even for a little time that he might think the smart of the disappointment caused by the nonappearance of miss march was beginning to subside a little looking at it more quietly and reasonably he could see that in her position it would be actually unmaidenly for her to come to him by herself it was altogether another thing for this other girl and therefore perhaps it was quite proper to send her but in spite of whatever reasonableness there might have been in it he chafed under this propriety it would have been far better he thought if she had come and told him that she could not possibly accept him and that nothing more must be said about it but then he did not believe if she had given him time to say the words he wished to say that she would have come to such a decision and as he called up her lovely face and figure as it stood framed in the open doorway with a background of the sunlit arbor and fields the gorgeous distant foliage with the blue sky and its white clouds and circling birds he thought of the rapture and ecstasy which would have come to him if she had listened to his words and had given him but a smile of encouragement  but here came mrs null with a fat brown book in her hand one of the funniest things she said as she came to the door is mr salmons chapter on paradoxes he thinks it would be quite improper to issue a book of this kind without alluding to geographical paradoxes listen to this one and then she read to him the elucidation of the apparent paradox that there is a certain place in this world where the wind always blows from the south and another explaining the statement that in certain cannibal islands the people eat themselves there is something he says about virginia said she turning over the pages which i want you to be sure to read  wont you sit down said lawrence and read to me some of those extracts you know just where to find them  that chair wasnt put there for me said miss annie with a smile  nonsense said lawrence wont you please sit down i ought to have asked you before perhaps it is too cool for you out there  oh not at all said she the air is still quite warm and she took her seat on the chair which was placed close to the doorstep and she read to him some of the surprising and interesting facts which mr salmon had heard in a dublin coffeehouse about virginia and the other colonies and also some of those relating to the kindly way in which slaveholders in south america when they killed a slave to feed their hounds would send a quarter to a neighbor expecting some day to receive a similar favor in return when they had laughed over these she read some very odd and surprising statements about southern europe and the people of faraway lands and so she went on from one thing to another talking a good deal about what she had read and always on the point of stopping and giving the book to lawrence until the short autumnal afternoon began to draw to its close and he told her that it was growing too chilly for her to sit out on the grass any longer  very well said she closing the book and handing it to him you can read the rest of it yourself and if you want any other books on the list just let me know by uncle isham and i will send them to you he is coming now to see after you i wonder she said stopping for a moment as she turned to leave if miss march had been sitting in that chair if you would have had the heart to tell her to go away or if you would have let her sit still and take cold  lawrence smiled but very slightly that subject said he is one on which i dont joke  goodness exclaimed miss annie clasping her hands and gazing with an air of comical commiseration at mr crofts serious face i should think not and away she went  just before supper time when lawrences door had been closed and his lamp lighted there came a knock and mrs keswick appeared that plan of mine didnt work she said but i will bring miss march out here and manage it so that shell have to stay till i come back i have an idea about that all that you have to do is to be ready when you get your chance  lawrence thanked her and assured her he would be very glad to have a chance although he hoped without much ground for it that roberta would not see through the old ladys schemes  mrs keswick lotioned and rebandaged the sprained ankle and then she said i think it would be pleasant if we were all to come out here after supper and have a game of whist i used to play whist and shouldnt mind taking a hand you could have the table drawn up to your chair andlet me seeyes there are three more chairs it wont be like having her alone with you she said with the cordial grin in which she sometimes indulged but you will have her opposite to you for an hour and that will be something  lawrence approved heartily of the whist party and assured mrs keswick that she was his guardian angel  not much of that she said but i have been told often enough that im a regular old matchmaker and i expect i am  if you make this match said lawrence you will have my eternal gratitude  the supper sent out to lawrence was a very good one and the anticipation of what was to follow made him enjoy it still more for his passion had now reached such a point that even to look at his love although he could only speak to her of trumps and of tricks would be a refreshing solace which would go down deep into his thirsty soul  but bedtime and old isham came and the whist players came not it needed no one to tell lawrence whose disinclination it was that had prevented their coming  i reckon said uncle isham as he looked in at lettys cabin on his way to his own dat dat ar mister crof aint much use to gittin hissef hurt all de time i was helpin him to go to bed he was a growlin like de bery debbil     chapter xx   although october in southern virginia can generally be counted upon as a very charming month it must not be expected that her face will wear one continuous smile on the day after lawrence crofts misadventure the sky was gray with lowhanging clouds there was a disagreeable wind from the northeast and the air was filled with the slight drizzle of rain the morning was so cool that lawrence was obliged to keep his door shut and uncle isham had made him a small wood fire on the hearth as he sat before this fire after breakfast his foot still upon a stool and vigorously puffed at a cigar he said to himself that it mattered very little to him whether the sun shone or all the rains of heaven descended so long as roberta march would not come out to him and that she did not intend to come rain or shine was just as plain as the marks on the sides of the fireplace probably made by the heels of mr junius keswick during many a long reflective smoke  on second thoughts however lawrence concluded that a rainy day was worse for his prospects than a bright one if the sun shone and everything was fair miss march might come across the grassy yard and might possibly stop before his open door to bid him good morning and to tell him that she was sorry that a headache had prevented her from coming to play whist the evening before but this last he presently admitted was rather too much to expect for he did not think she was subject to headaches or to making excuses at any rate he might have caught sight of her and if he had he certainly would have called to her and would have had his say with her even had she persisted in standing six feet from the doorstep but now this dreary day had shut his door and put an interdict upon strolls across the grass therefore it was that he must resign any opportunity for that day at least of soothing the harrowing perturbations of his passion by either the comforting warmth of hope or by the deadening frigidity of a consummated despair this last in truth he did not expect but still if it came it would be better than perturbations they must be soothed at any cost but how to incur this cost was a difficult question altogether so puffing gazing into the fire and knitting his brows he sat and thought  as a goodlooking young man as a welldressed young man as an educated and cultured man as a man of the clubs and of society and when occasion required as a very sensible man of business mr croft might be looked upon as essentially a commonplace personage and in our walks abroad we meet a great many like him but there dwelt within him a certain disposition which at times removed him to quite a distance from the arena in which commonplace people go through their prescribed performances he would come to a determination generally quite suddenly to attain a desired end in his own way without any reference to traditionary or conventional methods and the more original and startling these plans the better he liked it  this disposition it was which made lawrence read with so much interest the account of the defeated general who made the cavalry charge into the camp of his victorious enemy defeat had been his all through his short campaign and it now seemed that the time had come to make another bold effort to get the better of his bad luck as he could not woo miss march himself he must get some one else to do it for him or if not actually to woo the lady to get her at least into such a frame of mind that she would allow him to woo her even in spite of his present disadvantages this would be a very bold stroke but lawrence put a good deal of faith in it  if miss march were properly talked to by one of her own sex she might see as perhaps she did not now see how cruel was her line of conduct toward him and might be persuaded to relent at least enough to allow his voice to reach her and that was all he asked for he had not the slightest doubt that the widow keswick would gladly consent to carry any message he chose to send to miss march and more than that to throw all the force of her peculiar style of persuasion into the support of his cause but this he knew very well would finish the affair and not at all in the way he desired the person he wanted to act as his envoy was mrs null to be sure she had refused to act for him but he thought he could persuade her she was quiet she was sensible and could talk very gently and confidingly when she chose she would say just what he told her to say and if a contingency demanded that she should add anything she would probably do it very prudently but then it would be almost as difficult to communicate with her as with miss march  while he was thus thinking in came the old lady very cross you didnt get any rubber of whist last night did you said she without salutatory preface but i can tell you it wasnt my fault i did all that i could and more than i ought to make her come but she just put her foot down and wouldnt stir an inch and at last i got mad and went to bed i dont know whether she saw it or not but i was as mad as hops and i am that way yet i had a plan that would have given you a chance to talk to her but that aint any good now that it is raining let me look at your ankle i hope that is getting along all right any way  while the old lady was engaged in ministering to his needs he told her of his plan he said he wished to send a message to miss march by some one and if he could get the message properly delivered it would help him very much  ill take it said she looking up suddenly from the piece of soft old linen she was folding ill go to her this very minute and tell her just what you want me to  mrs keswick said lawrence you are as kind as you can possibly be but i do not think it would be right for you to go on an errand like this miss march might not receive you well and that would annoy me very much and besides to speak frankly you have taken up my cause so warmly and have been such a good friend to me that i am afraid your earnest desire to assist me might perhaps carry you a little too far please do not misunderstand me i dont mean that you would say anything imprudent but as you are kind enough to say that you really desire this match it will be very natural for you to show your interest in it to a degree that would arouse miss marchs opposition  yes i see said the old lady reflectively shed suspect what was at the bottom of my interest shes a sharp one ive found that out i reckon it will be better for me not to meddle with her i came very near quarreling with her last night and that wouldnt do at all  you see madam said lawrence well satisfied that he had succeeded in warding off the old ladys offer without offending her that i do not want any one to go to miss march and make a proposal for me i could do that in a letter but i very much object to a letter in fact it wouldnt do at all all i wish is that some one by the exercise of a little female diplomacy should induce her to let me speak to her now i think that mrs null might do this very well  that is so said the old lady who having now finished her bandaging was seated on a chair by the fireplace my niece is smart and quick and could do this thing for you just as well as not but she has her quips and her cranks like the rest of us i called her out of the room last night to know why she didnt back me up better about the whist party and she said she couldnt see why a gentleman who hadnt been confined to the house for quite a whole day should be so desperately lonely that people must go to his room to play whist with him it seemed to me exactly as if she thought that mr null wouldnt like it mr null indeed as if his wishes and desires were to be considered in my house i never mention that man now and annie does not speak of him either what i want is that he shall stay away just as long as he will and if he will only stay away long enough to make his absence what the law calls desertion ill have those two divorced before they know it can you tell me sir how long a man must stay away from his wife before he can be legally charged with desertion  no madam i can not said lawrence the laws i believe differ in the various states  well im going to make it my business to find out all about it said mrs keswick mr brandon has promised to attend to this matter for me and i must write to him to know what he has been doing well mrs null and miss march seem to be very good friends and i dare say my niece could manage things so as to give you the chance you want ill go to the house now and send her over to you so that you can tell her what you want her to say or do  do you think she will come madam asked lawrence  the old lady rose to her feet and knitted her brows until something like a perpendicular mouth appeared on her forehead no said she now i come to think of it i dont believe she will in fact i know she wont bother take it all sir what these young women want is a good whipping nothing else will ever bring them to their senses what possible difference could it make to mr null whether she came to you and took a message for you or whether she didnt come especially in a case like this when you cant walk or go to anybody  i dont think it ought to make any difference whatever said lawrence in fact i dont believe it would  its no use talking about it mr croft said the old lady moving toward the door i can go to my niece and talk to her but the first thing id know id blaze out at her and then as like as not shed blaze back again and then the next thing would be that shed pack up her things and go off to hunt up her fertilizer agent and that mustnt be i dont want to get myself in any snarls just now there is nothing for you to do mr croft but to wait till it clears off so that dainty young woman can come out of doors and then i think i can manage it so that you can get a chance to speak to her  i am very much obliged to you said lawrence i suppose i must wait  ill see that isham brings you a lot of dry hickory so that you can have a cheerful fire even if you cant have cheerful company said mrs keswick as she closed the door after her  lawrence looked through the window at the sky which gave no promise of clearing and then he gazed into the fire and considered his case he had spent a large portion of his life in considering his case and therefore the operation was a familiar one to him this time the case was not a satisfactory one everything in this love affair with miss march had gone on in a manner in which he had not intended and of which he greatly disapproved no one in the world could have planned the affair more prudently than he had planned it he had been so careful not to do anything rash that he had at first concealed even from the lady herself the fact that he was in love with her and nothing could be farther from his thoughts and desires than that any one else should know of it and yet how had it all turned out he had taken into his confidence mr junius keswick mr brandon old mrs keswick mrs null as she wished to be called and almost lastly the lady herself if i should lay bare my heart to the colored man isham he said to himself and the old centenarian in the cabin down there i believe there would be no one else to tell oh yes there is candy and the antidetective by rights they ought to know he did not include the good little peggy in this category because he was not aware that there was such a person  after about an hour of these doleful cogitations he again turned to look out of his front window which commanded a view of the larger house when he saw coming down the steps of the porch a not very tall figure wrapped in a waterproof cloak with the hood drawn over its head he did not see the face of the figure but he thought from the light way in which it moved that it was mrs null and when it stepped upon the grass and turned its head he saw that he was right  can her aunt have induced her to come to me was lawrences first thought but his second was very different for she began to walk toward the large gate which led out of the yard instantly lawrence rose and hopped on one foot to the window where he tapped loudly on the glass the lady turned and then he threw up the sash  wont you step here please he called out  without answering she immediately came over the wet grass to the window  i have something to say to you he said and i dont want to keep you standing in the rain wont you come inside for a few minutes  no thank you said she i dont mind a slight rain like this i have lived so long in the city that i cant imagine how country people can bear to shut themselves in when it happens to be a little wet i cant stand it and i am going out for a walk it is a very sensible thing to do said lawrence and i wish i could go with you and have a good long talk  what about said she  about miss march  well i am rather tired of that subject she said and so i reckon it is just as well that you should stay here by your firei see you have one thereand that i should take my walk by myself  mrs null said lawrence i want to implore you to do a favor for me i dont see how it can be disagreeable to you and i am sure it will confer the greatest possible obligation upon me  what is it she asked  i want you to go to miss march and endeavor in some wayyou will know how better than i can tell youto induce her to let me have a few words with her if it is only here at this open window it will do  mrs null laughed imagine she said a woman putting on a waterproof and overshoes and coming out in the rain to stand with an umbrella over her head to be proposed to that would be the funniest proceeding i ever heard of  lawrence could not help smiling though he was not in the mood for it it may seem amusing to you he said but i am very much in earnest i am in constant fear that she will go away while i am confined to this house do you know how long she intends to stay  she has not told me was the answer  if you will carry it he said i will give you a message for her  why dont you write it said miss annie  i dont want to write anything he said i should not know how it had been received nor would it be likely to get me any satisfaction i want a live sympathetic medium such as you are wont you do this favor for me  no i wont said miss annie her very decided tone appearing to give a shade of paleness to her features how often must i tell you that i will not help you in this thing  i would not ask you said lawrence if i could help myself  it is not right that you should ask me any more she said i am not in favor of your coming here to court miss march while my cousin is away and i should feel like a traitor if i helped you at all especially if i were to carry messages to her of course i am very sorry for you shut up here and i will do anything i can to make you more comfortable and contented but what you ask is too hard for me and as she said this a little air of trouble came into the large eyes with which she was steadfastly regarding him i dont want to seem unkind to you and i wish you would ask me something that i can do for you ill walk down to howletts and get you anything you may like to have ill bring you a lot of novels which i found in the house and which i expect anyway you will like better than those oldtime books and ill cook you anything that is in the cookbook but i really cannot go wooing for you and if you ask me to do that every time i come near you i really must  my dear mrs null interrupted lawrence i promise not to say any more to you on this subject i see it is distasteful to you and i beg your pardon for having mentioned it so often you have been very kind to me indeed and i should be exceedingly sorry to do anything to offend you it would be very bad for me to lose one of my friends now that i am shut up in this box and feel so very dependent  oh indeed said miss annie but i suppose if you were able to step around as you used to do it wouldnt matter whether you offended me or not  mrs null said lawrence you know i did not mean anything like that do you intend to be angry with me no matter what i say  not a bit of it she answered with a little smile that brought back to her face that warm brightness which had grown upon it since she had come down here i havent the least wish in the world to be angry with you and i promise you i wont be provided youll stop everlastingly asking me to go about helping you to make love to people  lawrence laughed very good said he i have promised to ask nothing more of that sort let us shake hands on it  he stretched his hand from the window and miss annie withdrew from the folds of her waterproof a very soft and white little hand and put it into his and now i must be off she said are you certain you dont want anything from the store at howletts  surely you are not going as far as that he said  not if you dont want anything she answered have you tobacco enough to last through your imprisonment they keep it  now miss said lawrence do you want to make me angry by supposing i would smoke any tobacco that they sell in that country store  it ought to be better than any other said miss annie they grow it in the fields all about here and the storekeepers can get it perfectly fresh and pure and a great deal better for you no doubt than the stuff they manufacture in the cities  when you learn to smoke said lawrence your opinion concerning tobacco will be more valuable  thank you she said and i will wait till then before i give you any more of it good morning and away she went  lawrence shut down the window and hopped back to the fire there is my last chance gone said he to himself i suppose i may as well take old mrs keswicks advice and wait for fair weather but even then who can say what sort of sky roberta march will show and not being able to answer this question he put two fresh sticks on the fire and then sedately sat and watched their gradual annihilation as for miss annie she took her walk and stepped along the road as lightly and blithely as if the skies had been blue and the sun shining and almost before she knew it she had reached the store at howletts ascending the high steps to the porch quite deserted on this damp unpleasant morning she entered the store the proprietor of which immediately jumped up from the mackerel kit at the extreme end of the room where he had been sitting in converse with some of his neighbors and hurried behind the counter  have you any tea said miss annie better than the kind which you usually sell to mrs keswick  no maam said he we send her the very best tea we have  i am not finding fault with it she said but i thought you might have some extra kind more expensive than people usually buy for common use  no maam said he there is fancy teas of that kind but youd have to send to philadelphia or new york for them  how long would that take she asked  i reckon it would be four or five days before youd get it maam said the storekeeper  i am afraid said miss annie looking reflectively along the counter that that would be too long and then she turned to go but suddenly stopped have you any guava jelly she asked  the man smiled we dont have no call for anything as fancy as that maam he said is there anything else  not today answered miss annie after throwing a despairing glance upon the rolls of calicoes the coils of clotheslines the battered tin boxes of tea and sugar the dusty and chimneyless kerosene lamps and the long rows of canned goods with their gaudy labels and then she departed  when she had gone the storekeeper returned to his seat on the mackerel kit and was accosted by a pensive neighbor in high boots who sat upon the upturned end of a case of brogans you didnt make no sale that time peckett said he  no said the storekeeper her idees is a little too fancy for our stock of goods  whars her husband anyway asked a stout elderly man in linen trousers and faded alpaca coat who was seated on two boxes of pearl starch one on top of the other ive heard that he was a member of the legislatur is that so  hes not that you can take my word for it said tom peckett old miss keswick give me to understand that he was in the fertilizing business  that ought to be a good thing for the old lady said the man on the starch boxes shell git a discount off her gwarner  i never did see said the pensive neighbor on the brogan case how such things do git twisted it was only yesterday that i met a man at tysons mill whod just come over from the valley and he said hed seen this mr noles over thar hes a hoss doctor and hes going up through all the farms along thar  i reckon when he gits up as fur as he wants to go said the man on the starch boxes hell come here and settle fur awhile  that wont be so much help to the old lady said the storekeeper for it wouldnt pay to keep a neffyinlaw just to doctor one sorrel horse and a par o oxen  i reckon his wife must be spectin him said the man on the brogan case from her comin after fancy vittles  if he do come said the stout elderly neighbor i wish youd let me know tom peckett fur my black mar has got a hitch in her shoulder i cant understand and id like him to look at her  the storekeeper smiled at the pensive man and the pensive man smiled back at the storekeeper you neednt trouble yourself about that young womans husband said mr peckett therell be a horse doctor coming along afore you know it and hell attend to that old mar of yourn without chargin you a cent     chapter xxi   the second afternoon of lawrence crofts confinement in the little building in mrs keswicks yard passed drearily enough the sky retained its sombre covering of clouds and the rain came down in a melancholy capricious way as if it were tears shed by a child who was crying because it was bad the monotony of the slowly moving hours was broken only by a very brief visit from the old lady who was going somewhere in the covered spring wagon and who looked in before she started to see if her patient wanted anything and by the arrival of a bundle of old novels sent by mrs null these books lawrence looked over with indifferent interest hoping to find one among them that was not a love story but he was disappointed they were all based upon and most of them permeated with the tender passion and lawrence was not in the mood for reading about that sort of thing a person afflicted with a disease is not apt to find agreeable occupation in reading hospital reports upon his particular ailment  the novels were put aside and although lawrence felt that he had smoked almost too much during that day he was about to light another cigar when he heard a carriage drive into the yard turning to the window he saw a barouche evidently a hired one drawn by a pair of horses very lean and bony but with their heads reined up so high that they had an appearance of considerable spirit and driven by a colored man sitting upon a very elevated seat with a jaunty air and a wellworn whip the carriage drove over the grass to the front of the housethere was no roadway in the yard the short crisp tough grass having long resisted the occasional action of wheels and hoofsand there stopping a gentleman with a valise got out he paid the driver who immediately turned the vehicle about and drove away the gentleman put his foot upon the bottom step as if he were about to ascend and then apparently changing his mind he picked up his valise and came directly toward the office drawing a key from his pocket as he walked it was junius keswick and in a few minutes his key was heard in the lock as it was not locked the key merely rattled and lawrence called out come in the door opened and junius looked in evidently surprised i beg your pardon said he i didnt know you were in here  please walk in said lawrence i know i am occupying your room and it is i who should ask your pardon but you see the reason why it was thought well that i should not have stairs to ascend and he pointed to his bandaged foot  have you hurt yourself asked junius with an air of concern  and then lawrence gave an account of his accident expressing at the same time his regret that he found himself occupying the room which belonged to the other  oh dont mention that said junius who had taken a seat near the window there are rooms enough in the house and i shall be perfectly comfortable it was quite right in my aunt to have you brought in here and i should have insisted upon it myself if i had been at home i expected to be away for a week or more but i have now come back on account of your letter  does that need explanation asked lawrence  not at all said junius i had no difficulty in understanding it although i must say that it surprised me but i came because i am not satisfied with the condition of things here and i wish to be on the spot i do not understand why you and miss march should be invited here during my absence  that i do not understand either said lawrence quickly and i wish to impress it on your mind mr keswick that when i came here i not only expected to find you but a party of invited guests i will say however that i came with the express intention of meeting miss march and having that interview with her which i could not have in her uncles house  i was not entirely correct said junius when i said that i did not know why these rather peculiar arrangements had been made my aunt is a very managing person and i think i perceive her purpose in this piece of management she is opposed to a marriage between you and miss march  most decidedly said junius has she told you so  no said lawrence but it has gradually dawned upon me that such is the case i believe she would be glad to have miss march married and out of your way  junius made no answer to this remark but sat silent for a few moments then he said well have you settled it with miss march  no i have not said lawrence if the matter had been decided one way or the other i should not be here i have no right to trespass on your aunts hospitality and i should have departed as soon as i had discovered miss marchs sentiments in regard to me but i have not been able to settle the matter at all i had one opportunity of seeing the lady and that was not a satisfactory interview yesterday morning i made another attempt but before i could get to her i sprained my ankle and here i am i can not go to her and of course she will not come to me you cannot imagine how i chafe under this harassing restraint  i can imagine it very easily said junius  the only thing i have to hope for said lawrence is that tomorrow may be a fine day and that the lady may come outside and give me the chance of speaking to her at this open door  junius smiled grimly it appears to me he said as if it were likely to rain for several days but now i must go into the house and see the family i hope you believe me sir when i say i am sorry to find you in your present predicament  yes said lawrence smiling although he did not feel at all gay for otherwise i might have been finally rejected and far away  if you had been rejected said junius i should have been very glad indeed to have you stay with us  thank you said lawrence  i will look in upon you again said junius as he left the room  lawrences mind which had been in a very unpleasant state of troubled restiveness for some days was now thrown into a sad turmoil by this arrival of junius keswick as he saw that tall and goodlooking young man going up the steps of the house porch with his valise in his hand he clinched both his fists as they rested on the arm of his chair and objurgated the antidetective  if it had not been for that rascal he said to himself i should not have written to keswick and he would not have thought of coming back at this untimely moment the only advantage i had was a clear coast and now that is gone of course keswick was frightened when he found i was staying in the same house with roberta march and hurried back to attend to his own interests the first thing he will do now will be to propose to her himself and as they have been engaged once it is as like as not she will take him again if i could use this foot i would go into the house this minute and have the first word with her at this he rose to his feet and made a step with his sprained ankle but the sudden pain occasioned by this action caused him to sit down again with a groan lawrence croft was not a man to do himself a physical injury which might be permanent if such doing could possibly be avoided and he gave up the idea of trying to go into the house  i tell you what it is letty said uncle isham when he returned to the kitchen after having carried lawrences supper to him dat ar mister croft in de offis is a gittin wuss an wuss in he min ebery day i neber seed a man more powful glowerin dan he is dis ebenin  i reckin he jints is healin up said letty dey tells me dat de healin pains mos genrally runs into de min  about nine oclock in the evening junius keswick paid lawrence a visit and taking a seat by one side of the fireplace accepted the offer of a cigar  how are things going on in the house asked lawrence  well said keswick speaking slowly as you know so much of our family affairs i might as well tell you that they are in a somewhat upset condition when i went in i saw at first no one but my cousin and she seemed so extraordinarily glad to see me that i thought something must be wrong somewhere and when my aunt returnedshe was not at home when i arrivedshe was thrown into such a state of mind on seeing me that i didnt know whether she was going to order me out of the house or go herself but she restrained herself wonderfully considering her provocation for of course i have entirely disordered her plans by appearing here when she had arranged everything for you to have miss march to yourself but so far the peace has been kept between us although she scarcely speaks to me  and miss march said lawrence you have seen her  yes said junius i saw her at supper and for a short time afterwards but she soon retired to her room  do you think she was disturbed by your return asked lawrence  i wont say that said junius but she was certainly not herself mrs null tells me that she expects to go home tomorrow morning having written to her uncle to send for her  that is bad bad very bad said lawrence  after that there was a pause in the conversation during which mr croft with brows very much knit gazed steadfastly into the fire mr keswick he said presently what you tell me fills me with consternation it is quite plain that i shall have no chance to see miss march and as there is no one else in the world who will do it for me i am going to ask you to go to her tomorrow morning and speak to her in my behalf  when this had been said junius keswick dropped his cigar upon the floor and sat up very straight in his chair gazing fixedly at lawrence upon my word he said i knew you were a cool man but that request freezes my imagination i cannot conceive how any man can ask another to try to win for him a lady whom he knows the other man desires to win for himself you have made some requests before that were rather astounding but this one overshadows them all  i admit said lawrence that what i ask is somewhat out of the way but you must consider the circumstances suppose i had met you in mortal combat and i had dropped my sword where you could reach it and i could not would you pick it up and give it to me or would you run me through  i dont think that comparison is altogether a good one said junius  yes it is said lawrence and covers the case entirely i am here disabled and if you pick up my sword as i have just asked you to do it is not to be assumed that your action gives me the victory it merely gives me an equal chance with yourself  do you mean said junius that you want me to go to miss march and deliberately ask her if she will marry you  no said lawrence i have done that myself but there are certain points in regard to which i want to be set right with miss march and now i wish you to understand me mr keswick i speak to you not only as a generous and honorable man which i have found you to be but as a rival i cannot believe that you would be willing to profit by my present disadvantages and as i have said two or three times before it would certainly be for your interest as a suitor for the lady to have this matter settled  wouldnt it be better then said junius if i were to go immediately and speak to her for myself  no said lawrence i dont think that would settle the affair at all from what i understand of your relations with miss march she knows you are her lover and yet she neither accepts nor declines you if you were to go to her now it is not likely she would give you any definite answer but in regard to me it would be different she would say yes or no and if she made the latter answer i think you could walk over the course i am not vain enough to say that i have been an obstacle to your success but i assure you that i have tried very hard to make myself such an obstacle  it seems to me said junius imitating his companion in the matter of knitting his brows and gazing into the fire that this affair could be managed very simply miss march is not going at the break of day why dont you contrive to see her before she starts and say for yourself what you have to say  nothing would please me better than that said croft but i dont believe she would give me any chance to speak with her since my accident she has persistently and pointedly refused to grant me even the shortest interview  that ought to prove to you said keswick that she does not desire your attentions you should consider it as a positive answer  not at all said lawrence not at all and i dont think you would consider it a positive answer if you were in my place i think she has taken some offence which is entirely groundless and if you will consent to act for me it will enable me to set straight this misunderstanding  confound it exclaimed keswick cant you write to her or get some one else to take your love messages  no said lawrence i cannot write to her for i am not sure that under the circumstances she would answer my letter and i have already asked mrs null the only other person i could ask to speak for me but she has declined  by the lord harry exclaimed junius you are the rarest wooer i ever heard of  i assure you said lawrence his face flushing somewhat that it is not my desire to carry on my wooing in this fashion my whole soul is opposed to it but circumstances will have it so and as i dont intend if i can help it to have my life determined by circumstances i must go ahead in despite of them although i admit that it makes the road very rough  i should think it would said junius and then there was a pause in the conversation  well mr keswick said lawrence presently will you do this thing for me  am i to understand said junius that if i dont do it it wont be done  yes said lawrence you are positively my last chance i have racked my brains to think of some other way of presenting my case to miss march but there is no other way i might stand at my door and call to her as she entered the carriage but that would be the height of absurdity i might hop on one foot into the house but even if i wished to present myself in that way i dont believe i could get up that long flight of steps it would be worse than useless to write for i should not know what was thought of my letter or even if it had been read mrs keswick cannot carry my message mrs null will not and i have only you to call upon i know it is a great deal to ask but it means so much to meto both of us in factthat i ask it  you were kind enough to say a little while ago said junius that you considered me an honorable man i try to be such and therefore will frankly state to you that i can think of but three motives satisfactory to myself for undertaking this business for you and not one of them is a generous one in the first place i might care to do it in order to have this matter settled for you are such an extraordinary suitor that i dont know in what form you may turn up the next time secondly from what you tell me of miss marchs repugnance to meet you i dont believe my mission will have an issue favorable to you and the more unfavorable it is the better i shall like it my third reason for acting for you is that the whole affair is such an original one that it will rather interest me to be engaged in it this last reason would not hold however if i had the least expectation of being successful  you consent then said lawrence quickly turning towards the other youll go to miss march for me  yes i think i will said junius if you will accept the services of a man who is decidedly opposed to your interests  of course i never expected you to favor them said lawrence nor is it necessary that you should all i ask is that you carry a message to miss march and if she needs any explanation of it that you will explain in the way that i shall indicate that you shall tell me how she received my message and that you shall bring me back her answer there is no need of your making any proposition to her that has already been done what i want is that she should not go away from here with a misunderstanding between us and that she shall give me at least the promise of a hearing  very good said junius now what is it that you want me to say  this was not an easy question for lawrence to answer he knew very well what he wanted to say if he had a chance of saying it himself he wanted to pour his whole heart out to roberta march and showing her its present passion to ask her to forgive those days in which his mind only had appeared to be engaged he believed he could say things that would force from her the pardon of his previous shortcomings if she considered them as such she had been very gracious to him in time past and he did not see why she should not be still more gracious now if he could remove the feelings of resentment which he believed were occasioned by her womanly insight into the motives of his conduct toward her during those delightful summer days at midbranch  but to get another person to say all this was a very different thing he was sure however that if it were not said now it would never be said it would be death to all his hopes if miss march went away feeling towards him as she now felt therefore he stiffened his purpose which was quite used to being stiffened hardened his sensibilities and took his plunge gazing steadfastly at the back of the fireplace while he spoke he endeavored to make junius keswick understand the nature and the probable force of the objections to his line of action as a suitor which had grown up in the mind of miss march and he also endeavored to show how completely and absolutely he had been changed by the vigor and ardor of his present affection and how he was entitled to be considered by miss march as a lover who had but one thought and purpose and that was to win her and as such he asked her to give him an opportunity to renew his proposal to her now then said lawrence i have placed the case before you and i beg you will present it as nearly as possible in the form in which i have given it to you  mr croft said junius this case of yours is worse than i thought it was what woman of spirit would accept a man who admitted that during the whole of his acquaintance with her he had had his doubts in regard to suitability etc but who when a crisis arrived and another man turned up had determined to overlook all his objections and take her anyway  that is a very coldblooded way of putting it said lawrence and i dont believe at all that she will look upon it in that light if you will set the matter before her as i have put it to you i believe she will see it as i wish her to see it  very well said junius rising and taking out his watch i will make your statement as accurately as i can and without any interpretations of my own and now i must bid you goodnight i had no idea it was after twelve oclock  and you will observe her moods asked lawrence  yes said junius as he opened the door i will carefully observe her moods  when junius had gone lawrence turned his face again toward the fireplace where the last smouldering stick had just broken apart in the middle and the two ends had wearily fallen over the andirons as if they wished it understood that they could do no more burning that night taking this as a hint lawrence prepared to retire old isham must have gone to bed long ago he said but as i have asked for so much assistance today i think it is well that i should try to do some things for myself  it was indeed very late but behind the partially closed shutters of a lower room of the house sat old mrs keswick gazing at the light that was streaming from the window of the office and wondering what those two men were saying to each other that was keeping them sitting up together until after midnight  annie peyton too had not gone to bed and looking through her chamber window at the office she hoped that cousin junius would come away before he lost his temper of course she thought he must have been very angry when he came home and found mr croft here at the only time that roberta march had ever visited the house and it was quite natural that he should go to his rival and tell him what he thought about it but he had been there a long long time and she did hope they would not get very angry with each other and that nothing would happen one thought comforted her very much mr croft was disabled and junius would scorn to take advantage of a man in that condition  at an upper window at the other end of the house sat roberta march ready for bed but with no intention of going there until junius keswick had come out of the office knowing the two men as she did she had no fear that any harm would come to either of them during this long conference whatever its subject might be that she herself was that subject she had not the slightest doubt and although it was of no earthly use for her to sit there and gaze upon that light streaming into the darkness of the yard but revealing to her no more of what was going on inside the room than if it had been the light of a distant star still she sat and speculated at last the office door opened and junius came out turning to speak to the occupant of the room as he did so the brief vision of him which the watchers caught as he stood for a moment in the lighted doorway before stepping out into the darkness showed that his demeanor was as quiet and composed as usual and one of the three women went to bed very much relieved     chapter xxii   from breakfast time the next morning until ten oclock in the forenoon at which hour the midbranch carriage arrived junius keswick had been vainly endeavoring to get an opportunity to speak with miss march that lady had remained in her own room nearly all the morning where his cousin had been with her and his aunt who had her own peculiar ways of speeding the parting guest had retired to some distant spot on the estate either to plan out some farming operation for the ensuing season or to prevent her pentup passion from boiling over in her own house  thus junius had the lower floor to himself and he strode about in much disquietude debating whether he ought to send a message to roberta or whether he should wait till she had finished her packing or whatever it was that was keeping her upstairs his last private interview with her had not been a pleasant one and if he had intended to speak to her for himself he would not have felt much encouraged by her manner of the preceding evening but he was now engaged on the affairs of another and he believed that a failure to attend to them would be regarded as a breach of faith  when mr brandons carriage drove into the yard he began to despair but now roberta came running down stairs to speak to sam the driver and ask him how long it would be necessary to rest his horses sam thought an hour would be long enough as they would have a good rest when they got home and this matter having been settled junius came forward and requested roberta to step in the parlor as he had something to say to her without reply she followed him into the room and he closed the door they sat down one on one side of the round centre table and one on the other and junius began his statement  he was by profession a lawyer and he had given a great deal of attention to the art of putting things plainly and with a view to a just effect he had carefully prepared in his mind what he should say to roberta he wished to present this mans message without the slightest exhibition of desire for its success and yet without any tendency to that coldblooded way of stating it to which croft had objected he had indeed picked up his adversarys sword and while he did not wish in handing it to him to prick him with it or do him some such underhand injury he did not think it at all necessary to sharpen the weapon before giving it back  what junius had to say occupied a good deal of time he expressed himself carefully and deliberately and as nearly as a skilfully stuffed and prepared animal in a museum resembles its wild original of the forest so did his remarks resemble those that lawrence would have made had he been there roberta listened to him in silence until he had finished and then she rose to her feet and her manner was such that junius rose also junius keswick she said you have deliberately come to me and offered me the hand of another man in marriage  not that said junius i merely came to explain  do not split hairs she interrupted you did exactly that you came to me because he could not come himself and offered him to me now go to him from me and tell him that i accept him and with that she swept out of the room and came down stairs no more until bonneted and accompanied by miss annie she hurried to the front door and entered the carriage which was there waiting for her with peggy by the driver with some quick goodbyes and kisses to annie but never a word to junius or anybody else she drove away  if junius keswick had been nervous and anxious that morning as he strode about the house waiting for an opportunity to speak to miss march it may well be supposed that lawrence croft shut up in his little room at the end of the yard would be more so he had sat at his window waiting and waiting he had occasionally seen mr keswick come out on the porch and with long strides pace backward and forward and he knew by that sign that he had yet no message to bring him he had seen the midbranch carriage drive into the yard he had seen miss march come out on the porch and speak to the driver and then go in again he had seen the carriage driven under a large tree where the horses were taken out and led away to be refreshed in an hour or more he saw them brought back and harnessed to the vehicle which was turned and driven up again to the door when some baggage was brought down and strapped on a little platform behind shortly afterwards peggy came round the end of the house with a hat on and a little bundle under her arm and approached the carriage making however a wide turn toward the office at which and a mile or two beyond her faroff gaze was steadily directed  lawrence threw up the sash and called to her and his guardian imp approached the window are you miss marchs maid i think i have seen you at midbranch  yaas sah yous done seen me offen said peggy  does miss march intend to start immediately he asked  yaas sah said the good peggy shell be out in a minute soon as she done kissin mahs junius goodbye in de parlor and then noticing a look of astonishment on the gentlemans face she added deys gwine to be mared chrismus  what exclaimed lawrence  goodbye mister crof said peggy is got to hurry up  lawrence made no answer but mechanically tossed her a coin which picking up she gave him a farewell grin and hastened to take her seat by the driver  very soon afterward lawrence saw roberta come out accompanied only by mrs null and hurry down the steps forgetting his injured ankle he sprang to his feet and stepping quickly to the door opened it and stood on the threshold but miss march did not even look his way he gazed at her with wideopen eyes as she hastily kissed mrs null and sprang into the carriage which was immediately driven off as mrs null turned to go into the house she looked toward the office and nodded to him he believed that she would have come to him if he had called her but he did not call his mind was in such a condition that he would not have been capable of framing a question had she come he felt that he could speak to no one until he had seen keswick closing the door he went back to his chair and as he did so his ankle pained him sadly but of this he scarcely thought  he did not have to wait long for junius keswick for in about ten minutes that individual entered lawrence turned as his visitor opened the door and he saw a countenance which had undergone a very noticeable change it was not dark or lowering it was not pale but it was gray and hard and the eyes looked larger than lawrence had remembered them  without preface or greeting junius approached him and said i have taken your message to miss march and have brought you one in return you are accepted  lawrence pushed back his chair and stared blankly at the other what do you mean he presently asked  i mean what i say said keswick miss march has accepted you  a crowd of emotions rushed through the brain of lawrence croft joy was among them but it was a joy that was jostled and shaken and pushed this way and that i do not understand he said i did not expect such a decisive message i supposed she might send me some encouragement some why didnt she see me before she left  i am not here to explain her actions if i could said junius who had not sat down she said tell him i accept him that is all good morning  but stop cried lawrence on his feet again you must tell me more than that did you say to her only what i said to you how did it affect her  oh said junius turning suddenly at the door i forgot that you asked me to observe her mood well she was very angry  with me cried lawrence  with me said junius and closing the door behind him he strode away  the accepted lover sat down he had never spoken more truly than when he said he did not understand it is she really mine he exclaimed and with his eyes fixed on the blank wall over the mantelpiece he repeated over and over again is she mine is she really mine he had well developed mental powers but the work of setting this matter straight and plain was too difficult for him  if she had sent him some such message as this i am very angry with you but some day you can come and explain yourself to me his heart would have leaped for joy he would have believed that his peace had been made and that he had only to go to her to call her his own now his heart desired to leap with joy but it did not seem to know how to do it the situation was such an anomalous one after such a message as this why had she not let him see her why had she been angry with keswick was that pique and then a dark thought crossed his mind had he been accepted to punish the other no he could not believe that no woman such as roberta march would give herself away from such a motive had keswick been joking with him no he could not believe that no man could joke with such a face  even the fact that mrs keswick had not bid miss march farewell troubled the mind of lawrence it was true that she might not yet know that the match which she had so much encouraged had been finally made but something must be very wrong or she would not have been absent at the moment of her guests departure and what did that beastly little negro mean by telling him that keswick and miss march were to be married at christmas and that the two were kissing each other goodbye in the parlor why the man had not even come out to put her in the carriage and the omission of this courtesy was very remarkable these questions were entirely too difficult for him to resolve by himself it was absolutely necessary that more should be told to him and explained to him seeing the negro boy plez crossing the yard he called him and asked him to tell mr keswick that mr croft wished to see him immediately  mahs junius said the boy he done gone to de railroad to take de kyars he done took he knapsack on he back an walk cross de fiels  when about an hour or two afterwards uncle isham brought mr croft his dinner the old negro appeared to have lost that air of attentive geniality which he usually put on while waiting on the gentleman lawrence however took no notice of this but before the man reached the table on which he was to place the tray he carried he asked is it true that mr keswick has gone away by train  yaas sah answered isham  and where is mrs keswick asked lawrence isnt she in the house  no sah done gwine vistin i spec  when will she return  dunno said isham she nebber comes to me an tells me whar she gwine an when she comin back  and then after satisfying himself that nothing more was needed of him for the present isham left the room and when he reached the kitchen he addressed himself to its plump mistress letty said he when dat ar mister crof has got froo wid his dinner you go an fotch back de plates an dishes he axes too many questions to suit me dis day  you is pohly today uncle isham said letty  yaas said the old man is right much on the careen  uncle isham perhaps was not more loyal to the widow keswick than many old servants were and are to their former mistresses but his loyalty was peculiar in that it related principally to his regard for her character this regard he wished to be very high and it always troubled and unsettled his mind when the old lady herself or anybody else interfered with his efforts to keep it high for years he had been hoping that the time would come when she would cease to rar and chawge but she had continued at intervals to indulge in that most unsuitable exercise and now that it appeared that she had reared and charged again her old servant was much depressed she had gone away from the house and for all he knew she might stay away for days or weeks as she had done before and uncle isham was never so much on the careen as when he found himself forced to believe that his old mistress was still a woman who could do a thing like that  letty had no objections to answering questions but much to her disappointment lawrence asked her none he had had enough of catechising negroes but he requested her to ask mrs null if she would be kind enough to step out for a few minutes and speak to him when very shortly thereafter that lady appeared lawrence was seated at his open door ready to receive her  how are you she said and how is your ankle today you have had nobody to attend to it  it has hurt me a good deal he answered i think i must have given it a wrench this morning but i put on it some of the lotion mrs keswick left with me and it feels better  it is too bad said mrs null that you have to attend to it yourself  not at all said lawrence now that i know how i can do it perfectly well and i dont care a snap about my ankle except that it interferes with more important affairs why do you suppose miss march went away without speaking to me or taking leave of me in any way  i thought that would trouble you said she and to speak honestly i dont think it was right but roberta was in a very agitated condition when she left here and i dont believe she ever thought of taking leave of you or any one except me she and i are very good friends but she dont confide much in me but one thing i am pretty sure of and that is that she is dreadfully angry with my cousin junius and i am very sorry for that  how did he anger her asked lawrence wishing to find out how much this young woman knew i havent the least idea said miss annie all i know is she had quite a long talk with him in the parlor and after that she came flying upstairs just as indignant as she could be she didnt say much but i could see how her soul raged within her and now the young lady stopped speaking and looked straight into lawrences face it isnt possible she said that you have been sending my cousin to propose to her for you  this was not a pleasant question to answer and besides lawrence had made up his mind that the period had passed for making confidants of other persons in regard to his love affairs do you suppose i would do that he said  no i dont miss annie answered cousin junius would never have undertaken such a thing and i dont believe you would be cruel enough to ask him  thank you for your good opinion said lawrence and now can you tell me when mr keswick is expected to return  he has gone back to washington and he told me he should stay there some time  and why has not mrs keswick been out to see me asked lawrence  you are dreadfully inquisitive said miss annie but to tell you the simple truth mr croft i dont believe aunt keswick takes any further interest in you now that roberta has gone she had set her heart on making a match between you two and doing it here without delay and i think that everything going wrong about this has put her into the state of mind she is in now  has she really gone away asked lawrence  oh that dont amount to anything said miss annie she went over the fields to howletts to see the postmistress who is an old friend to whom she often goes for comfort when things are not right at home but i am going after her this afternoon in the spring wagon ill take plez along with me to open the gates i am sure i shall bring her back  i must admit mrs null said lawrence that i am very inquisitive but you can easily understand how much i am troubled and perplexed  i expect miss marchs going away troubled you more than anything else said she  that is true he answered but then there are other things which give me a great deal of anxiety i came here to be for a day or two the guest of a lady on whom i have no manner of claim for prolonged hospitality and now here i am compelled to stay in this room and depend on her kindness or forbearance for everything i have i would go away immediately but i know it would injure me to travel the few steps i took yesterday have probably set me back for several days  oh it would never do for you to travel said she with such a sprained ankle as you have it would certainly injure you very much to be driven all the way to the green sulphur springs i am told the road is very rough between here and there but perhaps you didnt notice it having come over on horseback  yes i did notice it and i could not stand that drive and even if i could be got to the train to go north i should have to walk a good deal at the stations  you simply must not think of it said miss annie and now let me give you a piece of advice i am a practical person as you may know and i like to do things in a practical way the very best thing that you can do is to arrange with aunt keswick to stay here as a boarder until your ankle is well she has taken boarders and in this case i dont think she would refuse as i told you before you must not expect her to take the same interest in you that she did when you first came but she is really a kind woman though she has such dreadfully funny ways and she wouldnt have neglected you today if it hadnt been that her mind is entirely wrapped up in other things if you like ill propose such an arrangement to her this afternoon  you are very kind indeed said lawrence but is there not danger of offending her by such a proposition  yes i think there is answered miss annie and i have no doubt she will fly out into a passion when she hears that the gentleman whom she invited here as a guest proposes to stay as a boarder but i think i can pacify her and make her look at the matter in the proper way but why mention it at all and put yourself to all that trouble about it said lawrence  why of course because i think you will be so much better satisfied and content to keep quiet and get well if you feel that you have a right to stay here if aunt keswick wasnt so very different from other people i wouldnt have mentioned this matter for really there is no necessity for it but i know very well that if you were to drop out of her mind for two or three days and shouldnt see anything of her that you would become dreadfully nervous about staying here  you are certainly very practical mrs null and very sensible and very very kind and nothing could suit me better under the circumstances than the plan you propose but i am extremely anxious not to give offence to your aunt she has treated me with the utmost kindness and hospitality  oh dont trouble yourself about that said miss annie with a little laugh i am getting to know her so well that i think i can manage an affair like this very easily and now i must be off or it will be too late for me to go to howletts this afternoon and i am a very slow driver are you sure there is nothing you want i shall go directly past the store and can stop as well as not  thank you very much said lawrence but i do not believe that howletts possesses an article that i need one thing i will ask you to do for me before you go i want to write a letter and i find that i am out of paper therefore i shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me have some and some envelopes  why certainly said miss annie and she went into the house  she looked over the stock of paper which her aunt kept in a desk in the diningroom but she did not like it i dont believe he will want to write on such ordinary paper as this she said to herself whereupon she went upstairs and got some of her own paper and envelopes which were much finer in material and more correct in style i dont like it a bit she thought to give this to him to write that letter on but i suppose its bound to be written anyway so he might as well have the satisfaction of good paper  you must excuse these little sheets she said when she took it to him but you couldnt expect anything else in an amazonian household like ours cousin junius has manly stationery of course but i suppose it is all locked up in that secretary in your room  oh this will do very well indeed said lawrence and i wish i could come out and help you into your vehicle regarding the spring wagon which now stood at the door with plez at the head of the solemn sorrel  thank you said miss annie that is not at all necessary and she tripped over to the spring wagon and mounting into its altitudes without the least trouble in the world she took up the reins with these firmly grasped in her little hands which were stretched very far out and held very wide apart she gave the horse a great jerk and told him to get up as she moved off lawrence from his open door called out bon voyage and in a full clear voice she thanked him but did not dare to look around so intent was she upon her charioteering  slowly turning the horse toward the yard gate which plez stood holding open her whole soul was absorbed in the act of guiding the equipage through the gateway quickly glancing from side to side and then at the horses back which ought to occupy a medium position between the two gateposts she safely steered the front wheels through the dangerous pass although a grin of delight covered the face of plez as he noticed that the hub of one of the hind wheels almost grazed a post then the observant boy ran on to open the other gate and with many jerks and clucks miss annie induced the sorrel to break into a gentle trot  as lawrence looked after her a little pang made itself noticeable in his conscience this girl was certainly very kind to him and most remarkably considerate of him in the plan she had proposed and yet he felt that he had prevaricated to her and in fact deceived her in the answer he had made when she asked him if he had sent her cousin to speak for him to miss march would she have such friendly feelings toward him and be so willing to oblige him if she knew that he had in effect done the thing which she considered so wrong and so cruel but it could not be helped the time had passed for confidences he must now work out this affair for himself without regard to persons who really had nothing whatever to do with it  closing his door he hopped back to his table and seating himself at it he opened his travelling inkstand and prepared to write to miss march it was absolutely necessary that he should write this letter immediately for after the message he had received from the lady of his love no time should be lost in putting himself in communication with her but before beginning to write he must decide upon the spirit of his letter  under the very peculiar circumstances of his acceptance he did not feel that he ought to indulge in those rapturous expressions of ecstacy in which he most certainly would have indulged if the lady had personally delivered her decision to him he did not doubt her for what woman would play a joke like that on a manupon two men in fact even if there were no other reason she would not dare to do it nor did he doubt keswick it would have been impossible for him to come with such a message if it had not been delivered to him and yet lawrence could not bring himself to be rapturous if he had been accepted in cold blood and a hand and not a heart had been given to him he would gladly take that hand and trust to himself to so warm the heart that it also would soon be his but he did not know what roberta march had given him  on the other hand he knew very well if in his first letter as an accepted lover he should exhibit any of that caution and prudence which in the course of his courtship had proved to be shoals on which he had very nearly run aground that robertas resentment which had shown itself very marked in this regard would probably be roused to such an extent that the affair would be brought to a very speedy and abrupt termination if she had been obliged to forgive him once for this line of conduct he could not expect her to do it again to write a letter which should err in neither of these respects was a very difficult thing to do and required so much preparatory thought that when toward the close of the afternoon miss annie drove in at the yard gate with mrs keswick on the seat beside her not a line had been written  mrs keswick descended from the spring wagon and went into the house but miss annie remained at the bottom of the steps for the apparent purpose of speaking to plez perhaps to give him some instructions in regard to the leading of a horse to its stable or to instil into his mind some moral principle or other but the moment the vehicle moved away she ran over to the office and tapped at the window which was quickly opened by lawrence  i have spoken to her about it she said and although she blazed up at first so that i thought i should be burned alive i made her understand just how matters really are and she has agreed to let you stay here as a boarder  you are extremely good said lawrence and must be a most admirable manager this arrangement makes me feel much better satisfied than i could have been otherwise then leaning a little further out of the window he asked but what am i to do for company while i am shut up here  oh you will have uncle isham and aunt keswick and sometimes me but i hope that you will soon be able to come into the house and take your meals and spend your evenings with us  you have nothing but good wishes for me he said and i believe if you could manage it you would have me cured by magic and sent off well and whole tomorrow  of course said miss annie very promptly good night  just before supper mrs keswick came in to see lawrence she was very grave almost severe and her conversation was confined to inquiries as to the state of his ankle and his general comfort but lawrence took no offence at her manner and was very gracious saying some exceedingly neat things about the way he had been treated and after a little her manner slightly mollified and she remarked and so you let miss march go away without settling anything  now lawrence considered this a very incorrect statement but he had no wish to set the old lady right he knew it would joy her heart and make her more his friend than ever if he should tell her that miss march had accepted him but this would be a very dangerous piece of information to put in her hands he did not know what use she would make of it or what damage she might unwittingly do to his prospects and so he merely answered i had no idea she would leave so soon  well said the old lady i suppose after all that you neednt give it up yet i understand that she is not going to new york before the end of the month and you may be well enough before that to ride over to midbranch  i hope so most assuredly said he  lawrence devoted that evening to his letter it was a long one and was written with a most earnest desire to embrace all the merits of each of the two kinds of letters which have before been alluded to and to avoid all their faults when it was finished he read it tore it up and threw it in the fire     chapter xxiii   the next day opened bright and clear and before ten oclock the thermometer had risen to seventy degrees instead of sitting in front of the fireplace lawrence had his chair and table brought close to his open doorway where he could look out on the same beautiful scene which had greeted his eyes a few days before but what is the good he thought of this green grass this sunny air that blue sky those white clouds and the distant tinted foliage without that figure which a few days ago stood in the foreground of the picture but as the woman to whom in his souls sight the whole world was but a background was not there he turned his eyes from the warm autumnal scene and prepared again to write to her he had scarcely taken up his pen however when he was interrupted by the arrival of miss annie who came to bring him a book she had just finished reading a late english novel which she thought might be more interesting than those she had sent him the book was one which lawrence had not seen and wanted to see but in talking about it to the young lady he discovered that she had not read all of it  dont let me deprive you of the book said lawrence if you have begun it you ought to go on with it  oh dont trouble your mind about that she said with a laugh i have finished it but i have not read a word of the beginning i only looked at the end of it to see how the story turned out i always do that before i read a novel  this remark much amused lawrence do you know said he that i would rather not read novels at all than to read them in that way i must begin at the beginning and go regularly through as the author wishes his readers to do  and perhaps when you get to the end said miss annie youll find that the wrong man got her and then youll wish you had not read the story  as you appear to be satisfied with this novel said lawrence i wish you would read it to me and then i would feel that i was not taking an uncourteous precedence of you  ill read it to you said she or at least as much as you want me to for i feel quite sure that after you get interested in it you will want to take it yourself and read straight on till it is finished instead of waiting for some one to come and give you a chapter or two at a time that would be the way with me i know  i shall be delighted to have you read to me said lawrence when can you begin  now she said if you choose but perhaps you wish to write  not at this moment said lawrence turning from the table unfortunately i have plenty of leisure where will you sit and he reached out his hand for a chair  oh i dont want a chair said annie taking her seat on the broad doorstep this is exactly what i like i am devoted to sitting on steps dont you think there is something dreadfully stiff about always being perched up in a chair  yes said lawrence on some occasions  and forthwith she began upon the first chapter and having read five lines of this she went back and read the title page suddenly remembering that mr croft liked to begin a book at the very beginning miss annie had been accustomed to read to her father and she read aloud very well and liked it as she sat there shaded by a great locust tree which had dropped so many yellow leaves upon the grass that now and then it could not help letting a little fleck of sunshine come down upon her sometimes gilding for a moment her lightbrown hair sometimes touching the end of a crimson ribbon she wore and again resting for a brief space on the toe of a very small boot just visible at the edge of her dress lawrence looked at her and said to himself is it possible that this is the rather pale young girl in black who gave me change from behind the desk of mr candys information shop i dont believe it that young person sprang up temporarily and is defunct this is some one else  she read three chapters before she considered it time to go into the house to see if it was necessary for her to do anything about dinner when she left him lawrence turned again to his writing  that afternoon he sent mrs null a little note on the back of a card asking her if she could let him have a few more sheets of paper lawrence found this request necessary as he had used up that day all the paper she had sent him and the small torn pieces of it now littered the fireplace  he must be writing a diary letter said miss annie to herself when she received this message such as we girls used to write when we were at school and bringing down a little the corners of her mouth she took from her stationery box what she thought would be quite paper enough to send to a man for such a purpose  but although the means were thus made abundant the letter to miss march was not then written lawrence finally determined that it was simply impossible for him to write to the lady until he knew more what keswick had told him had been absurdly little and he had hurried away before there had been time to ask further questions instead of sending a letter to miss march he would write to keswick and would put to him a series of interrogations the answers to which would make him understand better the position in which he stood then he would write to miss march  the next day miss annie could not read to him in the morning because as she came and told him she was going to howletts on an errand for her aunt but there would be time to give him a chapter or two before dinner when she came back  would it be any trouble said lawrence for you to mail a letter for me  oh no said miss annie but not precisely in the same tone in which she would have told him that it would be no trouble to read to him two or three chapters of a novel and yet she would pass directly by the residence of miss harriet corvey the postmistress  as miss annie walked along the narrow path which ran by the roadside to howletts with the blue sky above her and the pleasant october sunshine all about her and followed at a little distance by the boy plez carrying a basket she did not seem to be taking that enjoyment in her walk which was her wont her brows were slightly contracted and she looked straight in front of her without seeing anything in particular after the manner of persons whose attention is entirely occupied in looking into their own minds at something they do not like it is too much she said almost loud her brows contracting a little more as she spoke it was bad enough to have to furnish the paper but for me to have to carry the letter is entirely too much and at this she involuntarily glanced at the thick and double stamped missive which having no pocket she carried in her hand she had not looked at it before and as her eyes fell upon the address she stopped so suddenly that plez who was dozing as he walked nearly ran into her what she exclaimed junius keswick five q street washington district of columbia is it possible that mr croft has been writing to him all this time she now walked on and although she still seemed to notice not the material objects around her the frown disappeared from her brow and her mental vision seemed to be fixed upon something more pleasant than that which had occupied it before as it will be remembered she had refused positively to have anything to do with lawrences suit to miss march and it was a relief to her to know that the letter she was carrying was not for that lady but why thought she should he be writing for two whole evenings to junius i expected that he would write to her to find out why she went off and left him in that way but i did not suppose he would want to write to junius it seems to me they had time enough that night they were together to talk over everything they had to say  and then she began to wonder what they had to say and gradually the conviction grew upon her that mr croft was a very very honorable man of course it was wrong that he should have come here to try to win a lady who if one looked at it in the proper light really belonged to another but it now came into her mind that mr croft must by degrees have seen this for himself and that it was the subject of his long conference with junius and also most probably of this letter the conference certainly ended amicably and in that case it was scarcely possible that junius had given up his claim he was not that kind of a man  if mr croft had become convinced that he ought to retire from this contest and had done so and roberta had been informed of it that would explain everything that had happened robertas state of mind after she had had the talk in the parlor with junius and her hurried departure without taking the slightest notice of either of the gentlemen was quite natural what woman would like to know that she had been bargained about and that her two lovers had agreed which of them should have her it was quite to be expected that she would be very angry at first though there was no doubt she would get over it so far as junius was concerned  having thus decided entirely to her own satisfaction that this was the state of affairs she thought it was a grand thing that there were two such young men in the world as her cousin and mr croft who could arrange such an affair in so kindly and honorable a manner without feeling that they were obliged to fightthat horribly stupid way in which such things used to be settled  this vision of masculine highmindedness which miss annie had called up seemed very pleasant to her and her mental satisfaction was denoted by a pretty little glow which came into her face and by a certain increase of sprightliness in her walk now then she said to herself and although she did not finish the sentence even in her own mind the sky increased the intensity of its beautiful blue the sun began to shine with a more golden radiance the little birds who had not yet gone south chirped to each other as merrily as if it had been early summer the yellow and purple wild flowers of autumn threw into their blossoms a richer coloring and even the blades of grass seemed to stretch themselves upward green tender and promising and when the young lady skipped up the step of the postoffice she dropped the letter into miss harriet corveys little box with the air of a motherbird feeding a young one with the first ripe cherry of the year  a day or two after this lawrence found himself able by the aid of a cane and a rude crutch which uncle isham had made for him and the top of which mrs keswick had carefully padded to make his way from the office to the house and after that he took his meals and passed the greater part of his time in the larger edifice sometimes he ransacked the old library sometimes miss annie read to him and sometimes he read to her in the evening there were games of cards in which the old lady would occasionally take a hand although more frequently miss annie and mr croft were obliged to content themselves with some game at which two could play but the pleasantest hours perhaps were those which were spent in talking for lawrence had travelled a good deal and had seen so many of the things in foreign lands which miss annie had always wished that she could see lawrence was waiting until he should hear from mr keswick so that with some confidence in his position he could write to miss march his trunk had been sent over from the green sulphur springs and he was much better satisfied to wait here than at that deserted wateringplace it was indeed a very agreeable spot in which to wait and quite near enough to midbranch for him to carry on his desired operations when the time should arrive he was a little annoyed that keswicks answer should be so long in coming but he resolved not to worry himself about it the answer was probably a difficult letter to write and one which keswick would not be likely to dash off in a hurry he remembered too that the mail was sent and received only twice a week at howletts  old mrs keswick was kind to him but grave and rather silent once she passed the open door of the parlor by the window of which sat miss annie and lawrence deeply engaged their heads together in studying out something on a map and as she went upstairs she grimly grinned and said to herself if that null could look in and see them now i reckon our young man would wish he had the use of all his arms and legs  but if mr null should disapprove of his wife and that gentleman from new york spending so much of their time together old mrs keswick had not the least objection in the world she was well satisfied that mr croft should find it interesting enough to stay here until the time came when he should be able to go to midbranch when that period arrived she would not be slow to urge him to his duty in spite of any obstacles mr brandon might put in his way so for the present she possessed her soul in as much peace as the soul of a headstrong and very wilful old lady is capable of being possessed     chapter xxiv   the letter which lawrence croft had written to junius keswick was not answered for more than a week and when the answer arrived it did not come through the howletts postoffice but was brought from a mail station on the railway by a special messenger in this epistle mr keswick stated that he would have written much sooner but for the fact that he had been away from washington and having just returned had found mr crofts letter waiting for him the answer was written in a tone which lawrence did not at all expect it breathed the spirit of a man who was determined and almost defiant it told mr croft that the writer did not now believe that miss marchs acceptance of the said mr croft should be considered of any value whatever it was the result of a very peculiar condition of things in which he regretted having taken a part and it was given in a moment of pique and indignation which gave miss march a right to reconsider her hasty decision if she chose to do so it would not be fair for either of them to accept as conclusive words said under the extraordinary circumstances which surrounded miss march when she said those words you asked me to do you a favor wrote junius keswick and very much against my inclination and against what is now my judgment i did it i now ask you to do me a favor and i do not think you should refuse it i ask you not to communicate with miss march until i have seen her and have obtained from her an explanation of the acceptance in question i have a right to this explanation and i feel confident that it will be given to me you ask me what i truly believe miss march meant by her message to you i answer that i do not know but i intend to find out what she meant and as soon as i do so i will write to you i think therefore considering what you have asked me to do and what you have written to me about what i have done that you cannot refuse to abstain from any further action in the matter until i am enabled to answer you i cannot leave washington immediately but i shall go to midbranch in a very few days  this letter was very far from being a categorical answer to lawrences questions and it disappointed and somewhat annoyed that gentleman but after he had read it for the second time and carefully considered it he put it in his pocket and said to himself this ends all discussion of this subject mr keswick may be right in the position he takes or he may be wrong he may go to midbranch he may get his explanation and he may send it to me but without any regard to what he does or says or writes i shall go to miss march as soon as i am able to use my ankle and whether she be at her uncles house or whether she has gone to new york or to any other place i shall see her and myself obtain from her an explanation of this acceptance this is due to me as well as to mr keswick and if he thinks he ought to get it for himself i also think i ought to get it for myself  the good results of lawrences great care in regard to his injured ankle soon began to show themselves the joint had slowly but steadily regained its strength and usual healthy condition and lawrence now found that he could walk about without the assistance of his rude crutch he was still prudent however and took but very short walks and in these he leaned upon his trusty cane the charming autumn days which often come to virginia in late october and early november were now at their best day after day the sun shone brightly but there was in the air an invigorating coolness which made its radiance something to be sought for and not avoided  it was just after dinner and it was saturday afternoon when miss annie announced that she was going to see old aunt patsy whom she had somewhat neglected of late  may i go with you said lawrence  miss annie shook her head doubtfully i should be very glad to have your company she said but i am afraid it will be entirely too much of a walk for you the days are so short that the sun will be low before we could get back and if you should be tired it would not do for you to sit down and rest at that time of day  i believe said lawrence that my ankle is quite strong enough for me to walk to aunt patsys and back without sitting down to rest i would be very glad to go with you and i would like too to see that venerable colored woman again  well said miss annie if you really think you can walk so far it will be very nice indeed to have you go but you ought to feel very sure that it will not hurt you  come along said lawrence taking up his hat and cane  after a man has been shut up as lawrence had been a pleasant ramble like this is a most delightful change and he did not hesitate to manifest his pleasure this touched the very sensitive soul of his companion and with such a sparkle of talk did she evince her gratification that almost any one would have been able to see that she was a young lady who had an earnest sympathy with those who had undergone afflictions but were now freed from them  aunt patsy was glad to see her visitors particularly glad it seemed to see mr croft she was quite loquacious considering the great length of her days and the proverbial shortness of her tongue  why aunt patsy said miss annie you seem to have grown younger since i last saw you i do believe you are getting old backwards what are you going to do with that dressbody is lookin at dis hyar said aunt patsy turning over the wellworn body of a black woollen dress which lay in her lap instead of the crazy quilt on which she was usually occupied to see if its done gib way in any ob de seams or de elbers twas a right smart good frock once an is gwine to wear it termorrer  tomorrow exclaimed

tell her yousef but is powful glad dat its all right now you all don know how powful glad i is and she looked at mr croft and miss annie with a glance as benignant as her timeset countenance was capable of  but aunt patsy said annie quite willing to change the conversation although she did not know the import of the old womans last remark i thought you were not able to go out  the old woman gave a little chuckle dats wot eberybody thought an to tell you de truf miss annie i thought so too but ef i was strong nuf to go to de pos offisan i did dat miss annie an not long ago nutheri reckon

once when i was a little girl did you ever see it she said turning to mr croft  i have not he answered i never even heard of it  suppose we go tomorrow and hear brother enoch she said i should like it very much answered lawrence  aunt patsy said miss annie would there be any objection to our going to your church tomorrow  the old woman gave her head a little shake dunno she said as a ginral rule we

strawngers you all isnt strawngers now i dont reckon darll be no jections to your comin ef you set sollum an i know youll do dat miss annie coz you did it when you was a little gal an i reckon itll be de same wid him looking at mr croft  miss annie assured her that she and her companion would be certain to sit solemn and that they would not think of such a thing as going to church and behaving indecorously  dar is white folks said aunt patsy wot comes to a culled chuch fur nothin else but to larf de debbil gits dem folks but dat don do us no good miss annie an wed rudder dey stay away but you alls not dat kine i knows dat sartin shuh  when the two had taken leave of the old woman and miss annie had gone out of the door aunt patsy leaned very far forward and stretching out her long arm seized mr croft by the skirt of his coat he stepped back quite surprised and then she said to him in a low but very earnest voice i reckon dat dat ar sprain ankle was nuffin but a acciden but you look out sah you look out hab you got dem little shoes handy  oh yes said lawrence i have them in my trunk  keep em whar you kin put your han on em said aunt patsy impressively you may want em yit you min my wuds  i shall be sure to remember said lawrence as he hastened out to rejoin annie  what in the world had aunt patsy to say to you asked that somewhat surprised young lady  then lawrence told her how some time before aunt patsy had given him a pair of blue shoes which she said would act as a preventive charm in case mrs keswick should ever wish to do him harm and that she had now called him back to remind him not to neglect this means of personal protection i cant imagine said lawrence that your aunt would ever think of such a thing as doing me a harm or how those little shoes would prevent her if she wanted to but i suppose aunt patsy is crackbrained on some subjects and so i thought it best to humor her and took the shoes  do you know said miss annie after walking a little distance in silence that i am afraid aunt patsy has done a dreadful thing and one i never should have suspected her of aunt keswick had a little baby once and it died very young she keeps its clothes in a box and i remember when i was a little girl that she once showed them to me and told me i was to take the place of that little girl and that frightened me dreadfully because i thought that i would have to die and have my clothes put in a box i recollect perfectly that there was a pair of little blue shoes among these clothes and aunt patsy must have stolen them  that surprises me said lawrence i supposed from what i had heard of the old woman that she was perfectly honest  so she is said annie she has been a trusted servant in our family nearly all her life but some negroes have very queer ideas about taking certain things and i suppose aunt patsy had some particular reason for taking those shoes for of course they could be of no value to her  i am very sorry said lawrence that such sacred relics should have come into my possession but i must admit that i would not like to give them back to your aunt  oh no said annie that would never do and i wouldnt dare to try to find her box and put them in it it would seem like a desecration for any hand but her own to touch those things  that is true said lawrence and you might get yourself into a lot of trouble by endeavoring to repair the mischief before i leave here we may think of some plan of disposing of the little trotters it might be well to give them back to aunt patsy and tell her to restore them  i dont know said miss annie with a slowness of reply and an irrelevance of demeanor which indicated she was not thinking of the words she was speaking  the sun was now very near the horizon and that evening coolness which in the autumn comes on so quickly after the sunshine fades out of the air made lawrence give a little shrug with his shoulders he proposed that they should quicken their pace and as his companion made no objection they soon reached the house  the next day being sunday breakfast was rather later than usual and as lawrence looked out on the bright morning with the mists just disengaging themselves from the manyhued foliage which crowned the tops of the surrounding hills and on the recently risen sun hanging in an atmosphere of grey and lilac with the smile of indian summer on its face he thought he would like to take a stroll before that meal but either the length of his walk on the previous day or the rapidity of the latter portion of it had been rather too much for the newlyrecovered strength of his ankle which now felt somewhat stiff and sore when he mentioned this at the breakfast table he received a good deal of condolence from the two ladies especially mrs keswick and at first it was thought that it might be well for him to give up his proposed attendance at the negro church but to this lawrence strongly objected for he very much desired to see some of the peculiar religious services of the negroes he had been talking on the subject the evening before with mrs keswick who had told him that in this part of the country which lay in the black belt of virginia where the negro population had always been thickest these ceremonies were more characteristic of the religious disposition of the african than in those sections of the state where the white race exerted a greater influence upon the manners and customs of the colored people  but it will not be necessary to walk much said miss annie we can take the springwagon and you can go with us aunt  the old lady permitted herself a little grin when i go to church she said i go to a white folks church and try to see what i can of white folks christianity though i must say that christianity of the other color is often just as good as far as works go but it is natural that a stranger should want to see what kind of services the colored people have so you two might as well get into the springwagon and go along  but shall we not deprive you of the vehicle said lawrence  i never go to church in the springwagon said the old lady so long as i am able to walk and besides this is not our sunday for preaching  it seemed to lawrence that an elderly person who went about in a purple calico sunbonnet and with an umbrella of the same material might go to church in a wheelbarrow so far as appearances were concerned but he had long ceased to wonder at mrs keswicks idiosyncrasies i remember very well said miss annie after the old lady had left the table which she always did as soon as she had finished a meal when aunt keswick used to go to church in a big family carriage which is now sleeping itself to pieces out there in the barn but then she had a pair of big gray horses one of them named doctor and the other colonel but now she has only one horse and i am going to tell uncle isham to harness that one up before he goes to church himself you know he is to take aunt patsy in the oxcart so he will have to go early  they went to the negro church in the springwagon lawrence driving the jogging sorrel and miss annie on the seat beside him when they reached the old frame edifice in the woods beyond howletts they found gathered there quite a large assemblage for this was one of those very attractive occasions called a big preaching horses and mules and wagons of various kinds many of the latter containing baskets of refreshments were standing about under the trees and mrs keswicks cart and oxen tethered to a little pine tree gave proof that aunt patsy had arrived the inside of the church was nearly full and outside around the door stood a large number of men and boys the white visitors were looked upon with some surprise but way was made for them to approach the door and as soon as they entered the building two of the officers of the church came forward to show them to one of the uppermost seats but this honor miss annie strenuously declined she preferred a seat near the open door and therefore she and mr croft were given a bench in that vicinity of which they had sole possession  to lawrence who had never seen anything of the sort the services which now began were exceedingly interesting and as annie had not been to a negro church since she was a little girl and very seldom then she gave very earnest and animated attention to what was going on the singing as it always is among the negroes was powerful and melodious and the long prayer of brother enoch hines was one of those spirited and emotional statements of personal condition and wild and ardent supplication which generally pave the way for a most powerful awakening in an assemblage of this kind another hymn sung in more vigorous tones than the first one warmed up the congregation to such a degree that when brother hines opened the bible and made preparations for his discourse he looked out upon an audience as anxious to be moved and stirred as he was to move and stir it the sermon was intended to be a long one for had it been otherwise brother hines had lost his reputation and therefore the preacher after a few prefatory statements delivered in a grave and solemn manner plunged boldly into the midst of his exhortations knowing that he could go either backward or forward presenting with equal acceptance fresh subject matter or that already used so long as his strength held out he had not preached half an hour before his hearers were so stirred and moved that a majority of them found it utterly impossible to merely sit still and listen in different ways their awakening was manifested some began to sing in a low voice others gently rocked their bodies while fervent ejaculations of various kinds were heard from all parts of the church from this beginning arose gradually a scene of religious activity such as lawrence had never imagined each individual allowed his or her fervor to express itself according to the method which best pleased the worshipper some kept to their seats and listened to the words of the preacher interrupting him occasionally by fervent ejaculations others sang and shouted sometimes standing up clapping their hands and stamping their feet while a large proportion of the ablebodied members left their seats and pushed their way forward to the wide open space which surrounded the preachers desk and prepared to engage in the exhilarating ceremony of the jerusalem jump  two concentric rings were formed around the preacher the inner one composed of women the outer one of men the faces of those forming the inner ring being turned towards those in the outer as soon as all were in place each brother reached forth his hand and took the hand of the sister opposite to him and then each couple began to jump up and down violently shaking hands and singing at the top of their voices after about a minute of this the two circles moved one one way and one another so that each brother found himself opposite a different sister hands were again immediately seized and the jumping handshaking and singing went on minute by minute the excitement increased faster the worshippers jumped and louder they sang through it all brother enoch hines kept on with his sermon it was very difficult now to make himself heard and the time for explanation or elucidation had long since passed all he could do was to shout forth certain important and moving facts and this he did over and over again holding his hand at the side of his mouth as if he were hailing a vessel in the wind much of what he said was lost in the din of the jumpers but ever and anon could be heard ringing through the church the announcement de wheel ob time is a turnin roun  in a group by themselves in an upper corner of the congregation were four or five very old women who were able to manifest their pious enthusiasm in no other way than by rocking their bodies backwards and forwards and singing with their cracked voices a gruesome and monotonous chant this rude song had something of a wild and uncivilized nature as if it had come down to these old people from the savage rites of their african ancestors they did not sing in unison but each squeaked or piped out her yi wiho yi hoo according to the strength of her lungs and the degree of her exaltation prominent among these was old aunt patsy her little black eyes sparkling through her great ironbound spectacles her head and body moving in unison with the wild air of the unintelligible chant she sang her long skinny hands clapping up and down upon her knees while her feet encased in their great green baize slippers unceasingly beat time upon the floor  so many persons being absent from their seats the group of old women was clearly visible to annie and lawrence and aunt patsy also could easily see them whenever her head in its ceaseless moving from side to side allowed her eyes to fall upon the two white visitors her ardor and fervency increased and she seemed to be expressing a pious gratitude that miss annie and he whom she supposed to be her husband were still together in peace and safety  annie was much affected by all she saw and heard her face was slightly pale and occasionally she was moved by a little nervous tremor mr croft too was very attentive his soul was not moved to enthusiasm and he did not feel as his companion did now and then that he would like to jump up and join in the dancing and the shouting but the scene made a very strong impression upon him  around and around went the two rings of men and women jumping singing and handshaking out from the centre of them came the stentorian shout de wheel ob time is a turnin roun from all parts of the church rose snatches of hymns exultant shouts groans and prayers and in the corner the shrill chants of the old women were fitfully heard through the storm of discordant worship  in the midst of all the wild din and hubbub the soul of aunt patsy looked out from the habitation where it had dwelt so long and without giving the slightest notice to any one or attracting the least attention by its movements it silently slipped away  the old habitation of the soul still sat in its chair but no one noticed that it no longer sang or beat time with its hands and feet  not long after this lawrence looked round at his companion and noticed that she was slightly trembling dont you think we have had enough of this he whispered  yes she answered and they rose and went out they thought they were the first who had left     chapter xxv   when mr croft and miss annie got into the springwagon and the head of the sorrel was turned away from the church lawrence looked at his watch and remarked that as it was still quite early there might be time for a little drive before going back to the house for dinner the face of the young lady beside him was still slightly pale and the thought came to him that it would be very well for her if her mind could be diverted from the abnormally inspiriting scene she had just witnessed  dinner will be late today she said for i saw letty doing her best among the jerusalem jumpers  very well said he we will drive and now where shall we go  if we take the crossroad at the store said miss annie and go on for about half a mile we can turn into the woods and then there is a beautiful road through the trees which will bring us out on the other side of aunt keswicks house junius took me that way not long ago  so they turned at the store much to the disgust of the plodding sorrel who thought he was going directly home and they soon reached the road that led through the woods this was hard and sandy as are many of the roads through the forests in that part of the country and it would have been a very good driving road had it not been for the occasional protrusion of tree roots which gave the wheels a little bump and for the branches which now and then hung down somewhat too low for the comfort of a lady and gentleman riding in a rather high springwagon without a cover but lawrence drove slowly and so the root bumps were not noticed and when the lowhanging boughs were on his side he lifted them so that his companions head could pass under and when they happened to be on her side annie ducked her head and her hat was never brushed off but at times they drove quite a distance without overhanging boughs and the pine trees surrounded by their smooth carpet of brown spines gave forth a spicy fragrance in the warm but sparkling air the oak trees stood up still dark and green while the chestnuts were all dressed in rich yellow with the chinquepin bushes by the roadside imitating them in color as they tried to do in fruit sometimes a spray of purple flowers could be seen among the trees and great patches of sunlight which here and there came through the thinning foliage fell now upon the brilliantly scarlet leaves of a sweetgum and now upon the polished and brownred dress of a neighboring blackgum  the woods were very quiet there was no sound of bird or insect and the occasional hare or molly cottontail as annie delightedly called it who hopped across the road made no noise at all a gentle wind among the tops of the taller trees made a sound as of a distant sea but besides this little was heard but the low crunching noise of the wheels and the voices of lawrence and miss annie  reaching a place where the road branched lawrence stopped the horse and looked up each leafy lane they were completely deserted white people seldom walked abroad at this hour on sunday and the negroes of the neighborhood were at church is not this a frightfully lonely place he said one might imagine himself in a desert  i like it replied annie it is so different from the wild exciting tumult of that church i am glad you took me away at first i would not have missed it for the world but there seemed to come into the stormy scene something oppressive and almost terrifying  i am glad i took you away said lawrence but it seems to me that your impression was not altogether natural i thought that amid all that mad enthusiasm you were overexcited not depressed a solemn solitude like this would to my thinking be much more likely to lower your spirits i dont like solitude myself and therefore i suppose it is that i thought an impressible nature like yours would find something sad in the loneliness of these silent woods  annie turned and fixed on him her large blue eyes but i am not alone she said  as lawrence looked into her eyes he saw that they were as clear as the purest crystal and that he could look through them straight into her soul and there he saw that this woman loved him the vision was as sudden as if it had been a night scene lighted up by a flash of lightning but it was as clear and plain as if it had been that same scene under the noonday sun  there are times in the life of a man when the goddess of reasonable impulse raises her arms above her head and allows herself a little yawn then she takes off her crown and hangs it on the back of her throne after which she rests her sceptre on the floor and rising stretches herself to her full height and goes forth to take a long refreshing walk by the waters of unreflection then her minister prudence stretches himself upon a bench and with his handkerchief over his eyes composes himself for a nap discretion worldly wisdom and other trusted officers of her court and even sometimes that agile page called memory no sooner see their royal mistress depart than by various doors they leave the palace and wander far away then silently with sparkling eyes and parted lips comes that fair being unthinking love she puts one foot upon the lower step of the throne she looks about her and with a quick bound she seats herself upon her tumbled curls she hastily puts the crown with her small white hand she grasps the sceptre and then rising waves it and issues her commands the crowd of emotions which serve as her satellites seize the great seal from the sleeping prudence and the new queen reigns  all this now happened to lawrence never before had he looked into the eyes of a woman who loved him and leaning over towards this one he put his arm around her and drew her towards him and never shall you be alone he said  she looked up at him with tears starting to her eyes and then she put her head against his breast she was too happy to say anything and she did not try  it was about a minute after this that the sober sorrel who took no interest in what had occurred behind him and a great deal of interest in his stable at home started in an uncertain and hesitating way and finding that he was not checked began to move onward lawrence looked up from the little head upon his breast and called out whoa to this however the sorrel paid no attention lawrence then put forth his right hand to grasp the reins but having lately forgotten all about them they had fallen out of the springwagon and were now dragging upon the ground it was impossible for him to reach them and so seizing the whip he endeavored with its aid to hook them up failing in this he was about to jump out and run to the horses head but perceiving his intention annie seized his arm dont you do it she exclaimed youll ruin your ankle  lawrence could not but admit to himself that he was not in condition to execute any feats of agility and he also felt that annie had a very charming way of holding fast to his arm as if she had a right to keep him out of danger and now the sorrel broke into the jogtrot which was his usual pace it is very provoking said lawrence i dont think i ever allowed myself to drop the reins before  it doesnt make the slightest difference said annie comfortingly this old horse knows the road perfectly well and he doesnt need a bit of driving he will take us home just as safely as if you held the reins and now dont you try to get them for you will only hurt yourself  very well said lawrence putting his arm around her again i am resigned but i think you are very brave to sit so quiet and composed under the circumstances  she looked at him with a smile such a little circumstance dont count just now she said you must stop that she added presently when we get to the edge of the woods  before long they came out into the open country and found themselves in a lane which led by a wide circuit to the road passing mrs keswicks house the old sorrel certainly behaved admirably he held back when he descended a declivity he walked over the rough places and he trotted steadily where the road was smooth  it seems like our fate said annie who now sat up without an arm around her the protecting woods having been left behind he just takes us along without our having anything to do with it  he is not much of a horse said lawrence clasping in an unobservable way the little hand which lay by his side but the fate is charming  fortunately there was no one upon the road to notice the reinless plight in which these two young people found themselves and they were quite as well satisfied as if they had been doing their own driving after a little period of thought annie turned an earnest face to lawrence and she said do you know that i never believed that you were really in love with roberta march  lawrence squeezed her hand but did not reply he knew very well that he had loved roberta march and he was not going to lie about it  i thought so she continued because i did not believe that any one who was truly in love would want to send other people about to propose for him as you did  that is not exactly the state of the case he said but we must not talk of those things now that is all passed and gone  but if there ever was any love she persisted are you sure that it is all gone  gone he answered earnestly as utterly and completely as the days of last summer  and now the sorrel of his own accord stopped at mrs keswicks outer gate and lawrence getting down took up the reins opened the gate and drove to the house in quite a proper way  when mr croft helped annie to descend from the springwagon he did not squeeze her hand nor exchange with her any tender glances for old mrs keswick was standing at the top of the steps have you seen letty she asked  letty said miss annie oh yes she added as if she suddenly remembered that such a person existed letty was at church and she was very active  well said the old lady she must have taken more interest in the exercises than you did for it is long past the time when i told her she must be home  i do not believe madam said lawrence that any one could have taken more interest in the exercises of this morning than we have  at this annie could not help giving him a little look which would have provoked reflection in the mind of the old lady had she not been very earnestly engaged in gazing out into the road in the hope of seeing letty  when lawrence had gone into the office and had closed the door behind him he stood in a meditative mood before the empty fireplace he was making inquiries of himself in regard to what he had just done he was not accusing himself nor indulging in regrets he was simply investigating the matter here he stood a man accepted by two women if he had ever heard of any other man in a like condition he would have called that man a scoundrel and yet he did not deem himself a scoundrel  the facts in the case were easy enough to understand for the first time in his life he had looked into the eyes of a woman who loved him and he had discovered to his utter surprise that he loved her there had been no plan no prudent outlook into her nature and feelings no cautious insight into his own he had taken part in a most unpremeditated act of pure and simple love and that it was real and pure love on each side he no more doubted than he doubted that he lived and yet had he been an impostor when on that hill over there he told roberta march he loved her no he had been honest he had loved her and since the time that he had been roused to action by the discovery of junius keswicks intentions to renew his suit it had been a love full of a rare and alluring beauty but its charm its fascination its very existence had disappeared in the first flash of his knowledge that annie peyton loved him had his love for roberta been a perfect one had he been sure that she returned it then it could not have been overthrown but it had gone and a love complete and perfect stood in its place he had seen that he was loved and he loved that was all but it would stand forever  this was the state of the case and now lawrence set himself to discover if in all ways he had acted truly and honestly he had been accepted by miss march but what sort of acceptance was it should he as a man true to himself accept such an acceptance what was he to think of a woman who very angry as he had been informed had sent him a message which meant everything in the world to him if it meant anything and had then dashed away without allowing him a chance to speak to her or even giving him a nod of farewell the last thing she had really said to him in this connection were those cruel words on pine top hill with which she had asked him to choose a spot in which to be rejected could he consider himself engaged would a woman who cared for him act towards him in such a manner after all was that acceptance anything more than the result of pique and could he not quite as justly accept the rejection which she had professed herself anxious to give him  a short time before lawrence had done his best to explain to his advantage these peculiarities of his status in regard to miss march he had said to himself that she had threatened to reject him because she wished to punish him and he had intended to implore her pardon and expected to receive it over and over again had he argued with himself in this strain and yet in spite of it all he had not been able to bring himself into a state of mind in which he could sit down and write to her a letter which in his estimation would be certain to seal and complete the engagement how very glad i am he now said to himself that i never wrote that letter and this was the only decision at which he had arrived when he heard mrs keswick calling to him from the yard  he immediately went to the door when the old lady informed him that as letty had not come back and did not appear to be intending to come back and that as none of the other servants on the place had made their appearance he might as well come into the house and try to satisfy his hunger on what cold food she and mrs null had managed to collect  the most biting and spicy condiments of the little meal to which the three sat down were supplied by mrs keswick who reviled without stint those utterly thoughtless and heedless colored people who once in the midst of their crazy religious exercises totally forgot that they owed any duty whatever to those who employed them lawrence and annie did not say much but there was something peculiarly piquant in the way in which annie brought and poured out the tea she had made and which with the exception of the old ladys remarks was the only warm part of the repast and there was an element of buoyancy in the manner of mr croft as he took his cup to drink the tea although he said little at this meal he thought a great deal listening not at all to mrs keswicks tirades what a charmingly inconsiderate affair this has been he said to himself nothing planned nothing provided for or against all spontaneous and from our very hearts i never thought to tell her that she must say nothing to her aunt until we had agreed how everything should be explained and i dont believe the idea that it is necessary to say anything to anybody has entered her mind but i must keep my eyes away from her if i dont want to bring on a premature explosion  whatever might be the result of the reasoning which this young man had to do with himself it was quite plain that he was abundantly satisfied with things as they were  it was beginning to be dark when letty and uncle isham returned and explained why they had been so late in returning  old aunt patsy had died in church     chapter xxvi   lawrence said annie on the forenoon of the next day as they were sitting together in the parlor with the house to themselves mrs keswick having gone to aunt patsys cabin to supervise proceedings there lawrence dont you feel glad that we did not have a chance to speak to dear old aunt patsy about those little shoes perhaps she had forgotten that she had stolen them and so went to heaven without that sin on her soul  that is a very comfortable way of looking at it said lawrence but wouldnt it be better to assume that she did not steal them  i am very sorry said annie but that is not easy to do but dont let us think anything more about that and dont you feel very glad that the poor old creature who looked so happy as she sat singing and clapping her hands on her knees didnt die until after we had left the church if it had happened while we were there i dont believe  dont believe what asked lawrence  well that you now would be sitting with your arm on the back of my chair  lawrence was quite sure from what had been told him that aunt patsys demise had taken place before they left the church but he did not say so to annie he merely took his arm from the back of her chair and placed it around her  and do you know said she that letty told me something this morning that is so funny and yet in a certain way so pathetic that it made me laugh and cry both she said that aunt patsy always thought that you were mr null  at this lawrence burst out laughing but annie checked him and went on and she told letty in church when she saw us two come in that she believed she could die happy now since she had seen miss annie married to such a peart gentleman and that it looked as if old miss had got over her grudge against him  and didnt letty undeceive her asked lawrence  no she said it would be a pity to upset the mind of such an old woman and she didnt do it  then the good aunt patsy died said lawrence thinking i was that wretched tramp of a bonedust pedler which the fancy of your aunt has conjured up that explains the interest the venerable colored woman took in me it is now quite easy to understand for if your aunt abused your mythical husband to everybody as she did to me i dont wonder aunt patsy thought i was in danger  poor old woman said annie looking down at the floor i am so glad that we helped her to die happy  as she was obliged to anticipate the truth said lawrence in order to derive any comfort from it i am glad she did it but although i am delighted more than my words can tell you to take the place of your mr null you must not expect me to have any of his attributes  now just listen to me sir said annie i dont want you to say one word against mr null if it had not been for that good freddy things would have been very different from what they are now if you care for me at all you owe me entirely to freddy null  entirely asked lawrence  of course i mean in regard to opportunities of finding out things and saying them if aunt keswick had supposed i was only annie peyton she would not have allowed mr croft to interfere with her plans for junius and me i expected mr null to be of service to me but no one could have imagined that he would have brought about anything like this  blessed be null exclaimed lawrence  annie asked him to please to be more careful for how did he know that one of the servants might not be sweeping the front porch and of course they would look in at the windows  but my dear child said lawrence pushing back his chair to a prudent distance we must seriously consider this null business we shall have to inform your aunt of the present state of affairs and before we do that we must explain what sort of person frederick null esquire really wasi am not willing to admit that he exists even as a myth  oh dear oh dear exclaimed annie we shall have a dreadful time when aunt keswick knows that there never was any mr null and then hears that you and i are engaged it will throw her into the most dreadful state of mind that she has ever been in in her life and father has told me of some of the awful family earthquakes that aunt keswick has brought about when things went wrong with her  we must be very cautious said lawrence and neither of us must say a word or do anything that may arouse her suspicions until we have settled upon the best possible method of making the facts known to her the case is indeed a complicated one  and what makes it more so said annie is aunt keswicks belief that you are in love with miss march and that you want to get a chance to propose to her she does think that doesnt she  yes said lawrence i must admit that she does  and she must be made to understand that that is entirely at an end continued annie all this will be a very difficult task lawrence and i dont see how it is to be done  but we shall do it he answered and we must not forget to be very prudent until it is fully settled how we shall do it  when lawrence retired to his room and sat down to hold that peculiar court in which he was judge jury lawyers and witnesses as well as the prisoner at the bar he had to do with a case a great deal more complicated and difficult than that which perplexed the mind of miss annie peyton he began by the very unjudicial act of pledging himself to himself that nothing should interfere with this new this true love in spite of all that might be said done or thought annie peyton should be his wife there was no indecision whatever in regard to the new love the only question was what is to be done about the old one  lawrence could not admit for a moment that he could have spoken to roberta march as he had spoken if he had not loved her but he could now perceive that that love had been in no small degree impaired and weakened by the manner of its acceptance the action of miss march on her last day here had much more chilled his ardor than her words on pine top hill he had not before examined thoroughly into the condition of that ardor after the departure of the lady but it was plain enough now  there was therefore no doubt whatever in regard to his love for miss march he was quite ready and able to lay that aside but what about her acceptance of it how could he lay that aside  this was the real case before the court the witnesses could give no available testimony the lawyers argued feebly the jury disagreed and lawrence in his capacity of judge dismissed the case in his efforts to conduct his mind through the channels of law and equity lawrence had not satisfied himself and his thoughts began to be moved by what might be termed his military impulses i made a charge into the camp he said with a little downward drawing of the corners of his mouth and i did not capture the commanderinchief and now i intend to charge out again  he sat down to his table and wrote the following note  my dear miss march  i have been waiting for a good many days hoping to receive either from you or mr keswick an explanation of the message you sent to me by him i now believe that it will be impossible to give a satisfactory explanation of that message i therefore recur to our last private interview and wish to say to you that i am ready at any time to meet you under either a sycamore or a cherry tree  and then he signed it and addressed it to miss march at midbranch this being done he put on his hat and stepped out to see if a messenger could be found to carry the letter to its destination for he did not wish to wait for the semiweekly mail near the house he met annie  what have you been doing all this time she asked  i have been writing a letter he said and am now looking for some colored boy who will carry it for me  who is it to she asked  miss march was his answer  let me see it said annie  at this lawrence looked at her with wideopen eyes and then he laughed never since he had been a child had there been any one who would have thought of such a thing as asking to see a private letter which he had written to some one else and that this young girl should stand up before him with her straightforward expectant gaze and make such a request of him in the first instance amused him  you dont mean to say she added that you would write anything to miss march which you would not let me see  this letter said lawrence was written for miss march and no one else it is simply the winding up of that old affair  give it to me said annie and let me see how you wound it up  lawrence smiled looked at her in silence for a moment and then handed her the letter  i dont want you to think she said as she took it that i am going to ask you to show me all the letters you write but when you write one to a lady like miss march i want to know what you say to her and then she read the letter when she had finished she turned to lawrence and with her countenance full of amazement exclaimed i havent the least idea in the world what all this means what message did she send you and why should you meet her under a tree  these questions went so straight to the core of the affair and were so peculiarly difficult to answer that lawrence for the moment found himself in the very unusual position of not knowing what to say but he presently remarked do you think it is of any advantage to either of us to talk over this affair which is now past and gone  i dont want to talk over any of it said annie very promptly except the part of it which is referred to in this letter but i want to know about that  that covers the most important part of it said lawrence  very good she answered and so you can tell it to me and now that i think of it you can tell me at the same time why you wanted to find my cousin junius you refused once to tell me that you know  i remember said lawrence and if you have the least feeling about it i will relate the whole affair from beginning to end  that perhaps will be the best thing to do after all said annie and suppose we take a walk over the fields and then you can tell it without being interrupted  but lawrence did not feel that his ankle would allow him to accept this invitation for it had hurt him a good deal since his walk to aunt patsys cabin he said so to annie and excited in her the deepest feelings of commiseration  you must take no more walks of any length she exclaimed until you are quite quite well it was my fault that you took that tramp to aunt patsys i ought to have known better but then she said looking up at him you were not under my charge i shall take very good care of you now  for my part he said i am glad i have this little relapse for now i can stay here longer  i am very very sorry for the relapse said she but awfully glad for the stay and you mustnt stand another minute let us go and sit in the arbor the sun is shining straight into it and that will make it all the more comfortable while you are telling me about those things  they sat down in the arbor and lawrence told annie the whole history of his affair with miss march from the beginning to the end that is if the end had been reached although he intimated to her no doubt upon this point this avowal he had never expected to make in fact he had never contemplated its possibility but now he felt a certain satisfaction in telling it every item as it was related seemed thrown aside forever and now then my dear annie he said when he had finished what do you think of all that  well she said in the first place i am still more of the opinion than i was before that you never were really in love with her you did entirely too much planning and investigating and calculating and when at last you did come to the conclusion to propose to her you did not do it so much of your own accord as because you found that another man would be likely to get her if you did not make a pretty quick move yourself and as to that acceptance i dont think anything of it at all i believe she was very angry at junius because he consented to bring your messages when he ought to have been his own messenger and that she gave him that answer just to rack his soul with agony i dont believe she ever dreamed that he would take it to you and to tell the simple truth i believe from what i saw of her that morning that she was thinking very little of you and a great deal of him to be sure she was fiery angry with him but it is better to be that way with a lover than to pay no attention to him at all  this was a view of the case which had never struck lawrence before and although it was not very flattering to him it was very comforting he felt that it was extremely likely that this young woman had been able to truthfully divine in a case in which he had failed the motives of another young woman here was a further reason for congratulating himself that he had not written to miss march  and as to the last part of the letter said annie you are not going under any cherry tree or sycamore either to be refused by her what she said to you was quite enough for a final answer without any signing or sealing under trees or anywhere else i think the best thing that can be done with this precious epistle is to tear it up  lawrence was amused by the piquant earnestness of this decision but what am i to do he asked i cant let the matter rest in this unfinished and unsatisfactory condition  you might write to her said annie and tell her that you have accepted what she said to you on pine top hill as a conclusive answer and that you now take back everything you ever said on the subject you talked of that day and do you think it would be well to put in anything about your being otherwise engaged  at this lawrence laughed i think that expression would hardly answer he said but i will write another note and we shall see how you like it  that will be very well said the happy annie and if i were you id make it as gentle as i could its of no use to hurt her feelings  oh i dont want to do that said lawrence and now that we have the opportunity let us consider the question of informing your aunt of our engagement  oh dear dear dear said annie that is a great deal worse than informing miss march that you dont want to be engaged to her  that is true said lawrence it is not by any means an easy piece of business but we might as well look it square in the face and determine what is to be done about it  it is simple enough just as we look at it said annie all we have to do is to say that knowing that aunt keswick had written to my father that she was determined to make a match between cousin junius and me i was afraid to come down here without putting up some insurmountable obstacle between me and a man that i had not seen since i was a little girl of course i would say very decidedly that i wouldnt have married him if i hadnt wanted to but then considering aunt keswicks very open way of carrying out her plans it would have been very unpleasant and indeed impossible for me to be in the house with him unless she saw that there was no hope of a marriage between us and for this reason i took the name of mrs null or mrs nothing and came down here secure under the protection of a husband who never existed and then we could say that you and i were a good deal together and that although you had supposed when you came here that you were in love with miss march you had discovered that this was a mistake and that afterwards we fell in love with each other and are now engaged that would be a straightforward statement of everything just as it happened but the great trouble is how are we going to tell it to aunt keswick  you are right said lawrence how are we going to tell it  it need not be told thundered a strong voice close to their ears and then there was a noise of breaking latticework and cracking vines and through the back part of the arbor came an old woman wearing a purple sunbonnet and beating down all obstacles before her with a great purple umbrella you neednt tell it cried mrs keswick standing in the middle of the arbor her eyes glistening her form trembling and her umbrella quivering in the air you neednt tell it its told  graphic and vivid descriptions have been written of those furious storms of devastating wind and deluging rain which suddenly sweep away the beauty of some fair tropical scene and we have read too of dreadful cyclones and tornadoes which rush in mad rage over land and sea burying great ships in a vast tumult of frenzied waves or crushing to the earth forests buildings everything that may lie in their awful paths but no description could be written which could give an adequate idea of the storm which now burst upon lawrence and annie the old lady had seen these two standing together in the yard conversing most earnestly she had then seen annie read a letter that lawrence gave her and then she had perceived the two in close converse enter the arbor and sit down together without the slightest regard for the rights of mr null  mrs keswick looked upon all this as somewhat more outoftheway than the usual proceedings of these young people and there came into her mind a curiosity to know what they were saying to each other so she immediately repaired to the large garden and quietly made her way to the back of the arbor in which advantageous position she heard the whole of lawrences story of his loveaffair with miss march annies remarks upon the same and the facts of this young ladys proposed confession in regard to her marriage with mr null and her engagement to mr croft  then she burst in upon them the tornado and the cyclone raged the thunder rolled and crashed and the white lightning of her wrath flashed upon the two as if it would scathe and annihilate them as they stood before her neither of them had ever known or imagined anything like this it had been long since mrs keswick had had an opportunity of exercising that power of vituperative torment which had driven a husband to the refuge of a reverted pistol which had banished for life relatives and friends and which in the shape of a promissory curse had held apart those who would have been husband and wife and now like the long stored up venom of a serpent it burst out with the direful force given by concentration and retention  at the first outburst annie had turned pale and shrunk back but now she clung to the side of lawrence who although his face was somewhat blanched and his form trembled a little with excitement still stood up bravely and endeavored but ineffectually to force upon the old ladys attention a denial of her bitter accusations with face almost as purple as the bonnet she wore or the umbrella she shook in the air the old lady first addressed her niece with scorn and condemnation she spoke of the deceit which the young girl had practised upon her but this part of the exercises was soon over she seemed to think that although nothing could be viler than annies conduct towards her still the fact that mr null no longer existed put annie again within her grasp and control and made it unnecessary to say much to her on this occasion it was upon lawrence that the main cataract of her fury poured it would be wrong to say that she could not find words to express her ire towards him she found plenty of them and used them all he had deceived her most abominably he had come there the expressed and avowed lover of miss march he had connived with her niece in her deceit he had taken advantage of all the opportunities she gave him to attain the legitimate object of his visit to inveigle into his snares this silly and absurd young woman and he had dared to interfere with the plans which by day and by night she had been maturing for years in vain did lawrence endeavor to answer or explain she stopped not nor listened to one word  and you need not imagine she screamed at him that you are going to turn round when you like and marry anybody you please you are engaged body and soul to roberta march and have no right by laws of man or heaven to marry anybody else if you breathe a word of love to any other woman it makes you a vile criminal in the eyes of the law and renders you liable to prosecution sir your affianced bride knows nothing of what her doublefaced snake of a lover is doing here but she shall know speedily that is a matter which i take into my own hands out of my way both of you  and with these words she charged by them and rushed out of the arbor and into the house     chapter xxvii   they were not a happy pair lawrence croft and annie peyton as they stood together in the arbor after old mrs keswick had left them they were both a good deal shaken by the storm they had passed through  lawrence said annie looking up to him with her large eyes full of earnestness there surely is no truth in what she said about your being legally bound to miss march  none in the least said lawrence no man under the circumstances would consider himself engaged to a woman at any rate there is one thing which i wish you to understand and that is that i am not engaged to miss march and that i am engaged to you no matter what is said or done you and i belong to each other  annie made no answer but she pressed his hand tightly as she looked up into his face he kissed her as she stood notwithstanding his belief that old mrs keswick was fully capable of bounding down on him umbrella in hand from an upper window  what do you think she is going to do annie asked presently  my dear annie said he i do not believe that there is a person on earth who could divine what your aunt keswick is going to do as to that we must simply wait and see but for my part i know what i must do i must write a letter to miss march and inform her plainly and definitely that i have ceased to be a suitor for her hand i think also that it will be well to let her know that we are engaged  yes said annie for she will be sure to hear it now but she will think it is a very prompt proceeding  thats exactly what it was said lawrence smiling prompt and determined there was no doubt or indecision about any part of our affair was there little one  not a bit of it said annie proudly  at dinner that day annie took her place at one end of the table and lawrence his at the other but the old lady did not make her appearance she was so erratic in her goings and comings and had so often told them they must never wait for her that annie cut the ham and lawrence carved the fowl and the meal proceeded without her but while they were eating mrs keswick was heard coming down stairs from her room the front door was opened and slammed violently and from the diningroom windows they saw her go down the steps across the yard and out of the gate  i do hope ejaculated annie that she has not gone away to stay  if annie had remembered that the boy plez in a clean jacket and long white apron officiated as waiter she would not have said this but then she would have lost some information ole miss not gone to stay he said with the license of an untrained retainer she gone to howlettses an she done tole aun letty shell be back agin dis ebenin  if aunt keswick dont come back said annie when the two were in the parlor after dinner i shall go after her i dont intend to drive her out of the house  dont you trouble yourself about that my dear said lawrence she is too angry not to come back  there is one thing said annie after a while that we really ought to do tomorrow aunt patsy is to be buried and before she is put into the ground those little shoes should be returned to aunt keswick it seems to me that justice to poor aunt patsy requires that this should be done perhaps now she knows how wicked it was to steal them  yes said lawrence i think it would be well to put them back where they belong but how can you manage it  if you will give them to me said annie i will go up to aunts room now that she is away and if she keeps the box in the same place where it used to be ill slip them into it i hate dreadfully to do it but i really feel that it is a duty  when lawrence with some little difficulty walked across the yard to get the shoes from his trunk annie ran after him and waited at the office door you must not take a step more than necessary she said and so i wont make you come back to the house  when lawrence gave her the shoes and her hand a little squeeze at the same time he told her that he should sit down immediately and write his letter  and i said annie will go and see what i can do with these  with the shoes in her pocket she went up stairs into her aunts room and after looking around hastily as if to see that the old lady had not left the ghost of herself in charge she approached the closet in which the sacred pasteboard box had always been kept but the closet was locked turning away she looked about the room there was no other place in which there was any probability that the box would be kept then she became nervous she fancied she heard the click of the yard gate she would not for anything have her aunt catch her in that room nor would she take the shoes away with her hastily placing them upon a table she slipped out and hurried into her own room  it was about an hour after this that mrs keswick came rapidly up the steps of the front porch she had been to howletts to carry a letter which she had written to miss march and had there made arrangements to have that letter taken to midbranch very early the next morning she had wished to find some one who would start immediately but as there was no moon and as the messenger would arrive after the family were all in bed she had been obliged to abandon this more energetic line of action but the letter would get there soon enough and if it did not bring down retribution on the head of the man who lodged in her office and who she said to herself had worked himself into her plans like the rot in a field of potatoes she would ever after admit that she did not know how to write a letter all the way home she had conned over her method of action until mr brandon or a letter should come from midbranch  she had already attacked together the unprincipled pair who found shelter in her house and she now determined to come upon them separately and torment each soul by itself annie of course would come in for the lesser share of the punishment for the fact that the wretched and depraved null was no more had in a great measure mitigated her offence she was safe and her aunt intended to hold her fast and do with her as she would when the time and junius came but upon lawrence she would have no mercy when she had delivered him into the hands of mr brandon or those of robertas father or the clutches of the law she would have nothing more to do with him but until that time she would make him bewail the day when he deceived and imposed upon her by causing her to believe that he was in love with another when he was in reality trying to get possession of her niece there were a great many things which she had not thought to say to him in the arbor but she would pour the whole hot mass upon his head that evening  stamping up the stairs and thumping her umbrella upon every step as she went hot vengeance breathing from between her parted lips and her eyes flashing with the delight of prospective fury she entered her room the light of the afternoon had but just begun to wane and she had not made three steps into the apartment before her eyes fell upon a pair of faded light blue shoes which stood side by side upon a table she stopped suddenly and stood pale and rigid her grasp upon her umbrella loosened and unnoticed it fell upon the floor then her eyes still fixed upon the shoes she moved slowly sidewise towards the closet she tried the door and found it still locked then she put her hand in her pocket drew out the key looked at it and dropped it with faltering steps she drew near the table and stood supporting herself by the back of a chair any one else would have seen upon that table merely a pair of babys shoes but she saw more she saw the tops of the little socks which she had folded away for the last time so many years before she saw the first short dress her child had ever worn it was tied up with pink ribbons at the shoulders from which hung two white plump little arms there was a little neck around which was a double string of coral fastened by a small gold clasp above this was a face a baby face with soft pale eyes and its head covered with curls of the lightest yellow not arranged in artistic negligence but smooth even and regular as she so often had turned twisted and set them it was indeed her baby girl who had come to her as clear and vivid in every feature limb and garment as were the real shoes upon the table for many minutes she stood her eyes fixed upon the little apparition then slowly she sank upon her knees by the chair her sunbonnet which she had not removed was bowed so the pale eyes of the little one could not see her face and from her own eyes came the first tears that that old woman had shed since her babys clothes had been put away in the box                                       lawrences letter to miss march was a definitely expressed document intended to cover all the ground necessary and no more but it could not be said that it was entirely satisfactory to himself his case to say the least of it was a difficult one to defend he was aware that his course might be looked upon by others as dishonorable although he assured himself that he had acted justly it might have been better to wait for a positive declaration from miss march that she had not truly accepted him before engaging himself to another lady but then he said to himself true love never waits for anything at all events he could write no better letter than the one he had produced and he hoped he should have an opportunity to show it to annie before he sent it  he need not have troubled himself in this regard for he and annie were not disturbed during the rest of that day by the appearance of mrs keswick but after the letter had been duly considered and approved he found it difficult to obtain a messenger there was no one on the place who would undertake to walk to midbranch and he could not take the liberty of using mrs keswicks horse for the trip so it was found necessary to wait until the morrow when the letter could be taken to howletts where if no one could be found to carry it immediately it would have to be entrusted to the mail which went out the next day lawrence of course knew nothing of mrs keswicks message to midbranch or he would have been still more desirous that his letter should be promptly dispatched  the evening was not a very pleasant one the lovers did not know at what moment the old lady might descend upon them and the element of unpleasant expectancy which pervaded the atmosphere of the house was somewhat depressing they talked a good deal of the probabilities of mrs keswicks action lawrence expected that she would order him away although annie had stoutly maintained that her aunt would have no right to do this as he was not in a condition to travel this argument however made little impression upon lawrence who was not the man to stay in any house where he was not wanted besides he knew very well that for any one to stay in mrs keswicks house when she did not want him would be an impossibility but he did not intend to slip away in any cowardly manner and leave annie to bear alone the brunt of the second storm he felt sure that such a storm was impending and he was also quite certain that its greatest violence would break upon him he would stay therefore and meet the old lady when she next descended upon them and before he went away he would endeavor to utter some words in defence of himself and annie  they separated early and a good deal of thinking was done by them before they went to sleep  the next morning they had only each other for company at breakfast but they had just risen from that meal when they were startled by the entrance of mrs keswick having expected her appearance during the whole of the time they were eating they had no reason to be startled by her coming now but for their subsequent amazement at her appearance and demeanor they had every reason in the world her face was pale and grave with an air of rigidity about it which was not common to her for in general she possessed a very mobile countenance without speaking a word she advanced towards lawrence and extended her hand to him he was so much surprised that while he took her hand in his he could only murmur some unintelligible form of morning salutation then mrs keswick turned to annie and shook hands with her the young girl grew pale but said not a word but some tears came into her eyes although why this happened she could not have explained to herself having finished this little performance the old lady walked to the back window and looked out into the flower garden although there was really nothing there to see now annie found voice to ask her aunt if she would not have some breakfast  no said mrs keswick my breakfast was brought upstairs to me and with that she turned and went out of the room she closed the door behind her but scarcely had she done so when she opened it again and looked in it was quite plain to the two silent and astonished observers of her actions that she was engaged in the occupation very unusual with her of controlling an excited condition of mind she looked first at one and then at the other and then she said in a voice which seemed to meet with occasional obstructions in its course i have nothing more to say about anything do just what you please only dont talk to me about it and she closed the door  what is the meaning of all this said lawrence advancing towards annie what has come over her  i am sure i dont know said annie and with this she burst into tears and cried as she would have scorned to cry during the terrible storm of the day before  that morning lawrence croft was a very much puzzled man what had happened to mrs keswick he could not divine and at times he imagined that her changed demeanor was perhaps nothing but an artful cover to some new and more ruthless attack  annie took occasion to be with her aunt a good deal during the morning but she reported to lawrence that the old lady had said very little and that little related entirely to household affairs  mrs keswick ate dinner with them her manner was grave and even stern but she made a few remarks in regard to the weather and some neighborhood matters and before the end of the meal both lawrence and annie fancied that they could see some little signs of a return to her usual humor which was pleasant enough when nothing happened to make it otherwise but expectations of an early return to her ordinary manner of life were fallacious she did not appear at supper and she spent the evening in her own room lawrence and annie had thus ample opportunity to discuss this novel and most unexpected state of affairs they did not understand it but it could not fail to cheer and encourage them only one thing they decided upon and that was that lawrence could not go away until he had had an opportunity of fully comprehending the position in relation to mrs keswick in which he and annie stood  about the middle of the evening as lawrence was thinking that it was time for him to retire to his room in the little house in the yard letty came in with a letter which she said had been brought from midbranch by a colored man on a horse the man had said there was no answer and had gone back to howletts where he belonged  the letter was for mr croft and from miss march very much surprised at receiving such a missive lawrence opened the envelope his letter to miss march had not yet been sent for the new state of affairs had not only very much occupied his mind but it also seemed to render unnecessary any haste in the matter and he had concluded to mail the letter the next day this therefore was not in answer to anything from him and why should she have written  it was with a decidedly uneasy sensation that lawrence began to read the letter annie watching him anxiously as he did so the letter was a somewhat long one and the purport of it was as follows the writer stated that having received a most extraordinary and astounding epistle from old mrs keswick which had been sent by a special messenger she had thought it her duty to write immediately on the subject to mr croft and had detained the man that she might send this letter by him she did not pretend to understand the full purport of what mrs keswick had written but it was evident that the old lady believed that an engagement of marriage existed between herself miss march and mr croft that that gentleman had given such information to mrs keswick she could hardly suppose but if he had it must have been in consequence of a message which very much to her surprise and grief had been delivered to mr croft by mr keswick in order that this message might be understood miss march had determined to make a full explanation of her line of conduct towards mr croft  during the latter part of their pleasant intercourse at midbranch during the past summer she had reason to believe that mr crofts intentions in regard to her were becoming serious but she had also perceived that his impulses however earnest they might have been were controlled by an extraordinary caution and prudence which although it sometimes amused her was not in the least degree complimentary to her she could not prevent herself from resenting this somewhat peculiar action of mr croft and this resentment grew into a desire which gradually became a very strong one that she might have an opportunity of declining a proposal from him that opportunity came while they were both at mrs keswicks and she had intended that what she said at her last interview with mr croft should be considered a definite refusal of his suit but the interview had terminated before she had stated her mind quite as plainly as she had purposed doing she had not however wished to renew the conversation on the subject and had concluded to content herself with what she had already said feeling quite sure that her words had been sufficient to satisfy mr croft that it would be useless to make any further proposals  when on the eve of her departure from the house mr keswick had brought her mr crofts message she was not only amazed but indignant not so much at mr croft for sending it as at mr keswick for bringing it miss march was not ashamed to confess that she was irritated and incensed to a high degree that a gentleman who had held the position towards her that mr keswick had held should bring her such a message from another man she was therefore seized with a sudden impulse to punish him and without in the least expecting that he would carry such an answer she had given him the one which he had taken to mr croft having until the day on which she was writing heard nothing further on the subject she had supposed that her expectations had been realized but on this day the astonishing letter from mrs keswick had arrived and it made her understand that not only had her impulsive answer been delivered but that mr croft had informed other persons that he had been accepted she wished therefore to lose no time in stating to mr croft that what she had said to him with her own lips was to be received as her final resolve and that the answer given to mr keswick was not intended for mr crofts ears  miss march then went on to say that it might be possible that she owed mr croft an apology for the somewhat ungracious manner in which she had treated him at mrs keswicks house but she assured herself that mr croft owed her an apology not only for the manner of his attentions but for the peculiar publicity he had given them in that case the apologies neutralized each other miss march had no intention of answering mrs keswicks letter under no circumstances could she have considered for a moment its absurd suggestions and recommendations and it contained allusions to mr croft and another person which if not founded upon the imagination of mrs keswick certainly concerned nothing with which miss march had anything to do  the proud spirit of lawrence croft was a good deal ruffled when he read this letter but he made no remark about it would you like to read it he said to annie  she greatly desired to read it but there was something in her lovers face and in the tone in which he spoke which made her suspect that the reading of that letter might be in some degree humiliating to him she was certain from the expression of his face as he read it that the letter contained matter very unpleasant to lawrence and it might be that it would wound him to have another person especially herself read them and so she said i dont care to read it if you will tell me why she wrote to you and the point of what she says  thank you said lawrence and he crumpled the letter in his hand as he spoke she wrote he continued in consequence of a letter she has had from your aunt  what exclaimed annie did aunt keswick write to her  yes said lawrence and sent it by a special messenger she must have told her all the heinous crimes with which she charged you and me particularly me and this must have been the first intimation to miss march that her cousin had given me the answer she made to him therefore miss march writes in haste to let me know that she did not intend that that answer should be given to me and that she wishes it generally understood that i have no more connection with her than i have with the queen of spain that is the sum and substance of the letter  i knew as well as i know anything in the world said annie that that message junius brought you meant nothing and taking the crumpled letter from his hand she threw it on the few embers that remained in the fireplace and as it blazed and crumbled into black ashes she said now that is the end of roberta march  yes said lawrence emphasizing his remark with an encircling arm so far as we are concerned that is the end of her     chapter xxviii   on the next day old aunt patsy was buried mrs keswick and annie attended the ceremonies in the cabin but they did not go to the burial after a time it might be in a week or two or it might be in a year the funeral sermon would be preached in the church and they would go to hear that aunt patsy never finished her crazy quilt several pieces being wanted to one corner of it but in the few days preceding her burial two old women of the congregation with trembling hands and uncertain eyes sewed in these pieces and finished the quilt in which the body of the venerable sister was wrapped according to her wellknown wish and desire it is customary among the negroes to keep the remains of their friends a very short time after death but aunt patsy had lived so long upon this earth that it was generally conceded that her spirit would not object to her body remaining above ground until all necessary arrangements should be completed and until all people who had known or heard of her had had an opportunity of taking a last look at her as she had been so very well known to almost everybodys grandparents a good many people availed themselves of this privilege  after mrs keswicks return from aunt patsys cabin where according to her custom she made herself very prominent it was noticeable that she had dropped some of the grave reserve in which she had wrapped herself during the preceding day it was impossible for her at least but for a very short time to act in a manner unsuited to her nature and reserve and constraint had never been suited to her nature she therefore began to speak on general subjects in her ordinary free manner to the various persons in her house but it must not be supposed that she exhibited any contrition for the outrageous way in which she had spoken to annie and lawrence or gave them any reason to suppose that the laceration of their souls on that occasion was a matter which at present needed any consideration whatever from her an angel born of memory and imagination might come to her from heaven and so work upon her superstitious feelings as to induce her to stop short in her course of reckless vengeance but she would not on that account fall upon anybodys neck or ask forgiveness for anything she had done to anybody she did not accuse herself nor repent she only stopped after this she said you all can do as you please i have no further concern with your affairs only dont talk to me about them  she told lawrence in a manner that would seem to indicate a moderate but courteous interest in his welfare that he must not think of leaving her house until his ankle had fully recovered its strength and she even went so far as to suggest the use of a patent lotion which she had seen at the store at howletts she resumed her former intercourse with annie but it seemed impossible for her to entirely forget the deception which that young lady had practised upon her the only indication however of this resentment was the appellation which she now bestowed upon her niece in speaking of her to lawrence or any of the household she invariably called her the late mrs null and this title so pleased the old lady that she soon began to use it in addressing her niece annie occasionally remonstrated in a manner which seemed half playful but was in fact quite earnest but her aunt paid no manner of attention to her words and continued to please herself by this halfsarcastic method of alluding to her nieces fictitious matrimonial state  letty and the other servants were at first much astonished by the new title given to miss annie and the only way in which they could explain it was by supposing that mr null had gone off somewhere and died and although they could not understand why miss annie should show so little grief in the matter and why she had not put on mourning they imagined that these were customs which she had learned in the north  lawrence advised annie to pay no attention to this whim of her aunt it dont hurt either of us he said and we ought to be very glad that she has let us off so easily but there is one thing i think you ought to do you should write to your cousin junius and tell him of our engagement but i would not refer at all to the other matter you are not supposed to have anything to do with it and miss march can tell him as much about it as she chooses mr keswick wrote me that he was going to midbranch and that he would communicate with me while there but as i have not since heard from him i presume he is still in washington  a letter was therefore written by annie and addressed to junius in washington and lawrence drove her to the railroad station in the springwagon where it was posted the family mail came biweekly to howletts as the postoffice at the railroad station was entirely too distant for convenience and as saturday approached it was evident from mrs keswicks occasional remarks and questions that she expected a letter it was quite natural for lawrence and annie to surmise that this letter was expected from miss march for mrs keswick had not heard of any rejoinder having been made to her epistle to that lady when late on saturday afternoon the boy plez returned from howletts mrs keswick eagerly took from him the wellworn letterbag and looked over its contents there was a letter for her and from midbranch but the address was written by junius not by miss march there was another in the same handwriting for annie as the old lady looked at the address on her letter and then on its postmark she was evidently disappointed and displeased but she said nothing and went away with it to her room annies letter was in answer to the one she had sent to washington which had been promptly forwarded to midbranch where junius had been for some days it began by expressing much surprise at the information his cousin had given him in regard to her assumption of a married title and although she had assured him she had very good reasons he could not admit that it was right and proper for her to deceive his aunt and himself in this way if it were indeed necessary that other persons should suppose that she were a married woman her nearest relatives at least should have been told the truth  at this passage annie who was reading the letter aloud and lawrence who was listening both laughed but they made no remarks and the reading proceeded  junius next alluded to the news of his cousins engagement to mr croft his guarded remarks on this subject showed the kindness of his heart he did not allude to the suddenness of the engagement nor to the very peculiar events that had so recently preceded it but reading between the lines both annie and lawrence thought that the writer had probably given these points a good deal of consideration in a general way however it was impossible for him to see any objection to such a match for his cousin and this was the impression he endeavored to give in a very kindly way in his congratulations but even here there seemed to be indications of a hope on the part of the writer that mr croft would not see fit to make another short tack in his course of love  like the polite gentleman he was mr keswick allowed his own affairs to come in at the end of the letter here he informed his cousin that his engagement with miss march had been renewed and that they were to be married shortly after christmas as it must have been very plain to those who were present when miss march left his aunts house that she left in anger with him he felt impelled to say that he had explained to her the course of action to which she had taken exception and although she had not admitted that that course had been a justifiable one she had forgiven him he wished also to say at this point that he himself was not at all proud of what he had done  that was intended for me interrupted lawrence  well if you understand it it is all right said annie  junius went on to say that the renewal of his engagement was due in great part to miss marchs visit to his aunt and to a letter she had received from her a few days of intercourse with mrs keswick whom she had never before seen and the tenor and purpose of that letter had persuaded miss march that his aunt was a person whose mind had passed into a condition when its opposition or its action ought not to be considered by persons who were intent upon their own welfare his own arrival at midbranch at this juncture had resulted in the happy renewal of their engagement  i dont know junius half as well as i wish i did said annie as she finished the letter but i am very sure indeed that he will make a good husband and i am glad he has got roberta marchas he wants her  did you emphasize he asked lawrence  i will emphasize it if you would like to hear me do it said she  its very queer remarked annie after a little pause that i should have been so anxious to preserve poor junius from your clutches and that after all i did to save him i should fall into those clutches myself  whereupon lawrence much to her delight told her the story of the antidetective  mrs keswick sat down in her room and read her letter she had no intention of abandoning her resolution to let things go as they would and therefore did not expect to follow up with further words or actions anything she had written in her letter to roberta march but she had had a very strong curiosity to know what that lady would say in answer to said letter and she was therefore disappointed and displeased that the missive she had received was from her nephew and not from miss march she did not wish to have a letter from junius she knew or rather very much feared that it would contain news which would be bad news to her and although she was sure that such news would come to her sooner or later she was very much averse to receiving it  his letter to her merely touched upon the points of mrs null and his cousins engagement to mr croft but it was almost entirely filled with the announcement and most earnest defence of his own engagement to roberta march he said a great deal upon this subject and he said it well but it is doubtful if his fervid and often affectionate expressions made much impression upon his aunt nothing could make the old lady like this engagement but she had made up her mind that he might do as he pleased and it didnt matter what he said about it he had done it and there was an end of it  but there was one thing that did matter that unprincipled and iniquitous old man brandon had had his own way at last and she and her way had been set aside this was the last of a series of injuries to her and her family with which she charged mr brandon and his family but it was the crowning wrong the injury itself she did not so much deplore as that the injurer would profit by it arrested in her course of raging passion by a sudden flood of warm and irresistible emotion she had resigned as impetuously as she had taken them up her purposes of vengeance and consequently her plans for her nephew and niece but she was a keenminded as well as passionate old woman and when she had considered the altered state of affairs she was able to see in it advantages as well as disappointment and defeat from what she had learned of lawrence crofts circumstances and position and she had made a good many inquiries on this subject of roberta march he was certainly a good match for annie and although she hated to have anything to do with midbranch it could not be a bad thing for junius to be master of that large estate and that mr brandon had repeatedly declared he would be if he married roberta thus in the midst of these reverses there was something to comfort her and reconcile her to them but there was no balm for the wound caused by mr brandons success and her failure  with the letter of junius open in her hand she sat for a long time in bitter meditation at length a light gradually spread itself over her gloomy countenance her eyes sparkled she sat up straight in her chair and a broad smile changed the course of the wrinkles on her cheeks she arose to her feet she gave her head a quick jerk of affirmation she clapped one hand upon the other and she said aloud i will bless not curse  and with that she went happy to bed     chapter xxix   on the following monday lawrence announced that his ankle was now quite well enough for him to go to new york where his affairs required his presence neither he nor the late mrs null regarded this parting with any satisfaction but their very natural regrets at the necessary termination of these happy autumn days were a good deal tempered by the fact that lawrence intended to return in a few weeks and that then the final arrangements would be made for their marriage it was not easy to decide what these arrangements would be for in spite of the many wrongnesses of the old ladys head and heart annie had conceived a good deal of affection for her aunt and felt a strong disinclination to abandon her to her lonely life which would be more lonely than before now that junius was to be married on the other hand lawrence although he had discovered some estimable points in the very peculiar character of mrs keswick had no intention of living in the same house with her this whole matter therefore was left in abeyance until the lovers should meet again some time in december  lawrence and annie had desired very much that junius should visit them before mr crofts departure for the north for they both had a high esteem for him and both felt a desire that he should be as well satisfied with their matrimonial project as they were with his but they need not have expected him junius had conceived a dislike for mr croft which was based in great part upon disapprobation of what he himself had done in connection with that gentleman and this manner of dislike is not easily set aside the time would come when he would take lawrence croft and annie by the hand and honestly congratulate them but for that time they must wait  lawrence departed in the afternoon and the next day mrs keswick set about that general renovation and rearrangement of her establishment which many good housewives consider necessary at certain epochs such as the departure of guests the coming in of spring or the advent of winter these arrangements occupied two days and on the evening that they were finished to her satisfaction the old lady informed her niece that early the next morning she was going to start for midbranch and that it was possible nay quite probable that she would stay there over a night i might go and come back the same day she said but thirty miles a day is too much for billy and besides i am not sure i could get through what i have to do if i do not stay over i would take you with me but this is not to be a mere visit i have important things to attend to and you would be in the way you got along so well without me when you first came here that i have no doubt you will do very well for one night i shall drive myself and take plez along with me and leave uncle isham and letty to take care of you  under ordinary circumstances annie would have been delighted to go to midbranch a place she had never seen and of which she had heard so much but she had no present desire to see roberta march and said so further remarking that she was very willing to stay by herself for a night she hoped much that her aunt would proceed with the conversation and tell her why she had determined upon such an extraordinary thing as a visit to midbranch where she knew the old lady had not been for many many years but mrs keswick had nothing further to say upon this subject and began to talk of other matters  after a very early breakfast next morning mrs keswick set out upon her journey driving the sorrel horse with much steadiness intermingled with severity whenever he allowed himself to drop out of his usual jogging pace plez sat in the back part of the springwagon and whenever the old lady saw an unusually large stone lying in the track of the road she would stop and make him get out and throw it to one side  i believe she said on one of these occasions that a thousand men in buggies might pass along this road thrice a day for a year and never think of stopping to throw that rock out of the way of peoples wheels they would steer around it every time or bump over it but such a thing as moving it would never enter their heads  the morning was somewhat cool but fine and the smile which occasionally flitted over the corrugated countenance of mrs keswick seemed to indicate that she was in a pleasant state of mind which might have been occasioned by the fine weather and the good condition of the roads or by cheerful anticipations connected with her visit  it was not very long after noonday that with a stifled remark of disapprobation upon her lips she drew up at the foot of the broad flight of steps by which one crossed the fence into the midbranch yard giving billy into the charge of plez with directions to take him round to the stables and tell somebody to put him up and feed him she mounted the steps and stopped for a minute or so on the broad platform at the top looking about her as she stood everything the house the yard the row of elms along the fence the widespreading fields and the farm buildings and cabins some of which she could see around the end of the house were all on a scale so much larger and more imposing than those of her own little estate that although nothing had changed for the better since the days when she was familiar with midbranch she was struck with the general superiority of the brandon possessions to her own her eyes twinkled and she smiled but there did not appear to be anything envious about her  she presented a rather remarkable figure as she stood in this conspicuous position annie had insisted when she was helping her aunt to array herself for the journey that she should wear a bonnet which for many years had been her headgear on sundays and important occasions but to this the old lady positively objected she was not going on a mere visit of state or ceremony her visit at midbranch would require her whole attention and she did not wish to distract her mind by wondering whether her bonnet was straight on her head or not and she was so unaccustomed to the feel of it that she would never know if it got turned hind part foremost she could never be at her ease nor say freely what she wished to say if she were dressed in clothes to which she was not accustomed she was perfectly accustomed to her sunbonnet and she intended to wear that of course she carried her purple umbrella and she wore a plain calico dress blue spotted with white which was very narrow and short in the skirt barely touching the tops of her shoes the stoutest and most serviceable that could be procured in the store at howletts she covered her shoulders with a small red shawl which much to annies surprise she fastened with a large and somewhat tarnished silver brooch an ornament her niece had never before seen attired thus she certainly would have attracted attention had there been any one there to see but the yard was empty and the house door closed she descended the steps crossed the yard with what might be termed a buoyant gait and mounting the porch knocked on the door with the handle of her umbrella after some delay a colored woman appeared and as soon as the door was opened mrs keswick walked in  where is your master said she forgetting all about the emancipation act  mahs robert is in the libery said the woman  and where are miss roberta march and master junius keswick  miss rob went norf day fore yestiddy was the answer an mahs junius done gone long to scort her who shall i tell mahs robert is come  there is no need to tell him who i am said mrs keswick just take me in to him thats all you have to do  a good deal doubtful of the propriety of this proceeding but more doubtful of the propriety of opposing the wishes of such a determinedlooking visitor the woman stepped to the back part of the hall and opened the door the moment she did so mrs keswick entered and closed the door behind her  mr brandon was seated in an arm chair by a table and not very far from a wood fire of a size suited to the season his slippered feet were on a cushioned stool his eyeglasses were carefully adjusted on the capacious bridge of his nose and intent upon a newspaper which had arrived by that mornings mail he presented the appearance of a very well satisfied old gentleman in very comfortable circumstances but when he turned his head and saw the widow keswick close the door behind her every idea of satisfaction or comfort seemed to vanish from his mind he dropped the paper he rose to his feet he took off his eyeglasses he turned somewhat red in the face and he ejaculated what madam so it is you mrs keswick  the old lady did not immediately answer her head dropped a little on one side a broad smile bewrinkled the lower part of her wellworn visage and with her eyes halfclosed behind her heavy spectacles she held out both her hands the purple umbrella in one of them and exclaimed in a voice of happy fervor robert i am yours  mr brandon recovered from his first surprise had made a step forward to go round the table and greet his visitor but at these words he stopped as if he had been shot perception understanding and even animation seemed to have left him as he vacantly stared at the elderly female with purple sunbonnet and umbrella blue calico gown red shawl and coarse boots who held out her arms towards him and who gazed upon him with an air of tender though decrepit fondness  dont you understand me robert she continued dont you remember the day many a good long year ago it is true when we walked together down there by the branch and you asked me to be yours i refused you robert and although you went down on your knees in the damp grass and besought me to give you my heart i would not do it but i did not know you then as i know you now robert and the words of true love which you spoke to me that morning come to me now with a sweetness which i was too young and trifling to notice then that heart is yours now robert i am yours and with these words she made a step forward  at this demonstration mr brandon appeared suddenly to recover his consciousness and he precipitately made two steps backwards just missing tumbling over his footstool into the fireplace  madam he exclaimed what are you talking about  of the days of our courtship and your love robert she said my love did not come then but it is here now here now she repeated putting the hand with the umbrella in it on her breast  madam exclaimed the old gentleman you must be raving crazy those things to which you allude happened nearly half a century ago and since that you have been married and settled and  robert interrupted the widow keswick you are mistaken it is not quite fortyfive years since that morning and why should hearts like ours allow the passage of time or the mere circumstance of what might be called an outside marriage but now extinct to come between them there is many a spring robert which does not show when a man first begins to dig but it will bubble up in time and robert it bubbles now and with her head bent a little downwards although her eyes were still fixed upon him she made another step in his direction  mr brandon now backed himself flat against some bookshelves in his rear the perspiration began to roll from his face and his whole form trembled mrs keswick madam he exclaimed you will drive me mad  the old lady dropped the end of her umbrella on the floor rested her two hands on the head of it settled herself into an easy position to speak and with her head thrown back fixed a steady gaze upon the trembling old gentleman robert she said do not try to crush emotions which always were a credit to you although in those days gone by i didnt tell you so your hair was black then robert and you looked taller for you hadnt a stoop and your face was very smooth and so was mine and i remember i had on a white dress with a broad ribbon around the waist and neither of us wore specs what you said to me was very fresh and sweet robert and it all comes to me now as it never came before you have never loved another robert and you dont know how happy it makes me to think that and to know that i can come to you and find you the same true and constant lover that you were when fortyfive years ago you went down on your knees to me by the branch we cant stifle those feelings of bygone days which well up in our bosoms robert after all these years i have learned what a prize your true love is and i return it i am yours  at this mr brandon opened his mouth with a spasmodic gasp but no word came from him he looked to the right and left and then made a lunge to one side as if he would run around the old lady and gain the door but mrs keswick was too quick for him with two sudden springs she reached the door and put her back against it  dont leave me robert she said i have not told you all dont you remember this breastpin unfastening the large silver brooch from her shawl and holding it out to him you gave it to me robert there were almost tears of joy in your eyes on the first day i wore it although i was careful to let you know it meant nothing where are those tears today robert it means something now i have kept it all these years although in the lifetime of mr keswick it was never cleaned and i wore it today robert that your eyes might rest upon it once again and that you might speak to me the words you spoke to me the day after i let you pin it on my white neckerchief you waited then robert a whole day before you spoke but you neednt wait now let your heart speak out dear robert  but dear robert appeared to have no power to speak on this or any other subject he was half sitting half leaning on the corner of a table which stood by a window out of which he gave sudden agonized and longing glances as if had he strength enough he would raise the sash and leap out  the old lady however had speech enough for two robert she exclaimed how happy may we be yet if you wish to give up to a younger couple this spacious mansion these fine grounds and noble elms and come to my humble home i shall only say to you robert come i shall be alone there robert and shall welcome you with joy i have nobody now to give anything to the late mrs null by which i mean my niece will marry a man who if reports dont lie is rich enough to make her want nothing that i have and as for junius he is to have your property as we all know so all i have is yours if you choose to come to me robert but if you would rather live here i will come to you and the young people can board with us until your decease after that ill board with them and im not sure robert but i like the plan of coming here best there are lots of improvements we could make on this place with you to furnish the money and me to advise and direct the first thing id do would be to have down those abominable steps over the front fence and put a decent gate in its place and then we would have a gravelled walk across the yard to the porch wide enough for you and me robert to walk together arminarm when we would go out to look over the plantation or stroll down to that spot on the branch robert where the first plightings of our troth began  the words of tender reminiscence and of fond though rather late devotion with which mrs keswick had stabbed and gashed the soul of the poor old gentleman had at first deranged his senses and then driven him into a state of abject despair but the practical remarks which succeeded seemed to have a more direful effect upon him the idea of the being with the sunbonnet and the umbrella entering into his life at midbranch tearing down the broad steps which his honored father had built cutting a gravelled path across the green turf which had been the pride of generations and doing no man could say what else of advice and direction seemed to strike a chill of terror into his very bones  the quick perception of mrs keswick told her that it was time to terminate the interview i will not say anything more to you now robert she said of course you have been surprised at my coming to you today and accepting your offer of marriage and you must have time to quiet your mind and think it over i dont doubt your affection robert and i dont want to hurry you i am going to stay here tonight so that we can have plenty of time to settle everything comfortably ill go now and get one of the servants to show me to a room where i can take off my things ill see you again at dinner  and with a smile of antiquated coyness she left the room     chapter xxx   mr brandon was not a weak man nor one very susceptible to outside influences but in the whole course of his life nothing so extraordinarily nervestirring had occurred to him as this visit of old mrs keswick endeavoring to appear in the character of the young creature he had wooed some fortyfive years before for a long time mrs keswick had been the enemy of himself and his family and many a bitter onslaught she had made upon him both by letter and by word of mouth these he had borne with the utmost bravery and coolness and there were times when they even afforded him entertainment but this most astounding attack was something against which no man could have been prepared and mr brandon suddenly pounced upon in the midst of his comfortable bachelordom by a malevolent sorceress and hurled back to the days of his youth was shown himself kneeling not at the feet of a fair young girl but before a horrible old woman  this amazing and startling state of affairs was too much for him immediately to comprehend it stunned and bewildered him such indeed was the effect upon him that the first act of his mind when he was left alone and it began to act was to ask of itself if there were really any grounds upon which mrs keswick could with any reason take up her position the absolute absurdity of her position however became more and more evident as mr brandons mind began to straighten itself and stand up and now he grew angry anger was a passion with which he was not at all unfamiliar and the exercise of it seemed to do him good when he had walked up and down his library for a quarter of an hour he felt almost like his natural self and with many nods of his head and shakes of his fist he declared that the old woman was crazy and that he would bundle her home just as soon as he could  by dinnertime he had cooled down a good deal and he resolved to treat her with the respect due to her age and former condition of sanity but to take care that she should not again be alone with him and to arrange that she should return to her home that day  mrs keswick came to the table with a smiling face and wearing a closefitting white cap which looked like a portion of her night gear tied under her chin with broad stiff strings in this she appeared to her host as far more hideous than when wearing her sunbonnet mr brandon had arranged that two servants should wait upon the table so that one of them should always be in the room but in his supposition that the presence of a third person would have any effect upon the expression of mrs keswicks fond regard he was mistaken the meal had scarcely begun when she looked around the room with wideopen eyes and exclaimed robert if we should conclude to remain here i think we will have this room repapered with some lightcolored paper i like a light diningroom this is entirely too dark  the two servants one of whom was our old friend peggy actually stopped short in their duties at this remark and as for mr brandon his appetite immediately left him to return no more during that meal  he was obliged to make some answer to this speech and so he briefly remarked that he had no desire to alter the appearance of his diningroom and then hastened to change the conversation by making some inquiries about that interesting young woman her niece who he had been informed was not a married lady as he had supposed her to be  at this intelligence peggy dropped two spoons and a fork she had never heard it before  the late mrs null said mrs keswick is a young woman who likes to cut her clothes after her own patterns they may be becoming to her when they are made up or they may not be but i am inclined to think she has got a pretty good head on her shoulders and perhaps she knows what suits her as well as any of us i cant say it was easy to forgive the trick she played on me her own aunt and just the same in fact as her mother but robert and as she said this the old lady laid down her knife and fork and looked tenderly at mr brandon i have determined to forgive everybody and to overlook everything and i do this as much for your sake dear robert as for my own it wouldnt do for a couple of our age to be keeping up grudges against the young people for their ways of getting out of marriages or getting into them we will have my niece and her husband here sometimes wont we robert  mr brandon straightened himself and remarked mr croft whom i have heard your niece is to marry will be quite welcome here with his wife then putting his napkin on the table and pushing back his chair he said now madam you must excuse me for i have orders to give to some of my people which i had forgotten until this moment but do not let me interfere with your dinner pray continue your meal  never before had mr brandon been known to leave his dinner until he had finished it and he was not at all accustomed to give such a poor reason for his actions as the one he gave now but it was simply impossible for him to sit any longer at table and have that old woman talk in that shocking manner before the servants  robert cried mrs keswick as he left the room ill save some dessert for you and well eat it together  mr brandons first impulse when he found himself out of the diningroom was to mount his horse and ride away but there was no place to which he wished to ride and he was a man who was very loath to leave the comforts of his home no he said she must go and not i and then he went into his parlor and strode up and down as soon as mrs keswick had finished her dinner he would see her there and speak his mind to her he had determined that he would not again be alone with her but since the presence of others was no restraint whatever upon her it had become absolutely necessary that he should speak with her alone  it was not long before the widow keswick with a brisk blithe step entered the parlor i couldnt eat without you robert she cried and so i really havent half finished my dinner did you have to come in here to speak to your people  mr brandon stepped to the door and closed it madam he said it will be impossible for me in the absence of my niece to entertain you here tonight and so it would be prudent for you to start for home as soon as possible as the days are short it would be too much of a journey for your horse to go back again today and your vehicle is an open one therefore i have ordered my carriage to be prepared and you may trust my driver to take you safely home even if it should be dark before you get there if you desire it there is a young maidservant here who will go with you  robert said mrs keswick approaching the old gentleman and gazing fondly upward at him you are so good and thoughtful and sweet but you need not put yourself to all that trouble for me i shall stay here tonight and in your house dear robert i can take care of myself a great deal better than any lady could take care of me  madam exclaimed mr brandon i want you to stop calling me by my first name you have no right to do so and i wont stand it  robert said the old lady looking at him with an air of tender upbraiding you forget that i am yours now and forever  never since he had arrived at mans estate and probably not before had mr brandon spoken in improper language to a lady but now it was all he could do to restrain himself from the ejaculation of an oath but he did restrain himself and only exclaimed confound it madam i cannot stand this why do you come here to drive me crazy with your senseless ravings  robert said mrs keswick very composedly i do not wonder that my coming to you and accepting the proposals which you once so heartily made to me and from which you have never gone back should work a good deal upon your feelings it is quite natural and i expected it therefore dont hesitate about speaking out your mind i shall not be offended so that we belong to each other for the rest of our days i dont mind what you say now when it is all new and unexpected to you you and i have had many a difference of opinion robert and your plans were not my plans but things have turned out as you wished and you have what you have always wanted and with the other good things robert you can take me and as she finished speaking she held out both hands to her companion  with a stamp of his foot and a kick at a chair which stood in his way mr brandon precipitately left the room and slammed the door after him and if peggy had not nimbly sprung to one side he would have stumbled over her and have had a very bad fall for a man of his age  it was not ten minutes after this that looking out of a window mrs keswick saw a saddled horse brought into the back yard she hastened into the hall and found peggy run to mr brandon she said and bid him goodbye for me i am going up stairs to get ready to go home and havent time to speak to him myself before he starts on his ride  at the receipt of this message the heart of mr brandon gave a bound which actually helped him to get into the saddle but he did not hesitate in his purpose of instant departure if he staid but for a moment she might come out to him and change her mind so he put spurs to his horse and galloped away merely stopping long enough as he passed the stables to give orders that the carriage be prepared for mrs keswick and taken round to the front  as he rode through the cool air of that fine november afternoon the spirits of mr brandon rose he felt a serene satisfaction in assuring himself that although he had been very angry indeed with mrs keswick on account of her most unheard of and outrageous conduct yet he had not allowed his indignation to burst out against her in any way of which he would afterward be ashamed some hasty words had escaped him but they were of no importance and under the circumstances no one could have avoided speaking them but when he had addressed her at any length he had spoken dispassionately and practically and she being at bottom a practical woman had seen the sense of his advice and had gone home comfortably in his carriage whether she took her insane fancies home with her or dropped them on the road it mattered very little to him so that he never saw her again and he did not intend to see her again if she came again to his house he would leave it and not return until she had gone but he had no reason to suppose that he would be forced into any such exceedingly disagreeable action as this he did not believe she would ever come back for unless she were really crazycrazyand in that case she ought to be put in the lunatic asylumshe could not keep up for any length of time the extraordinary and outrageous delusion that he would be willing to renew the feelings that he had entertained for her in her youth  mr brandon rode until nearly dark for it took a good while to free his mind from the effects of the excitements and torments of that day but when he entered the house and took his seat in his library chair by the fire he had almost regained his usual composed and well satisfied frame of mind  then through the quietly opened door came mrs keswick and stealthily stepping towards him in the fitful light of the blazing logs she put her hand on his arm and said dear robert how glad i am to see you back  the next morning about ten oclock mrs keswick sent her eighteenth or twentieth message to mr brandon who had shut himself up in his room since a little before suppertime on the previous evening the message was sent by peggy and she was instructed to shout it outside of her masters door until he took notice of it its purport was that it was necessary that mrs keswick should go home today and that her horse was harnessed and she was now ready to go but that she could not think of leaving until she had seen mr brandon again she would therefore wait until he was ready to come down  mr brandon looked out of the window and saw the springwagon at the outside of the broad stile with plez standing at the sorrels head he remembered that the venerable demon had said at the first that she intended to stay but one night and he could but believe that she was now really going knowing her as he did however he was very well aware that if she had said she would not leave until she had seen him she would stay in his house for a year unless he sooner went down to her therefore he opened his door and slowly and feebly descended the stairs  my dear dear robert exclaimed mrs keswick totally regardless of the fact that peggy was standing at the front door with her valise in her hand and that there was another servant in the hall how pale and haggard and worn you look you must be quite unwell and i dont know but that i ought to stay here and take care of you  at these words a look of agony passed over the old mans face but he said nothing  but i am afraid i cannot stay any longer this time continued the widow keswick for my niece would not know what had become of me and there are things at home that i must attend to but i will come again dont think i intend to desert you dear robert you shall see me soon again but while i am gone she said turning to the two servants i want you maids to take good care of your master you must do it for his sake for he has always been kind to you but i also want you to do it for my sake dont you forget that and now dear robert goodbye as she spoke she extended her hand towards the old gentleman  without a word but with a good deal of apparent reluctance he took the long bony hand in his and probably would have instantly dropped it again had not mrs keswick given him a most hearty clutch and a vigorous and longcontinued shake  it is hard dear robert she said for us to part with nothing but a handshake but there are people about and this will have to do and then after urging him to take good care of his health so valuable to them both and assuring him that he would soon see her again she gave his hand a final shake and left him accompanied by peggy she went out to the springwagon and clambered into it it almost surpasses belief that mr brandon a virginia gentleman of the old school should have stood in his hall and have seen an old lady leave his house and get into a vehicle without accompanying and assisting her but such was the case on this occasion he seemed to have forgotten his traditions and to have lost his impulses he simply stood where the widow keswick had left him and gazed at her  when she was seated and ready to start the old lady turned towards him called out to him in a cheery voice goodbye robert and kissed her hand to him  mrs keswick slowly drove away and mr brandon stood at his hall door gazing after her until she was entirely out of sight then he ejaculated the devils daughter and went into his library  i wonders said peggy when she returned to the kitchen how you alls gwine to like habin dat ole miss keswick libin hyar as you alls mistiss  whos gwine to hab her growled aunt judy  you all is sturdily retorted peggy dar aint no use tryin to git out ob dat dat old miss keswick done gone an kunjered mahs robert an deys boun to git mared i done heered all bout it an shes comin hyar to lib wid mahs robert but dat don make no difrence to me is gwine to lib wid mahs junius an miss rob in new york i is but is mighty sorry for you all  you peggy shouted the irate aunt judy shut up wid your fool talk when mahs robert marry dat ole jimpsun weed de angel gabrel blow his hohn shuh  slowly driving along the road to her home the widow keswick gazed cheerfully at the blue sky above her and the pleasant autumn scenery around her sniffed the fine fresh air delicately scented with the odor of falling leaves and settling herself into a more comfortable position on her seat she complacently said to herself well i reckon the old scapegrace has got his moneys worth this time     chapter xxxi   there were two reasons why peggy could not go to live with mahs junius and miss rob in new york in the first place this couple had no intention of setting up an establishment in that city and secondly peggy as roberta well knew was not adapted by nature to be her maid or the maid of any one else peggys true vocation in life was to throw her faraway gaze into futurity and as far as in her lay to adapt present circumstances to what she supposed was going to happen it would have delighted her soul if she could have been the adept in conjuring which she firmly believed the widow keswick to be but as she possessed no such gift she made up the deficiency as well as she could by mixing up her mind her soul and her desires into a sort of witchs hodgepodge which she thrust as a spell into the affairs of other people twice had the devices of this stupidlooking wooden peg of a negro girl stopped lawrence croft in the path he was following in his pursuit of roberta march if lawrence had known at the time what peggy was doing he would have considered her an unmitigated little demon but afterward if he could have known of it he would have thought her a very unprepossessing and conscienceless guardian angel  as it was he knew not what she had done and never considered her at all  junius keswick took much more delight in farming than he did in the practice of the law and it was only because he had felt himself obliged to do so that he had adopted the legal profession to be a farmer one must have a farm but a lawyer can frequently make a living from the lands of other men he was very willing therefore to agree to the plan which for years had been mr brandons most cherished scheme that he and roberta should make their home at midbranch and that he should take charge of the estate which would be his wifes property after the old gentlemans decease roberta was as fond of the country as was junius but she was also a city woman and it was arranged that the couple should spend a portion of each winter in new york at the house of mr march  junius and roberta as well as her father hoped very much that they might be able to induce mr brandon to come to new york to attend the wedding which was to take place the middle of january but they were not confident of success for they knew the old gentleman disliked very much to travel especially in winter three very pressing letters were therefore written to mr brandon and the writers were much surprised to receive in a short time a collective answer in which he stated that he would not only be present at the wedding but that he thought of spending several months in new york it would be very lonely at midbranch he wrote without robertathough why it should be more so this year than during preceding winters he did not explainand he felt a desire to see the changes that had taken place in the metropolis since he had visited it years ago  they would not have been so much surprised had they known that mr brandon did not feel himself safe in his own home by night or by day frequently had he gazed out of a window at the point in the road on which the first sight of an approaching springwagon could have been caught and had said to himself if only roberta were here that old hag would not dare to speak a word to me i dont want to go away but by george i dont see how i can stay here without rob  there was a short very black and somewhat bowlegged negro man on the place named israel bonaparte who lived in a little cabin by himself and was noted for his unsocial disposition and his taciturnity to him mr brandon went one day and said israel i want you to go to work on the fence rows on my side of the road to howletts grub up the bushes clear out the vines and weeds and see that the rails and posts are all in order that will be a job that i expect will last you until the roads begin to get heavy and by the way israel while you are at work i want you to keep a lookout for any visitors that may turn into our road especially if they happen to be ladies now that miss rob is away i am very particular about knowing beforehand when ladies are coming to visit me and when you see any wagon or carriage turn in i want you to make a short cut across the fields and let me know it and i will give you a quarter of a dollar every time you do so this was a very pleasant job of work for the meditative israel he was not very fond of grubbing but he earned the greater part of his ten dollars a month and rations by sitting on the fence smoking a corncob pipe and attending to the second division of the work which his employer had set him to do  lawrence croft was in new york at this time a very busy man arranging his affairs in that city so that they would not need his personal attention for some time to come he sublet for the remainder of his lease the suite of bachelor apartments he had occupied and he stored his furniture and books one might have imagined that he was taking in all possible sails close reefing the others battening down the hatches and preparing to run before a storm and yet his demeanor did not indicate that he expected any violent commotion of the elements on the contrary his friends and acquaintances thought him particularly blithe and gay he told them he was going to be married  to that virginia lady i suppose said one i remember her very well and consider you fortunate  i dont think you ever met her said mr croft she is a miss peyton from king thomas county  ah remarked his interlocutor lawrence walked to the window of the clubroom and stood there slowly puffing his cigar had anybody met this one he thought he knew she had seen but little company during her fathers life but was it likely that any of his acquaintances had had business at candys information shop as this idea came into his mind there seemed to be something unpleasant in the taste of his cigar and he threw it into the fire a few turns however up and down the now almost deserted rooms restored his tone he lighted another cigar and now there came up before him a vision of the girl who from loyalty to her dead father preferred to sit all day behind candys money desk rather than go to a relative who had not been his friend and then he saw the young girl who took up so courageously the cause of one of her own bloodthe boy cousin of her childhood and with a lovers pride lawrence thought of the dash the spirit and the bravery with which she had done it  by george he said to himself his eyes sparkling and his step quickening she has more in her than all the rest of them put together  who were included in the rest of them lawrence was not prepared just then to say but the expression was intended to have a very wide range  it was about the middle of december when lawrence paid another visit to mrs keswicks house the day was cold but clear and as he drove up to the outer gate he saw the old lady returning from a walk to howletts she stepped along briskly and was in a very good humor for she had just posted a carefully concocted letter to mr brandon in which she had expatiated in her peculiar style on the pleasure which she expected from an early visit to midbranch she had not the slightest idea of going there at present but she thought it quite time to freshen up the old gentlemans anticipations  descending from his carriage to meet her lawrence was very warmly greeted and the two went up to the house together  i expect the late mrs null will be very glad to see you said mrs keswick i think she has burned up all her widows weeds  you should be very much obliged to your niece said mr croft for so delicately ridding you of that dreadful fertilizer man  humph said the old lady she cheated me out of the pleasure of telling him what i thought of him and i shall never forgive her for that  as lawrence and annie sat together in the parlor that evening he told her what he had been doing in new york and this brought to her lips a question which she was very anxious to have answered she knew that lawrence was rich that his methods of life and thought made him a man of the cities and she felt quite certain that the position to which he would conduct her was that of the mistress of a handsome townhouse and the wife of a man of society she liked handsome townhouses and she was sure she would like society but it would all be very new and strange to her and although she was a brave girl at heart she shrank from making such a plunge as this  how are we going to live repeated lawrence that of course is to be as you shall choose but i have a plan to propose to you and i want very much to hear what you think about it and the plan is that we shall not live anywhere for a year or two but wander fancy free over as much of the world as pleases us and then decide where we shall settle down and how we shall like to do it  if annies answer had been expressed in words it might have been given here it may be said however that it was very quick very affirmative and in more ways than one highly satisfactory to lawrence  is it london and a landlady and tea she presently asked  yes it is that he said  is it the shops on the boulevards  yes said lawrence  and the appian way and the island of capri and snow mountains in the distance she asked  in their turn most certainly said her lover and it shall be the midnight sun and the nile if you like  freddy exclaimed the late mrs null i thank thee for what thou hast given me and she clasped the hand of lawrence in both her own     chapter xxxii   the marriage of junius keswick and roberta march was appointed for the fifteenth of january and mr brandon had arranged to be in new york a few days before the event he intended however to leave midbranch soon after the first of the year and to spend a week with some of his friends in richmond  it was on the afternoon of new years day and mr brandon was sitting in his library with colonel pinckney macon an elderly gentleman of social habits and genial temper whom mr brandon had invited to midbranch to spend the holidays and who was afterwards to be his travelling companion as far as richmond the two had had a very good dinner and were now sitting before the fire smoking their pipes and paying occasional attention to two tumblers of eggnogg which stood on a small table between them they were telling anecdotes of olden times and were in very good humor indeed when a servant came in with a note which had just been brought for mr brandon the old gentleman took the missive and put on his eyeglasses but the moment he read the address he let his hand fall on his knee and gave vent to an angry ejaculation  its from that rabid old witch the widow keswick he exclaimed ive a great mind to throw it into the fire without reading it  dont do that cried colonel macon it is a new year present she is sending you read it sir read it by all means  mr brandon had given his friend an account of his unexampled and astounding persecutions by the widow keswick and the old colonel had been much interested thereby and it would have greatly grieved his soul not to become acquainted with this new feature of the affair read it sir he cried i would like to know what sort of new year congratulations she offers you  congratulations indeed said mr brandon you neednt expect anything of that kind but he opened the note and turning so that he could get a good light upon it began to read aloud as follows  my dearest robert  confound it sir exclaimed the reader did you ever hear of such a piece of impertinence as that  colonel pinckney macon leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud it is impertinent he cried but its confoundedly jolly go on sir go on i beg of you  mr brandon continued  it is not for me to suggest anything of the kind but i write this note simply to ask you what you would think of a triple wedding there would certainly be something very touching about it and it would be very satisfactory and comforting i am sure to our nieces and their husbands to know that they were not leaving either of us to a lonely life would we not make three happy pairs dear robert remember i do not propose this i only lay it before your kindly and affectionate heart  your own  martha ann keswick   colonel macon who with much difficulty and redness of face had restrained himself during the reading of this note now burst into a shout of laughter while mr brandon sprang to his feet and crumpling the note in his hand threw it into the fire and then turning around he exclaimed did the world ever hear anything like that triple wedding indeed does the pestiferous old shrew imagine that anything in this world would induce me to marry her  why my dear sir cried colonel macon of course she dont i know the widow keswick as well as you do she wouldnt marry you to save your soul sir all she wants to do is to worry and persecute you and to torment your senses out of you in revenge for your having got the better of her now take my advice sir and dont let her do it  id like to know how i am going to hinder her said mr brandon  hinder her exclaimed colonel macon nothing easier in this world sir just you turn right square round and face her sir and youll see that shell stop short sir and whats more shell run sir  how am i to face her asked mr brandon i have faced her and i assure you sir she didnt run  that was because you did not go to work in the right way said the colonel now if i were in your place sir this is what i would do id turn on her and id scare her out of all the wits she has left id say to her madam i think your proposition is an excellent one i am ready to marry you today or at the very latest tomorrow morning ill come to your house and bring a clergyman and some of my friends dont let there be the least delay for i desire to start immediately for new york and to take you with me now sir a note like that would frighten that old woman so that she would leave her house and wouldnt come back for six weeks and the letter you have just burned would be the last attack she would make on you now sir that is what i would do if i were in your place  mr brandon sat down drained his tumbler of eggnogg and began to think of what his friend had said and as he thought of it the conviction forced itself upon him that this idea of colonel macons was a good one in fact a splendid one now that he came to look upon the matter more clearly than he had done before he saw that this persecution on the part of the widow keswick was not only base but cowardly he had been entirely too yielding had given way too much yes he would face her by george that was a royal idea he would turn round and make a dash at her and scare her out of her five senses  pens ink and paper were brought out more eggnogg was ordered and mr brandon aided and abetted by colonel macon wrote a letter to mrs keswick  this letter took a long time to write and was very carefully constructed with outstretched hands mr brandon met the old lady on the very threshold of her proposition he stated that nothing would please him better than an immediate wedding and that he would have proposed it himself had he not feared that the lady would consider him too importunate this expression was suggested by colonel macon in order that they might lose no time in making themselves happy mr brandon proposed that the marriage should take place in a week and that the ceremony should be performed in richmond the colonel wished him to say that he would immediately go to her house for the purpose but mr brandon would not consent to write this he was afraid that the widow would sit at her front door with a shotgun and wait for him and that some damage might thereby come to an unwary neighbor each of them had many old friends in richmond and it would be very pleasant to be married there he intended to start for that city in a day or two and he would be rejoiced to meet her at eleven oclock on the morning of the fifth instant in the corridor or covered bridge connecting the exchange and ballard hotels and there arrange all the details for an immediate marriage the letter closed with an earnest hope that she would accede to this proposed plan which would so soon make them the happiest couple upon earth and was signed your devoted robert  by which i mean said mr brandon that i am devoted to her destruction  the letter was read over by colonel macon and highly approved by him if you had met that woman sir when she first came to you he said to mr brandon with the spirit that is shown in this letter you would have put a shiver through her sir that would have shaken the bones out of her umbrella and she would have cut and run sir before you knew it  the messenger from howletts was kept at midbranch all night and the next morning he was sent back with mr brandons note two days afterward colonel macon and mr brandon started for richmond and in the course of a few hours they were comfortably sipping their peach and honey at the exchange and ballards  the next day was most enjoyably spent with a number of old friends and in reminiscences of the past war and in discussions of the coming political campaign mr brandon had thrown off every sign of the annoyance and persecution to which he had lately been subjected  by george sir said colonel macon to him the next morning do you know that you are a most untrustworthy and perfidious man  sir exclaimed mr brandon what do you mean  i mean replied colonel pinckney macon with much dignity that you promised at eleven oclock today to meet a lady in the corridor connecting these two hotels it wants three minutes of that time now sir and here you are reading the dispatch as if you never made a promise in your life  i declare said mr brandon rising my conduct is indefensible but i am going to my room and on my way will keep my part of the contract  i will go with you said the colonel  together they mounted the stairs and approached the corridor and as they opened its glass doors they saw sitting in a chair on one side of the passage the widow keswick  if mr brandon had not been caught by his friend he would have fallen over backwards regaining an upright position he made a frantic turn as if he would fly but he was not quick enough mrs keswick had him by the arm  robert she exclaimed i knew how true and faithful you would be it has just struck eleven how do you do colonel macon and she extended her hand  there was no one in the corridor at the time but these three but the place was much used as a passageway and colonel macon who was very pale but still retained his presence of mind knew well that if any one were to come along at this moment it would be decidedly unpleasant not only for his friend but himself i am glad to meet you again mrs keswick he said let us go into one of the parlors it will be more comfortable  how kind murmured mrs keswick as she clung to the arm of mr brandon for you to bring our good friend colonel macon  they went into a parlor which was empty and where they were not likely to be disturbed mr brandon walked there without saying a word his face was as pallid as its wellseasoned color would allow and he looked straight before him with an air which seemed to indicate that he was trying to remember something terrible or else trying to forget it and that he himself did not know which it was  colonel macon did not stay long in the parlor there was that in the air of mrs keswick which made him understand that there were other places in richmond where he would be much more welcome than in that room he went down into the large hall where the gentlemen generally congregate and there in great distress of mind he paced up and down the marble floor exchanging nothing but the briefest salutations and answers with the acquaintances he occasionally encountered the clerk behind his desk at one side of the hall had seen men walking up and down in that way and he thought that the colonel had probably been speculating in tobacco or wheat but he knew he was good for the amount of his bill and he retained his placidity  in about half an hour there came down the stairs at one end of the hall an elderly person who somewhat resembled mr brandon of midbranch the clothes and the hat were the same that that gentleman wore and the same heavy gold chain with dangling sealrings hung across his ample waistcoat but there was a general air of haggardness and stoop about him which did not in the least suggest the upright and portly gentleman who had written his name in the hotel register the day before yesterday  colonel macon made five strides towards him and seized his hand what said he how  mr brandon did not look at him he let his eyes fall where they chose it mattered not to him what they gazed upon and in a low voice he said it is all over  over repeated the colonel  mr brandon put a feeble hand on his friends arm and together they walked into the reading room where they sat down in a corner  have you settled it then asked colonel macon with great anxiety is she gone  it is settled said mr brandon we are to be married  married cried colonel macon springing to his feet great heavens man what do you mean  not very fluently and in sentences with a very few words in each of them but words that sank like hot coals into the soul of his hearer mr brandon explained what he meant it had been of no use he said to try to get out of it the old woman had him with the grip of a vise that letter had done it all he ought to have known that she was not to be frightened but it was needless to talk about that it was all over now and he was as much bound to her as if he had promised before a magistrate  but you dont mean to say exclaimed the colonel in a voice of anguish that you are really going to marry her  sir said mr brandon solemnly there is no way to get out of it if you think there is you dont know the woman  i would have died first said the colonel i never would have submitted to her  i did not submit replied mr brandon that was done when the letter was written i roused myself and i said everything i could say but it was all useless she held me to my promise i told her i would fly to the ends of the earth rather than marry her and then sir she threatened me with a prosecution for breach of promise and think of the disgrace that that would bring upon me upon my family name and on my niece and her young husband it was a mistake sir to suppose that she merely wished to persecute me she wished to marry me and she is going to do it  the colonel bowed his face upon his hands and groaned mr brandon looked at him with a dim compassion in his eyes do not reproach yourself sir he said we thought we were acting for the best  but little more was said and two crushed old gentlemen retired to their rooms  in the days of her youth mrs keswick had been very well known in richmond and there were a good many elderly ladies and gentlemen now living in that city who remembered her as a handsome sparkling and somewhat eccentric young woman and who had since heard of her as a decidedly eccentric old one mr brandon also had a large circle of friends and acquaintances in the city and when it became known that these two elderly persons were to be marriedand the news began to spread shortly after mrs keswick reached the house of the friend with whom she was stayingit excited a great deal of excusable interest  mrs keswick according to her ordinary methods of action took all the arrangements into her own hands she appointed the wedding for the eighth of january in order that the happy pair might go to new york and be present at the nuptials of junius and roberta mr brandon had thought of writing to junius in the hope that the young man might do something to avert his fate but remembering how utterly unable junius had always been to move his aunt one inch this way or that he did not believe that he could be of any service in this case in which all the energies of her mind were evidently engaged and he readily consented that she should attend to all the correspondence it would indeed have been too hard for him to break the direful truth to his niece and junius he ventured to suggest that miss peyton be sent for having a faint hope that he might in some manner lean upon her but mrs keswick informed him that her niece must stay at home to take charge of the place there were two women in the house who were busy sewing for her and it would be impossible for her to come to richmond  her correspondence kept the widow keswick very busy she decided that she would be married in a church which she used to attend in her youth and to all of her old friends and to all those of mr brandon whose names she could learn by diligent inquiry invitations were sent to attend the ceremony but no one outside of richmond was invited  the old lady did not come to the city with a purple sunbonnet and a big umbrella she wore her best bonnet which had been used for churchgoing purposes for many years and arrayed herself in a travelling suit which was of excellent material although of most antiquated fashion she discussed very freely with her friends the arrangements she had made and protuberant candor being at times one of her most noticeable characteristics she did not leave it altogether to others to say that the match she was about to make was a most remarkably good one for years it had been a hard struggle for her to keep up the keswick farm but now she had fought a battle and won a victory which ought to make her comfortable and satisfied for the rest of her life if mr brandons family had taken a great deal from her she would more than repay herself by appropriating the old gentleman together with his possessions  after the depression following the first shock mr brandon endeavored to stiffen himself there was a great deal of pride in him and if he was obliged to go to the altar he did not wish his old friends to suppose that he was going there to be sacrificed he had brought this dreadful thing upon himself but he would try to stand up like a man and bear it and after all it might not be for long the widow keswick was a good deal older than he was other thoughts occasionally came to comfort him she could not make him continually live with her and he had plans for visits to richmond and even to new york and better than that she might want to spend a good deal of time at her own farm  for the sake of my name and my niece he said to himself i must bear it like a man  and in answer to an earnest adjuration colonel pinckney macon solemnly promised that he would never reveal to man or woman that his friend did not marry the widow keswick entirely of his own wish and accord  it was the desire of mrs keswick that the marriage although conducted in church should be very simple in its arrangements there would be no bridesmaids or groomsmen no flowers no breakfast and the couple would be dressed in travelling costume the friends of the old lady persuaded her to make considerable changes in her attire and a costume was speedily prepared which while it suggested the fashions of the present day was also calculated to recall reminiscences of those of a quarter of a century ago this simplicity was the only thing connected with the affair which satisfied mr brandon and he would have been glad to have the marriage entirely private with no more witnesses than the law demanded but to this mrs keswick would not consent she wanted to have her former friends about her accordingly the church was pretty well filled with old colonels old majors old generals and old judges with their wives and their sisters and in a few cases their daughters all the elderly people in richmond who in the days of their youth had known the gay miss matty pettigrew and the handsome bob brandon felt a certain rejuvenation of spirit as they went to the wedding of the couple who had once been these two  the old lady looked full of life and vigor and despite the circumstances mr brandon preserved a good deal of his usual manly deportment but when in the course of the marriage service the clergyman came to the question in which the bridegroom was asked if he would have this woman to be his wedded wife to love and keep her for the rest of their lives the answer i will came forth in a feeble tone which was not wholly divested of a tinge of despondency  with the lady it was quite otherwise when the like question was put to her she stepped back and in a loud clear voice exclaimed not i marry that man there she continued in a higher tone and pointing her finger at the astounded mr brandon not for the world sir before he was born his family defrauded and despoiled my people and as soon as he took affairs into his own hands he continued the villainous law robberies until we are poor and he is rich and not content with that he basely wrecks and destroys the plans i had made for the comfort of my old age in order that his paltry purposes may be carried out after all that does anybody here suppose that i would take him for a husband marry him not i and with these words the old lady turned her back on the clergyman and walked rapidly down the centre aisle until she reached the church door there she stopped and turning towards the stupefied assemblage she snapped her bony fingers in the air and exclaimed now mr robert brandon of midbranch our account is balanced  she then went out of the door and took a street car for the train that would carry her to her home   the end
