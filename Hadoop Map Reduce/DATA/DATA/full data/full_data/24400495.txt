      fish nor beast nor bird     till i came to a hill clothed in flowers to its summit       then shrill small voices i heard      and i saw from concealment a company of elffolk       with faces strangely fair     talking their unearthly scattered talk together       a bind of greengrasses in their hair      marvellously gentle feater far than children       in gesture mien and speech

  o three tall footsore men of rags       which walking this gold morn i see     what will ye give me from your bags         for fairy kisses three      the first that was a reddish man       out of

    instead of groat a white lily         with seven blooms thereon      and each fair cup was deep with wine       such was the changelings charity     the sweet feast was enough for nine         but not too much for three      o toothsome meat in jelly froze       o tender haunch of elfin stag     o rich the odour that arose         o plump with scraps each bag      there in the daybreak gold and wild       each merryhearted beggar man     drank deep unto the fairy child         and blessed the good st ann     the stranger       in the nook of a wood where a pool freshed with dew     glassed

shine     lips like wax and cheeks like wine     as saucy and winsome a thing to see     as are linden buds on a linden tree      stockstill in the doorway stood simple sam     aducking his head with

her voice rang sweet     and the nightwind sighed at the sound of it     he frownedglanced back at the empty grate     and shook very slowly his grey old pate     three wishes my dear why i scarcely

ax for a fat goose to fry in the oven      and lo and forsooth as the words he was uttering     a rich puff of air set his candle aguttering     and there rose in the kitchen a sizzling and sputtering     with a crackling of sparks and of flames a great fluttering     andof which here could not be two opinions     a smokinghot savour of sage and onions     beam wall and flagstones the kitchen was lit     every dark corner and cranny of it     with the blaze from the hearthstone copper and brass     winked back the winking of platter and glass     and a wonderful squeaking of mice went up     at the smell of a michaelmas supper to sup     unctuous odours that wreathed and swirled     whereer frisked a whisker or mousetail twirled     while out of the chimney up into the night     that neertobesnuffedtoomuch smoke took flight     thats one says the fairy finger on thumb     so now mister sam theres but two to come     she leaned her head sidelong she lifted her chin     with a twinkling of eye from the radiance within     poor sam stood astounded he says says he     i wish my old mother was back with me     for if there was one thing she couldnt refuse     twas a sweet thick slice from the breast of a goose     but his cheek grew stiff and his eyes stared bright     for there on her stick pushing out of the night     taptapping along herself and no other     came who but the shape of his dear old mother     straight into the kitchen she hastened and went     her breath coming quick as if all but spent     why sam says she the bird be turning     for my nose tells i that the skins aburning     and down at the oven the ghost of her sat     and basted the goose with the boiling fat      oho cries the fairy sweet and small     another wish gone will leave

well he says im unspeakable glad     butit baint quite the same as when i was a lad     theres joy and theres joy maam but to tell ee the truth     theres none can compare with the joy of ones youth

nowhere came      empty the dark in the candleflame      and there stood our sam about four foot high     snub nose shock hair and round blue eye     breeches and braces and coat of him too     shirt on his back and each clodhopping shoe     had shrunk to a nicetybutton and hem     to fit the small sammie tucked up into them      there was his mother too smooth dear cheek     lips as smooth as a

be     and therewith a bumpity tail to wag     sat laughing with tongue out their old dog shag     to clatter of patter bones giblets and juice     between them they ate up the whole of the goose      but time is a river for ever in flow     the weeks went by as the weeks must go     soon fiftytwo to a year did grow     the long years passed one after another     making older and older our sam and his mother     and alas and alack with nine of them gone     poor shag lay asleep again under a stone     and a sorrowful dread would sometimes creep     into sams dreams as he lay asleep     that his mother was lost and away hed fare     calling her calling her everywhere     in dark in rain by roads unknown     under echoing hills and alone alone     what bliss in the morning to wake and see     the sun shining green in the linden tree     and out of that dreams dark shadowiness     to slip in on his mother and give her a kiss     and go whistling off in the dew to hear     the thrushes all mocking him sweet and clear      still moon after moon from heaven above     shone on mother and son and made light of love     her roses faded her pretty brown hair     had sorrowful grey in it everywhere     and at last she died and was laid to rest     her tired hands crossed on her shrunken breast     and sam now lonely lived on and on     till most of his workaday life seemed gone      yet spring came again with its green and blue     and presently summers wild roses too     pinks sweet william and sopsinwine     blackberry lavender eglantine     and when these had blossomed and gone their way     twas apples and daisies and michaelmas day     yes spiderwebs dew and haws in the may     and seraphs singing in michaelmas day      sam worked all morning and couldnt get rest     for a kind of a feeling of grief in his breast     and yet not grief but something more     like the thought that what happens has happened before     he fed the chickens he fed the sow     on a threelegged stool sate down to the cow     with a pail twixt his legs in the green in the meadow     under the elm trees lengthening shadow     and woke at last with a smile and a sigh     to find he had milked his poor jingo dry      as dusk set in even the birds did seem     to be calling and calling from out of a dream     he chopped up kindling shut up his shed     in a bucket of wellwater soused his head     to freshen his eyes up a little and make     the drowsy old wits of him wider awake     as neat as a womanless creature is able     he swept up his hearthstone and laid the table     and then oer his platter and mug if you please     sate gloomily gooming at loaf and cheese     gooming and gooming as if the mere sight     of his victuals could satisfy appetite     and the longer and longer he looked at them     the slimmer slimmed upward his candle flame     blue in the air and when squeaked a mouse     twas loud as a trump in the hush of the house     then sudden a soft little wind puffed by     twixt the thickthatched roof and the starsown sky     and died and then     that deep dead wonderful silence again      thensoft as a rattle acounting her seeds     in the midst of a tangle of witheredup weeds     came a faint faint knocking a rustle like silk     and a breath at the keyhole as soft as milk     still as the flit of a moth and then      that infinitesimal knocking again      sam lifted his chin from his fists he listened     his wandering eyes in the candle glistened     then slowly slowly rolled round by degrees     and there sat a mouse

gold beam across the green world       faltered and failed as he     remembered his solitude and the dark nights       inhospitality      and he looked upon the witch with eyes of sorrow       in the darkening of the day     and turned him aside into oblivion       and the voices died away      and the witch stepped down from her casement       in the hush of night he heard     the calling and wailing in dewy thicket       of bird to hidden bird      and gloom stole all her burning crimson       remote and faint in space     as stars in gathering shadow of the evening       seemed now her phantom face      and one nights rest shall be a myriad       midst dreams that come and go     till heedless fate unmoved by weakness bring him       this same strange byway through      to the beauty of earth that fades in ashes       the lips of welcome and the eyes     more beauteous than the feeble shine of hesper       lone in the lightening skies      till once again the witchs guile

by seven poplartrees against the suns bright face      she looks to left she looks to right and in the midst she sees     a little pool of water clear and frozen neath the trees     then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels     and hears a magic belfry aringing with sweet bells  illustration      clear sang the faint far merry peal then silence on the air     and icystill the

ring     all muffled up in brindled shawls do caper frisk and spring     a witch and witches one and nine they straight to her reply     and looked upon her narrowly with green and needle eye      then lucy sees in clouds of gold green cherry trees upgrow     and bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow     she smells all faint the almondboughs blowing so wild and fair     and doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air      clear flowers she sees like tulip buds go floating by like birds     with wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words     and as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung     and clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung      o witches nine ye dreadful nine o witches seven and three     whence come these wondrous
