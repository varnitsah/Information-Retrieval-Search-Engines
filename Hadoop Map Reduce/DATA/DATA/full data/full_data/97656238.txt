years were gone       with the old world to the grave     i was a king in babylon       and you were a christian slave      we henley  his name was charlie mears he was the only son of his mother who was a widow and he lived in the north of london coming into the city every day to work in a bank he was twenty years old and suffered from aspirations i met him in a public billiardsaloon where the marker called him by his given name and he called the marker bullseyes charlie explained a little nervously that he had only come to the place to look on and since looking on at games of skill is not a cheap amusement for the young i suggested that charlie should go back to his mother  that was our first step toward better acquaintance he would call on me sometimes in the evenings instead of running about london with his fellowclerks and before long speaking of himself as a young man must he told me of his aspirations which were all literary he desired to make himself an undying name chiefly through verse though he was not above sending stories of love and death to the dropapennyintheslot journals it was my fate to sit still while charlie read me poems of many hundred lines and bulky fragments of plays that would surely shake the world my reward was his unreserved confidence and the selfrevelations and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as those of a maiden charlie had never fallen in love but was anxious to do so on the first opportunity he believed in all things good and all things honorable but at the same time was curiously careful to let me see that he knew his way about the world as befitted a bank clerk on twentyfive shillings a week he rhymed dove with love and moon with june and devoutly believed that they had never so been rhymed before the long lame gaps in his plays he filled up with hasty words of apology and description and swept on seeing all that he intended to do so clearly that he esteemed it already done and turned to me for applause  i fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations and i know that his writingtable at home was the edge of his washstand this he told me almost at the outset of our acquaintance when he was ravaging my bookshelves and a little before i was implored to speak the truth as to his chances of writing something really great you know maybe i encouraged him too much for one night he called on me his eyes flaming with excitement and said breathlessly  do you mindcan you let me stay here and write all this evening i wont interrupt you i wont really theres no place for me to write in at my mothers  whats the trouble i said knowing well what that trouble was  ive a notion in my head that would make the most splendid story that was ever written do let me write it out here its such a notion  there was no resisting the appeal i set him a table he hardly thanked me but plunged into the work at once for half an hour the pen scratched without stopping then charlie sighed and tugged his hair the scratching grew slower there were more erasures and at last ceased the finest story in the world would not come forth  it looks such awful rot now he said mournfully and yet it seemed so good when i was thinking about it whats wrong  i could not dishearten him by saying the truth so i answered perhaps you dont feel in the mood for writing  yes i doexcept when i look at this stuff ugh  read me what youve done i said  he read and it was wondrous bad and he paused at all the specially turgid sentences expecting a little approval for he was proud of those sentences as i knew he would be  it needs compression i suggested cautiously  i hate cutting my things down i dont think you could alter a word here without spoiling the sense it reads better aloud than when i was writing it  charlie youre suffering from an alarming disease afflicting a numerous class put the thing by and tackle it again in a week  i want to do it at once what do you think of it  how can i judge from a halfwritten tale tell me the story as it lies in your head  charlie told and in the telling there was everything that his ignorance had so carefully prevented from escaping into the written word i looked at him and wondering whether it were possible that he did not know the originality the power of the notion that had come in his way it was distinctly a notion among notions men had been puffed up with pride by notions not a tithe as excellent and practicable but charlie babbled on serenely interrupting the current of pure fancy with samples of horrible sentences that he purposed to use i heard him out to the end it would be folly to allow his idea to remain in his own inept hands when i could do so much with it not all that could be done indeed but oh so much  what do you think he said at last i fancy i shall call it the story of a ship  i think the ideas pretty good but you wont be able to handle it for ever so long now i  would it be of any use to you would you care to take it i should be proud said charlie promptly  there are few things sweeter in this world than the guileless hotheaded intemperate open admiration of a junior even a woman in her blindest devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores tilt her bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat or interlard her speech with his pet oaths and charlie did all these things still it was necessary to salve my conscience before i possessed myself of charlies thoughts  lets make a bargain ill give you a fiver for the notion i said  charlie became a bankclerk at once  oh thats impossible between two pals you know if i may call you so and speaking as a man of the world i couldnt take the notion if its any use to you ive heaps more  he hadnone knew this better than ibut they were the notions of other men  look at it as a matter of businessbetween men of the world i returned five pounds will buy you any number of poetrybooks business is business and you may be sure i shouldnt give that price unless  oh if you put it that way said charlie visibly moved by the thought of the books the bargain was clinched with an agreement that he should at unstated intervals come to me with all the notions that he possessed should have a table of his own to write at and unquestioned right to inflict upon me all his poems and fragments of poems then i said now tell me how you came by this idea  it came by itself charlies eyes opened a little  yes but you told me a great deal about the hero that you must have read before somewhere  i havent any time for reading except when you let me sit here and on sundays im on my bicycle or down the river all day theres nothing wrong about the hero is there  tell me again and i shall understand clearly you say that your hero went pirating how did he live  he was on the lower deck of this shipthing that i was telling you about  what sort of ship  it was the kind rowed with oars and the sea spurts through the oarholes and the men row sitting up to their knees in water then theres a bench running down between the two lines of oars and an overseer with a whip walks up and down the bench to make the men work  how do you know that  its in the tale theres a rope running overhead looped to the upper deck for the overseer to catch hold of when the ship rolls when the overseer misses the rope once and falls among the rowers remember the hero laughs at him and gets licked for it hes chained to his oar of coursethe hero  how is he chained  with an iron band round his waist fixed to the bench he sits on and a sort of handcuff on his left wrist chaining him to the oar hes on the lower deck where the worst men are sent and the only light comes from the hatchways and through the oarholes cant you imagine the sunlight just squeezing through between the handle and the hole and wobbling about as the ship moves  i can but i cant imagine your imagining it  how could it be any other way now you listen to me the long oars on the upper deck are managed by four men to each bench the lower ones by three and the lowest of all by two remember its quite dark on the lowest deck and all the men there go mad when a man dies at his oar on that deck he isnt thrown overboard but cut up in his chains and stuffed through the oarhole in little pieces  why i demanded amazed not so much at the information as the tone of command in which it was flung out  to save trouble and to frighten the others it needs two overseers to drag a mans body up to the top deck and if the men at the lower deck oars were left alone of course theyd stop rowing and try to pull up the benches by all standing up together in their chains  youve a most provident imagination where have you been reading about galleys and galleyslaves  nowhere that i remember i row a little when i get the chance but perhaps if you say so i may have read something  he went away shortly afterward to deal with booksellers and i wondered how a bank clerk aged twenty could put into my hands with a profligate abundance of detail all given with absolute assurance the story of extravagant and bloodthirsty adventure riot piracy and death in unnamed seas he had led his hero a desperate dance through revolt against the overseers to command of a ship of his own and ultimate establishment of a kingdom on an island somewhere in the sea you know and delighted with my paltry five pounds had gone out to buy the notions of other men that these might teach him how to write i had the consolation of knowing that this notion was mine by right of purchase and i thought that i could make something of it  when next he came to me he was drunkroyally drunk on many poets for the first time revealed to him his pupils were dilated his words tumbled over each other and he wrapped himself in quotations most of all was he drunk with longfellow  isnt it splendid isnt it superb he cried after hasty greetings listen to this    wouldst thouso the helmsman answered      know the secret of the sea    only those who brave its dangers      comprehend its mystery  by gum    only those who brave its dangers      comprehend its mystery  he repeated twenty times walking up and down the room and forgetting me but i can understand it too he said to himself i dont know how to thank you for that fiver and this listen    i remember the black wharves and the ships      and the seatides tossing free    and the spanish sailors with bearded lips    and the beauty and mystery of the ships      and the magic of the sea  i havent braved any dangers but i feel as if i knew all about it  you certainly seem to have a grip of the sea have you ever seen it  when i was a little chap i went to brighton once we used to live in coventry though before we came to london i never saw it    when descends on the atlantic    the gigantic    stormwind of the equinox  he shook me by the shoulder to make me understand the passion that was shaking himself  when that storm comes he continued i think that all the oars in the ship that i was talking about get broken and the rowers have their chests smashed in by the bucking oarheads by the way have you done anything with that notion of mine yet  no i was waiting to hear more of it from you tell me how in the world youre so certain about the fittings of the ship you know nothing of ships  i dont know its as real as anything to me until i try to write it down i was thinking about it only last night in bed after you had loaned me treasure island and i made up a whole lot of new things to go into the story  what sort of things  about the food the men ate rotten figs and black beans and wine in a skin bag passed from bench to bench  was the ship built so long ago as that  as what i dont know whether it was long ago or not its only a notion but sometimes it seems just as real as if it was true do i bother you with talking about it  not in the least did you make up anything else  yes but its nonsense charlie flushed a little  never mind lets hear about it  well i was thinking over the story and after awhile i got out of bed and wrote down on a piece of paper the sort of stuff the men might be supposed to scratch on their oars with the edges of their handcuffs it seemed to make the thing more lifelike it is so real to me yknow  have you the paper on you  yees but whats the use of showing it its only a lot of scratches all the same we might have em reproduced in the book on the front page  ill attend to those details show me what your men wrote  he pulled out of his pocket a sheet of notepaper with a single line of scratches upon it and i put this carefully away  what is it supposed to mean in english i said  oh i dont know perhaps it means im beastly tired its great nonsense he repeated but all those men in the ship seem as real as people to me do do something to the notion soon i should like to see it written and printed  but all youve told me would make a long book  make it then youve only to sit down and write it out  give me a little time have you any more notions  not just now im reading all the books ive bought theyre splendid  when he had left i looked at the sheet of notepaper with the inscription upon it then i took my head tenderly between both hands to make certain that it was not coming off or turning round then  but there seemed to be no interval between quitting my rooms and finding myself arguing with a policeman outside a door marked private in a corridor of the british museum all i demanded as politely as possible was the greek antiquity man the policeman knew nothing except the rules of the museum and it became necessary to forage through all the houses and offices inside the gates an elderly gentleman called away from his lunch put an end to my search by holding the notepaper between finger and thumb and sniffing at it scornfully  what does this mean hmm said he so far as i can ascertain it is an attempt to write extremely corrupt greek on the parthere he glared at me with intentionof an extremely illiterateahperson he read slowly from the paper pollock erckmann tauchnitz hennikerfour names familiar to me  can you tell me what the corruption is supposed to meanthe gist of the thing i asked  i have beenmany timesovercome with weariness in this particular employment that is the meaning he returned me the paper and i fled without a word of thanks explanation or apology  i might have been excused for forgetting much to me of all men had been given the chance to write the most marvelous tale in the world nothing less than the story of a greek galleyslave as told by himself small wonder that his dreaming had seemed real to charlie the fates that are so careful to shut the doors of each successive life behind us had in this case been neglectful and charlie was looking though that he did not know where never man had been permitted to look with full knowledge since time began above all he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to me for five pounds and he would retain that ignorance for bankclerks do not understand metempsychosis and a sound commercial education does not include greek he would supply mehere i capered among the dumb gods of egypt and laughed in their battered faceswith material to make my tale sureso sure that the world would hail it as an impudent and vamped fiction and ii alone would know that it was absolutely and literally true ii alone held this jewel to my hand for the cutting and polishing therefore i danced again among the gods till a policeman saw me and took steps in my direction  it remained now only to encourage charlie to talk and here there was no difficulty but i had forgotten those accursed books of poetry he came to me time after time as useless as a surcharged phonographdrunk on byron shelley or keats knowing now what the boy had been in his past lives and desperately anxious not to lose one word of his babble i could not hide from him my respect and interest he misconstrued both into respect for the present soul of charlie mears to whom life was as new as it was to adam and interest in his readings and stretched my patience to breaking point by reciting poetrynot his own now but that of others i wished every english poet blotted out of the memory of mankind i blasphemed the mightiest names of song because they had drawn charlie from the path of direct narrative and would later spur him to imitate them but i choked down my impatience until the first flood of enthusiasm should have spent itself and the boy returned to his dreams  whats the use of my telling you what i think when these chaps wrote things for the angels to read he growled one evening why dont you write something like theirs  i dont think youre treating me quite fairly i said speaking under strong restraint  ive given you the story he said shortly replunging into lara  but i want the details  the things i make up about that damned ship that you call a galley theyre quite easy you can just make em up yourself turn up the gas a little i want to go on reading  i could have broken the gas globe over his head for his amazing stupidity i could indeed make up things for myself did i only know what charlie did not know that he knew but since the doors were shut behind me i could only wait his youthful pleasure and strive to keep him in good temper one minutes want of guard might spoil a priceless revelation now and again he would toss his books asidehe kept them in my rooms for his mother would have been shocked at the waste of good money had she seen themand launched into his sea dreams again i cursed all the poets of england the plastic mind of the bankclerk had been overlaid colored and distorted by that which he had read and the result as delivered was a confused tangle of other voices most like the muttered song through a city telephone in the busiest part of the day  he talked of the galleyhis own galley had he but known itwith illustrations borrowed from the bride of abydos he pointed the experiences of his hero with quotations from the corsair and threw in deep and desperate moral reflections from cain and manfred expecting me to use them all only when the talk turned on longfellow were the jarring crosscurrents dumb and i knew that charlie was speaking the truth as he remembered it  what do you think of this i said one evening as soon as i understood the medium in which his memory worked best and before he could expostulate read him the whole of the saga of king olaf  he listened openmouthed flushed his hands drumming on the back of the sofa where he lay till i came to the song of einar tamberskelver and the verse    einar then the arrow taking      from the loosened string    answered that was norway breaking      neath thy hand o king  he gasped with pure delight of sound  thats better than byron a little i ventured  better why its true how could he have known  i went back and repeated    what was that said olaf standing      on the quarterdeck    something heard i like the stranding      of a shattered wreck  how could he have known how the ships crash and the oars rip out and go zzzp all along the line why only the other night but go back please and read the skerry of shrieks again  no im tired lets talk what happened the other night  i had an awful nightmare about that galley of ours i dreamed i was drowned in a fight you see we ran alongside another ship in harbor the water was dead still except where our oars whipped it up you know where i always sit in the galley he spoke haltingly at first under a fine english fear of being laughed at  no thats news to me i answered meekly my heart beginning to beat  on the fourth oar from the bow on the right side on the upper deck there were four of us at that oar all chained i remember watching the water and trying to get my handcuffs off before the row began then we closed up on the other ship and all their fighting men jumped over our bulwarks and my bench broke and i was pinned down with the three other fellows on top of me and the big oar jammed across our backs  well charlies eyes were alive and alight he was looking at the wall behind my chair  i dont know how we fought the men were trampling all over my back and i lay low then our rowers on the left sidetied to their oars you knowbegan to yell and back water i could hear the water sizzle and we spun round like a cockchafer and i knew lying where i was that there was a galley coming up bowon to ram us on the left side i could just lift up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks we wanted to meet her bow to bow but it was too late we could only turn a little bit because the galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and stopped our moving then by gum there was a crash our left oars began to break as the other galley the moving one yknow stuck her nose into them then the lowerdeck oars shot up through the deck planking butt first and one of them jumped clean up into the air and came down again close to my head  how was that managed  the moving galleys bow was plunking them back through their own oarholes and i could hear the devil of a shindy in the decks below then her nose caught us nearly in the middle and we tilted sideways and the fellows in the righthand galley unhitched their hooks and ropes and threw things on to our upper deckarrows and hot pitch or something that stung and we went up and up and up on the left side and the right side dipped and i twisted my head round and saw the water stand still as it topped the right bulwarks and then it curled over and crashed down on the whole lot of us on the right side and i felt it hit my back and i woke  one minute charlie when the sea topped the bulwarks what did it look like i had my reasons for asking a man of my acquaintance had once gone down with a leaking ship in a still sea and had seen the waterlevel pause for an instant ere it fell on the deck  it looked just like a banjostring drawn tight and it seemed to stay there for years said charlie  exactly the other man had said it looked like a silver wire laid down along the bulwarks and i thought it was never going to break he had paid everything except the bare life for this little valueless piece of knowledge and i had traveled ten thousand weary miles to meet him and take his knowledge at second hand but charlie the bankclerk on twentyfive shillings a week he who had never been out of sight of a london omnibus knew it all it was no consolation to me that once in his lives he had been forced to die for his gains i also must have died scores of times but behind me because i could have used my knowledge the doors were shut  and then i said trying to put away the devil of envy  the funny thing was though in all the mess i didnt feel a bit astonished or frightened it seemed as if id been in a good many fights because i told my next man so when the row began but that cad of an overseer on my deck wouldnt unloose our chains and give us a chance he always said that wed all be set free after a battle but we never were we never were charlie shook his head mournfully  what a scoundrel  i should say he was he never gave us enough to eat and sometimes we were so thirsty that we used to drink saltwater i can taste that saltwater still  now tell me something about the harbor where the fight was fought  i didnt dream about that i know it was a harbor though because we were tied up to a ring on a white wall and all the face of the stone under water was covered with wood to prevent our ram getting chipped when the tide made us rock  thats curious our hero commanded the galley didnt he  didnt he just he stood by the bows and shouted like a good un he was the man who killed the overseer  but you were all drowned together charlie werent you  i cant make that fit quite he said with a puzzled look the galley must have gone down with all hands and yet i fancy that the hero went on living afterward perhaps he climbed into the attacking ship i wouldnt see that of course i was dead you know he shivered slightly and protested that he could remember no more  i did not press him further but to satisfy myself that he lay in ignorance of the workings of his own mind deliberately introduced him to mortimer collinss transmigration and gave him a sketch of the plot before he opened the pages  what rot it all is he said frankly at the end of an hour i dont understand his nonsense about the red planet mars and the king and the rest of it chuck me the longfellow again  i handed him the book and wrote out as much as i could remember of his description of the seafight appealing to him from time to time for confirmation of fact or detail he would answer without raising his eyes from the book as assuredly as though all his knowledge lay before him on the printed page i spoke under the normal key of my voice that the current might not be broken and i know that he was not aware of what he was saying for his thoughts were out on the sea with longfellow  charlie i asked when the rowers on the gallies mutinied how did they kill their overseers  tore up the benches and brained em that happened when a heavy sea was running an overseer on the lower deck slipped from the centre plank and fell among the rowers they choked him to death against the side of the ship with their chained hands quite quietly and it was too dark for the other overseer to see what had happened when he asked he was pulled down too and choked and the lower deck fought their way up deck by deck with the pieces of the broken benches banging behind em how they howled  and what happened after that  i dont know the hero went awayred hair and red beard and all that was after he had captured our galley i think  the sound of my voice irritated him and he motioned slightly with his left hand as a man does when interruption jars  you never told me he was redheaded before or that he captured your galley i said after a discreet interval  charlie did not raise his eyes  he was as red as a red bear said he abstractedly he came from the north they said so in the galley when he looked for rowersnot slaves but free men afterwardyears and years afterwardnews came from another ship or else he came back  his lips moved in silence he was rapturously retasting some poem before him  where had he been then i was almost whispering that the sentence might come gentle to whichever section of charlies brain was working on my behalf  to the beachesthe long and wonderful beaches was the reply after a minute of silence  to furdurstrandi i asked tingling from head to foot  yes to furdurstrandi he pronounced the word in a new fashion and i too sawthe voice failed  do you know what you have said i shouted incautiously  he lifted his eyes fully roused now no he snapped i wish youd let a chap go on reading hark to this    but othere the old sea captain    he neither paused nor stirred      till the king listened and then      once more took up his pen    and wrote down every word    and to the king of the saxons    in witness of the truth      raising his noble head      he stretched his brown hand and said    behold this walrus tooth  by jove what chaps those must have been to go sailing all over the shop never knowing where theyd fetch the land hah  charlie i pleaded if youll only be sensible for a minute or two ill make our hero in our tale every inch as good as othere  umph longfellow wrote that poem i dont care about writing things any more i want to read he was thoroughly out of tune now and raging over my own illluck i left him  conceive yourself at the door of the worlds treasurehouse guarded by a childan idle irresponsible child playing knuckleboneson whose favor depends the gift of the key and you will imagine one half my torment till that evening charlie had spoken nothing that might not lie within the experiences of a greek galleyslave but now or there was no virtue in books he had talked of some desperate adventure of the vikings of thorfin karlsefnes sailing to wineland which is america in the ninth or tenth century the battle in the harbor he had seen and his own death he had described but this was a much more startling plunge into the past was it possible that he had skipped half a dozen lives and was then dimly remembering some episode of a thousand years later it was a maddening jumble and the worst of it was that charlie mears in his normal condition was the last person in the world to clear it up i could only wait and watch but i went to bed that night full of the wildest imaginings there was nothing that was not possible if charlies detestable memory only held good  i might rewrite the saga of thorfin karlsefne as it had never been written before might tell the story of the first discovery of america myself the discoverer but i was entirely at charlies mercy and so long as there was a threeandsixpenny bohn volume within his reach charlie would not tell i dared not curse him openly i hardly dared jog his memory for i was dealing with the experiences of a thousand years ago told through the mouth of a boy of today and a boy of today is affected by every change of tone and gust of opinion so that he lies even when he desires to speak the truth  i saw no more of him for nearly a week when next i met him it was in gracechurch street with a billhook chained to his waist business took him over london bridge and i accompanied him he was very full of the importance of that book and magnified it as we passed over the thames we paused to look at a steamer unloading great slabs of white and brown marble a barge drifted under the steamers stern and a lonely cow in that barge bellowed charlies face changed from the face of the bankclerk to that of an unknown andthough he would not have believed thisa much shrewder man he flung out his arm across the parapet of the bridge and laughing very loudly said  when they heard our bulls bellow the skroelings ran away  i waited only for an instant but the barge and the cow had disappeared under the bows of the steamer before i answered  charlie what do you suppose are skroelings  never heard of em before they sound like a new kind of seagull what a chap you are for asking questions he replied i have to go to the cashier of the omnibus company yonder will you wait for me and we can lunch somewhere together ive a notion for a poem  no thanks im off youre sure you know nothing about skroelings  not unless hes been entered for the liverpool handicap he nodded and disappeared in the crowd  now it is written in the saga of eric the red or that of thorfin karlsefne that nine hundred years ago when karlsefnes galleys came to leifs booths which leif had erected in the unknown land called markland which may or may not have been rhode island the skroelingsand the lord he knows who these may or may not have beencame to trade with the vikings and ran away because they were frightened at the bellowing of the cattle which thorfin had brought with him in the ships but what in the world could a greek slave know of that affair i wandered up and down among the streets trying to unravel the mystery and the more i considered it the more baffling it grew one thing only seemed certain and that certainty took away my breath for the moment if i came to full knowledge of anything at all it would not be one life of the soul in charlie mearss body but half a dozenhalf a dozen several and separate existences spent on blue water in the morning of the world  then i walked round the situation  obviously if i used my knowledge i should stand alone and unapproachable until all men were as wise as myself that would be something but manlike i was ungrateful it seemed bitterly unfair that charlies memory should fail me when i needed it most great powers abovei looked up at them through the fog smokedid the lords of life and death know what this meant to me nothing less than eternal fame of the best kind that comes from one and is shared by one alone i would be contentremembering clive i stood astounded at my own moderationwith the mere right to tell one story to work out one little contribution to the light literature of the day if charlie were permitted full recollection for one hourfor sixty short minutesof existences that had extended over a thousand yearsi would forego all profit and honor from all that i should make of his speech i would take no share in the commotion that would follow throughout the particular corner of the earth that calls itself the world the thing should be put forth anonymously nay i would make other men believe that they had written it they would hire bullhided selfadvertising englishmen to bellow it abroad preachers would found a fresh conduct of life upon it swearing that it was new and that they had lifted the fear of death from all mankind every orientalist in europe would patronize it discursively with sanskrit and pali texts terrible women would invent unclean variants of the mens belief for the elevation of their sisters churches and religions would war over it between the hailing and restarting of an omnibus i foresaw the scuffles that would arise among half a dozen denominations all professing the doctrine of the true metempsychosis as applied to the world and the new era and saw too the respectable english newspapers shying like frightened kine over the beautiful simplicity of the tale the mind leaped forward a hundredtwo hundreda thousand years i saw with sorrow that men would mutilate and garble the story that rival creeds would turn it upside down till at last the western world which clings to the dread of death more closely than the hope of life would set it aside as an interesting superstition and stampede after some faith so long forgotten that it seemed altogether new upon this i changed the terms of the bargain that i would make with the lords of life and death only let me know let me write the story with sure knowledge that i wrote the truth and i would burn the manuscript as a solemn sacrifice five minutes after the last line was written i would destroy it all but i must be allowed to write it with absolute certainty  there was no answer the flaming colors of an aquarium poster caught my eye and i wondered whether it would be wise or prudent to lure charlie into the hands of the professional mesmerist and whether if he were under his power he would speak of his past lives if he did and if people believed him  but charlie would be frightened and flustered or made conceited by the interviews in either case he would begin to lie through fear or vanity he was safest in my own hands  they are very funny fools your english said a voice at my elbow and turning round i recognized a casual acquaintance a young bengali law student called grish chunder whose father had sent him to england to become civilized the old man was a retired native official and on an income of five pounds a month contrived to allow his son two hundred pounds a year and the run of his teeth in a city where he could pretend to be the cadet of a royal house and tell stories of the brutal indian bureaucrats who ground the faces of the poor  grish chunder was a young fat fullbodied bengali dressed with scrupulous care in frock coat tall hat light trousers and tan gloves but i had known him in the days when the brutal indian government paid for his university education and he contributed cheap sedition to sachi durpan and intrigued with the wives of his schoolmates  that is very funny and very foolish he said nodding at the poster i am going down to the northbrook club will you come too  i walked with him for some time you are not well he said what is there in your mind you do not talk  grish chunder youve been too well educated to believe in a god havent you  oah yes here but when i go home i must conciliate popular superstition and make ceremonies of purification and my women will anoint idols  and hang up tulsi and feast the purohit and take you back into caste again and make a good khuttri of you again you advanced social freethinker and youll eat desi food and like it all from the smell in the courtyard to the mustard oil over you  i shall very much like it said grish chunder unguardedly once a hindualways a hindu but i like to know what the english think they know  ill tell you something that one englishman knows its an old tale to you  i began to tell the story of charlie in english but grish chunder put a question in the vernacular and the history went forward naturally in the tongue best suited for its telling after all it could never have been told in english grish chunder heard me nodding from time to time and then came up to my rooms where i finished the tale  beshak he said philosophically lekin darwaza band hai without doubt but the door is shut i have heard of this remembering of previous existences among my people it is of course an old tale with us but to happen to an englishmana cowfed malechhan outcast by jove that is most peculiar  outcast yourself grish chunder you eat cowbeef every day lets think the thing over the boy remembers his incarnations  does he know that said grish chunder quietly swinging his legs as he sat on my table he was speaking in english now  he does not know anything would i speak to you if he did go on  there is no going on at all if you tell that to your friends they will say you are mad and put it in the papers suppose now you prosecute for libel  lets leave that out of the question entirely is there any chance of his being made to speak  there is a chance oah yess but if he spoke it would mean that all this world would end nowinstantofall down on your head these things are not allowed you know as i said the door is shut  not a ghost of a chance  how can there be you are a christian and it is forbidden to eat in your books of the tree of life or else you would never die how shall you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that he knows i am afraid to be kicked but i am not afraid to die because i know what i know you are not afraid to be kicked but you are afraid to die if you were not by god you english would be all over the shop in an hour upsetting the balances of power and making commotions it would not be good but no fear he will remember a little and a little less and he will call it dreams then he will forget altogether when i passed my first arts examination in calcutta that was all in the crambook on wordsworth trailing clouds of glory you know  this seems to be an exception to the rule  there are no exceptions to rules some are not so hardlooking as others but they are all the same when you touch if this friend of yours said soandso and soandso indicating that he remembered all his lost lives or one piece of a lost life he would not be in the bank another hour he would be what you called sack because he was mad and they would send him to an asylum for lunatics you can see that my friend  of course i can but i wasnt thinking of him his name need never appear in the story  ah i see that story will never be written you can try  i am going to  for your own credit and for the sake of money of course  no for the sake of writing the story on my honor that will be all  even then there is no chance you cannot play with the gods it is a very pretty story now as they say let it go on thati mean at that be quick he will not last long  how do you mean  what i say he has never so far thought about a woman  hasnt he though i remembered some of charlies confidences  i mean no woman has thought about him when that comes bushogyaall up i know there are millions of women here housemaids for instance  i winced at the thought of my story being ruined by a housemaid and yet nothing was more probable  grish chunder grinned  yesalso pretty girlscousins of his house and perhaps not of his house one kiss that he gives back again and remembers will cure all this nonsense or else  or else what remember he does not know that he knows  i know that or else if nothing happens he will become immersed in the trade and the financial speculations like the rest it must be so you can see that it must be so but the woman will come first i think  there was a rap at the door and charlie charged in impetuously he had been released from office and by the look in his eyes i could see that he had come over for a long talk most probably with poems in his pockets charlies poems were very wearying but sometimes they led him to talk about the galley  grish chunder looked at him keenly for a minute  i beg your pardon charlie said uneasily i didnt know you had any one with you  i am going said grish chunder  he drew me into the lobby as he departed  that is your man he said quickly i tell you he will never speak all you wish that is rotbosh but he would be most good to make to see things suppose now we pretend that it was only playi had never seen grish chunder so excitedand pour the inkpool into his hand eh what do you think i tell you that he could see anything that a man could see let me get the ink and the camphor he is a seer and he will tell us very many things  he may be all you say but im not going to trust him to your gods and devils  it will not hurt him he will only feel a little stupid and dull when he wakes up you have seen boys look into the inkpool before  that is the reason why i am not going to see it any more youd better go grish chunder  he went declaring far down the staircase that it was throwing away my only chance of looking into the future  this left me unmoved for i was concerned for the past and no peering of hypnotized boys into mirrors and inkpools would help me to that but i recognized grish chunders point of view and sympathized with it  what a big black brute that was said charlie when i returned to him well look here ive just done a poem did it instead of playing dominoes after lunch may i read it  let me read it to myself  then you miss the proper expression besides you always make my things sound as if the rhymes were all wrong  read it aloud then youre like the rest of em  charlie mouthed me his poem and it was not much worse than the average of his verses he had been reading his books faithfully but he was not pleased when i told him that i preferred my longfellow undiluted with charlie  then we began to go through the ms line by line charlie parrying every objection and correction with  yes that may be better but you dont catch what im driving at  charles was in one way at least very like one kind of poet  there was a pencil scrawl at the back of the paper and whats that i said  oh thats not poetry at all its some rot i wrote last night before i went to bed and it was too much bother to hunt for rhymes so i made it a sort of blank verse instead  here is charlies blank verse     we pulled for you when the wind was against us and the sails were low   will you never let us go     we ate bread and onions when you took towns or ran aboard quickly when you were beaten back by the foe    the captains walked up and down the deck in fair weather singing songs but we were below    we fainted with our chins on the oars and you did not see that we were idle for we still swung to and fro   will you never let us go    the salt made the oar bandies like sharkskin our knees were cut to the bone with salt cracks our hair was stuck to our foreheads and our lips were cut to our gums and you whipped us because we could not row   will you never let us go    but in a little time we shall run out of the portholes as the water runs along the oarblade and though you tell the others to row after us you will never catch us till you catch the oarthresh and tie up the winds in the belly of the sail aho   will you never let us go  hm whats oarthresh charlie  the water washed up by the oars thats the sort of song they might sing in the galley yknow arent you ever going to finish that story and give me some of the profits  it depends on yourself if you had only told me more about your hero in the first instance it might have been finished by now youre so hazy in your notions  i only want to give you the general notion of itthe knocking about from place to place and the fighting and all that cant you fill in the rest yourself make the hero save a girl on a pirategalley and marry her or do something  youre a really helpful collaborator i suppose the hero went through some few adventures before he married  well then make him a very artful carda low sort of mana sort of political man who went about making treaties and breaking thema blackhaired chap who hid behind the mast when the fighting began  but you said the other day that he was redhaired  i couldnt have make him blackhaired of course youve no imagination  seeing that i had just discovered the entire principles upon which the halfmemory falsely called imagination is based i felt entitled to laugh but forbore for the sake of the tale  youre right youre the man with imagination a blackhaired chap in a decked ship i said  no an open shiplike a big boat  this was maddening  your ship has been built and designed closed and decked in you said so yourself i protested  no no not that ship that was open or half decked becauseby jove youre right you made me think of the hero as a redhaired chap of course if he were red the ship would be an open one with painted sails  surely i thought he would remember now that he had served in two galleys at leastin a threedecked greek one under the blackhaired political man and again in a vikings open seaserpent under the man red as a red bear who went to markland the devil prompted me to speak  why of course charlie said i  i dont know are you making fun of me  the current was broken for the time being i took up a notebook and pretended to make many entries in it  its a pleasure to work with an imaginative chap like yourself i said after a pause the way that youve brought out the character of the hero is simply wonderful  do you think so he answered with a pleased flush i often tell myself that theres more in me than my mothan people think  theres an enormous amount in you  then wont you let me send an essay on the ways of bank clerks to titbits and get the guinea prize  that wasnt exactly what i meant old fellow perhaps it would be better to wait a little and go ahead with the galleystory  ah but i shant get the credit of that titbits would publish my name and address if i win what are you grinning at they would  i know it suppose you go for a walk i want to look through my notes about our story  now this reprehensible youth who left me a little hurt and put back might for aught he or i knew have been one of the crew of the argohad been certainly slave or comrade to thorfin karlsefne therefore he was deeply interested in guinea competitions remembering what grish chunder had said i laughed aloud the lords of life and death would never allow charlie mears to speak with full knowledge of his pasts and i must even piece out what he had told me with my own poor inventions while charlie wrote of the ways of bank clerks  i got together and placed on one file all my notes and the net result was not cheering i read them a second time there was nothing that might not have been compiled at secondhand from other peoples booksexcept perhaps the story of the fight in the harbor the adventures of a viking had been written many times before the history of a greek galleyslave was no new thing and though i wrote both who could challenge or confirm the accuracy of my details i might as well tell a tale of two thousand years hence the lords of life and death were as cunning as grish chunder had hinted they would allow nothing to escape that might trouble or make easy the minds of men though i was convinced of this yet i could not leave the tale alone exaltation followed reaction not once but twenty times in the next few weeks my moods varied with the march sunlight and flying clouds by night or in the beauty of a spring morning i perceived that i could write that tale and shift continents thereby in the wet windy afternoons i saw that the tale might indeed be written but would be nothing more than a faked falsevarnished shamrusted piece of wardour street work at the end then i blessed charlie in many waysthough it was no fault of his he seemed to be busy with prize competitions and i saw less and less of him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and grew ripe to spring and the buds swelled in their sheaths he did not care to read or talk of what he had read and there was a new ring of selfassertion in his voice i hardly cared to remind him of the galley when we met but charlie alluded to it on every occasion always as a story from which money was to be made  i think i deserve twentyfive per cent dont i at least he said with beautiful frankness i supplied all the ideas didnt i  this greediness for silver was a new side in his nature i assumed that it had been developed in the city where charlie was picking up the curious nasal drawl of the underbred city man  when the things done well talk about it i cant make anything of it at present redhaired or blackhaired hero are equally difficult  he was sitting by the fire staring at the red coals i cant understand what you find so difficult its all as clear as mud to me he replied a jet of gas puffed out between the bars took light and whistled softly suppose we take the redhaired heros adventures first from the time that he came south to my galley and captured it and sailed to the beaches  i knew better now than to interrupt charlie i was out of reach of pen and paper and dared not move to get them lest i should break the current the gasjet puffed and whinnied charlies voice dropped almost to a whisper and he told a tale of the sailing of an open galley to furdurstrandi of sunsets on the open sea seen under the curve of the one sail evening after evening when the galleys beak was notched into the centre of the sinking disc and we sailed by that for we had no other guide quoth charlie he spoke of a landing on an island and explorations in its woods where the crew killed three men whom they found asleep under the pines their ghosts charlie said followed the galley swimming and choking in the water and the crew cast lots and threw one of their number overboard as a sacrifice to the strange gods whom they had offended then they ate seaweed when their provisions failed and their legs swelled and their leader the redhaired man killed two rowers who mutinied and after a year spent among the woods they set sail for their own country and a wind that never failed carried them back so safely that they all slept at night this and much more charlie told sometimes the voice fell so low that i could not catch the words though every nerve was on the strain he spoke of their leader the redhaired man as a pagan speaks of his god for it was he who cheered them and slew them impartially as he thought best for their needs and it was he who steered them for three days among floating ice each floe crowded with strange beasts that tried to sail with us said charlie and we beat them back with the handles of the oars  the gasjet went out a burned coal gave way and the fire settled down with a tiny crash to the bottom of the grate charlie ceased speaking and i said no word  by jove he said at last shaking his head ive been staring at the fire till im dizzy what was i going to say  something about the galley  i remember now its 25 per cent of the profits isnt it  its anything you like when ive done the tale  i wanted to be sure of that i must go now iveive an appointment and he left me  had my eyes not been held i might have known that that broken muttering over the fire was the swansong of charlie mears but i thought it the prelude to fuller revelation at last and at last i should cheat the lords of life and death  when next charlie came to me i received him with rapture he was nervous and embarrassed but his eyes were very full of light and his lips a little parted  ive done a poem he said and then quickly its the best ive ever done read it he thrust it into my hand and retreated to the window  i groaned inwardly it would be the work of half an hour to criticisethat is to say praisethe poem sufficiently to please charlie then i had good reason to groan for charlie discarding his favorite centipede metres had launched into shorter and choppier verse and verse with a motive at the back of it this is what i read    the day is most fair the cheery wind      halloos behind the hill    where he bends the wood as seemeth good      and the sapling to his will    riot o wind there is that in my blood      that would not have thee still    she gave me herself o earth o sky      grey sea she is mine alone    let the sullen boulders hear my cry      and rejoice tho they be but stone    mine i have won her o good brown earth      make merry tis hard on spring    make merry my love is doubly worth      all worship your fields can bring    let the hind that tills you feel my mirth      at the early harrowing  yes its the early harrowing past a doubt i said with a dread at my heart charlie smiled but did not answer    red cloud of the sunset tell it abroad      i am victor greet me o sun    dominant master and absolute lord      over the soul of one  well said charlie looking over my shoulder  i thought it far from well and very evil indeed when he silently laid a photograph on the paperthe photograph of a girl with a curly head and a foolish slack mouth  isnt itisnt it wonderful he whispered pink to the tips of his ears wrapped in the rosy mystery of first love i didnt know i didnt thinkit came like a thunderclap  yes it comes like a thunderclap are you very happy charlie  my godsheshe loves me he sat down repeating the last words to himself i looked at the hairless face the narrow shoulders already bowed by deskwork and wondered when where and how he had loved in his past lives  what will your mother say i asked cheerfully  i dont care a damn what she says  at twenty the things for which one does not care a damn should properly be many but one must not include mothers in the list i told him this gently and he described her even as adam must have described to the newly named beasts the glory and tenderness and beauty of eve incidentally i learned that she was a tobacconists assistant with a weakness for pretty dress and had told him four or five times already that she had never been kissed by a man before  charlie spoke on and on and on while i separated from him by thousands of years was considering the beginnings of things now i understood why the lords of life and death shut the doors so carefully behind us it is that we may not remember our first wooings were it not so our world would be without inhabitants in a hundred years  now about that galleystory i said still more cheerfully in a pause in the rush of the speech  charlie looked up as though he had been hit the galleywhat galley good heavens dont joke man this is serious you dont know how serious it is  grish chunder was right charlie had tasted the love of woman that kills remembrance and the finest story in the world would never be written    with the main guard     der jungere uhlanen    sit round mit open mouth    while breitmann tell dem stories    of fightin in the south    und gif dem moral

least desirable of all fortresses in india what i was doing there at that hour is a question which only concerns mgrath the sergeant of the guard and the men on the gate  slape said mulvaney is a shuparfluous necessity this gyardll shtay lively till relieved he himself was stripped to the waist learoyd on the next bedstead was dripping from the skinful of water which ortheris clad only in white trousers had just sluiced over his shoulders and a fourth private was muttering uneasily as he dozed openmouthed in the glare of the great guardlantern the heat under the bricked archway was terrifying  the worrst night that iver i remimber eyah is all hell loose this tide said mulvaney a puff of burning wind lashed through the wicketgate like a wave of the sea and ortheris swore  are ye

groaned the huge yorkshireman who was feeling the heat acutely being of fleshly build  the sleeper under the lantern roused for a moment and raised himself on his elbowdie and be damned then he said im damned and i cant die  whos that i whispered for the voice was new to me  gentleman born said mulvaney corpril wan year sargint nex redhot on his cmission but dhrinks like a fish hell be gone before the cowld weathers here so  he slipped his boot and with the naked toe just touched the trigger of his martini ortheris misunderstood the movement and the next instant the irishmans rifle was dashed aside while ortheris stood before him his eyes blazing with reproof  you said ortheris my gawd you if it was you wot would we do  kape quiet little man said mulvaney putting him aside but very gently tis not me nor will ut be me whoile dina shadds here i was but showin something  learoyd bowed on his bedstead groaned and the gentlemanranker sighed in his sleep ortheris took mulvaneys tendered pouch and we three smoked gravely for a space while the dustdevils danced on the glacis and scoured the redhot plain  pop said ortheris wiping his forehead  dont tantalize wid talkin av

veins of his neck was pegging his maker to strike him dead and fighting for more air between his prayers a second time ortheris drenched the quivering body with water and the giant revived  an ah

gave back learoyds broken whisper in a bass boom mulvaney looked at me hopelessly but i remembered how the madness of despair had once fallen upon ortheris that weary weary afternoon in the banks of the khemi river and how it had been exorcised by the skilful magician mulvaney  talk terence i said or we shall have learoyd slinging loose and hell be worse than ortheris was talk hell answer to your voice  almost before ortheris had deftly thrown all the rifles of the guard on mulvaneys bedstead the irishmans voice was uplifted as that of one in the middle of a story and turning to me he said  in

up to the top av the fort an well pershue our invistigations into mgraths shtable the relieved guard strolled round the main bastion on its way to the swimmingbath and learoyd grew almost talkative ortheris looked into the fort ditch and across the plain ho its weary waitin for maary he hummed but id like to kill some more bloomin paythans before my times up war bloody war north east south and west  amen said learoyd slowly  fwhats here said mulvaney checking at a blurr of white by the foot of the old sentrybox he stooped and touched it its norahnorah mtaggart why nonie darlin fwhat are ye doin out av your mothers bed at this time  the twoyearold child of sergeant mtaggart must have wandered for a breath of cool air to the very verge of the parapet of the fort ditch her tiny nightshift was gathered into a wisp round her neck and she moaned in her sleep see there said mulvaney poor lamb look at the heatrash on the innocint skin av her tis hardcrool hard even for us fwhat must it be for these wake up nonie your mother will be woild about you begad the child might ha fallen into the ditch  he picked her up in the growing light and set her on his shoulder and her fair curls touched the grizzled stubble of his temples ortheris and learoyd followed snapping their fingers while norah smiled at them a sleepy smile then carolled mulvaney clear as a lark dancing the baby on his arm    if any young man should marry you      say nothin about the joke    that iver ye slep in a sinthrybox      wrapped up in a soldiers cloak  though on my sowl nonie he said gravely there was not much cloak about you niver mind you wont dhress like this ten years to come kiss your friends an run along to your mother  nonie set down close to the married quarters nodded with the quiet obedience of the soldiers child but ere she pattered off over the flagged path held up her lips to be kissed by the three musketeers ortheris wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and swore sentimentally learoyd turned pink and the two walked away together the yorkshireman lifted up his voice and gave in thunder the chorus of the sentrybox while ortheris piped at his side  bin to a bloomin singsong you two said the artilleryman who was taking his cartridge down to the morning gun youre over merry for these dashed days     i bid ye take care o the brat said he    for it comes of a noble race  learoyd bellowed the voices died out in the swimmingbath  oh terence i said dropping into mulvaneys speech when we were alone its you that have the tongue  he looked at me wearily his eyes were sunk in his head and his face was drawn and white eyah said he ive blandandhered thim through the night somehow but can thim that helps others help thimselves answer me that sorr  and over the bastions of fort amara broke the pitiless day    wee willie winkie  an officer and a gentleman  his full name was percival william williams but he picked up the other name in a nurserybook and that was the end of the christened titles his mothers ayah called him williebaba but as he never paid the faintest attention to anything that the ayah said her wisdom did not help matters  his father was the colonel of the 195th and as soon as wee willie winkie was old enough to understand what military discipline meant colonel williams put him under it there was no other way of managing the child when he was good for a week he drew goodconduct pay and when he was bad he was deprived of his goodconduct stripe generally he was bad for india offers so many chances to little sixyearolds of going wrong  children resent familiarity from strangers and wee willie winkie was a very particular child once he accepted an acquaintance he was graciously pleased to thaw he accepted brandis a subaltern of the 195th on sight brandis was having tea at the colonels and wee willie winkie entered strong in the possession of a goodconduct badge won for not chasing the hens round the compound he regarded brandis with gravity for at least ten minutes and then delivered himself of his opinion  i like you said he slowly getting off his chair and coming over to brandis i like you i shall call you coppy because of your hair do you mind being called coppy it is because of ve hair you know  here was one of the most embarrassing of wee willie winkies peculiarities he would look at a stranger for some time and then without warning or explanation would give him a name and the name stuck no regimental penalties could break wee willie winkie of this habit he lost his goodconduct badge for christening the commissioners wife pobs but nothing that the colonel could do made the station forego the nickname and mrs collen remained mrs pobs till the end of her stay so brandis was christened coppy and rose therefore in the estimation of the regiment  if wee willie winkie took an interest in any one the fortunate man was envied alike by the mess and the rank and file and in their envy lay no suspicion of selfinterest the colonels son was idolized on his own merits entirely yet wee willie winkie was not lovely his face was permanently freckled as his legs were permanently scratched and in spite of his mothers almost tearful remonstrances he had insisted upon having his long yellow locks cut short in the military fashion i want my hair like sergeant tummils said wee willie winkie and his father abetting the sacrifice was accomplished  three weeks after the bestowal of his youthful affections on lieutenant brandishenceforward to be called coppy for the sake of brevitywee willie winkie was destined to behold strange things and far beyond his comprehension  coppy returned his liking with interest coppy had let him wear for five rapturous minutes his own big swordjust as tall as wee willie winkie coppy had promised him a terrier puppy and coppy had permitted him to witness the miraculous operation of shaving nay morecoppy had said that even he wee willie winkie would rise in time to the ownership of a box of shiny knives a silver soapbox and a silverhandled sputterbrush as wee willie winkie called it decidedly there was no one except his father who could give or take away goodconduct badges at pleasure half so wise strong and valiant as coppy with the afghan and egyptian medals on his breast why then should coppy be guilty of the unmanly weakness of kissingvehemently kissinga big girl miss allardyce to wit in the course of a morning ride wee willie winkie had seen coppy so doing and like the gentleman he was had promptly wheeled round and cantered back to his groom lest the groom should also see  under ordinary circumstances he would have spoken to his father but he felt instinctively that this was a matter on which coppy ought first to be consulted  coppy shouted wee willie winkie reining up outside that subalterns bungalow early one morningi want to see you coppy  come in young un returned coppy who was at early breakfast in the midst of his dogs what mischief have you been getting into now  wee willie winkie had done nothing notoriously bad for three days and so stood on a pinnacle of virtue  ive been doing nothing bad said he curling himself into a long chair with a studious affectation of the colonels languor after a hot parade he buried his freckled nose in a teacup and with eyes staring roundly over the rim askedi say coppy is it pwoper to kiss big girls  by jove youre beginning early who do you want to kiss  no one my muvvers always kissing me if i dont stop her if it isnt pwoper how was you kissing major allardyces big girl last morning by ve canal  coppys brow wrinkled he and miss allardyce had with great craft managed to keep their engagement secret for a fortnight there were urgent and imperative reasons why major allardyce should not know how matters stood for at least another month and this small marplot had discovered a great deal too much  i saw you said wee willie winkie calmly but ve groom didnt see i said hut jao  oh you had that much sense you young rip groaned poor coppy half amused and half angry and how many people may you have told about it  only me myself you didnt tell when i twied to wide ve buffalo ven my pony was lame and i fought you wouldnt like  winkie said coppy enthusiastically shaking the small hand youre the best of good fellows look here you cant understand all these things one of these dayshang it how can i make you see itim going to marry miss allardyce and then shell be mrs coppy as you say if your young mind is so scandalized at the idea of kissing big girls go and tell your father  what will happen said wee willie winkie who firmly believed that his father was omnipotent  i shall get into trouble said coppy playing his trump card with an appealing look at the holder of the ace  ven i wont said wee willie winkie briefly but my faver says its unmanly to be always kissing and i didnt fink youd do vat coppy  im not always kissing old chap its only now and then and when youre bigger youll do it too your father meant its not good for little boys  ah said wee willie winkie now fully enlightened its like ve sputterbrush  exactly said coppy gravely  but i dont fink ill ever want to kiss big girls nor no one cept my muvver and i must vat you know  there was a long pause broken by wee willie winkie  are you fond of vis big girl coppy  awfully said coppy  fonder van you are of bell or ve butchaor me  its in a different way said coppy you see one of these days miss allardyce will belong to me but youll grow up and command the regiment andall sorts of things its quite different you see  very well said wee willie winkie rising if youre fond of ve big girl i wont tell any one i must go now  coppy rose and escorted his small guest to the door adding youre the best of little fellows winkie i tell you what in thirty days from now you can tell if you liketell any one you like  thus the secret of the brandisallardyce engagement was dependent on a little childs word coppy who knew wee willie winkies idea of truth was at ease for he felt that he would not break promises wee willie winkie betrayed a special and unusual interest in miss allardyce and slowly revolving round that embarrassed young lady was used to regard her gravely with unwinking eye he was trying to discover why coppy should have kissed her she was not half so nice as his own mother on the other hand she was coppys property and would in time belong to him therefore it behooved him to treat her with as much respect as coppys big sword or shiny pistol  the idea that he shared a great secret in common with coppy kept wee willie winkie unusually virtuous for three weeks then the old adam broke out and he made what he called a campfire at the bottom of the garden how could he have foreseen that the flying sparks would have lighted the colonels little hayrick and consumed a weeks store for the horses sudden and swift was the punishmentdeprivation of the goodconduct badge and most sorrowful of all two days confinement to barracksthe house and verandacoupled with the withdrawal of the light of his fathers countenance  he took the sentence like the man he strove to be drew himself up with a quivering underlip saluted and once clear of the room ran to weep bitterly in his nurserycalled by him my quarters coppy came in the afternoon and attempted to console the culprit  im under awwest said wee willie winkie mournfully and i didnt ought to speak to you  very early the next morning he climbed on to the roof of the housethat was not forbiddenand beheld miss allardyce going for a ride  where are you going cried wee willie winkie  across the river she answered and trotted forward  now the cantonment in which the 195th lay was bounded on the north by a riverdry in the winter from his earliest years wee willie winkie had been forbidden to go across the river and had noted that even coppythe almost almighty coppyhad never set foot beyond it wee willie winkie had once been read to out of a big blue book the history of the princess and the goblinsa most wonderful tale of a land where the goblins were always warring with the children of men until they were defeated by one curdie ever since that date it seemed to him that the bare black and purple hills across the river were inhabited by goblins and in truth every one had said that there lived the bad men even in his own house the lower halves of the windows were covered with green paper on account of the bad men who might if allowed clear view fire into peaceful drawingrooms and comfortable bedrooms certainly beyond the river which was the end of all the earth lived the bad men and here was major allardyces big girl coppys property preparing to venture into their borders what would coppy say if anything happened to her if the goblins ran off with her as they did with curdies princess she must at all hazards be turned back  the house was still wee willie winkie reflected for a moment on the very terrible wrath of his father and thenbroke his arrest it was a crime unspeakable the low sun threw his shadow very large and very black on the trim gardenpaths as he went down to the stables and ordered his pony it seemed to him in the hush of the dawn that all the big world had been bidden to stand still and look at wee willie winkie guilty of mutiny the drowsy groom handed him his mount and since the one great sin made all others insignificant wee willie winkie said that he was going to ride over to coppy sahib and went out at a footpace stepping on the soft mould of the flowerborders  the devastating track of the ponys feet was the last misdeed that cut him off from all sympathy of humanity he turned into the road leaned forward and rode as fast as the pony could put foot to the ground in the direction of the river  but the liveliest of twelvetwo ponies can do little against the long canter of a waler miss allardyce was far ahead had passed through the crops beyond the policepost when all the guards were asleep and her mount was scattering the pebbles of the river bed as wee willie winkie left the cantonment and british india behind him bowed forward and still flogging wee willie winkie shot into afghan territory and could just see miss allardyce a black speck flickering across the stony plain the reason of her wandering was simple enough coppy in a tone of toohastilyassumed authority had told her over night that she must not ride out by the river and she had gone to prove her own spirit and teach coppy a lesson  almost at the foot of the inhospitable hills wee willie winkie saw the waler blunder and come down heavily miss allardyce struggled clear but her ankle had been severely twisted and she could not stand having thus demonstrated her spirit she wept copiously and was surprised by the apparition of a white wideeyed child in khaki on a nearly spent pony  are you badly badly hurted shouted wee willie winkie as soon as he was within range you didnt ought to be here  i dont know said miss allardyce ruefully ignoring the reproof good gracious child what are you doing here  you said you was going acwoss ve wiver panted wee willie winkie throwing himself off his pony and nobodynot even coppymust go acwoss ve wiver and i came after you ever so hard but you wouldnt stop and now youve hurted yourself and coppy will be angwy wiv me andive bwoken my awwest ive bwoken my awwest  the future colonel of the 195th sat down and sobbed in spite of the pain in her ankle the girl was moved  have you ridden all the way from cantonments little man what for  you belonged to coppy coppy told me so wailed wee willie winkie disconsolately i saw him kissing you and he said he was fonder of you van bell or ve butcha or me and so i came you must get up and come back you didnt ought to be here vis is a bad place and ive bwoken my awwest  i cant move winkie said miss allardyce with a groan ive hurt my foot what shall i do  she showed a readiness to weep afresh which steadied wee willie winkie who had been brought up to believe that tears were the depth of unmanliness still when one is as great a sinner as wee willie winkie even a man may be permitted to break down  winkie said miss allardyce when youve rested a little ride back and tell them to send out something to carry me back in it hurts fearfully  the child sat still for a little time and miss allardyce closed her eyes the pain was nearly making her faint she was roused by wee willie winkie tying up the reins on his ponys neck and setting it free with a vicious cut of his whip that made it whicker the little animal headed toward the cantonments  oh winkie what are you doing  hush said wee willie winkie veres a man comingone of ve bad men i must stay wiv you my faver says a man must always look after a girl jack will go home and ven veyll come and look for us vats why i let him go  not one man but two or three had appeared from behind the rocks of the hills and the heart of wee willie winkie sank within him for just in this manner were the goblins wont to steal out and vex curdies soul thus had they played in curdies garden he had seen the picture and thus had they frightened the princesss nurse he heard them talking to each other and recognized with joy the bastard pushto that he had picked up from one of his fathers grooms lately dismissed people who spoke that tongue could not be the bad men they were only natives after all  they came up to the bowlders on which miss allardyces horse had blundered  then rose from the rock wee willie winkie child of the dominant race aged six and threequarters and said briefly and emphatically jao the pony had crossed the riverbed  the men laughed and laughter from natives was the one thing wee willie winkie could not tolerate he asked them what they wanted and why they did not depart other men with most evil faces and crookedstocked guns crept out of the shadows of the hills till soon wee willie winkie was face to face with an audience some twenty strong miss allardyce screamed  who are you said one of the men  i am the colonel sahibs son and my order is that you go at once you black men are frightening the miss sahib one of you must run into cantonments and take the news that miss sahib has hurt herself and that the colonels son is here with her  put our feet into the trap was the laughing reply hear this boys speech  say that i sent youi the colonels son they will give you money  what is the use of this talk take up the child and the girl and we can at least ask for the ransom ours are the villages on the heights said a voice in the background  these were the bad menworse than goblinsand it needed all wee willie winkies training to prevent him from bursting into tears but he felt that to cry before a native excepting only his mothers ayah would be an infamy greater than any mutiny moreover he as future colonel of the 195th had that grim regiment at his back  are you going to carry us away said wee willie winkie very blanched and uncomfortable  yes my little sahib bahadur said the tallest of the men and eat you afterward  that is childs talk said wee willie winkie men do not eat men  a yell of laughter interrupted him but he went on firmlyand if you do carry us away i tell you that all my regiment will come up in a day and kill you all without leaving one who will take my message to the colonel sahib  speech in any vernacularand wee willie winkie had a colloquial acquaintance with threewas easy to the boy who could not yet manage his rs and ths aright  another man joined the conference cryingo foolish men what this babe says is true he is the hearts heart of those white troops for the sake of peace let them go both for if he be taken the regiment will break loose and gut the valley our villages are in the valley and we shall not escape that regiment are devils they broke khoda yars breastbone with kicks when he tried to take the rifles and if we touch this child they will fire and rape and plunder for a month till nothing remains better to send a man back to take the message and get a reward i say that this child is their god and that they will spare none of us nor our women if we harm him  it was din mahommed the dismissed groom of the colonel who made the diversion and an angry and heated discussion followed wee willie winkie standing over miss allardyce waited the upshot surely his wegiment his own wegiment would not desert him if they knew of his extremity                                            the riderless pony brought the news to the 195th though there had been consternation in the colonels household for an hour before the little beast came in through the parade ground in front of the main barracks where the men were settling down to play spoilfive till the afternoon devlin the color sergeant of e company glanced at the empty saddle and tumbled through the barrackrooms kicking up each room corporal as he passed up ye beggars theres something happened to the colonels son he shouted  he couldnt fall off selp me e couldnt fall off blubbered a drummerboy go an hunt acrost the river hes over there if hes anywhere an maybe those pathans have got im for the love o gawd dont look for im in the nullahs lets go over the river  theres sense in mott yet said devlin e company double out to the riversharp  so e company in its shirtsleeves mainly doubled for the dear life and in the rear toiled the perspiring sergeant adjuring it to double yet faster the cantonment was alive with the men of the 195th hunting for wee willie winkie and the colonel finally overtook e company far too exhausted to swear struggling in the pebbles of the riverbed  up the hill under which wee willie winkies bad men were discussing the wisdom of carrying off the child and the girl a lookout fired two shots  what have i said shouted din mahommed there is the warning the pulton are out already and are coming across the plain get away let us not be seen with the boy  the men waited for an instant and then as another shot was fired withdrew into the hills silently as they had appeared  the wegiment is coming said wee willie winkie confidently to miss allardyce and its all wight dont cwy  he needed the advice himself for ten minutes later when his father came up he was weeping bitterly with his head in miss allardyces lap  and the men of the 195th carried him home with shouts and rejoicings and coppy who had ridden a horse into a lather met him and to his intense disgust kissed him openly in the presence of the men  but there was balm for his dignity his father assured him that not only would the breaking of arrest be condoned but that the goodconduct badge would be restored as soon as his mother could sew it on his blousesleeve miss allardyce had told the colonel a story that made him proud of his son  she belonged to you coppy said wee willie winkie indicating miss allardyce with a grimy forefinger i knew she didnt ought to go acwoss ve wiver and i knew ve wegiment would come to me if i sent jack home  youre a hero winkie said coppya pukka hero  i dont know what vat means said wee willie winkie but you mustnt call me winkie any no more im percival willam willams  and in this manner did wee willie winkie enter into his manhood    the rout of the white hussars    it was not in the open fight      we threw away the sword    but in the lonely watching      in the darkness by the ford    the waters lapped the nightwind blew    fullarmed the fear was born and grew    and we were flying ere we knew      from panic in the night         beoni bari  some people hold that an english cavalry regiment cannot run this is a mistake i have seen four hundred and thirtyseven sabres flying over the face of the country in abject terrorhave seen the best regiment that ever drew bridle wiped off the army list for the space of two hours if you repeat this tale to the white hussars they will in all probability treat you severely they are not proud of the incident  you may know the white hussars by their side which is greater than that of all the cavalry regiments on the roster if this is not a sufficient mark you may know them by their old brandy it has been sixty years in the mess and is worth going far to taste ask for the mcgaire old brandy and see that you get it if the mess sergeant thinks that you are uneducated and that the genuine article will be lost on you he will treat you accordingly he is a good man but when you are at mess you must never talk to your hosts about forced marches or longdistance rides the mess are very sensitive and if they think that you are laughing at them will tell you so  as the white hussars say it was all the colonels fault he was a new man and he ought never to have taken the command he said that the regiment was not smart enough this to the white hussars who knew that they could walk round any horse and through any guns and over any foot on the face of the earth that insult was the first cause of offence  then the colonel cast the drumhorsethe drumhorse of the white hussars perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had committed i will try to make it clear the soul of the regiment lives in the drumhorse who carries the silver kettledrums he is nearly always a big piebald waler that is a point of honor and a regiment will spend anything you please on a piebald he is beyond the ordinary laws of casting his work is very light and he only manoeuvres at a footpace wherefore so long as he can step out and look handsome his wellbeing is assured he knows more about the regiment than the adjutant and could not make a mistake if he tried  the drumhorse of the white hussars was only eighteen years old and perfectly equal to his duties he had at least six years more work in him and carried himself with all the pomp and dignity of a drummajor of the guards the regiment had paid rs1200 for him  but the colonel said that he must go and he was cast in due form and replaced by a washy bay beast as ugly as a mule with a eweneck rattail and cowhocks the drummer detested that animal and the best of the bandhorses put back their ears and showed the whites of their eyes at the very sight of him they knew him for an upstart and no gentleman i fancy that the colonels ideas of smartness extended to the band and that he wanted to make it take part in the regular parade movements a cavalry band is a sacred thing it only turns out for commanding officers parades and the band master is one degree more important than the colonel he is a high priest and the keel row is his holy song the keel row is the cavalry trot and the man who has never heard that tune rising high and shrill above the rattle of the regiment going past the salutingbase has something yet to hear and understand  when the colonel cast the drumhorse of the white hussars there was nearly a mutiny  the officers were angry the regiment were furious and the bandsmen sworelike troopers the drumhorse was going to be put up to auctionpublic auctionto be bought perhaps by a parsee and put into a cart it was worse than exposing the inner life of the regiment to the whole world or selling the mess plate to a jewa black jew  the colonel was a mean man and a bully he knew what the regiment thought about his action and when the troopers offered to buy the drumhorse he said that their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the regulations  but one of the subalternshoganyale an irishmanbought the drumhorse for rs 160 at the sale and the colonel was wroth yale professed repentancehe was unnaturally submissiveand said that as he had only made the purchase to save the horse from possible illtreatment and starvation he would now shoot him and end the business this appeared to soothe the colonel for he wanted the drumhorse disposed of he felt that he had made a mistake and could not of course acknowledge it meantime the presence of the drumhorse was an annoyance to him  yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy three cheroots and his friend martyn and they all left the mess together yale and martyn conferred for two hours in yales quarters but only the bullterrier who keeps watch over yales boottrees knows what they said a horse hooded and sheeted to his ears left yales stables and was taken very unwillingly into the civil lines yales groom went with him two men broke into the regimental theatre and took several paintpots and some large scenerybrushes then night fell over the cantonments and there was a noise as of a horse kicking his loosebox to pieces in yales stables yale had a big old white waler traphorse  the next day was a thursday and the men hearing that yale was going to shoot the drumhorse in the evening determined to give the beast a regular regimental funerala finer one than they would have given the colonel had he died just then they got a bullockcart and some sacking and mounds and mounds of roses and the body under sacking was carried out to the place where the anthrax cases were cremated twothirds of the regiment following there was no band but they all sang the place where the old horse died as something respectful and appropriate to the occasion when the corpse was dumped into the grave and the men began throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it the farriersergeant ripped out an oath and said aloud why it aint the drumhorse any more than its me the troop sergeantmajors asked him whether he had left his head in the canteen the farriersergeant said that he knew the drumhorses feet as well as he knew his own but he was silenced when he saw the regimental number burned in on the poor stiff upturned nearfore  thus was the drumhorse of the white hussars buried the farriersergeant grumbling the sacking that covered the corpse was smeared in places with black paint and the farriersergeant drew attention to this fact but the troop sergeantmajor of e troop kicked him severely on the shin and told him that he was undoubtedly drunk  on the monday following the burial the colonel sought revenge on the white hussars unfortunately being at that time temporarily in command of the station he ordered a brigade fieldday he said that he wished to make the regiment sweat for their damned insolence and he carried out his notion thoroughly that monday was one of the hardest days in the memory of the white hussars they were thrown against a skeletonenemy and pushed forward and withdrawn and dismounted and scientifically handled in every possible fashion over dusty country till they sweated profusely their only amusement came late in the day when they fell upon the battery of horse artillery and chased it for two miles this was a personal question and most of the troopers had money on the event the gunners saying openly that they had the legs of the white hussars they were wrong a marchpast concluded the campaign and when the regiment got back to their lines the men were coated with dirt from spur to chinstrap  the white hussars have one great and peculiar privilege they won it at fontenoy i think  many regiments possess special rights such as wearing collars with undress uniform or a bow of riband between the shoulders or red and white roses in their helmets on certain days of the year some rights are connected with regimental saints and some with regimental successes all are valued highly but none so highly as the right of the white hussars to have the band playing when their horses are being watered in the lines only one tune is played and that tune never varies i dont know its real name but the white hussars call it take me to london again it sounds very pretty the regiment would sooner be struck off the roster than forego their distinction  after the dismiss was sounded the officers rode off home to prepare for stables and the men filed into the lines riding easy that is to say they opened their tight buttons shifted their helmets and began to joke or to swear as the humor took them the more careful slipping off and easing girths and curbs a good trooper values his mount exactly as much as he values himself and believes or should believe that the two together are irresistible where women or men girls or guns are concerned  then the orderlyofficer gave the order water horses and the regiment loafed off to the squadrontroughs which were in rear of the stables and between these and the barracks there were four huge troughs one for each squadron arranged en échelon so that the whole regiment could water in ten minutes if it liked but it lingered for seventeen as a rule while the band played  the band struck up as the squadrons filed off to the troughs and the men slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other the sun was just setting in a big hot bed of red cloud and the road to the civil lines seemed to run straight into the suns eye there was a little dot on the road it grew and grew till it showed as a horse with a sort of gridironthing on his back the red cloud glared through the bars of the gridiron some of the troopers shaded their eyes with their hands and saidwhat the mischief as that there orse got on im  in another minute they heard a neigh that every soulhorse and manin the regiment knew and saw heading straight toward the band the dead drumhorse of the white hussars  on his withers banged and bumped the kettledrums draped in crape and on his back very stiff and soldierly sat a bareheaded skeleton  the band stopped playing and for a moment there was a hush  then some one in e troopmen said it was the troopsergeantmajorswung his horse round and yelled no one can account exactly for what happened afterward but it seems that at least one man in each troop set an example of panic and the rest followed like sheep the horses that had barely put their muzzles into the troughs reared and capered but as soon as the band broke which it did when the ghost of the drumhorse was about a furlong distant all hooves followed suit and the clatter of the stampedequite different from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on parade or the rough horseplay of watering in campmade them only more terrified they felt that the men on their backs were afraid of something when horses once know that all is over except the butchery  troop after troop turned from the troughs and rananywhere and everywherelike spilled quicksilver it was a most extraordinary spectacle for men and horses were in all stages of easiness and the carbinebuckets flopping against their sides urged the horses on men were shouting and cursing and trying to pull clear of the band which was being chased by the drumhorse whose rider had fallen forward and seemed to be spurring for a wager  the colonel had gone over to the mess for a drink most of the officers were with him and the subaltern of the day was preparing to go down to the lines and receive the watering reports from the troopsergeant majors when take me to london again stopped after twenty bars every one in the mess said what on earth has happened a minute later they heard unmilitary noises and saw far across the plain the white hussars scattered and broken and flying  the colonel was speechless with rage for he thought that the regiment had risen against him or was unanimously drunk the band a disorganized mob tore past and at its heels labored the drumhorsethe dead and buried drumhorsewith the jolting clattering skeleton hoganyale whispered softly to martynno wire will stand that treatment and the band which had doubled like a hare came back again but the rest of the regiment was gone was rioting all over the province for the dusk had shut in and each man was howling to his neighbor that the drumhorse was on his flank troophorses are far too tenderly treated as a rule they can on emergencies do a great deal even with seventeen stone on their backs as the troopers found out  how long this panic lasted i cannot say i believe that when the moon rose the men saw they had nothing to fear and by twos and threes and halftroops crept back into cantonments very much ashamed of themselves meantime the drumhorse disgusted at his treatment by old friends pulled up wheeled round and trotted up to the mess verandasteps for bread no one liked to run but no one cared to go forward till the colonel made a movement and laid hold of the skeletons foot the band had halted some distance away and now came back slowly the colonel called it individually and collectively every evil name that occurred to him at the time for he had set his hand on the bosom of the drumhorse and found flesh and blood then he beat the kettledrums with his clenched fist and discovered that they were but made of silvered paper and bamboo next still swearing he tried to drag the skeleton out of the saddle but found that it had been wired into the cantle the sight of the colonel with his arms round the skeletons pelvis and his knee in the old drumhorses stomach was striking not to say amusing he worried the thing off in a minute or two and threw it down on the ground saying to the bandhere you curs thats what youre afraid of the skeleton did not look pretty in the twilight the bandsergeant seemed to recognize it for he began to chuckle and choke shall i take it away sir said the bandsergeant yes said the colonel take it to hell and ride there yourselves  the bandsergeant saluted hoisted the skeleton across his saddlebow and led off to the stables then the colonel began to make inquiries for the rest of the regiment and the language he used was wonderful he would disband the regimenthe would courtmartial every soul in ithe would not command such a set of rabble and so on and so on as the men dropped in his language grew wilder until at last it exceeded the utmost limits of free speech allowed even to a colonel of horse  martyn took hoganyale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from the service as a necessity when all was discovered martyn was the weaker man of the two hoganyale put up his eyebrows and remarked firstly that he was the son of a lord and secondly that he was as innocent as the babe unborn of the theatrical resurrection of the drumhorse  my instructions said yale with a singularly sweet smile were that the drumhorse should be sent back as impressively as possible i ask you am i responsible if a muleheaded friend sends him back in such a manner as to disturb the peace of mind of a regiment of her majestys cavalry  martyn said you are a great man and will in time become a general but id give my chance of a troop to be safe out of this affair  providence saved martyn and hoganyale the secondincommand led the colonel away to the little curtained alcove wherein the subalterns of the white hussars were accustomed to play poker of nights and there after many oaths on the colonels part they talked together in low tones i fancy that the secondincommand must have represented the scare as the work of some trooper whom it would be hopeless to detect and i know that he dwelt upon the sin and the shame of making a public laughingstock of the scare  they will call us said the secondincommand who had really a fine imaginationthey will call us the flybynights they will call us the ghost hunters they will nickname us from one end of the army list to the other all the explanation in the world wont make outsiders understand that the officers were away when the panic began for the honor of the regiment and for your own sake keep this thing quiet  the colonel was so exhausted with anger that soothing him down was not so difficult as might be imagined he was made to see gently and by degrees that it was obviously impossible to courtmartial the whole regiment and equally impossible to proceed against any subaltern who in his belief had any concern in the hoax  but the beasts alive hes never been shot at all shouted the colonel its flat flagrant disobedience ive known a man broke for lessdam sight less theyre mocking me i tell you mutman theyre mocking me  once more the secondincommand set himself to soothe the colonel and wrestled with him for half an hour at the end of that time the regimental sergeantmajor reported himself the situation was rather novel to him but he was not a man to be put out by circumstances he saluted and said regiment all comeback sir then to propitiate the colonelan none of the orses any the worse sir  the colonel only snorted and answeredyoud better tuck the men into their cots then and see that they dont wake up and cry in the night the sergeant withdrew  his little stroke of humor pleased the colonel and further he felt slightly ashamed of the language he had been using the secondincommand worried him again and the two sat talking far into the night  next day but one there was a commanding officers parade and the colonel harangued the white hussars vigorously the pith of his speech was that since the drumhorse in his old age had proved himself capable of cutting up the whole regiment he should return to his post of pride at the head of the band but the regiment were a set of ruffians with bad consciences  the white hussars shouted and threw everything movable about them into the air and when the parade was over they cheered the colonel till they couldnt speak no cheers were put up for lieutenant hoganyale who smiled very sweetly in the background  said the secondincommand to the colonel unofficially  these little things ensure popularity and do not the least affect discipline  but i went back on my word said the colonel  never mind said the secondincommand the white hussars will follow you anywhere from today regiments are just like women they will do anything for trinketry  a week later hoganyale received an extraordinary letter from some one who signed himself secretary charity and zeal 3709 e c and asked for the return of our skeleton which we have reason to believe is in your possession  who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones said hoganyale  beg your pardon sir said the bandsergeant but the skeleton is with me an ill return it if youll pay the carriage into the civil lines theres a coffin with it sir  hoganyale smiled and handed two rupees to the bandsergeant saying write the date on the skull will you  if you doubt this story and know where to go you can see the date on the skeleton but dont mention the matter to the white hussars  i happened to know something about it because i prepared the drumhorse for his resurrection he did not take kindly to the skeleton at all    at twentytwo  narrow as the womb deep as the pit and dark as the heart of a mansonthal miners proverb  a weaver went out to reap but stayed to unravel the cornstalks ha ha ha is there any sense in a weaver  janki meah glared at kundoo but as janki meah was blind kundoo was not impressed he had come to argue with janki meah and if chance favored to make love to the old mans pretty young wife  this was kundoos grievance and he spoke in the name of all the five men who with janki meah composed the gang in number seven gallery of twentytwo janki meah had been blind for the thirty years during which he had served the jimahari collieries with pick and crowbar all through those thirty years he had regularly every morning before going down drawn from the overseer his allowance of lampoiljust as if he had been an eyed miner what kundoos gang resented as hundreds of gangs had resented before was janki meahs selfishness he would not add the oil to the common stock of his gang but would save and sell it  i knew these workings before you were born janki meah used to reply i dont want the light to get my coal out by and i am not going to help you the oil is mine and i intend to keep it  a strange man in many ways was janki meah the whitehaired hot tempered sightless weaver who had turned pitman all day longexcept on sundays and mondays when he was usually drunkhe worked in the twentytwo shaft of the jimahari colliery as cleverly as a man with all the senses at evening he went up in the great steamhauled cage to the pitbank and there called for his ponya rusty coaldusty beast nearly as old as janki meah the pony would come to his side and janki meah would clamber on to its back and be taken at once to the plot of land which he like the other miners received from the jimahari company the pony knew that place and when after six years the company changed all the allotments to prevent the miners from acquiring proprietary rights janki meah represented with tears in his eyes that were his holdings shifted he would never be able to find his way to the new one my horse only knows that place pleaded janki meah and so he was allowed to keep his land  on the strength of this concession and his accumulated oilsavings janki meah took a second wifea girl of the jolaha main stock of the meahs and singularly beautiful janki meah could not see her beauty wherefore he took her on trust and forbade her to go down the pit he had not worked for thirty years in the dark without knowing that the pit was no place for pretty women he loaded her with ornamentsnot brass or pewter but real silver onesand she rewarded him by flirting outrageously with kundoo of number seven gallery gang kundoo was really the ganghead but janki meah insisted upon all the work being entered in his own name and chose the men that he worked with customstronger even than the jimahari companydictated that janki by right of his years should manage these things and should also work despite his blindness in indian mines where they cut into the solid coal with the pick and clear it out from floor to ceiling he could come to no great harm at home where they undercut the coal and bring it down in crashing avalanches from the roof he would never have been allowed to set foot in a pit he was not a popular man because of his oilsavings but all the gangs admitted that janki knew all the khads or workings that had ever been sunk or worked since the jimahari company first started operations on the tarachunda fields  pretty little unda only knew that her old husband was a fool who could be managed she took no interest in the collieries except in so far as they swallowed up kundoo five days out of the seven and covered him with coaldust kundoo was a great workman and did his best not to get drunk because when he had saved forty rupees unda was to steal everything that she could find in jankis house and run with kundoo to a land where there were no mines and every one kept three fat bullocks and a milchbuffalo while this scheme ripened it was his custom to drop in upon janki and worry him about the oil savings unda sat in a corner and nodded approval on the night when kundoo had quoted that objectionable proverb about weavers janki grew angry  listen you pig said he blind i am and old i am but before ever you were born i was grey among the coal even in the days when the twentytwo khad was unsunk and there were not two thousand men here i was known to have all knowledge of the pits what khad is there that i do not know from the bottom of the shaft to the end of the last drive is it the baromba khad the oldest or the twentytwo where tibus gallery runs up to number five  hear the old fool talk said kundoo nodding to unda no gallery of twentytwo will cut into five before the end of the rains we have a months solid coal before us the babuji says so  babuji pigji dogji what do these fat slugs from calcutta know he draws and draws and draws and talks and talks and talks and his maps are all wrong i janki know that this is so when a man has been shut up in the dark for thirty years god gives him knowledge the old gallery that tibus gang made is not six feet from number five  without doubt god gives the blind knowledge said kundoo with a look at unda let it be as you say i for my part do not know where lies the gallery of tibus gang but i am not a withered monkey who needs oil to grease his joints with  kundoo swung out of the hut laughing and unda giggled janki turned his sightless eyes toward his wife and swore i have land and i have sold a great deal of lampoil mused janki but i was a fool to marry this child  a week later the rains set in with a vengeance and the gangs paddled about in coalslush at the pitbanks then the big minepumps were made ready and the manager of the colliery ploughed through the wet toward the tarachunda river swelling between its soppy banks lord send that this beastly beck doesnt misbehave said the manager piously and he went to take counsel with his assistant about the pumps  but the tarachunda misbehaved very much indeed after a fall of three inches of rain in an hour it was obliged to do something it topped its bank and joined the flood water that was hemmed between two low hills just where the embankment of the colliery main line crossed when a large part of a rainfed river and a few acres of floodwater made a dead set for a ninefoot culvert the culvert may spout its finest but the water cannot all get out the manager pranced upon one leg with excitement and his language was improper  he had reason to swear because he knew that one inch of water on land meant a pressure of one hundred tons to the acre and here were about five feet of water forming behind the railway embankment over the shallower workings of twentytwo you must understand that in a coalmine the coal nearest the surface is worked first from the central shaft that is to say the miners may clear out the stuff to within ten twenty or thirty feet of the surface and when all is worked out leave only a skin of earth upheld by some few pillars of coal in a deep mine where they know that they have any amount of material at hand men prefer to get all their mineral out at one shaft rather than make a number of little holes to tap the comparatively unimportant surfacecoal  and the manager watched the flood  the culvert spouted a ninefoot gush but the water still formed and word was sent to clear the men out of twentytwo the cages came up crammed and crammed again with the men nearest the piteye as they call the place where you can see daylight from the bottom of the main shaft all away and away up the long black galleries the flarelamps were winking and dancing like so many fireflies and the men and the women waited for the clanking rattling thundering cages to come down and fly up again but the outworkings were very far off and word could not be passed quickly though the heads of the gangs and the assistant shouted and swore and tramped and stumbled the manager kept one eye on the great troubled pool behind the embankment and prayed that the culvert would give way and let the water through in time with the other eye he watched the cages come up and saw the headmen counting the roll of the gangs with all his heart and soul he swore at the winder who controlled the iron drum that wound up the wire rope on which hung the cages  in a little time there was a downdraw in the water behind the embankmenta sucking whirlpool all yellow and yeasty the water had smashed through the skin of the earth and was pouring into the old shallow workings of twentytwo  deep down below a rush of black water caught the last gang waiting for the cage and as they clambered in the whirl was about their waists the cage reached the pitbank and the manager called the roll the gangs were all safe except gang janki gang mogul and gang rahim eighteen men with perhaps ten basketwomen who loaded the coal into the little iron carriages that ran on the tramways of the main galleries these gangs were in the outworkings threequarters of a mile away on the extreme fringe of the mine once more the cage went down but with only two english men in it and dropped into a swirling roaring current that had almost touched the roof of some of the lower sidegalleries one of the wooden balks with which they had propped the old workings shot past on the current just missing the cage  if we dont want our ribs knocked out wed better go said the manager we cant even save the companys props  the cage drew out of the water with a splash and a few minutes later it was officially reported that there were at least ten feet of water in the pits eye now ten feet of water there meant that all other places in the mine were flooded except such galleries as were more than ten feet above the level of the bottom of the shaft the deep workings would be full the main galleries would be full but in the high workings reached by inclines from the main roads there would be a certain amount of air cut off so to speak by the water and squeezed up by it the little scienceprimers explain how water behaves when you pour it down testtubes the flooding of twentytwo was an illustration on a large scale                                            by the holy grove what has happened to the air it was a sonthal gangman of gang mogul in number nine gallery and he was driving a sixfoot way through the coal then there was a rush from the other galleries and gang janki and gang rahim stumbled up with their basketwomen  water has come in the mine they said and there is no way of getting out  i went down said jankidown the slope of my gallery and i felt the water  there has been no water in the cutting in our time clamored the women why cannot we go away  be silent said janki long ago when my father was here water came to tenno elevencutting and there was great trouble let us get away to where the air is better  the three gangs and the basketwomen left number nine gallery and went further up number sixteen at one turn of the road they could see the pitchy black water lapping on the coal it had touched the roof of a gallery that they knew wella gallery where they used to smoke their huqas and manage their flirtations seeing this they called aloud upon their gods and the mehas who are thrice bastard muhammadans strove to recollect the name of the prophet they came to a great open square whence nearly all the coal had been extracted it was the end of the outworkings and the end of the mine  far away down the gallery a small pumpingengine used for keeping dry a deep working and fed with steam from above was throbbing faithfully they heard it cease  they have cut off the steam said kundoo hopefully they have given the order to use all the steam for the pitbank pumps they will clear out the water  if the water has reached the smokinggallery said janki all the companys pumps can do nothing for three days  it is very hot moaned jasoda the meah basketwoman there is a very bad air here because of the lamps  put them out said janki why do you want lamps the lamps were put out and the company sat still in the utter dark somebody rose quietly and began walking over the coals it was janki who was touching the walls with his hands where is the ledge he murmured to himself  sit sit said kundoo if we die we die the air is very bad  but janki still stumbled and crept and tapped with his pick upon the walls the women rose to their feet  stay all where you are without the lamps you cannot see and ii am always seeing said janki then he paused and called out oh you who have been in the cutting more than ten years what is the name of this open place i am an old man and i have forgotten  bullias room answered the sonthal who had complained of the vileness of the air  again said janki  bullias room  then i have found it said janki the name only had slipped my memory tibus gangs gallery is here  a lie said kundoo there have been no galleries in this place since my day  three paces was the depth of the ledge muttered janki without heedingandoh my poor bonesi have found it it is here up this ledge come all you one by one to the place of my voice and i will count you  there was a rush in the dark and janki felt the first mans face hit his knees as the sonthal scrambled up the ledge  who cried janki  i sunua manji  sit you down said janki who next  one by one the women and the men crawled up the ledge which ran along one side of bullias room degraded muhammadan pigeating musahr and wild sonthal janki ran his hand over them all  now follow after said he catching hold of my heel and the women catching the mens clothes he did not ask whether the men had brought their picks with them a miner black or white does not drop his pick one by one janki leading they crept into the old gallerya sixfoot way with a scant four feet from hill to roof  the air is better here said jasoda they could hear her heart beating in thick sick bumps  slowly slowly said janki i am an old man and i forget many things this is tibus gallery but where are the four bricks where they used to put their huqa fire on when the sahibs never saw slowly slowly o you people behind  they heard his hands disturbing the small coal on the floor of the gallery and then a dull sound this is one unbaked brick and this is another and another kundoo is a young manlet him come forward put a knee upon this brick and strike here when tibus gang were at dinner on the last day before the good coal ended they heard the men of five on the other side and five worked their gallery two sundays lateror it may have been one strike there kundoo but give me room to go back  kundoo doubting drove the pick but the first soft crush of the coal was a call to him he was fighting for his life and for undapretty little unda with rings on all her toesfor unda and the forty rupees the women sang the song of the pickthe terrible slow swinging melody with the muttered chorus that repeats the sliding of the loosened coal and to each cadence kundoo smote in the black dark when he could do no more sunua manji took the pick and struck for his life and his wife and his village beyond the blue hills over the tarachunda river an hour the men worked and then the women cleared away the coal  it is farther than i thought said janki the air is very bad but strike kundoo strike hard  for the fifth time kundoo took up the pick as the sonthal crawled back the song had scarcely recommenced when it was broken by a yell from kundoo that echoed down the gallery par hua par hua we are through we are through the imprisoned air in the mine shot through the opening and the women at the far end of the gallery heard the water rush through the pillars of bullias room and roar against the ledge having fulfilled the law under which it worked it rose no farther the women screamed and pressed forward the water has comewe shall be killed let us go  kundoo crawled through the gap and found himself in a propped gallery by the simple process of hitting his head against a beam  do i know the pits or do i not chuckled janki this is the number five go you out slowly giving me your names ho rahim count your gang now let us go forward each catching hold of the other as before  they formed a line in the darkness and janki led themfor a pitman in a strange pit is only one degree less liable to err than an ordinary mortal underground for the first time at last they saw a flarelamp and gangs janki mogul and rahim of twentytwo stumbled dazed into the glare of the draughtfurnace at the bottom of five janki feeling his way and the rest behind  water has come into twentytwo god knows where are the others i have brought these men from tibus gallery in our cutting making connection through the north side of the gallery take us to the cage said janki meah                                            at the pitbank of twentytwo some thousand people clamored and wept and shouted one hundred menone thousand menhad been drowned in the cutting they would all go to their homes tomorrow where were their men little unda her cloth drenched with the rain stood at the pitmouth calling down the shaft for kundoo they had swung the cages clear of the mouth and her only answer was the murmur of the flood in the pits eye two hundred and sixty feet below  look after that woman shell chuck herself down the shaft in a minute shouted the manager  but he need not have troubled unda was afraid of death she wanted kundoo the assistant was watching the flood and seeing how far he could wade into it there was a lull in the water and the whirlpool had slackened the mine was full and the people at the pitbank howled  my faith we shall be lucky if we have five hundred hands on the place tomorrow said the manager theres some chance yet of running a temporary dam across that water shove in anythingtubs and bullockcarts if you havent enough bricks make them work now if they never worked before hi you gangers make them work  little by little the crowd was broken into detachments and pushed toward the water with promises of overtime the dammaking began and when it was fairly under way the manager thought that the hour had come for the pumps there was no fresh inrush into the mine the tall red ironclamped pumpbeam rose and fell and the pumps snored and guttered and shrieked as the first water poured out of the pipe  we must run her all tonight said the manager wearily but theres no hope for the poor devils down below look here gur sahai if you are proud of your engines show me what they can do now  gur sahai grinned and nodded with his right hand upon the lever and an oilcan in his left he could do no more than he was doing but he could keep that up till the dawn were the companys pumps to be beaten by the vagaries of that troublesome tarachunda river never never and the pumps sobbed and panted never never the manager sat in the shelter of the pitbank roofing trying to dry himself by the pumpboiler fire and in the dreary dusk he saw the crowds on the dam scatter and fly  thats the end he groaned twill take us six weeks to persuade em that we havent tried to drown their mates on purpose oh for a decent rational geordie  but the flight had no panic in it men had run over from five with astounding news and the foremen could not hold their gangs together presently surrounded by a clamorous crew gangs rahim mogul and janki and ten basketwomen walked up to report themselves and pretty little unda stole away to jankis hut to prepare his evening meal  alone i found the way explained janki meah and now will the company give me pension  the simple pitfolk shouted and leaped and went back to the dam reassured in their old belief that whatever happened so great was the power of the company whose salt they ate none of them could be killed but gur sahai only bared his white teeth and kept his hand upon the lever and proved his pumps to the uttermost                                            i say said the assistant to the manager a week later do you recollect germinal  yes queer thing i thought of it in the cage when that balk went by why  oh this business seems to be germinal upside down janki was in my veranda all this morning telling me that kundoo had eloped with his wifeunda or anda i think her name was  hillo and those were the cattle that you risked your life to clear out of twentytwo  noi was thinking of the companys props not the companys men  sounds better to say so now but i dont believe you old fellow    the courting of dinah shadd    what did the colonels lady think      nobody never knew    somebody asked the sergeants wife      an she told em true    when you git to a man in the case      theyre like a row o pins    for the colonels lady an judy ogrady      are sisters under their skins      barrack room ballad  all day i had followed at the heels of a pursuing army engaged on one of the finest battles that ever camp of exercise beheld thirty thousand troops had by the wisdom of the government of india been turned loose over a few thousand square miles of country to practice in peace what they would never attempt in war consequently cavalry charged unshaken infantry at the trot infantry captured artillery by frontal attacks delivered in line of quarter columns and mounted infantry skirmished up to the wheels of an armored train which carried nothing more deadly than a twentyfive pounder armstrong two nordenfeldts and a few score volunteers all cased in threeeighthsinch boilerplate yet it was a very lifelike camp operations did not cease at sundown nobody knew the country and nobody spared man or horse there was unending cavalry scouting and almost unending forced work over broken ground the army of the south had finally pierced the centre of the army of the north and was pouring through the gap hotfoot to capture a city of strategic importance its front extended fanwise the sticks being represented by regiments strung out along the line of route backward to the divisional transport columns and all the lumber that trails behind an army on the move on its right the broken left of the army of the north was flying in mass chased by the southern horse and hammered by the southern guns till these had been pushed far beyond the limits of their last support then the flying sat down to rest while the elated commandant of the pursuing force telegraphed that he held all in check and observation  unluckily he did not observe that three miles to his right flank a flying column of northern horse with a detachment of ghoorkhas and british troops had been pushed round as fast as the failing light allowed to cut across the entire rear of the southern army to break as it were all the ribs of the fan where they converged by striking at the transport reserve ammunition and artillery supplies their instructions were to go in avoiding the few scouts who might not have been drawn off by the pursuit and create sufficient excitement to impress the southern army with the wisdom of guarding their own flank and rear before they captured cities it was a pretty manoeuvre neatly carried out  speaking for the second division of the southern army our first intimation of the attack was at twilight when the artillery were laboring in deep sand most of the escort were trying to help them out and the main body of the infantry had gone on a noahs ark of elephants camels and the mixed menagerie of an indian transporttrain bubbled and squealed behind the guns when there appeared from nowhere in particular british infantry to the extent of three companies who sprang to the heads of the gunhorses and brought all to a standstill amid oaths and cheers  hows that umpire said the major commanding the attack and with one voice the drivers and limber gunners answered hout while the colonel of artillery sputtered  all your scouts are charging our main body said the major your flanks are unprotected for two miles i think weve broken the back of this division and listenthere go the ghoorkhas  a weak fire broke from the rearguard more than a mile away and was answered by cheerful howlings the ghoorkhas who should have swung clear of the second division had stepped on its tail in the dark but drawing off hastened to reach the next line of attack which lay almost parallel to us five or six miles away  our column swayed and surged irresolutelythree batteries the divisional ammunition reserve the baggage and a section of the hospital and bearer corps the commandant ruefully promised to report himself cut up to the nearest umpires and commending his cavalry and all other cavalry to the special care of eblis toiled on to resume touch with the rest of the division  well bivouac here tonight said the major i have a notion that the ghoorkhas will get caught they may want us to reform on stand easy till the transport gets away  a hand caught my beasts bridle and led him out of the choking dust a larger hand deftly canted me out of the saddle and two of the hugest hands in the world received me sliding pleasant is the lot of the special correspondent who falls into such hands as those of privates mulvaney ortheris and learoyd  an thats all right said the irishman calmly we thought wed find you somewheres here by is there anything av yours in the transport orthris ll fetch ut out  ortheris did fetch ut out from under the trunk of an elephant in the shape of a servant and an animal both laden with medical comforts the little mans eyes sparkled  if the brutil an licentious soldiery av these parts gets sight av the thruck said mulvaney making practiced investigation theyll loot evrything theyre bein fed on ironfilins an dogbiscuit these days but glorys no compensation for a bellyache praise be were here to protect you sorr beer sausage bread soft an thats a curosity soup in a tin whisky by the smell av ut an fowls mother av moses but ye take the field like a confectioner tis scandlus  eres a orficer said ortheris significantly when the sergents done lushin the privit may clean the pot  i bundled several things into mulvaneys haversack before the majors hand fell on my shoulder and he said tenderly requisitioned for the queens service wolseley was quite wrong about special correspondents they are the soldiers best friends come and take potluck with us tonight  and so it happened amid laughter and shoutings that my wellconsidered commissariat melted away to reappear later at the messtable which was a waterproof sheet spread on the ground the flying column had taken three days rations with it and there be few things nastier than government rationsespecially when government is experimenting with german toys erbsenwurst tinned beef of surpassing tinniness compressed vegetables and meatbiscuits may be nourishing but what thomas atkins needs is bulk in his inside the major assisted by his brother officers purchased goats for the camp and so made the experiment of no effect long before the fatigueparty sent to collect brushwood had returned the men were settled down by their valises kettles and pots had appeared from the surrounding country and were dangling over fires as the kid and the compressed vegetable bubbled together there rose a cheerful clinking of messtins outrageous demands for a little more stuffin with that there liverwing and gust on gust of chaff as pointed as a bayonet and as delicate as a gunbutt  the boys are in a good temper said the major theyll be singing presently well a night like this is enough to keep them happy  over our heads burned the wonderful indian stars which are not all pricked in on one plane but preserving an orderly perspective draw the eye through the velvet darkness of the void up to the barred doors of heaven itself the earth was a grey shadow more unreal than the sky we could hear her breathing lightly in the pauses between the howling of the jackals the movement of the wind in the tamarisks and the fitful mutter of musketryfire leagues away to the left a native woman from some unseen hut began to sing the mailtrain thundered past on its way to delhi and a roosting crow cawed drowsily then there was a beltloosening silence about the fires and the even breathing of the crowded earth took up the story  the men full fed turned to tobacco and songtheir officers with them the subaltern is happy who can win the approval of the musical critics in his regiment and is honored among the more intricate stepdancers by him as by him who plays cricket cleverly thomas atkins will stand in time of need when he will let a better officer go on alone the ruined tombs of forgotten mussulman saints heard the ballad of agra town the buffalo battery marching to kabul the long long indian day the place where the punkahcoolie died and that crashing chorus which announces    youths daring spirit manhoods fire      firm hand and eagle eye    must he acquire who would aspire      to see the grey boar die  today of all those jovial thieves who appropriated my commissariat and lay and laughed round that waterproof sheet not one remains they went to camps that were not of exercise and battles without umpires burmah the soudan and the frontierfever and fighttook them in their time  i drifted across to the mens fires in search of mulvaney whom i found strategically greasing his feet by the blaze there is nothing particularly lovely in the sight of a private thus engaged after a long days march but when you reflect on the exact proportion of the might majesty dominion and power of the british empire which stands on those feet you take an interest in the proceedings  theres a blister bad luck to ut on the heel said mulvaney i cant touch ut prick ut out little man  ortheris took out his housewife eased the trouble with a needle stabbed mulvaney in the calf with the same weapon and was swiftly kicked into the fire  ive bruk the best av my toes over you ye grinnin child av disruption said mulvaney sitting crosslegged and nursing his feet then seeing me oh uts you sorr be welkim an take that maraudin scutts place jock hold him down on the cindhers for a bit  but ortheris escaped and went elsewhere as i took possession of the hollow he had scraped for himself and lined with his greatcoat learoyd on the other side of the fire grinned affably and in a minute fell fast asleep  theres the height av politeness for you said mulvaney lighting his pipe with a flaming branch but jocks eaten half a box av your sardines at wan gulp an i think the tin too whats the best wid you sorr an how did you happen to be on the losin side this day whin we captured you  the army of the south is winning all along the line i said  then that lines the hangmans rope savin your presence youll learn tomorrow how we rethreated to dhraw thim on before we made thim trouble an thats what a woman does by the same tokin well be attacked before the dawnin an ut would be betther not to slip your boots how do i know that by the light av pure reason here are three companies av us ever so far inside av the enemys flank an a crowd av roarin tarin squealin cavalry gone on just to turn out the whole hornets nest av them av course the enemy will pursue by brigades like as not an thin well have to run for ut mark my words i am av the opinion av polonius whin he said dont fight wid ivry scutt for the pure joy av fightin but if you do knock the nose av him first an frequint we ought to ha gone on an helped the ghoorkhas  but what do you know about polonius i demanded this was a new side of mulvaneys character  all that shakespeare iver wrote an a dale more that the gallery shouted said the man of war carefully lacing his boots did i not tell you av silvers theatre in dublin whin i was younger than i am now an a patron av the drama ould silver wud never pay actorman or woman their just dues an by consequince his compnies was collapsible at the last minut thin the bhoys wud clamor to take a part an oft as not ould silver made them pay for the fun faith ive seen hamlut played wid a new black eye an the queen as full as a cornucopia i remimber wanst hogin that listed in the black tyrone an was shot in south africa he sejuced ould silver into givin him hamluts part instid av me that had a fine fancy for rhetoric in those days av course i wint into the gallery an began to fill the pit wid other peoples hats an i passed the time av day to hogin walkin through denmark like a hamstrung mule wid a pall on his back hamlut sez i theres a hole in your heel pull up your shtockins hamlut sez i hamlut hamlut for the love av decincy dhrop that skull an pull up your shtockins the whole house begun to tell him that he stopped his soliloquishms midbetween my shtockins may be comin down or they may not sez he screwin his eye into the gallery for well he knew who i was but afther this performince is over me an the ghost ll trample the tripes out av you terence wid your asss bray an thats how i come to know about hamlut eyah those days those days did you iver have onendin devilmint an nothin to pay for it in your life sorr  never without having to pay i said  thats thrue tis mane whin you considher on ut but uts the same wid horse or fut a headache if you dhrink an a bellyache if you eat too much an a heartache to kape all down faith the beast only gets the colic an hes the lucky man  he dropped his head and stared into the fire fingering his moustache the while from the far side of the bivouac the voice of corbetnolan senior subaltern of b company uplifted itself in an ancient and much appreciated song of sentiment the men moaning melodiously behind him     the north wind blew coldly she dropped from that hour    my own little kathleen my sweet little kathleen    kathleen my kathleen kathleen omoore  with fortyfive os in the last word even at that distance you might have cut the soft south irish accent with a shovel  for all we take we must pay but the price is cruel high murmured mulvaney when the chorus had ceased  whats the trouble i said gently for i knew that he was a man of an inextinguishable sorrow  hear now said he ye know what i am now i know what i mint to be at the beginnin av my service ive tould you time an again an what i have not dinah shadd has an what am i oh

to the end i said royally but rake up the fire a bit first  i passed ortheriss bayonet for a poker  that shows how little we know what we do said mulvaney putting it aside fire takes all the heart out av the steel an the next time may be that our little man is fighting for his life his bradawl ll break an so youll ha killed him manin no more than to kape yourself warm tis a recruitys thrick that pass the claninrod sorr  i snuggled down abased and after an interval the voice of mulvaney began  did i iver tell you how dinah shadd came to be wife av mine  i dissembled a burning anxiety that i had felt for some monthsever since dinah shadd the strong the patient and the infinitely tender had of her own good love and free will washed a shirt for me moving in a barren land where washing was not  i cant remember i said casually was it before or after you made love to annie bragin and got no satisfaction  the story of annie bragin is written in another place it is one of the many less respectable episodes in mulvaneys checkered career  beforebeforelong before was that business av annie bragin an the corprils ghost niver woman was the worse for me whin i had married dinah theres a time for all things an i know how to kape all things in placebarrin the dhrink that kapes me in my place wid no hope av comin to be aught else  begin at the beginning i insisted mrs mulvaney told me that you married her when you were quartered in krab bokhar barracks  an the same is a cesspit said mulvaney piously she spoke thrue did dinah twas this way talkin av that have ye iver fallen in love

if mulvaney were uninterrupted he would go on the clamor from the bivouac fires beat up to the stars as the rival singers of the companies were pitted against each other  so i felt that way an a bad time ut was wanst bein a fool i wint into the married lines more for the sake av spakin to our ould colorsergint shadd than for any thruck wid womenfolk i was a corpril thenrejuced aftherward but a

know not what vultures tearing his liver    the story of muhammad din    who is the happy man he that sees in his own house at home little children crowned with dust leaping and falling and crying munichandra translated by professor peterson  the poloball was an old one scarred chipped and dinted it stood on the mantelpiece among the pipestems which imam din khitmatgar was cleaning for me  does the heavenborn want this ball said imam din deferentially  the heavenborn set no particular store by it but of what use was a poloball to a khitmatgar  by your honors favor i have a little son he has seen this ball and desires it to play with i do not want it for myself  no one would for an instant accuse portly old imam din of wanting to play with poloballs he carried out the battered thing into the veranda and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks a patter of small feet and the thudthudthud of the ball rolling along the ground evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his treasure but how had he managed to see that poloball  next day coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual i was aware of a small figure in the diningrooma tiny plump figure in a ridiculously inadequate shirt which came perhaps halfway down the tubby stomach it wandered round the room thumb in mouth crooning to itself as it took stock of the pictures undoubtedly this was the little son  he had no business in my room of course but was so deeply absorbed in his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway i stepped into the room and startled him nearly into a fit he sat down on the ground with a gasp his eyes opened and his mouth followed suit i knew what was coming and fled followed by a long dry howl which reached the servants quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever done in ten seconds imam din was in the diningroom then despairing sobs arose and i returned to find imam din admonishing the small sinner who was using most of his shirt as a handkerchief  this boy said imam din judicially is a budmasha big budmash he will without doubt go to the jailkhana for his behavior renewed yells from the penitent and an elaborate apology to myself from imam din  tell the baby said i that the sahib is not angry and take him away imam din conveyed my forgiveness to the offender who had now gathered all his shirt round his neck stringwise and the yell subsided into a sob the two set off for the door his name said imam din as though the name were part of the crime is muhammad din and he is a budmash freed from present danger muhammad din turned round in his fathers arms and said gravely it is true that my name is muhammad din tahib but i am not a budmash i am a man  from that day dated my acquaintance with muhammad din never again did he come into my diningroom but on the neutral ground of the garden we greeted each other with much state though our conversation was confined to talaam tahib from his side and salaam muhammad din from mine daily on my return from office the little white shirt and the fat little body used to rise from the shade of the creepercovered trellis where they had been hid and daily i checked my horse here that my salutation might not be slurred over or given unseemly  muhammad din never had any companions he used to trot about the compound in and out of the castoroil bushes on mysterious errands of his own one day i stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down the grounds he had half buried the poloball in dust and stuck six shriveled old marigold flowers in a circle round it  outside that circle again was a rude square traced out in bits of red brick alternating with fragments of broken china the whole bounded by a little bank of dust the waterman from the wellcurb put in a plea for the small architect saying that it was only the play of a baby and did not much disfigure my garden  heaven knows that i had no intention of touching the childs work then or later but that evening a stroll through the garden brought me unawares full on it so that i trampled before i knew marigoldheads dustbank and fragments of broken soapdish into confusion past all hope of mending next morning i came upon muhammad din crying softly to himself over the ruin i had wrought some one had cruelly told him that the sahib was very angry with him for spoiling the garden and had scattered his rubbish using bad language the while muhammad din labored for an hour at effacing every trace of the dustbank and pottery fragments and it was with a tearful and apologetic face that he said talaam tahib when i came home from office a hasty inquiry resulted in imam din informing muhammad din that by my singular favor he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the groundplan of an edifice which was to eclipse the marigoldpoloball creation  for some months the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble orbit among the castoroil bushes and in the dust always fashioning magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer smooth waterworn pebbles bits of broken glass and feathers pulled i fancy from my fowlsalways alone and always crooning to himself  a gailyspotted seashell was dropped one day close to the last of his little buildings and i looked that muhammad din should build something more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it nor was i disappointed he meditated for the better part of an hour and his crooning rose to a jubilant song then he began tracing in the dust it would certainly be a wondrous palace this one for it was two yards long and a yard broad in groundplan but the palace was never completed  next day there was no muhammad din at the head of the carriagedrive and no talaam tahib to welcome my return i had grown accustomed to the greeting and its omission troubled me next day imam din told me that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine he got the medicine and an english doctor  they have no stamina these brats said the doctor as he left imam dins quarters  a week later though i would have given much to have avoided it i met on the road to the mussulman buryingground imam din accompanied by one other friend carrying in his arms wrapped in a white cloth all that was left of little muhammad din    in flood time     tweed said tae till    what gars ye rin sae still    till said tae tweed    though ye rin wi speed    an i rin slaw    yet where ye droon ae man    i droon twa  there is no getting over the river tonight sahib they say that a bullockcart has been washed down already and the ekka that went over a half hour before you came has not yet reached the far side is the sahib in haste i will drive the fordelephant in to show him ohé mahout there in the shed bring out ram pershad and if he will face the current good an elephant never lies sahib and ram pershad is separated from his friend kala nag he too wishes to cross to the far side well done well done my king go half way across mahoutji and see what the river says well done ram pershad pearl among elephants go into the river hit him on the head fool was the goad made only to scratch thy own fat back with bastard strike strike what are the boulders to thee ram pershad my rustum my mountain of strength go in go in  no sahib it is useless you can hear him trumpet he is telling kala nag that he cannot come over see he has swung round and is shaking his head he is no fool he knows what the barhwi means when it is angry aha indeed thou art no fool my child salaam ram pershad bahadur take him under the trees mahout and see that he gets his spices well done thou chiefest among tuskers salaam to the sirkar and go to sleep  what is to be done the sahib must wait till the river goes down it will shrink tomorrow morning if god pleases or the day after at the latest now why does the sahib get so angry i am his servant before god i did not create this stream what can i do my hut and all that is therein is at the service of the sahib and it is beginning to rain come away my lord how will the river go down for your throwing abuse at it in the old days the english people were not thus the firecarriage has made them soft in the old days when they drave behind horses by day or by night they said naught if a river barred the way or a carriage sat down in the mud it was the will of godnot like a firecarriage which goes and goes and goes and would go though all the devils in the land hung on to its tail the firecarriage hath spoiled the english people after all what is a day lost or for that matter what are two days is the sahib going to his own wedding that he is so mad with haste ho ho ho i am an old man and see few sahibs forgive me if i have forgotten the respect that is due to them the sahib is not angry  his own wedding ho ho ho the mind of an old man is like the numahtree fruit bud blossom and the dead leaves of all the years of the past flourish together old and new and that which is gone out of remembrance all three are there sit on the bedstead sahib and drink milk orwould the sahib in truth care to drink my tobacco it is good it is the tobacco of nuklao my son who is in service there sent it to me drink then sahib if you know how to handle the tube the sahib takes it like a musalman wah wah where did he learn that his own wedding ho ho ho the sahib says that there is no wedding in the matter at all now is it likely that the sahib would speak true talk to me who am only a black man small wonder then that he is in haste thirty years have i beaten the gong at this ford but never have i seen a sahib in such haste thirty years sahib that is a very long time thirty years ago this ford was on the track of the bunjaras and i have seen two thousand packbullocks cross in one night now the rail has come and the firecarriage says buzbuzbuz and a hundred lakhs of maunds slide across that big bridge it is very wonderful but the ford is lonely now that there are no bunjaras to camp under the trees  nay do not trouble to look at the sky without it will rain till the dawn listen the boulders are talking tonight in the bed of the river hear them they would be husking your bones sahib had you tried to cross see i will shut the door and no rain can enter wahi ahi ugh thirty years on the banks of the ford an old man am i andwhere is the oil for the lamp                                            your pardon but because of my years i sleep no sounder than a dog and you moved to the door look then sahib look and listen a full half kos from bank to bank is the stream nowyou can see it under the starsand there are ten feet of water therein it will not shrink because of the anger in your eyes and it will not be quiet on account of your curses which is louder sahibyour voice or the voice of the river call to itperhaps it will be ashamed lie down and sleep afresh sahib i know the anger of the barhwi when there has fallen rain in the foothills i swam the flood once on a night tenfold worse than this and by the favor of god i was released from death when i had come to the very gates thereof  may i tell the tale very good talk i will fill the pipe anew  thirty years ago it was when i was a young man and had but newly come to the ford i was strong then and the bunjaras had no doubt when i said this ford is clear i have toiled all night up to my shoulderblades in running water amid a hundred bullocks mad with fear and have brought them across losing not a hoof when all was done i fetched the shivering men and they gave me for reward the pick of their cattlethe bellbullock of the drove so great was the honor in which i was held but today when the rain falls and the river rises i creep into my hut and whimper like a dog my strength is gone from me i am an old man and the firecarriage has made the ford desolate they were wont to call me the strong one of the barhwi  behold my face sahibit is the face of a monkey and my armit is the arm of an old woman i swear to you sahib that a woman has loved this face and has rested in the hollow of this arm twenty years ago sahib believe me this was true talktwenty years ago  come to the door and look across can you see a thin fire very far away down the stream that is the templefire in the shrine of hanuman of the village of pateera north under the big star is the village itself but it is hidden by a bend of the river is that far to swim sahib would you take off your clothes and adventure yet i swam to pateeranot once but many times and there are muggers in the river too  love knows no caste else why should i a musalman and the son of a musalman have sought a hindu womana widow of the hindusthe sister of the headman of pateera but it was even so they of the headmans household came on a pilgrimage to muttra when she was but newly a bride silver tires were upon the wheels of the bullockcart and silken curtains hid the woman sahib i made no haste in their conveyance for the wind parted the curtains and i saw her when they returned from pilgrimage the boy that was her husband had died and i saw her again in the bullockcart by god these hindus are fools what was it to me whether she was hindu or jainscavenger leper or whole i would have married her and made her a home by the ford the seventh of the nine bars says that a man may not marry one of the idolaters is that truth both shiahs and sunnis say that a musalman may not marry one of the idolaters is the sahib a priest then that he knows so much i will tell him something that he does not know there is neither shiah nor sunni forbidden nor idolater in love and the nine bars are but nine little fagots that the flame of love utterly burns away in truth i would have taken her but what could i do the headman would have sent his men to break my head with staves i am noti was notafraid of any five men but against half a village who can prevail  therefore it was my custom these things having been arranged between us twain to go by night to the village of pateera and there we met among the crops no man knowing aught of the matter behold now i was wont to cross here skirting the jungle to the river bend where the railway bridge is and thence across the elbow of land to pateera the light of the shrine was my guide when the nights were dark that jungle near the river is very full of snakeslittle karaits that sleep on the sandand moreover her brothers would have slain me had they found me in the crops but none knewnone knew save she and i and the blown sand of the riverbed covered the track of my feet in the hot months it was an easy thing to pass from the ford to pateera and in the first rains when the river rose slowly it was an easy thing also i set the strength of my body against the strength of the stream and nightly i ate in my hut here and drank at pateera yonder she had said that one hirnam singh a thief had sought her and he was of a village up the river but on the same bank all sikhs are dogs and they have refused in their folly that good gift of godtobacco i was ready to destroy hirnam singh that ever he had come nigh her and the more because he had sworn to her that she had a lover and that he would lie in wait and give the name to the headman unless she went away with him what curs are these sikhs  after that news i swam always with a little sharp knife in my belt and evil would it have been for a man had he stayed me i knew not the face of hirnam singh but i would have killed any who came between me and her  upon a night in the beginning of the rains i was minded to go across to pateera albeit the river was angry now the nature of the barhwi is this sahib in twenty breaths it comes down from the hills a wall three feet high and i have seen it between the lighting of a fire and the cooking of a chupatty grow from a runnel to a sister of the jumna  when i left this bank there was a shoal a half mile down and i made shift to fetch it and draw breath there ere going forward for i felt the hands of the river heavy upon my heels yet what will a young man not do for loves sake there was but little light from the stars and midway to the shoal a branch of the stinking deodar tree brushed my mouth as i swam that was a sign of heavy rain in the foothills and beyond for the deodar is a strong tree not easily shaken from the hillsides i made haste the river aiding me but ere i had touched the shoal the pulse of the stream beat as it were within me and around and behold the shoal was gone and i rode high on the crest of a wave that ran from bank to bank has the sahib ever been cast into much water that fights and will not let a man use his limbs to me my head upon the water it seemed as though there were naught but water to the worlds end and the river drave me with its driftwood a man is a very little thing in the belly of a flood and this flood though i knew it not was the great flood about which men talk still my liver was dissolved and i lay like a log upon my back in the fear of death there were living things in the water crying and howling grievouslybeasts of the forest and cattle and once the voice of a man asking for help but the rain came and lashed the water white and i heard no more save the roar of the boulders below and the roar of the rain above thus i was whirled downstream wrestling for the breath in me it is very hard to die when one is young can the sahib standing here see the railway bridge look there are the lights of the mailtrain going to peshawur the bridge is now twenty feet above the river but upon that night the water was roaring against the latticework and against the lattice came i feet first but much driftwood was piled there and upon the piers and i took no great hurt only the river pressed me as a strong man presses a weaker scarcely could i take hold of the latticework and crawl to the upper boom sahib the water was foaming across the rails a foot deep judge therefore what manner of flood it must have been i could not hear i could not see i could but lie on the boom and pant for breath  after a while the rain ceased and there came out in the sky certain new washed stars and by their light i saw that there was no end to the black water as far as the eye could travel and the water had risen upon the rails there were dead beasts in the driftwood on the piers and others caught by the neck in the latticework and others not yet drowned who strove to find a foothold on the latticeworkbuffaloes and kine and wild pig and deer one or two and snakes and jackals past all counting their bodies were black upon the left side of the bridge but the smaller of them were forced through the latticework and whirled downstream  thereafter the stars died and the rain came down afresh and the river rose yet more and i felt the bridge begin to stir under me as a man stirs in his sleep ere he wakes but i was not afraid sahib i swear to you that i was not afraid though i had no power in my limbs i knew that i should not die till i had seen her once more but i was very cold and i felt that the bridge must go  there was a trembling in the water such a trembling as goes before the coming of a great wave and the bridge lifted its flank to the rush of that coming so that the right lattice dipped under water and the left rose clear on my beard sahib i am speaking gods truth as a mirzapore stoneboat careens to the wind so the barhwi bridge turned thus and in no other manner  i slid from the boom into deep water and behind me came the wave of the wrath of the river i heard its voice and the scream of the middle part of the bridge as it moved from the piers and sank and i knew no more till i rose in the middle of the great flood i put forth my hand to swim and lo it fell upon the knotted hair of the head of a man he was dead for no one but i the strong one of barhwi could have lived in that race he had been dead full two days for he rode high wallowing and was an aid to me i laughed then knowing for a surety that i should yet see her and take no harm and i twisted my fingers in the hair of the man for i was far spent and together we went down the streamhe the dead and i the living lacking that help i should have sunk the cold was in my marrow and my flesh was ribbed and sodden on my bones but he had no fear who had known the uttermost of the power of the river and i let him go where he chose at last we came into the power of a sidecurrent that set to the right bank and i strove with my feet to draw with it but the dead man swung heavily in the whirl and i feared that some branch had struck him and that he would sink the tops of the tamarisk brushed my knees so i knew we were come into floodwater above the crops and after i let down my legs and felt bottomthe ridge of a fieldand after the dead man stayed upon a knoll under a figtree and i drew my body from the water rejoicing  does the sahib know whither the backwash of the flood had borne me to the knoll which is the eastern boundarymark of the village of pateera no other place i drew the dead man up on the grass for the service that he had done me and also because i knew not whether i should need him again then i went crying thrice like a jackal to the appointed place which was near the byre of the headmans house but my love was already there weeping she feared that the flood had swept my hut at the barhwi ford when i came softly through the ankledeep water she thought it was a ghost and would have fled but i put my arms round her andi was no ghost in those days though i am an old man now ho ho dried corn in truth maize without juice ho ho footnote i grieve to say that the warden of barhwi ford is responsible here for two very bad puns in the vernacularrk  i told her the story of the breaking of the barhwi bridge and she said that i was greater than mortal man for none may cross the barhwi in full flood and i had seen what never man had seen before hand in hand we went to the knoll where the dead lay and i showed her by what help i had made the ford she looked also upon the body under the stars for the latter end of the night was clear and hid her face in her hands crying it is the body of hirnam singh i said the swine is of more use dead than living my beloved and she said surely for he has saved the dearest life in the world to my love none the less he cannot stay here for that would bring shame upon me the body was not a gunshot from her door  then said i rolling the body with my hands god hath judged between us hirnam singh that thy blood might not be upon my head now whether i have done thee a wrong in keeping thee from the burningghat do thou and the crows settle together so i cast him adrift into the floodwater and he was drawn out to the open ever wagging his thick black beard like a priest under the pulpitboard and i saw no more of hirnam singh  before the breaking of the day we two parted and i moved toward such of the jungle as was not flooded with the full light i saw what i had done in the darkness and the bones of my body were loosened in my flesh for there ran two kos of raging water between the village of pateera and the trees of the far bank and in the middle the piers of the barhwi bridge showed like broken teeth in the jaw of an old man nor was there any life upon the watersneither birds nor boats but only an army of drowned thingsbullocks and horses and menand the river was redder than blood from the clay of the foothills never had i seen such a floodnever since that year have i seen the likeand o sahib no man living had done what i had done there was no return for me that day not for all the lands of the headman would i venture a second time without the shield of darkness that cloaks danger i went a kos up the river to the house of a blacksmith saying that the flood had swept me from my hut and they gave me food seven days i stayed with the blacksmith till a boat came and i returned to my house there was no trace of wall or roof or floornaught but a patch of slimy mud judge therefore sahib how far the river must have risen  it was written that i should not die either in my house or in the heart of the barhwi or under the wreck of the barhwi bridge for god sent down hirnam singh two days dead though i know not how the man died to be my buoy and support hirnam singh has been in hell these twenty years and the thought of that night must be the flower of his torment  listen sahib the river has changed its voice it is going to sleep before the dawn to which there is yet one hour with the light it will come down afresh how do i know have i been here thirty years without knowing the voice of the river as a father knows the voice of his son every moment it is talking less angrily i swear that there will be no danger for one hour or perhaps two i cannot answer for the morning be quick sahib i will call ram pershad and he will not turn back this time is the paulin tightly corded upon all the baggage ohé mahout with a mud head the elephant for the sahib and tell them on the far side that there will be no crossing after daylight  money nay sahib i am not of that kind no not even to give sweetmeats to the babyfolk my house look you is empty and i am an old man  dutt ram pershad dutt dutt dutt good luck go with you sahib    my own true ghost story     as i came through the desert thus it was    as i came through the desert  the city of dreadful night  somewhere in the other world where there are books and pictures and plays and shopwindows to look at and thousands of men who spend their lives in building up all four lives a gentleman who writes real stories about the real insides of people and his name is mr walter besant but he will insist upon treating his ghostshe has published half a workshopful of themwith levity he makes his ghostseers talk familiarly and in some cases flirt outrageously with the phantoms you may treat anything from a viceroy to a vernacular paper with levity but you must behave reverently toward a ghost and particularly an indian one  there are in this land ghosts who take the form of fat cold pobby corpses and hide in trees near the roadside till a traveler passes then they drop upon his neck and remain there are also terrible ghosts of women who have died in childbed these wander along the pathways at dusk or hide in the crops near a village and call seductively but to answer their call is death in this world and the next their feet are turned backward that all sober men may recognize them there are ghosts of little children who have been thrown into wells these haunt wellcurbs and the fringes of jungles and wail under the stars or catch women by the wrist and beg to be taken up and carried these and the corpseghosts however are only vernacular articles and do not attack sahibs no native ghost has yet been authentically reported to have frightened an englishman but many english ghosts have scared the life out of both white and black  nearly every other station owns a ghost there are said to be two at simla not counting the woman who blows the bellows at syree dâkbungalow on the old road mussoorie has a house haunted of a very lively thing a white lady is supposed to do nightwatchman round a house in lahore dalhousie says that one of her houses repeats on autumn evenings all the incidents of a horrible horseandprecipice accident murree has a merry ghost and now that she has been swept by cholera will have room for a sorrowful one there are officers quarters in mian mir whose doors open without reason and whose furniture is guaranteed to creak not with the heat of june but with the weight of invisibles who come to lounge in the chair peshawur possesses houses that none will willingly rent and there is somethingnot feverwrong with a big bungalow in allahabad the older provinces simply bristle with haunted houses and march phantom armies along their main thoroughfares  some of the dâkbungalows on the grand trunk road have handy little cemeteries in their compoundwitnesses to the changes and chances of this mortal life in the days when men drove from calcutta to the northwest these bungalows are objectionable places to put up in they are generally very old always dirty while the khansamah is as ancient as the bungalow he either chatters senilely or falls into the long trances of age in both moods he is useless if you get angry with him he refers to some sahib dead and buried these thirty years and says that when he was in that sahibs service not a khansamah in the province could touch him then he jabbers and mows and trembles and fidgets among the dishes and you repent of your irritation  in these dâkbungalows ghosts are most likely to be found and when found they should be made a note of not long ago it was my business to live in dâkbungalows i never inhabited the same house for three nights running and grew to be learned in the breed i lived in governmentbuilt ones with red brick walls and rail ceilings an inventory of the furniture posted in every room and an excited snake at the threshold to give welcome i lived in converted onesold houses officiating as dâkbungalowswhere nothing was in its proper place and there wasnt even a fowl for dinner i lived in secondhand palaces where the wind blew through openwork marble tracery just as uncomfortably as through a broken pane i lived in dâkbungalows where the last entry in the visitors book was fifteen months old and where they slashed off the currykids head with a sword it was my goodluck to meet all sorts of men from sober traveling missionaries and deserters flying from british regiments to drunken loafers who threw whiskey bottles at all who passed and my still greater goodfortune just to escape a maternity case seeing that a fair proportion of the tragedy of our lives out here acted itself in dâkbungalows i wondered that i had met no ghosts a ghost that would voluntarily hang about a dâkbungalow would be mad of course but so many men have died mad in dâkbungalows that there must be a fair percentage of lunatic ghosts  in due time i found my ghost or ghosts rather for there were two of them up till that hour i had sympathized with mr besants method of handling them as shown in the strange case of mr lucraft and other stories i am now in the opposition  we will call the bungalow katmal dâkbungalow but that was the smallest part of the horror a man with a sensitive hide has no right to sleep in dâkbungalows he should marry katmal dâkbungalow was old and rotten and unrepaired the floor was of worn brick the walls were filthy and the windows were nearly black with grime it stood on a bypath largely used by native subdeputy assistants of all kinds from finance to forests but real sahibs were rare the khansamah who was nearly bent double with old age said so  when i arrived there was a fitful undecided rain on the face of the land accompanied by a restless wind and every gust made a noise like the rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddypalms outside the khansamah completely lost his head on my arrival he had served a sahib once did i know that sahib he gave me the name of a wellknown man who has been buried for more than a quarter of a century and showed me an ancient daguerreotype of that man in his prehistoric youth i had seen a steel engraving of him at the head of a double volume of memoirs a month before and i felt ancient beyond telling  the day shut in and the khansamah went to get me food he did not go through the pretence of calling it khanamans victuals he said ratub and that means among other things grubdogs rations there was no insult in his choice of the term he had forgotten the other word i suppose  while he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals i settled myself down after exploring the dâkbungalow there were three rooms beside my own which was a corner kennel each giving into the other through dingy white doors fastened with long iron bars the bungalow was a very solid one but the partitionwalls of the rooms were almost jerrybuilt in their flimsiness every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room down the other three and every footfall came back tremulously from the far walls for this reason i shut the door there were no lampsonly candles in long glass shades an oil wick was set in the bathroom  for bleak unadulterated misery that dâkbungalow was the worst of the many that i had ever set foot in there was no fireplace and the windows would not open so a brazier of charcoal would have been useless the rain and the wind splashed and gurgled and moaned round the house and the toddypalms rattled and roared half a dozen jackals went through the compound singing and a hyena stood afar off and mocked them a hyena would convince a sadducee of the resurrection of the deadthe worst sort of dead then came the ratuba curious meal half native and half english in compositionwith the old khansamah babbling behind my chair about dead and gone english people and the windblown candles playing shadowbopeep with the bed and the mosquitocurtains it was just the sort of dinner and evening to make a man think of every single one of his past sins and of all the others that he intended to commit if he lived  sleep for several hundred reasons was not easy the lamp in the bathroom threw the most absurd shadows into the room and the wind was beginning to talk nonsense  just when the reasons were drowsy with bloodsucking i heard the regularletustakeandheavehimover grunt of dooliebearers in the compound first one doolie came in then a second and then a third i heard the doolies dumped on the ground and the shutter in front of my door shook thats some one trying to come in i said but no one spoke and i persuaded myself that it was the gusty wind the shutter of the room next to mine was attacked flung back and the inner door opened thats some subdeputy assistant i said and he has brought his friends with him now theyll talk and spit and smoke for an hour  but there were no voices and no footsteps no one was putting his luggage into the next room the door shut and i thanked providence that i was to be left in peace but i was curious to know where the doolies had gone i got out of bed and looked into the darkness there was never a sign of a doolie just as i was getting into bed again i heard in the next room the sound that no man in his senses can possibly mistakethe whir of a billiard ball down the length of the slates when the striker is stringing for break no other sound is like it a minute afterward there was another whir and i got into bed i was not frightenedindeed i was not i was very curious to know what had become of the doolies i jumped into bed for that reason  next minute i heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up it is a mistake to say that hair stands up the skin of the head tightens and you can feel a faint prickly bristling all ever the scalp that is the hair sitting up  there was a whir and a click and both sounds could only have been made by one thinga billiard ball i argued the matter out at great length with myself and the more i argued the less probable it seemed that one bed one table and two chairsall the furniture of the room next to minecould so exactly duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards after another cannon a threecushion one to judge by the whir i argued no more i had found my ghost and would have given worlds to have escaped from that dâkbungalow i listened and with each listen the game grew clearer there was whir on whir and click on click sometimes there was a double click and a whir and another click beyond any sort of doubt people were playing billiards in the next room and the next room was not big enough to hold a billiard table  between the pauses of the wind i heard the game go forwardstroke after stroke i tried to believe that i could not hear voices but that attempt was a failure  do you know what fear is not ordinary fear of insult injury or death but abject quivering dread of something that you cannot seefear that dries the inside of the mouth and half of the throatfear that makes you sweat on the palms of the hands and gulp in order to keep the uvula at work this is a fine feara great cowardice and must be felt to be appreciated the very improbability of billiards in a dâkbungalow proved the reality of the thing no mandrunk or sobercould imagine a game a billiards or invent the spitting crack of a screwcannon  a severe course of dâkbungalows has this disadvantageit breeds infinite credulity if a man said to a confirmed dâkbungalowhaunterthere is a corpse in the next room and theres a mad girl in the next but one and the woman and man on that camel have just eloped from a place sixty miles away the hearer would not disbelieve because he would know that nothing is too wild grotesque or horrible to happen in a dâkbungalow  this credulity unfortunately extends to ghosts a rational person fresh from his own house would have turned on his side and slept i did not so surely as i was given up as a bad carcass by the scores of things in the bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart so surely did i hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the echoing room behind the ironbarred door my dominant fear was that the players might want a marker it was an absurd fear because creatures who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities i only know that that was my terror and it was real  after a long long while the game stopped and the door banged i slept because i was dead tired otherwise i should have preferred to have kept awake not for everything in asia would i have dropped the doorbar and peered into the dark of the next room  when the morning came i considered that i had done well and wisely and inquired for the means of departure  by the way khansamah i said what were those three doolies doing in my compound in the night  there were no doolies said the khansamah  i went into the next room and the daylight streamed through the open door i was immensely brave i would at that hour have played black pool with the owner of the big black pool down below  has this place always been a dâkbungalow i asked  no said the khansamah ten or twenty years ago i have forgotten how long it was a billiardroom  a how much  a billiardroom for the sahibs who built the railway i was khansamah then in the big house where all the railwaysahibs lived and i used to come across with brandyshrab these three rooms were all one and they held a big table on which the sahibs played every evening but the sahibs are all dead now and the railway runs you say nearly to kabul  do you remember anything about the sahibs  it is long ago but i remember that one sahib a fat man and always angry was playing here one night and he said to memangal khan brandypani do and i filled the glass and he bent over the table to strike and his head fell lower and lower till it hit the table and his spectacles came off and when wethe sahibs and i myselfran to lift him he was dead i helped to carry him out aha he was a strong sahib but he is dead and i old mangal khan am still living by your favor  that was more than enough i had my ghosta firsthand authenticated article i would write to the society for psychical researchi would paralyze the empire with the news but i would first of all put eighty miles of assessed cropland between myself and that dâkbungalow before nightfall the society might send their regular agent to investigate later on  i went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down the facts of the case as i smoked i heard the game begin againwith a miss in balk this time for the whir was a short one  the door was open and i could see into the room clickclick that was a cannon i entered the room without fear for there was sunlight within and a fresh breeze without the unseen game was going on at a tremendous rate and well it might when a restless little rat was running to and fro inside the dingy ceilingcloth and a piece of loose windowsash was making fifty breaks off the windowbolt as it shook in the breeze  impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls impossible to mistake the whir of a ball over the slate but i was to be excused even when i shut my enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously like that of a fast game  entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows kadir baksh  this bungalow is very bad and lowcaste no wonder the presence was disturbed and is speckled three sets of dooliebearers came to the bungalow late last night when i was sleeping outside and said that it was their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the english people what honor has the khansamah they tried to enter but i told them to go no wonder if these oorias have been here that the presence is sorely spotted it is shame and the work of a dirty man  kadir baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two annas for rent in advance and then beyond my earshot had beaten them with the big green umbrella whose use i could never before divine but kadir baksh has no notions of morality  there was an interview with the khansamah but as he promptly lost his head wrath gave place to pity and pity led to a long conversation in the course of which he put the fat engineersahibs tragic death in three separate stationstwo of them fifty miles away the third shift was to calcutta and there the sahib died while driving a dogcart  if i had encouraged him the khansamah would have wandered all through bengal with his corpse  i did not go away as soon as i intended i stayed for the night while the wind and the rat and the sash and the windowbolt played a dingdong hundred and fifty up then the wind ran out and the billiards stopped and i felt that i had ruined my one genuine hallmarked ghost story  had i only stopped at the proper time i could have made anything out of it  that was the bitterest thought of all    the big drunk draf     were goin ome were goin ome      our ship is at the shore    an you mus pack your aversack      for we wont come back no more    ho dont you grieve for me      my lovely mary ann    for ill marry you yet on a fourpny bit      as a timeexpired maaan  barrack room ballad  an awful thing has happened my friend private mulvaney who went home in the serapis timeexpired not very long ago has come back to india as a civilian it was all dinah shadds fault she could not stand the poky little lodgings and she missed her servant abdullah more than words could tell the fact was that the mulvaneys had been out here too long and had lost touch of england  mulvaney knew a contractor on one of the new central india lines and wrote to him for some sort of work the contractor said that if mulvaney could pay the passage he would give him command of a gang of coolies for old sakes sake the pay was eightyfive rupees a month and dinah shadd said that if terence did not accept she would make his life a basted purgathory therefore the mulvaneys came out as civilians which was a great and terrible fall though mulvaney tried to disguise it by saying that he was kernel on the railway line an a consequinshal man  he wrote me an invitation on a toolindent form to visit him and i came down to the funny little construction bungalow at the side of the line dinah shadd had planted peas about and about and nature had spread all manner of green stuff round the place there was no change in mulvaney except the change of clothing which was deplorable but could not be helped he was standing upon his trolly haranguing a gangman and his shoulders were as well drilled and his big thick chin was as cleanshaven as ever  im a civilian now said mulvaney cud you tell that i was iver a martial man

sundown  when we three were comfortably settled under the big sisham in front of the bungalow and the first rush of questions and answers about privates ortheris and learoyd and old times and places

be an all the ould days shut up along wid your papers eyah im growin rusty an tis the will av god that a man mustnt serve his quane for time an all  he helped himself to a fresh peg and sighed furiously  let your beard grow mulvaney said i and then you wont be troubled with those notions youll be a real civilian  dinah shadd had told me in the drawingroom of her desire to coax mulvaney into letting his beard grow twas so civilianlike said poor dinah who hated her husbands hankering for his old life  dinah shadd youre a dishgrace to an honust clanescraped man said mulvaney without

pullin hair on their way to the sea  he threw himself back in the chair chuckled and was silent  mrs mulvaney i said please take up the whiskey and dont let him have it until he has told the story  dinah shadd dexterously whipped the bottle away saying at the same time tis nothing to be proud av and thus captured by the enemy mulvaney spake  twas on chuseday week i was behaderin round wid the

me still    one moments comfort in my matchless ill  shadow houses  this tale may be explained by those who know how souls are made and where the bounds of the possible are put down i have lived long enough in this india to know that it is best to know nothing and can only write the story as it happened  dumoise was our civil surgeon at meridki and we called him dormouse because he was a round little sleepy little man he was a good doctor and never quarreled with any one not even with our deputy commissioner who had the manners of a bargee and the tact of a horse he married a girl as round and as sleepylooking as himself she was a miss hillardyce daughter of squash hillardyce of the berars who married his chiefs daughter by mistake but that is another story                                            a honeymoon in india is seldom more than a week long but there is nothing to hinder a couple from extending it over two or three years india is a delightful country for married folk who are wrapped up in one another they can live absolutely alone and without interruptionjust as the dormice did those two little people retired from the world after their marriage and were very happy they were forced of course to give occasional dinners but they made no friends thereby and the station went its own way and forgot them only saying occasionally that dormouse was the best of good fellows though dull a civil surgeon who never quarrels is a rarity appreciated as such  few people can afford to play robinson crusoe anywhereleast of all in india where we are few in the land and very much dependent on each others kind offices dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the world for a year and he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of typhoid broke out in the station in the heart of the cold weather and his wife went down he was a shy little man and five days were wasted before he realized that mrs dumoise was burning with something worse than simple fever and three days more passed before he ventured to call on mrs shute the engineers wife and timidly speak about his trouble  nearly every household in india knows that doctors are very helpless in typhoid the battle must be fought out between death and the nurses minute by minute and degree by degree mrs shute almost boxed dumoises ears for what she called his criminal delay and went off at once to look after the poor girl we had seven cases of typhoid in the station that winter and as the average of death is about one in every five cases we felt certain that we should have to lose somebody but all did their best the women sat up nursing the women and the men turned to and tended the bachelors who were down and we wrestled with those typhoid cases for fiftysix days and brought them through the valley of the shadow in triumph but just when we thought all was over and were going to give a dance to celebrate the victory little mrs dumoise got a relapse and died in a week and the station went to the funeral dumoise broke down utterly at the brink of the grave and had to be taken away  after the death dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be comforted he did his duties perfectly but we all felt that he should go on leave and the other men of his own service told him so dumoise was very thankful for the suggestionhe was thankful for anything in those daysand went to chini on a walkingtour chini is some twenty marches from simla in the heart of the hills and the scenery is good if you are in trouble you pass through big still deodarforests and under big still cliffs and over big still grassdowns swelling like a womans breasts and the wind across the grass and the rain among the deodars sayshushhushhush so little dumoise was packed off to chini to wear down his grief with a fullplate camera and a rifle he took also a useless bearer because the man had been his wifes favorite servant he was idle and a thief but dumoise trusted everything to him  on his way back from chini dumoise turned aside to bagi through the forest reserve which is on the spur of mount huttoo some men who have traveled more than a little say that the march from kotegarh to bagi is one of the finest in creation it runs through dark wet forest and ends suddenly in bleak nipped hillside and black rocks bagi dâkbungalow is open to all the winds and is bitterly cold few people go to bagi perhaps that was the reason why dumoise went there he halted at seven in the evening and his bearer went down the hillside to the village to engage coolies for the next days march the sun had set and the nightwinds were beginning to croon among the rocks dumoise leaned on the railing of the veranda waiting for his bearer to return the man came back almost immediately after he had disappeared and at such a rate that dumoise fancied he must have crossed a bear he was running as hard as he could up the face of the hill  but there was no bear to account for his terror he raced to the veranda and fell down the blood spurting from his nose and his face irongrey then he gurgledi have seen the memsahib i have seen the memsahib  where said dumoise  down there walking on the road to the village she was in a blue dress and she lifted the veil of her bonnet and saidram dass give my salaams to the sahib and tell him that i shall meet him next month at nuddea then i ran away because i was afraid  what dumoise said or did i do not know ram dass declares that he said nothing but walked up and down the veranda all the cold night waiting for the memsahib to come up the hill and stretching out his arms into the dark like a madman but no memsahib came and next day he went on to simla crossquestioning the bearer every hour  ram dass could only say that he had met mrs dumoise and that she had lifted up her veil and given him the message which he had faithfully repeated to dumoise to this statement ram dass adhered he did not know where nuddea was had no friends at nuddea and would most certainly never go to nuddea even though his pay were doubled  nuddea is in bengal and has nothing whatever to do with a doctor serving in the punjab it must be more than twelve hundred miles south of meridki  dumoise went through simla without halting and returned to meridki there to take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him during his tour there were some dispensary accounts to be explained and some recent orders of the surgeongeneral to be noted and altogether the takingover was a full days work in the evening dumoise told his locum tenens who was an old friend of his bachelor days what had happened at bagi and the man said that ram dass might as well have chosen tuticorin while he was about it  at that moment a telegraphpeon came in with a telegram from simla ordering dumoise not to take over charge at meridki but to go at once to nuddea on special duty there was a nasty outbreak of cholera at nuddea and the bengal government being shorthanded as usual had borrowed a surgeon from the punjab  dumoise threw the telegram across the table and saidwell  the other doctor said nothing it was all that he could say  then he remembered that dumoise had passed through simla on his way from bagi and thus might possibly have heard first news of the impending transfer  he tried to put the question and the implied suspicion into words but dumoise stopped him withif i had desired that i should never have come back from chini i was shooting there i wish to live for i have things to do  but i shall not be sorry  the other man bowed his head and helped in the twilight to pack up dumoises just opened trunks ram dass entered with the lamps  where is the sahib going he asked  to nuddea said dumoise softly  ram dass clawed dumoises knees and boots and begged him not to go ram dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room then he wrapped up all his belongings and came back to ask for a character he was not going to nuddea to see his sahib die and perhaps to die himself  so dumoise gave the man his wages and went down to nuddea alone the other doctor bidding him goodbye as one under sentence of death  eleven days later he had joined his memsahib and the bengal government had to borrow a fresh doctor to cope with that epidemic at nuddea the first importation lay dead in chooadanga dâk bungalow    the drums of the fore and aft  and a little child shall lead them  in the army list they still stand as the fore and fit princess hohenzollernsigmaringenauspachs merthertydfilshire own royal loyal light infantry regimental district 329a but the army through all its barracks and canteens knows them now as the fore and aft they may in time do something that shall make their new title honorable but at present they are bitterly ashamed and the man who calls them fore and aft does so at the risk of the head which is on his shoulders  two words breathed into the stables of a certain cavalry regiment will bring the men out into the streets with belts and mops and bad language but a whisper of fore and aft will bring out this regiment with rifles  their one excuse is that they came again and did their best to finish the job in style but for a time all their world knows that they were openly beaten whipped dumbcowed shaking and afraid the men know it their officers know it the horse guards know it and when the next war comes the enemy will know it also there are two or three regiments of the line that have a black mark against their names which they will then wipe out and it will be excessively inconvenient for the troops upon whom they do their wiping  the courage of the british soldier is officially supposed to be above proof and as a general rule it is so the exceptions are decently shoveled out of sight only to be referred to in the freshet of unguarded talk that occasionally swamps a messtable at midnight then one hears strange and horrible stories of men not following their officers of orders being given by those who had no right to give them and of disgrace that but for the standing luck of the british army might have ended in brilliant disaster these are unpleasant stories to listen to and the messes tell them under their breath sitting by the big wood fires and the young officer bows his head and thinks to himself please god his men shall never behave unhandily  the british soldier is not altogether to be blamed for occasional lapses but this verdict he should not know a moderately intelligent general will waste six months in mastering the craft of the particular war that he may be waging a colonel may utterly misunderstand the capacity of his regiment for three months after it has taken the field and even a company commander may err and be deceived as to the temper and temperament of his own handful wherefore the soldier and the soldier of today more particularly should not be blamed for falling back he should be shot or hanged afterwardpour encourager les autres but he should not be vilified in newspapers for that is want of tact and waste of space  he has let us say been in the service of the empress for perhaps four years he will leave in another two years he has no inherited morals and four years are not sufficient to drive toughness into his fibre or to teach him how holy a thing is his regiment he wants to drink he wants to enjoy himselfin india he wants to save moneyand he does not in the least like getting hurt he has received just sufficient education to make him understand half the purport of the orders he receives and to speculate on the nature of clean incised and shattering wounds thus if he is told to deploy under fire preparatory to an attack he knows that he runs a very great risk of being killed while he is deploying and suspects that he is being thrown away to gain ten minutes time he may either deploy with desperate swiftness or he may shuffle or bunch or break according to the discipline under which he has lain for four years  armed with imperfect knowledge cursed with the rudiments of an imagination hampered by the intense selfishness of the lower classes and unsupported by any regimental associations this young man is suddenly introduced to an enemy who in eastern lands is always ugly generally tall and hairy and frequently noisy if he looks to the right and the left and sees old soldiersmen of twelve years service who he knows know what they are abouttaking a charge rush or demonstration without embarrassment he is consoled and applies his shoulder to the butt of his rifle with a stout heart his peace is the greater if he hears a senior who has taught him his soldiering and broken his head on occasion whisperingtheyll shout and carry on like this for five minutes then theyll rush in and then weve got em by the short hairs  but on the other hand if he sees only men of his own term of service turning white and playing with their triggers and sayingwhat the hells up now while the company commanders are sweating into their swordhilts and shoutingfrontrank fix bayonets steady theresteady sight for three hundredno for five lie down all steady frontrank kneel and so forth he becomes unhappy and grows acutely miserable when he hears a comrade turn over with the rattle of fireirons falling into the fender and the grunt of a poleaxed ox if he can be moved about a little and allowed to watch the effect of his own fire on the enemy he feels merrier and may be then worked up to the blind passion of fighting which is contrary to general belief controlled by a chilly devil and shakes men like ague if he is not moved about and begins to feel cold at the pit of the stomach and in that crisis is badly mauled and hears orders that were never given he will break and he will break badly and of all things under the sight of the sun there is nothing more terrible than a broken british regiment when the worst comes to the worst and the panic is really epidemic the men must be een let go and the company commanders had better escape to the enemy and stay there for safetys sake if they can be made to come again they are not pleasant men to meet because they will not break twice  about thirty years from this date when we have succeeded in halfeducating everything that wears trousers our army will be a beautifully unreliable machine it will know too much and it will do too little later still when all men are at the mental level of the officer of today it will sweep the earth speaking roughly you must employ either blackguards or gentlemen or best of all blackguards commanded by gentlemen to do butchers work with efficiency and despatch the ideal soldier should of course think for himselfthe pocketbook says so unfortunately to attain this virtue he has to pass through the phase of thinking of himself and that is misdirected genius a blackguard may be slow to think for himself but he is genuinely anxious to kill and a little punishment teaches him how to guard his own skin and perforate anothers a powerfully prayerful highland regiment officered by rank presbyterians is perhaps one degree more terrible in action than a hardbitten thousand of irresponsible irish ruffians led by most improper young unbelievers but these things prove the rulewhich is that the midway men are not to be trusted alone they have ideas about the value of life and an upbringing that has not taught them to go on and take the chances they are carefully unprovided with a backing of comrades who have been shot over and until that backing is reintroduced as a great many regimental commanders intend it shall be they are more liable to disgrace themselves than the size of the empire or the dignity of the army allows their officers are as good as good can be because their training begins early and god has arranged that a cleanrun youth of the british middle classes shall in the matter of backbone brains and bowels surpass all other youths for this reason a child of eighteen will stand up doing nothing with a tin sword in his hand and joy in his heart until he is dropped if he dies he dies like a gentleman if he lives he writes home that he has been potted sniped chipped or cut over and sits down to besiege government for a woundgratuity until the next little war breaks out when he perjures himself before a medical board blarneys his colonel burns incense round his adjutant and is allowed to go to the front once more  which homily brings me directly to a brace of the most finished little fiends that ever banged drum or tootled fife in the band of a british regiment they ended their sinful career by open and flagrant mutiny and were shot for it their names were jakin and lewpiggy lewand they were bold bad drummerboys both of them frequently birched by the drummajor of the fore and aft  jakin was a stunted child of fourteen and lew was about the same age when not looked after they smoked and drank they swore habitually after the manner of the barrackroom which is coldswearing and comes from between clinched teeth and they fought religiously once a week jakin had sprung from some london gutter and may or may not have passed through dr barnados hands ere he arrived at the dignity of drummerboy lew could remember nothing except the regiment and the delight of listening to the band from his earliest years he hid somewhere in his grimy little soul a genuine love for music and was most mistakenly furnished with the head of a cherub insomuch that beautiful ladies who watched the regiment in church were wont to speak of him as a darling they never heard his vitriolic comments on their manners and morals as he walked back to barracks with the band and matured fresh causes of offence against jakin  the other drummerboys hated both lads on account of their illogical conduct jakin might be pounding lew or lew might be rubbing jakins head in the dirt but any attempt at aggression on the part of an outsider was met by the combined forces of lew and jakin and the consequences were painful the boys were the ishmaels of the corps but wealthy ishmaels for they sold battles in alternate weeks for the sport of the barracks when they were not pitted against other boys and thus amassed money  on this particular day there was dissension in the camp they had just been convicted afresh of smoking which is bad for little boys who use plugtobacco and lews contention was that jakin had stunk so orrid bad from keepin the pipe in pocket that he and he alone was responsible for the birching they were both tingling under  i tell you i id the pipe back o barricks said jakin pacifically  youre a bloomin liar said lew without heat  youre a bloomin little barstard said jakin strong in the knowledge that his own ancestry was unknown  now there is one word in the extended vocabulary of barrackroom abuse that cannot pass without comment you may call a man a thief and risk nothing you may even call him a coward without finding more than a boot whiz past your ear but you must not call a man a bastard unless you are prepared to prove it on his front teeth  you might ha kep that till i wasnt so sore said lew sorrowfully dodging round jakins guard  ill make you sorer said jakin genially and got home on lews alabaster forehead all would have gone well and this story as the books say would never have been written had not his evil fate prompted the bazarsergeants son a long employless man of five and twenty to put in an appearance after the first round he was eternally in need of money and knew that the boys had silver  fighting again said he ill report you to my father and hell report you to the colorsergeant  whats that to you said jakin with an unpleasant dilation of the nostrils  oh nothing to me youll get into trouble and youve been up too often to afford that  what the hell do you know about what weve done asked lew the seraph you arent in the army you lousy cadging civilian  he closed in on the mans left flank  jes cause you find two gentlemen settlin their differences with their fistes you stick in your ugly nose where you arent wanted run ome to your arfcaste slut of a maor well give you whatfor said jakin  the man attempted reprisals by knocking the boys heads together the scheme would have succeeded had not jakin punched him vehemently in the stomach or had lew refrained from kicking his shins they fought together bleeding and breathless for half an hour and after heavy punishment triumphantly pulled down their opponent as terriers pull down a jackal  now gasped jakin ill give you whatfor he proceeded to pound the mans features while lew stamped on the outlying portions of his anatomy chivalry is not a strong point in the composition of the average drummerboy he fights as do his betters to make his mark  ghastly was the ruin that escaped and awful was the wrath of the bazarsergeant awful too was the scene in orderlyroom when the two reprobates appeared to answer the charge of halfmurdering a civilian the bazarsergeant thirsted for a criminal action and his son lied the boys stood to attention while the black clouds of evidence accumulated  you little devils are more trouble than the rest of the regiment put together said the colonel angrily one might as well admonish thistledown and i cant well put you in cells or under stoppages you must be flogged again  beg y pardon sir cant we say nothin in our own defence sir shrilled jakin  hey what are you going to argue with me said the colonel  no sir said lew but if a man come to you sir and said he was going to report you sir for aving a bit of a turnup with a friend sir an wanted to get money out o you sir  the orderlyroom exploded in a roar of laughter well said the colonel  that was what that measly jarnwar there did sir and ed a done it sir if we adnt prevented im we didnt it im much sir e adnt no manner o right to interfere with us sir i dont mind bein flogged by the drummajor sir nor yet reported by any corpral but imbut i dont think its fair sir for a civilian to come an talk over a man in the army  a second shout of laughter shook the orderlyroom but the colonel was grave  what sort of characters have these boys he asked of the regimental sergeantmajor  accordin to the bandmaster sir returned that revered officialthe only soul in the regiment whom the boys fearedthey do everything but lie sir  is it like wed go for that man for fun sir said lew pointing to the plaintiff  oh admonishedadmonished said the colonel testily and when the boys had gone he read the bazarsergeants son a lecture on the sin of unprofitable meddling and gave orders that the bandmaster should keep the drums in better discipline  if either of you come to practice again with so much as a scratch on your two ugly little faces thundered the bandmaster ill tell the drummajor to take the skin off your backs understand that you young devils  then he repented of his speech for just the length of time that lew looking like a seraph in red worsted embellishments took the place of one of the trumpetsin hospitaland rendered the echo of a battlepiece lew certainly was a musician and had often in his more exalted moments expressed a yearning to master every instrument of the band  theres nothing to prevent your becoming a bandmaster lew said the bandmaster who had composed waltzes of his own and worked day and night in the interests of the band  what did he say demanded jakin after practice  said i might be a bloomin bandmaster an be asked in to ave a glass o sherrywine on messnights  ho said you might be a bloomin noncombatant did e thats just about wot e would say when ive put in my boys serviceits a bloomin shame that doesnt count for pensionill take on a privit then ill be a lance in a yearknowin what i know about the ins an outs o things in three years ill be a bloomin sergeant i wont marry then not i ill old on and learn the orfcers ways an apply for exchange into a regment that doesnt know all about me then ill be a bloomin orfcer then ill ask you to ave a glass o sherrywine mister lew an youll bloomin well ave to stay in the hantyroom while the messsergeant brings it to your dirty ands  spose im going to be a bandmaster not i quite ill be a orfcer too theres nothin like taking to a thing an stickin to it the schoolmaster says the regment dont go ome for another seven years ill be a lance then or near to  thus the boys discussed their futures and conducted themselves with exemplary piety for a week that is to say lew started a flirtation with the colorsergeants daughter aged thirteennot as he explained to jakin with any intention o matrimony but by way o keepin my and in and the blackhaired cris delighan enjoyed that flirtation more than previous ones and the other drummerboys raged furiously together and jakin preached sermons on the dangers of bein tangled along o petticoats  but neither love nor virtue would have held lew long in the paths of propriety had not the rumor gone abroad that the regiment was to be sent on active service to take part in a war which for the sake of brevity we will call the war of the lost tribes  the barracks had the rumor almost before the messroom and of all the nine hundred men in barracks not ten had seen a shot fired in anger the colonel had twenty years ago assisted at a frontier expedition one of the majors had seen service at the cape a confirmed deserter in e company had helped to clear streets in ireland but that was all the regiment had been put by for many years the overwhelming mass of its rank and file had from three to four years service the noncommissioned officers were under thirty years old and men and sergeants alike had forgotten to speak of the stories written in brief upon the colorsthe new colors that had been formally blessed by an archbishop in england ere the regiment came away  they wanted to go to the frontthey were enthusiastically anxious to gobut they had no knowledge of what war meant and there was none to tell them they were an educated regiment the percentage of schoolcertificates in their ranks was high and most of the men could do more than read and write they had been recruited in loyal observance of the territorial idea but they themselves had no notion of that idea they were made up of drafts from an overpopulated manufacturing district the system had put flesh and muscle upon their small bones but it could not put heart into the sons of those who for generations had done overmuch work for overscanty pay had sweated in dryingrooms stooped over looms coughed among whitelead and shivered on limebarges the men had found food and rest in the army and now they were going to fight niggerspeople who ran away if you shook a stick at them  wherefore they cheered lustily when the rumor ran and the shrewd clerkly noncommissioned officers speculated on the chances of batta and of saving their pay at headquarters men saidthe fore and fit have never been under fire within the last generation let us therefore break them in easily by setting them to guard lines of communication and this would have been done but for the fact that british regiments were wantedbadly wantedat the front and there were doubtful native regiments that could fill the minor duties brigade em with two strong regiments said headquarters they may be knocked about a bit but theyll learn their business before they come through nothing like a nightalarm and a little cuttingup of stragglers to make a regiment smart in the field wait till theyve had half a dozen sentries throats cut  the colonel wrote with delight that the temper of his men was excellent that the regiment was all that could be wished and as sound as a bell the majors smiled with a sober joy and the subalterns waltzed in pairs down the messroom after dinner and nearly shot themselves at revolver practice but there was consternation in the hearts of jakin and lew what was to be done with the drums would the band go to the front how many of the drums would accompany the regiment  they took council together sitting in a tree and smoking  its more than a bloomin tossup theyll leave us beind at the depot with the women youll like that said jakin sarcastically  cause o cris y mean wots a woman or a ole bloomin depôt o women longside o the chanst of fieldservice you know im as keen on goin as you said lew  wish i was a bloomin bugler said jakin sadly theyll take tom kidd along that i can plaster a wall with an like as not they wont take us  then lets go an

the branch and gazed across the plain  lew said he theres the colonel coming colonels a good old beggar lets go an talk to im  lew nearly fell out of the tree at the audacity of the suggestion like jakin he feared not god neither regarded he man but there are limits even to the audacity of drummerboy and to speak to a colonel was   but jakin had slid down the trunk and doubled in the direction of the colonel that officer was walking wrapped in thought and visions of a c byes even a kcb for had he not at command one of the best regiments of the linethe fore and fit and he was aware of two small boys charging down upon him once before it had been solemnly reported to him that the drums were in a state of mutiny jakin and lew being the ringleaders this looked like an organized conspiracy  the boys halted at twenty yards walked to the regulation four paces and saluted together each as well setup as a ramrod and little taller  the colonel was in a genial mood the boys appeared very forlorn and unprotected on the desolate plain and one of them was handsome  well said the colonel recognizing them are you going to pull me down in the open im sure i never interfere with you even thoughhe sniffed suspiciouslyyou have been smoking  it was time to strike while the iron was hot their hearts beat tumultuously  beg y pardon sir began jakin the regments ordered on active service sir  so i believe said the colonel courteously  is the band goin sir said both together then without pause were goin sir aint we  you said the colonel stepping back the more fully to take in the two small figures you youd die in the first march  no we wouldnt sir we can march with the regiment anywheresprade an anywhere else said jakin  if tom kidd goes ell shut up like a claspknife said lew tom as very close veins in both is legs sir  very how much  very close veins sir thats why they swells after long prade sir if e can go we can go sir  again the colonel looked at them long and intently  yes

one to be considered of on our account sir  you poor little sprats and you want to go up to the front with the regiment do you why  ive wore the queens uniform for two years said jakin its very ard

sir  the colonel made no answer for a long time then he said quietlyif youre passed by the doctor i dare say you can go i shouldnt smoke if i were you  the boys saluted and disappeared the colonel walked home and told the story to his wife who nearly cried over it the colonel was well pleased if that was the temper of the children what would not the men do  jakin and lew entered the boys barrackroom with great stateliness and refused to hold any conversation with their comrades for at least ten minutes then bursting with pride jakin drawledive bin intervooin the colonel good old beggar is the colonel says i to im colonel says i let me go the front along o the regment to the front you shall go says e an i only wish there was more like you among the dirty little devils that bang the bloomin drums kidd if you throw your coutrements at me for tellin you the truth to your own advantage your legs ll swell  none the less there was a battleroyal in the barrackroom for the boys were consumed with envy and hate and neither jakin nor lew behaved in conciliatory wise  im goin out to say adoo to my girl said lew to cap the climax dont none o you touch my kit because its wanted for active service me bein specially invited to go by the colonel  he strolled forth and whistled in the clump of trees at the back of the married quarters till cris came to him and the preliminary kisses being given and taken lew began to explain the situation  im goin to the front with the regment he said valiantly  piggy youre a little liar said cris but her heart misgave her for lew was not in the habit of lying  liar yourself cris said lew slipping an arm round her im goin when the regment marches out youll see me with em all galliant and gay give us another kiss cris on the strength of

you a new buttonbag as nice as i know how she whispered  put some o your air into it cris an ill keep it in my pocket so longs im alive  then cris wept anew and the interview ended public feeling among the drummerboys rose to fever pitch and the lives of jakin and lew became unenviable not only had they been permitted to enlist two years before the regulation boys agefourteenbut by virtue it seemed of their extreme youth they were allowed to go to the frontwhich thing had not happened to actingdrummers within the knowledge of boy the band which was to accompany the regiment had been cut down to the regulation twenty men the surplus returning to the ranks jakin and lew were attached to the band as supernumeraries though they would much have preferred being company buglers  dont matter much said jakin after the medical inspection be thankful that were lowed to go at all the doctor e said that if we could stand what we took from the bazarsergeants son wed stand pretty nigh anything  which we will said lew looking tenderly at the ragged and illmade housewife that cris had given him with a lock of her hair worked into a sprawling l upon the cover  it was the best i could she sobbed i wouldnt let mother nor the sergeants tailor elp me keep it always piggy an remember i love you true  they marched to the railway station nine hundred and sixty strong and every soul in cantonments turned out to see them go the drummers gnashed their teeth at jakin and lew marching with the band the married women wept upon the platform and the regiment cheered its noble self black in the face  a nice level lot said the colonel to the secondincommand as they watched the first four companies entraining  fit to do anything said the secondincommand enthusiastically but it seems to me theyre a thought too young and tender for the work in hand its bitter cold up at the front now  theyre sound enough said the colonel we must take our chance of sick casualties  so they went northward ever northward past droves and droves of camels armies of camp followers and legions of laden mules the throng thickening day by day till with a shriek the train pulled up at a hopelessly congested junction where six lines of temporary track accommodated six fortywagon trains where whistles blew babus sweated and commissariat officers swore from dawn till far into the night amid the winddriven chaff of the fodderbales and the lowing of a thousand steers  hurry upyoure badly wanted at the front was the message that greeted the fore and aft and the occupants of the red cross carriages told the same tale  tisnt so much the bloomin fighting gasped a headbound trooper of hussars to a knot of admiring fore and afts tisnt so much the bloomin fightin though theres enough o that its the bloomin food an the bloomin climate frost all night cept when it hails and biling sun all day and the water stinks fit to knock you down i got my ead chipped like a egg ive got pneumonia too an my guts is all out o order taint no bloomin picnic in those parts i can tell you  wot are the niggers like demanded a private  theres some prisoners in that train yonder go an look at em theyre the aristocracy o the country the common folk are a dashed sight uglier if you want to know what they fight with reach under my seat an pull out the long knife thats there  they dragged out and beheld for the first time the grim bonehandled triangular afghan knife it was almost as long as lew  thats the thing to jint ye said the trooper feebly  it can take off a mans arm at the shoulder as easy as slicing butter i halved the beggar that used that un but theres more of his likes up above they dont understand thrustin but theyre devils to slice  the men strolled across the tracks to inspect the afghan prisoners they were unlike any niggers that the fore and aft had ever metthese huge blackhaired scowling sons of the beniisrael as the men stared the afghans spat freely and muttered one to another with lowered eyes  my eyes wot awful swine said jakin who was in the rear of the procession say old man how you got puckrowed eh kiswasti you wasnt hanged for your ugly face hey  the tallest of the company turned his legirons clanking at the movement and stared at the boy see he cried to his fellows in pushto they send children against us what a people and what fools  hya said jakin nodding his head cheerily you go downcountry khana get peenikapanee getlive like a bloomin raja ke marfik thats a better bandobust than baynit get it in your innards goodbye ole man take care o your beautiful figureed an try to look kushy  the men laughed and fell in for their first march when they began to realize that a soldiers life was not all beer and skittles they were much impressed with the size and bestial ferocity of the niggers whom they had now learned to call paythans and more with the exceeding discomfort of their own surroundings twenty old soldiers in the corps would have taught them how to make themselves moderately snug at night but they had no old soldiers and as the troops on the line of march said they lived like pigs they learned the heartbreaking cussedness of campkitchens and camels and the depravity of an ep tent and a witherwrung mule they studied animalculae in water and developed a few cases of dysentery in their study  at the end of their third march they were disagreeably surprised by the arrival in their camp of a hammered iron slug which fired from a steady rest at seven hundred yards flicked out the brains of a private seated by the fire this robbed them of their peace for a night and was the beginning of a longrange fire carefully calculated to that end in the daytime they saw nothing except an occasional puff of smoke from a crag above the line of march at night there were distant spurts of flame and occasional casualties which set the whole camp blazing into the gloom and occasionally into opposite tents then they swore vehemently and vowed that this was magnificent but not war  indeed it was not the regiment could not halt for reprisals against the franctireurs of the country side its duty was to go forward and make connection with the scotch and gurkha troops with which it was brigaded the afghans knew this and knew too after their first tentative shots that they were dealing with a raw regiment thereafter they devoted themselves to the task of keeping the fore and aft on the strain not for anything would they have taken equal liberties with a seasoned corpswith the wicked little gurkhas whose delight it was to lie out in the open on a dark night and stalk their stalkerswith the terrible big men dressed in womens clothes who could be heard praying to their god in the nightwatches and whose peace of mind no amount of sniping could shakeor with those vile sikhs who marched so ostentatiously unprepared and who dealt out such grim reward to those who tried to profit by that unpreparedness this white regiment was differentquite different it slept like a hog and like a hog charged in every direction when it was roused its sentries walked with a footfall that could be heard for a quarter of a mile would fire at anything that movedeven a driven donkeyand when they had once fired could be scientifically rushed and laid out a horror and an offence against the morning sun then there were campfollowers who straggled and could be cut up without fear their shrieks would disturb the white boys and the loss of their services would inconvenience them sorely  thus at every march the hidden enemy became bolder and the regiment writhed and twisted under attacks it could not avenge the crowning triumph was a sudden nightrush ending in the cutting of many tentropes the collapse of the sodden canvas and a glorious knifing of the men who struggled and kicked below it was a great deed neatly carried out and it shook the already shaken nerves of the fore and aft all the courage that they had been required to exercise up to this point was the two oclock in the morning courage and they so far had only succeeded in shooting their comrades and losing their sleep  sullen discontented cold savage sick with their uniforms dulled and unclean the fore and aft joined their brigade  i hear you had a tough time of it coming up said the brigadier but when he saw the hospitalsheets his face fell  this is bad said he to himself theyre as rotten as sheep and aloud to the colonelim afraid we cant spare you just yet we want all we have else i should have given you ten days to recruit in  the colonel winced on my honor sir he returned there is not the least necessity to think of sparing us my men have been rather mauled and upset without a fair return they only want to go in somewhere where they can see whats before them  cant say i think much of the fore and fit said the brigadier in confidence to his brigademajor theyve lost all their soldiering and by the trim of them might have marched through the country from the other side a more faggedout set of men i never put eyes on  oh theyll improve as the work goes on the parade gloss has been rubbed off a little but theyll put on field polish before long said the brigademajor theyve been mauled and they dont quite understand it  they did not all the hitting was on one side and it was cruelly hard hitting with accessories that made them sick there was also the real sickness that laid hold of a strong man and dragged him howling to the grave worst of all their officers knew just as little of the country as the men themselves and looked as if they did the fore and aft were in a thoroughly unsatisfactory condition but they believed that all would be well if they could once get a fair goin at the enemy potshots up and down the valleys were unsatisfactory and the bayonet never seemed to get a chance perhaps it was as well for a longlimbed afghan with a knife had a reach of eight feet and could carry away enough lead to disable three englishmen the fore and fit would like some riflepractice at the enemyall seven hundred rifles blazing together that wish showed the mood of the men  the gurkhas walked into their camp and in broken barrackroom english strove to fraternize with them offered them pipes of tobacco and stood them treat at the canteen but the fore and aft not knowing much of the nature of the gurkhas treated them as they would treat any other niggers and the little men in green trotted back to their firm friends the highlanders and with many grins confided to themthat dam white regiment no dam use sulkyugh dirtyugh hya any tot for johnny whereat the highlanders smote the gurkhas as to the head and told them not to vilify a british regiment and the gurkhas grinned cavernously for the highlanders were their elder brothers and entitled to the privileges of kinship the common soldier who touches a gurkha is more than likely to have his head sliced open  three days later the brigadier arranged a battle according to the rules of war and the peculiarity of the afghan temperament the enemy were massing in inconvenient strength among the hills and the moving of many green standards warned him that the tribes were up in aid of the afghan regular troops a squadron and a half of bengal lancers represented the available cavalry and two screwguns borrowed from a column thirty miles away the artillery at the generals disposal  if they stand as ive a very strong notion that they will i fancy we shall see an infantry fight that will be worth watching said the brigadier well do it in style each regiment shall be played into action by its band and well hold the cavalry in reserve  for all the reserve somebody asked  for all the reserve because were going to crumple them up said the brigadier who was an extraordinary brigadier and did not believe in the value of a reserve when dealing with asiatics and indeed when you come to think of it had the british army consistently waited for reserves in all its little affairs the boundaries of our empire would have stopped at brighton beach  that battle was to be a glorious battle  the three regiments debouching from three separate gorges after duly crowning the heights above were to converge from the centre left and right upon what we will call the afghan army then stationed toward the lower extremity of a flatbottomed valley thus it will be seen that three sides of the valley practically belonged to the english while the fourth was strictly afghan property in the event of defeat the afghans had the rocky hills to fly to where the fire from the guerilla tribes in aid would cover their retreat in the event of victory these same tribes would rush down and lend their weight to the rout of the british  the screwguns were to shell the head of each afghan rush that was made in close formation and the cavalry held in reserve in the right valley were to gently stimulate the breakup which would follow on the combined attack the brigadier sitting upon a rock overlooking the valley would watch the battle unrolled at his feet the fore and aft would debouch from the central gorge the gurkhas from the left and the highlanders from the right for the reason that the left flank of the enemy seemed as though it required the most hammering it was not every day that an afghan force would take ground in the open and the brigadier was resolved to make the most of it  if we only had a few more men he said plaintively we could surround the creatures and crumble em up thoroughly as it is im afraid we can only cut them up as they run its a great pity  the fore and aft had enjoyed unbroken peace for five days and were beginning in spite of dysentery to recover their nerve but they were not happy for they did not know the work in hand and had they known would not have known how to do it throughout those five days in which old soldiers might have taught them the craft of the game they discussed together their misadventures in the pasthow such an one was alive at dawn and dead ere the dusk and with what shrieks and struggles such another had given up his soul under the afghan knife death was a new and horrible thing to the sons of mechanics who were used to die decently of zymotic disease and their careful conservation in barracks had done nothing to make them look upon it with less dread  very early in the dawn the bugles began to blow and the fore and aft filled with a misguided enthusiasm turned out without waiting for a cup of coffee and a biscuit and were rewarded by being kept under arms in the cold while the other regiments leisurely prepared for the fray all the world knows that it is ill taking the breeks off a highlander it is much iller to try to make him stir unless he is convinced of the necessity for haste  the fore and aft awaited leaning upon their rifles and listening to the protests of their empty stomachs the colonel did his best to remedy the default of lining as soon as it was borne in upon him that the affair would not begin at once and so well did he succeed that the coffee was just ready whenthe men moved off their band leading even then there had been a mistake in time and the fore and aft came out into the valley ten minutes before the proper hour their band wheeled to the right after reaching the open and retired behind a little rocky knoll still playing while the regiment went past  it was not a pleasant sight that opened on the uninstructed view for the lower end of the valley appeared to be filled by an army in positionreal and actual regiments attired in red coats andof this there was no doubtfiring martinihenri bullets which cut up the ground a hundred yards in front of the leading company over that pockmarked ground the regiment had to pass and it opened the ball with a general and profound courtesy to the piping pickets ducking in perfect time as though it had been brazed on a rod being halfcapable of thinking for itself it fired a volley by the simple process of pitching its rifle into its shoulder and pulling the trigger the bullets may have accounted for some of the watchers on the hillside but they certainly did not affect the mass of enemy in front while the noise of the rifles drowned any orders that might have been given  good god said the brigadier sitting on the rock high above all that regiment has spoiled the whole show hurry up the others and let the screwguns get off  but the screwguns in working round the heights had stumbled upon a wasps nest of a small mud fort which they incontinently shelled at eight hundred yards to the huge discomfort of the occupants who were unaccustomed to weapons of such devilish precision  the fore and aft continued to go forward but with shortened stride where were the other regiments and why did these niggers use martinis they took open order instinctively lying down and firing at random rushing a few paces forward and lying down again according to the regulations once in this formation each man felt himself desperately alone and edged in toward his fellow for comforts sake  then the crack of his neighbors rifle at his ear led him to fire as rapidly as he couldagain for the sake of the comfort of the noise the reward was not long delayed five volleys plunged the files in banked smoke impenetrable to the eye and the bullets began to take ground twenty or thirty yards in front of the firers as the weight of the bayonet dragged down and to the right arms wearied with holding the kick of the leaping martini the company commanders peered helplessly through the smoke the more nervous mechanically trying to fan it away with their helmets  high and to the left bawled a captain till he was hoarse no good cease firing and let it drift away a bit  three and four times the bugles shrieked the order and when it was obeyed the fore and aft looked that their foe should be lying before them in mown swaths of men a light wind drove the smoke to leeward and showed the enemy still in position and apparently unaffected a quarter of a ton of lead had been buried a furlong in front of them as the ragged earth attested  that was not demoralizing to the afghans who have not european nerves they were waiting for the mad riot to die down and were firing quietly into the heart of the smoke a private of the fore and aft spun up his company shrieking with agony another was kicking the earth and gasping and a third ripped through the lower intestines by a jagged bullet was calling aloud on his comrades to put him out of his pain these were the casualties and they were not soothing to hear or see the smoke cleared to a dull haze  then the foe began to shout with a great shouting and a massa black massdetached itself from the main body and rolled over the ground at horrid speed it was composed of perhaps three hundred men who would shout and fire and slash if the rush of their fifty comrades who were determined to die carried home the fifty were ghazis halfmaddened with drugs and wholly mad with religious fanaticism when they rushed the british fire ceased and in the lull the order was given to close ranks and meet them with the bayonet  any one who knew the business could have told the fore and aft that the only way of dealing with a ghazi rush is by volleys at long ranges because a man who means to die who desires to die who will gain heaven by dying must in nine cases out of ten kill a man who has a lingering prejudice in favor of life if he can close with the latter where they should have closed and gone forward the fore and aft opened out and skirmished and where they should have opened out and fired they closed and waited  a man dragged from his blankets half awake and unfed is never in a pleasant frame of mind nor does his happiness increase when he watches the whites of the eyes of three hundred sixfoot fiends upon whose beards the foam is lying upon whose tongues is a roar of wrath and in whose hands are threefoot knives  the fore and aft heard the gurkha bugles bringing that regiment forward at the double while the neighing of the highland pipes came from the left they strove to stay where they were though the bayonets wavered down the line like the oars of a ragged boat then they felt body to body the amazing physical strength of their foes a shriek of pain ended the rush and the knives fell amid scenes not to be told the men clubbed together and smote blindlyas often as not at their own fellows their front crumpled like paper and the fifty ghazis passed on their backers now drunk with success fighting as madly as they  then the rearranks were bidden to close up and the subalterns dashed into the stewalone for the rearrank had heard the clamor in front the yells and the howls of pain and had seen the dark stale blood that makes afraid they were not going to stay it was the rushing of the camps over again let their officers go to hell if they chose they would get away from the knives  come on shrieked the subalterns and their men cursing them drew back each closing into his neighbor and wheeling round  charteris and devlin subalterns of the last company faced their death alone in the belief that their men would follow  youve killed me you cowards sobbed devlin and dropped cut from the shoulderstrap to the centre of the chest and a fresh detachment of his men retreating always retreating trampled him under foot as they made for the pass whence they had emerged     i kissed her in the kitchen and i kissed her in the hall        childun childun follow me    oh golly said the cook is he gwine to kiss us all        hallahallahalla hallelujah  the gurkhas were pouring through the left gorge and over the heights at the double to the invitation of their regimental quickstep the black rocks were crowned with dark green spiders as the bugles gave tongue jubilantly     in the morning in the morning by the bright light    when gabriel blows his trumpet in the morning  the gurkha rearcompanies tripped and blundered over loose stones the frontfiles halted for a moment to take stock of the valley and to settle stray bootlaces then a happy little sigh of contentment soughed down the ranks and it was as though the land smiled for behold there below was the enemy and it was to meet them that the gurkhas had doubled so hastily there was much enemy there would be amusement the little men hitched their kukris well to hand and gaped expectantly at their officers as terriers grin ere the stone is cast for them to fetch the gurkhas ground sloped downward to the valley and they enjoyed a fair view of the proceedings they sat upon the bowlders to watch for their officers were not going to waste their wind in assisting to repulse a ghazi rush more than half a mile away let the white men look to their own front  hi yi said the subadarmajor who was sweating profusely dam fools yonder stand closeorder this is no time for close order its the time for volleys ugh  horrified amused and indignant the gurkhas beheld the retirementlet us be gentleof the fore and aft with a running chorus of oaths and commentaries  they run the white men run colonel sahib may we also do a little running murmured runbir thappa the senior jemadar  but the colonel would have none of it let the beggars be cut up a little said he wrathfully serves em right theyll be prodded into facing round in a minute he looked through his fieldglasses and caught the glint of an officers sword  beating em with the flatdamned conscripts how the ghazis are walking into them said he  the fore and aft heading back bore with them their officers the narrowness of the pass forced the mob into solid formation and the rearrank delivered some sort of a wavering volley the ghazis drew off for they did not know what reserves the gorge might hide moreover it was never wise to chase white men too far they returned as wolves return to cover satisfied with the slaughter that they had done and only stopping to slash at the wounded on the ground a quarter of a mile had the fore and aft retreated and now jammed in the pass was quivering with pain shaken and demoralized with fear while the officers maddened beyond control smote the men with the hilts and the flats of their swords  get back get back you cowardsyou women right about facecolumn of companies formyou hounds shouted the colonel and the subalterns swore aloud but the regiment wanted to goto go anywhere out of the range of those merciless knives it swayed to and fro irresolutely with shouts and outcries while from the right the gurkhas dropped volley after volley of cripplestopper snider bullets at long range into the mob of the ghazis returning to their own troops  the fore and aft band though protected from direct fire by the rocky knoll under which it had sat down fled at the first rush jakin and lew would have fled also but their short legs left them fifty yards in the rear and by the time the band had mixed with the regiment they were painfully aware that they would have to close in alone and unsupported  get back to that rock gasped jakin they wont see us there  and they returned to the scattered instruments of the band their hearts nearly bursting their ribs  heres a nice show for us said jakin throwing himself full length on the ground a bloomin fine show for british infantry oh the devils theyve gone an left us alone here wot ll we do  lew took possession of a castoff water bottle which naturally was full of canteen rum and drank till he coughed again  drink said he shortly theyll come back in a minute or twoyou see  jakin drank but there was no sign of the regiments return they could hear a dull clamor from the head of the valley of retreat and saw the ghazis slink back quickening their pace as the gurkhas fired at them  were all thats left of the band an well be cut up as sure as death said jakin  ill die game then said lew thickly fumbling with his tiny drummers sword the drink was working on his brain as it was on jakins  old on i know something better than fightin said jakin stung by the splendor of a sudden thought due chiefly to rum tip our bloomin cowards yonder the word to come back the paythan beggars are well away come on lew we wont get hurt take the fife an give me the drum the old step for all your bloomin guts are worth theres a few of our men coming back now stand up ye drunken little defaulter by your rightquick march  he slipped the drumsling over his shoulder thrust the fife into lews hand and the two boys marched out of the cover of the rock into the open making a hideous hash of the first bars of the british grenadiers  as lew had said a few of the fore and aft were coming back sullenly and shamefacedly under the stimulus of blows and abuse their red coats shone at the head of the valley and behind them were wavering bayonets but between this shattered line and the enemy who with afghan suspicion feared that the hasty retreat meant an ambush and had not moved therefore lay half a mile of a level ground dotted only by the wounded  the tune settled into full swing and the boys kept shoulder to shoulder jakin banging the drum as one possessed the one fife made a thin and pitiful squeaking but the tune carried far even to the gurkhas  come on you dogs muttered jakin to himself are we to play forhever lew was staring straight in front of him and marching more stiffly than ever he had done on parade  and in bitter mockery of the distant mob the old tune of the old line shrilled and rattled     some talk of alexander      and some of hercules    of hector and lysander      and such great names as these  there was a faroff clapping of hands from the gurkhas and a roar from the highlanders in the distance but never a shot was fired by british or afghan the two little red dots moved forward in the open parallel to the enemys front     but of all the worlds great heroes      theres none that can compare    with a towrowrowrowrowrow      to the british grenadier  the men of the fore and aft were gathering thick at the entrance into the plain the brigadier on the heights far above was speechless with rage still no movement from the enemy the day stayed to watch the children  jakin halted and beat the long roll of the assembly while the fife squealed despairingly  right about face hold up lew youre drunk said jakin they wheeled and marched back     those heroes of antiquity      neer saw a cannonball    nor knew the force o powder  here they come said jakin go on lew      to scare their foes withal  the fore and aft were pouring out of the valley what officers had said to men in that time of shame and humiliation will never be known for neither officers nor men speak of it now  they are coming anew shouted a priest among the afghans do not kill the boys take them alive and they shall be of our faith  but the first volley had been fired and lew dropped on his face jakin stood for a minute spun round and collapsed as the fore and aft came forward the maledictions of their officers in their ears and in their hearts the shame of open shame  half the men had seen the drummers die and they made no sign they did not even shout they doubled out straight across the plain in open order and they did not fire  this said the colonel of gurkhas softly is the real attack as it ought to have been delivered come on my children  ululululu squealed the gurkhas and came down with a joyful clicking of kukristhose vicious gurkha knives  on the right there was no rush the highlanders cannily commending their souls to god for it matters as much to a dead man whether he has been shot in a border scuffle or at waterloo opened out and fired according to their custom that is to say without heat and without intervals while the screwguns having disposed of the impertinent mud fort aforementioned dropped shell after shell into the clusters round the flickering green standards on the heights  charrging is an unfortunate necessity murmured the colorsergeant of the right company of the highlanders  it makes the men sweer so but i am thinkin that it will come to a charrge if these black devils stand much longer stewarrt man youre firing into the eye of the sun and hell not take any harm for government ammuneetion a foot lower and a great deal slower what are the english doing theyre very quiet there in the centre running again  the english were not running they were hacking and hewing and stabbing for though one white man is seldom physically a match for an afghan in a sheepskin or wadded coat yet through the pressure of many white men behind and a certain thirst for revenge in his heart he becomes capable of doing much with both ends of his rifle the fore and aft held their fire till one bullet could drive through five or six men and the front of the afghan force gave on the volley they then selected their men and slew them with deep gasps and short hacking coughs and groanings of leather belts against strained bodies and realized for the first time that an afghan attacked is far less formidable than an afghan attacking which fact old soldiers might have told them  but they had no old soldiers in their ranks  the gurkhas stall at the bazar was the noisiest for the men were engagedto a nasty noise as of beef being cut on the blockwith the kukri which they preferred to the bayonet well knowing how the afghan hates the halfmoon blade  as the afghans wavered the green standards on the mountain moved down to assist them in a last rally which was unwise the lancers chafing in the right gorge had thrice despatched their only subaltern as galloper to report on the progress of affairs on the third occasion he returned with a bulletgraze on his knee swearing strange oaths in hindoostani and saying that all things were ready so that squadron swung round the right of the highlanders with a wicked whistling of wind in the pennons of its lances and fell upon the remnant just when according to all the rules of war it should have waited for the foe to show more signs of wavering  but it was a dainty charge deftly delivered and it ended by the cavalry finding itself at the head of the pass by which the afghans intended to retreat and down the track that the lances had made streamed two companies of the highlanders which was never intended by the brigadier the new development was successful it detached the enemy from his base as a sponge is torn from a rock and left him ringed about with fire in that pitiless plain and as a sponge is chased round the bathtub by the hand of the bather so were the afghans chased till they broke into little detachments much more difficult to dispose of than large masses  see quoth the brigadier everything has come as i arranged weve cut their base and now well bucket em to pieces  a direct hammering was all that the brigadier had dared to hope for considering the size of the force at his disposal but men who stand or fall by the errors of their opponents may be forgiven for turning chance into design the bucketing went forward merrily the afghan forces were upon the runthe run of wearied wolves who snarl and bite over their shoulders the red lances dipped by twos and threes and with a shriek up rose the lancebutt like a spar on a stormy sea as the trooper cantering forward cleared his point the lancers kept between their prey and the steep hills for all who could were trying to escape from the valley of death the highlanders gave the fugitives two hundred yards law and then brought them down gasping and choking ere they could reach the protection of the bowlders above the gurkhas followed suit but the fore and aft were killing on their own account for they had penned a mass of men between their bayonets and a wall of rock and the flash of the rifles was lighting the wadded coats  we cannot hold them captain sahib panted a ressaldar of lancers let us try the carbine the lance is good but it wastes time  they tried the carbine and still the enemy melted awayfled up the hills by hundreds when there were only twenty bullets to stop them on the heights the screwguns ceased firingthey had run out of ammunitionand the brigadier groaned for the musketry fire could not sufficiently smash the retreat long before the last volleys were fired the litters were out in force looking for the wounded the battle was over and but for want of fresh troops the afghans would have been wiped off the earth as it was they counted their dead by hundreds and nowhere were the dead thicker than in the track of the fore and aft  but the regiment did not cheer with the highlanders nor did they dance uncouth dances with the gurkhas among the dead they looked under their brows at the colonel as they leaned upon their rifles and panted  get back to camp you havent you disgraced yourself enough for one day go and look to the wounded its all youre fit for said the colonel yet for the past hour the fore and aft had been doing all that mortal commander could expect they had lost heavily because they did not know how to set about their business with proper skill but they had borne themselves gallantly and this was their reward  a young and sprightly colorsergeant who had begun to imagine himself a hero offered his waterbottle to a highlander whose tongue was black with thirst i drink with no cowards answered the youngster huskily and turning to a gurkha said hya johnny drink water got it the gurkha grinned and passed his bottle the fore and aft said no word  they went back to camp when the field of strife had been a little mopped up and made presentable and the brigadier who saw himself a knight in three months was the only soul who was complimentary to them the colonel was heartbroken and the officers were savage and sullen  well said the brigadier they are young troops of course and it was not unnatural that they should retire in disorder for a bit  oh my only aunt maria murmured a junior staff officer retire in disorder it was a bally run  but they came again as we all know cooed the brigadier the colonels ashywhite face before him and they behaved as well as could possibly be expected behaved beautifully indeed i was watching them its not a matter to take to heart colonel as some german general said of his men they wanted to be shooted over a little that was all to himself he said now theyre blooded i can give em responsible work its as well that they got what they did teach em more than half a dozen rifle flirtations that willlaterrun alone and bite poor old colonel though  all that afternoon the heliograph winked and flickered on the hills striving to tell the good news to a mountain forty miles away and in the evening there arrived dusty sweating and sore a misguided correspondent who had gone out to assist at a trumpery villageburning and who had read off the message from afar cursing his luck the while  lets have the details somehowas full as ever you can please its the first time ive ever been left this campaign said the correspondent to the brigadier and the brigadier nothing loath told him how an army of communication had been crumpled up destroyed and all but annihilated by the craft strategy wisdom and foresight of the brigadier  but some say and among these be the gurkhas who watched on the hillside that that battle was won by jakin and lew whose little bodies were borne up just in time to fit two gaps at the head of the big ditchgrave for the dead under the heights of jagai    the sending of dana da  when the devil rides on your chest remember the chamarnative proverb  once upon a time some people in india made a new heaven and a new earth out of broken teacups a missing brooch or two and a hairbrush these were hidden under brushes or stuffed into holes in the hillside and an entire civil service of subordinate gods used to find or mend them again and every one said there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy several other things happened also but the religion never seemed to get much beyond its first manifestations though it added an airline postal service and orchestral effects in order to keep abreast of the times and choke off competition  this religion was too elastic for ordinary use it stretched itself and embraced pieces of everything that the medicinemen of all ages have manufactured it approved of and stole from freemasonry looted the latterday rosicrucians of half their pet words took any fragments of egyptian philosophy that it found in the encyclopaedia britannica annexed as many of the vedas as had been translated into french or english and talked of all the rest built in the german versions of what is left of the zend avesta encouraged white grey and black magic including spiritualism palmistry fortunetelling by cards hot chestnuts doublekerneled nuts and tallow droppings would have adopted voodoo and oboe had it known anything about them and showed itself in every way one of the most accommodating arrangements that had ever been invented since the birth of the sea  when it was in thorough working order with all the machinery down to the subscriptions complete dana da came from nowhere with nothing in his hands and wrote a chapter in its history which has hitherto been unpublished he said that his first name was dana and his second was da now setting aside dana of the new york sun dana is a bhil name and da fits no native of india unless you except the bengali dé as the original spelling da is lap or finnish and dana da was neither finn chin bhil bengali lap nair gond romaney magh bokhariot kurd armenian levantine jew persian punjabi madrasi parsee nor anything else known to ethnologists he was simply dana da and declined to give further information for the sake of brevity and as roughly indicating his origin he was called the native he might have been the original old man of the mountains who is said to be the only authorized head of the teacup creed some people said that he was but dana da used to smile and deny any connection with the cult explaining that he was an independent experimenter  as i have said he came from nowhere with his hands behind his back and studied the creed for three weeks sitting at the feet of those best competent to explain its mysteries then he laughed aloud and went away but the laugh might have been either of devotion or derision  when he returned he was without money but his pride was unabated he declared that he knew more about the things in heaven and earth than those who taught him and for this contumacy was abandoned altogether  his next appearance in public life was at a big cantonment in upper india and he was then telling fortunes with the help of three leaden dice a very dirty old cloth and a little tin box of opium pills he told better fortunes when he was allowed half a bottle of whiskey but the things which he invented on the opium were quite worth the money he was in reduced circumstances among other peoples he told the fortune of an englishman who had once been interested in the simla creed but who later on had married and forgotten all his old knowledge in the study of babies and things the englishman allowed dana da to tell a fortune for charitys sake and gave him five rupees a dinner and some old clothes when he had eaten dana da professed gratitude and asked if there were anything he could do for his hostin the esoteric line  is there any one that you love said dana da the englishman loved his wife but had no desire to drag her name into the conversation he therefore shook his head  is there any one that you hate said dana da the englishman said that there were several men whom he hated deeply  very good said dana da upon whom the whiskey and the opium were beginning to tell only give me their names and i will despatch a sending to them and kill them  now a sending is a horrible arrangement first invented they say in iceland it is a thing sent by a wizard and may take any form but most generally wanders about the land in the shape of a little purple cloud till it finds the sendee and him it kills by changing into the form of a horse or a cat or a man without a face it is not strictly a native patent though chamars of the skin and hide castes can if irritated despatch a sending which sits on the breast of their enemy by night and nearly kills him very few natives care to irritate chamars for this reason  let me despatch a sending said dana da i am nearly dead now with want and drink and opium but i should like to kill a man before i die i can send a sending anywhere you choose and in any form except in the shape of a man  the englishman had no friends that he wished to kill but partly to soothe dana da whose eyes were rolling and partly to see what would be done he asked whether a modified sending could not be arranged forsuch a sending as should make a mans life a burden to him and yet do him no harm if this were possible he notified his willingness to give dana da ten rupees for the job  i am not what i was once said dana da and i must take the money because i am poor to what englishman shall i send it  send a sending to lone sahib said the englishman naming a man who had been most bitter in rebuking him for his apostasy from the teacup creed dana da laughed and nodded  i could have chosen no better man myself said he i will see that he finds the sending about his path and about his bed  he lay down on the hearthrug turned up the whites of his eyes shivered all over and began to snort this was magic or opium or the sending or all three when he opened his eyes he vowed that the sending had started upon the warpath and was at that moment flying up to the town where lone sahib lives  give me my ten rupees said dana da wearily and write a letter to lone sahib telling him and all who believe with him that you and a friend are using a power greater than theirs they will see that you are speaking the truth  he departed unsteadily with the promise of some more rupees if anything came of the sending  the englishman sent a letter to lone sahib couched in what he remembered of the terminology of the creed he wrote i also in the days of what you held to be my backsliding have obtained enlightenment and with enlightenment has come power then he grew so deeply mysterious that the recipient of the letter could make neither head nor tail of it and was proportionately impressed for he fancied that his friend had become a fifthrounder when a man is a fifthrounder he can do more than slade and houdin combined  lone sahib read the letter in five different fashions and was beginning a sixth interpretation when his bearer dashed in with the news that there was a cat on the bed now if there was one thing that lone sahib hated more than another it was a cat he scolded the bearer for not turning it out of the house the bearer said that he was afraid all the doors of the bedroom had been shut throughout the morning and no real cat could possibly have entered the room he would prefer not to meddle with the creature  lone sahib entered the room gingerly and there on the pillow of his bed sprawled and whimpered a wee white kitten not a jumpsome frisky little beast but a sluglike crawler with its eyes barely opened and its paws lacking strength or directiona kitten that ought to have been in a basket with its mamma lone sahib caught it by the scruff of its neck handed it over to the sweeper to be drowned and fined the bearer four annas  that evening as he was reading in his room he fancied that he saw something moving about on the hearthrug outside the circle of light from his readinglamp when the thing began to myowl he realized that it was a kittena wee white kitten nearly blind and very miserable he was seriously angry and spoke bitterly to his bearer who said that there was no kitten in the room when he brought in the lamp and real kittens of tender age generally had mothercats in attendance  if the presence will go out into the veranda and listen said the bearer he will hear no cats how therefore can the kitten on the bed and the kitten on the hearthrug be real kittens  lone sahib went out to listen and the bearer followed him but there was no sound of any one mewing for her children he returned to his room having hurled the kitten down the hillside and wrote out the incidents of the day for the benefit of his coreligionists those people were so absolutely free from superstition that they ascribed anything a little out of the common to agencies as it was their business to know all about the agencies they were on terms of almost indecent familiarity with manifestations of every kind their letters dropped from the ceilingunstampedand spirits used to squatter up and down their staircases all night but they had never come into contact with kittens lone sahib wrote out the facts noting the hour and the minute as every psychical observer is bound to do and appending the englishmans letter because it was the most mysterious document and might have had a bearing upon anything in this world or the next an outsider would have translated all the tangle thus look out you laughed at me once and now i am going to make you sit up  lone sahibs coreligionists found that meaning in it but their translation was refined and full of foursyllable words they held a sederunt and were filled with tremulous joy for in spite of their familiarity with all the other worlds and cycles they had a very human awe of things sent from ghostland they met in lone sahibs room in shrouded and sepulchral gloom and their conclave was broken up by clinking among the photoframes on the mantelpiece a wee white kitten nearly blind was looping and writhing itself between the clock and the candlesticks that stopped all investigations or doubtings here was the manifestation in the flesh it was so far as could be seen devoid of purpose but it was a manifestation of undoubted authenticity  they drafted a round robin to the englishman the backslider of old days adjuring him in the interests of the creed to explain whether there was any connection between the embodiment of some egyptian god or other i have forgotten the name and his communication they called the kitten ra or toth or tum or some thing and when lone sahib confessed that the first one had at his most misguided instance been drowned by the sweeper they said consolingly that in his next life he would be a bounder and not even a rounder of the lowest grade these words may not be quite correct but they accurately express the sense of the house  when the englishman received the round robinit came by posthe was startled and bewildered he sent into the bazar for dana da who read the letter and laughed that is my sending said he i told you i would work well now give me another ten rupees  but what in the world is this gibberish about egyptian gods asked the englishman  cats said dana da with a hiccough for he had discovered the englishmans whiskey bottle cats and cats and cats never was such a sending a hundred of cats now give me ten more rupees and write as i dictate  dana das letter was a curiosity it bore the englishmans signature and hinted at catsat a sending of cats the mere words on paper were creepy and uncanny to behold  what have you done though said the englishman i am as much in the dark as ever do you mean to say that you can actually send this absurd sending you talk about  judge for yourself said dana da what does that letter mean in a little time they will all be at my feet and yours and io glorywill be drugged or drunk all day long  dana da knew his people  when a man who hates cats wakes up in the morning and finds a little squirming kitten on his breast or puts his hands into his ulsterpocket and finds a little halfdead kitten where his gloves should be or opens his trunk and finds a vile kitten among his dressshirts or goes for a long ride with his mackintosh strapped on his saddlebow and shakes a little squawling kitten from its folds when he opens it or goes out to dinner and finds a little blind kitten under his chair or stays at home and finds a writhing kitten under the quilt or wriggling among his boots or hanging head downward in his tobaccojar or being mangled by his terrier in the verandawhen such a man finds one kitten neither more nor less once a day in a place where no kitten rightly could or should be he is naturally upset when he dare not murder his daily trove because he believes it to be a manifestation an emissary an embodiment and half a dozen other things all out of the regular course of nature he is more than upset he is actually distressed some of lone sahibs coreligionists thought that he was a highly favored individual but many said that if he had treated the first kitten with proper respectas suited a tothratumsennacherib embodimentall this trouble would have been averted they compared him to the ancient mariner but none the less they were proud of him and proud of the englishman who had sent the manifestation they did not call it a sending because icelandic magic was not in their programme  after sixteen kittens that is to say after one fortnight for there were three kittens on the first day to impress the fact of the sending the whole camp was uplifted by a letterit came flying through a windowfrom the old man of the mountainsthe head of all the creedexplaining the manifestation in the most beautiful language and soaking up all the credit of it for himself the englishman said the letter was not there at all he was a backslider without power or asceticism who couldnt even raise a table by force of volition much less project an army of kittens through space the entire arrangement said the letter was strictly orthodox worked and sanctioned by the highest authorities within the pale of the creed there was great joy at this for some of the weaker brethren seeing that an outsider who had been working on independent lines could create kittens whereas their own rulers had never gone beyond crockeryand broken at bestwere showing a desire to break line on their own trail in fact there was the promise of a schism a second round robin was drafted to the englishman beginning o scoffer and ending with a selection of curses from the rites of mizraim and memphis and the commination of jugana who was a fifthrounder upon whose name an upstart thirdrounder once traded a papal excommunication is a billetdoux compared to the commination of jugana the englishman had been proved under the hand and seal of the old man of the mountains to have appropriated virtue and pretended to have power which in reality belonged only to the supreme head naturally the round robin did not spare him  he handed the letter to dana da to translate into decent english the effect on dana da was curious at first he was furiously angry and then he laughed for five minutes  i had thought he said that they would have come to me in another week i would have shown that i sent the sending and they would have discrowned the old man of the mountains who has sent this sending of mine do you do nothing the time has come for me to act write as i dictate and i will put them to shame but give me ten more rupees  at dana das dictation the englishman wrote nothing less than a formal challenge to the old man of the mountains it wound up and if this manifestation be from your hand then let it go forward but if it be from my hand i will that the sending shall cease in two days time on that day there shall be twelve kittens and thenceforward none at all the people shall judge between us this was signed by dana da who added pentacles and pentagrams and a crux ansaia and half a dozen swastikas and a triple tau to his name just to show that he was all he laid claim to be  the challenge was read out to the gentlemen and ladies and they remembered then that dana da had laughed at them some years ago it was officially announced that the old man of the mountains would treat the matter with contempt dana da being an independent investigator without a single round at the back of him but this did not soothe his people they wanted to see a fight they were very human for all their spirituality lone sahib who was really being worn out with kittens submitted meekly to his fate he felt that he was being kittened to prove the power of dana da as the poet says  when the stated day dawned the shower of kittens began some were white and some were tabby and all were about the same loathsome age three were on his hearthrug three in his bathroom and the other six turned up at intervals among the visitors who came to see the prophecy break down never was a more satisfactory sending on the next day there were no kittens and the next day and all the other days were kittenless and quiet the people murmured and looked to the old man of the mountains for an explanation a letter written on a palmleaf dropped from the ceiling but every one except lone sahib felt that letters were not what the occasion demanded there should have been cats there should have been catsfullgrown ones the letter proved conclusively that there had been a hitch in the psychic current which colliding with a dual identity had interfered with the percipient activity all along the main line the kittens were still going on but owing to some failure in the developing fluid they were not materialized the air was thick with letters for a few days afterward unseen hands played glück and beethoven on fingerbowls and clockshades but all men felt that psychic life was a mockery without materialized kittens even lone sahib shouted with the majority on this head dana das letters were very insulting and if he had then offered to lead a new departure there is no knowing what might not have happened  but dana da was dying of whiskey and opium in the englishmans godown and had small heart for honors  they have been put to shame said he never was such a sending it has killed me  nonsense said the englishman you are going to die dana da and that sort of stuff must be left behind ill admit that you have made some queer things come about tell me honestly now how was it done  give me ten more rupees said dana da faintly and if i die before i spend them bury them with me the silver was counted out while dana da was fighting with death his hand closed upon the money and he smiled a grim smile  bend low he whispered the englishman bent  bunniamissionschoolexpelledboxwallah peddlerceylon pearlmerchantall mine english educationoutcasted and made up name dana

very few kittens now in the bazar ask lone sahibs sweepers wife  so saying dana da gasped and passed away into a land where if all be true there are no materializations and the making of new creeds is discouraged  but consider the gorgeous simplicity of it all    on the city wall    then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the townwall and she dwelt upon the walljoshua ii 15  lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world lilith was her verygreatgrandmamma and that was before the days of eve as every one knows in the west people say rude things about laluns profession and write lectures about it and distribute the lectures to young persons in order that morality may be preserved in the east where the profession is hereditary descending from mother to daughter nobody writes lectures or takes any notice and that is a distinct proof of the inability of the east to manage its own affairs  laluns real husband for even ladies of laluns profession in the east must have husbands was a big jujubetree her mamma who had married a figtree spent ten thousand rupees on laluns wedding which was blessed by fortyseven clergymen of mammas church and distributed five thousand rupees in charity to the poor and that was the custom of the land the advantages of having a jujubetree for a husband are obvious you cannot hurt his feelings and he looks imposing  laluns husband stood on the plain outside the city walls and laluns house was upon the east wall facing the river if you fell from the broad windowseat you dropped thirty feet sheer into the city ditch but if you stayed where you should and looked forth you saw all the cattle of the city being driven down to water the students of the government college playing cricket the high grass and trees that fringed the riverbank the great sand bars that ribbed the river the red tombs of dead emperors beyond the river and very far away through the blue heathaze a glint of the snows of the himalayas  wali dad used to lie in the windowseat for hours at a time watching this view he was a young muhammadan who was suffering acutely from education of the english variety and knew it his father had sent him to a missionschool to get wisdom and wali dad had absorbed more than ever his father or the missionaries intended he should when his father died wali dad was independent and spent two years experimenting with the creeds of the earth and reading books that are of no use to anybody  after he had made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the roman catholic church and the presbyterian fold at the same time the missionaries found him out and called him names but they did not understand his trouble he discovered lalun on the city wall and became the most constant of her few admirers he possessed a head that english artists at home would rave over and paint amid impossible surroundingsa face that female novelists would use with delight through nine hundred pages in reality he was only a cleanbred young muhammadan with penciled eyebrows smallcut nostrils little feet and hands and a very tired look in his eyes by virtue of his twentytwo years he had grown a neat black beard which he stroked with pride and kept delicately scented his life seemed to be divided between borrowing books from me and making love to lalun in the windowseat he composed songs about her and some of the songs are sung to this day in the city from the street of the muttonbutchers to the coppersmiths ward  one song the prettiest of all says that the beauty of lalun was so great that it troubled the hearts of the british government and caused them to lose their peace of mind that is the way the song is sung in the streets but if you examine it carefully and know the key to the explanation you will find that there are three puns in iton beauty heart and peace of mindso that it runs by the subtlety of lalun the administration of the government was troubled and it lost such and such a man when wali dad sings that song his eyes glow like hot coals and lalun leans back among the cushions and throws bunches of jasminebuds at wali dad  but first it is necessary to explain something about the supreme government which is above all and below all and behind all gentlemen come from england spend a few weeks in india walk round this great sphinx of the plains and write books upon its ways and its works denouncing or praising it as their own ignorance prompts consequently all the world knows how the supreme government conducts itself but no one not even the supreme government knows everything about the administration of the empire year by year england sends out fresh drafts for the first fightingline which is officially called the indian civil service these die or kill themselves by overwork or are worried to death or broken in health and hope in order that the land may be protected from death and sickness famine and war and may eventually become capable of standing alone it will never stand alone but the idea is a pretty one and men are willing to die for it and yearly the work of pushing and coaxing and scolding and petting the country into good living goes forward if an advance be made all credit is given to the native while the englishmen stand back and wipe their foreheads if a failure occurs the englishmen step forward and take the blame overmuch tenderness of this kind has bred a strong belief among many natives that the native is capable of administering the country and many devout englishmen believe this also because the theory is stated in beautiful english with all the latest political color  there be other men who though uneducated see visions and dream dreams and they too hope to administer the country in their own waythat is to say with a garnish of red sauce such men must exist among two hundred million people and if they are not attended to may cause trouble and even break the great idol called pax britannic which as the newspapers say lives between peshawur and cape comorin were the day of doom to dawn tomorrow you would find the supreme government taking measures to allay popular excitement and putting guards upon the graveyards that the dead might troop forth orderly the youngest civilian would arrest gabriel on his own responsibility if the archangel could not produce a deputy commissioners permission to make music or other noises as the license says  whence it is easy to see that mere men of the flesh who would create a tumult must fare badly at the hands of the supreme government and they do there is no outward sign of excitement there is no confusion there is no knowledge when due and sufficient reasons have been given weighed and approved the machinery moves forward and the dreamer of dreams and the seer of visions is gone from his friends and following he enjoys the hospitality of government there is no restriction upon his movements within certain limits but he must not confer any more with his brother dreamers once in every six months the supreme government assures itself that he is well and takes formal acknowledgment of his existence no one protests against his detention because the few people who know about it are in deadly fear of seeming to know him and never a single newspaper takes up his case or organizes demonstrations on his behalf because the newspapers of india have got behind that lying proverb which says the pen is mightier than the sword and can walk delicately  so now you know as much as you ought about wali dad the educational mixture and the supreme government  lalun has not yet been described she would need so wali dad says a thousand pens of gold and ink scented with musk she has been variously compared to the moon the dil sagar lake a spotted quail a gazelle the sun on the desert of kutch the dawn the stars and the young bamboo these comparisons imply that she is beautiful exceedingly according to the native standards which are practically the same as those of the west her eyes are black and her hair is black and her eyebrows are black as leeches her mouth is tiny and says witty things her hands are tiny and have saved much money her feet are tiny and have trodden on the naked hearts of many men but as wali dad sings lalun is lalun and when you have said that you have only come to the beginnings of knowledge  the little house on the city wall was just big enough to hold lalun and her maid and a pussycat with a silver collar a big pink and blue cutglass chandelier hung from the ceiling of the reception room a petty nawab had given lalun the horror and she kept it for politeness sake the floor of the room was of polished chunam white as curds a latticed window of carved wood was set in one wall there was a profusion of squabby pluffy cushions and fat carpets everywhere and laluns silver huqa studded with turquoises had a special little carpet all to its shining self wali dad was nearly as permanent a fixture as the chandelier as i have said he lay in the windowseat and meditated on life and death and lalunspecially lalun the feet of the young men of the city tended to her doorways and thenretired for lalun was a particular maiden slow of speech reserved of mind and not in the least inclined to orgies which were nearly certain to end in strife if i am of no value i am unworthy of this honor said lalun if i am of value they are unworthy of me and that was a crooked sentence  in the long hot nights of latter april and may all the city seemed to assemble in laluns little white room to smoke and to talk shiahs of the grimmest and most uncompromising persuasion sufis who had lost all belief in the prophet and retained but little in god wandering hindu priests passing southward on their way to the central india fairs and other affairs pundits in black gowns with spectacles on their noses and undigested wisdom in their insides bearded headmen of the wards sikhs with all the details of the latest ecclesiastical scandal in the golden temple redeyed priests from beyond the border looking like trapped wolves and talking like ravens mas of the university very superior and very volubleall these people and more also you might find in the white room wali dad lay in the windowseat and listened to the talk  it is laluns salon said wali dad to me and it is electicis not that the word outside of a freemasons lodge i have never seen such gatherings there i dined once with a jewa yahoudi he spat into the city ditch with apologies for allowing national feelings to overcome him though i have lost every belief in the world said he and try to be proud of my losing i cannot help hating a jew lalun admits no jews here  but what in the world do all these men do i asked  the curse of our country said wali dad they talk it is like the atheniansalways hearing and telling some new thing ask the pearl and she will show you how much she knows of the news of the city and the province lalun knows everything  lalun i said at randomshe was talking to a gentleman of the kurd persuasion who had come in from godknowswherewhen does the 175th regiment go to agra  it does not go at all said lalun without turning her head they have ordered the 118th to go in its stead that regiment goes to lucknow in three months unless they give a fresh order  that is so said wali dad without a shade of doubt can you with your telegrams and your newspapers do better always hearing and telling some new thing he went on my friend has your god ever smitten a european nation for gossiping in the bazars india has gossiped for centuriesalways standing in the bazars until the soldiers go by thereforeyou are here today instead of starving in your own country and i am not a muhammadani am a producta demnition product that also i owe to you and yours that i cannot make an end to my sentence without quoting from your authors he pulled at the huqa and mourned half feelingly half in earnest for the shattered hopes of his youth wali dad was always mourning over something or otherthe country of which he despaired or the creed in which he had lost faith or the life of the english which he could by no means understand  lalun never mourned she played little songs on the sitar and to hear her sing o peacock cry again was always a fresh pleasure she knew all the songs that have ever been sung from the warsongs of the south that make the old men angry with the young men and the young men angry with the state to the lovesongs of the north where the swords whinnywhicker like angry kites in the pauses between the kisses and the passes fill with armed men and the lover is torn from his beloved and cries ai ai ai evermore she knew how to make up tobacco for the huqa so that it smelled like the gates of paradise and wafted you gently through them she could embroider strange things in gold and silver and dance softly with the moonlight when it came in at the window also she knew the hearts of men and the heart of the city and whose wives were faithful and whose untrue and more of the secrets of the government offices than are good to be set down in this place nasiban her maid said that her jewelry was worth ten thousand pounds and that some night a thief would enter and murder her for its possession but lalun said that all the city would tear that thief limb from limb and that he whoever he was knew it  so she took her sitar and sat in the windowseat and sang a song of old days that had been sung by a girl of her profession in an armed camp on the eve of a great battlethe day before the fords of the jumna ran red and sivaji fled fifty miles to delhi with a toorkh stallion at his horses tail and another lalun on his saddlebow it was what men call a mahratta laonee and it said     their warrior forces chimnajee      before the peishwa led    the children of the sun and fire      behind him turned and fled  and the chorus said     with them there fought who rides so free      with sword and turban red    the warrioryouth who earns his fee      at peril of his head  at peril of his head said wali dad in english to me thanks to your government all our heads are protected and with the educational facilities at my commandhis eyes twinkled wickedlyi might be a distinguished member of the local administration perhaps in time i might even be a member of a legislative council  dont speak english said lalun bending over her sitar afresh the chorus went out from the city wall to the blackened wall of fort amara which dominates the city no man knows the precise extent of fort amara three kings built it hundreds of years ago and they say that there are miles of underground rooms beneath its walls it is peopled with many ghosts a detachment of garrison artillery and a company of infantry in its prime it held ten thousand men and filled its ditches with corpses  at peril of his head sang lalun again and again  a head moved on one of the rampartsthe grey head of an old manand a voice rough as sharkskin on a swordhilt sent back the last line of the chorus and broke into a song that i could not understand though lalun and wali dad listened intently  what is it i asked who is it  a consistent man said wali dad he fought you in 46 when he was a warrioryouth refought you in 57 and he tried to fight you in 71 but you had learned the trick of blowing men from guns too well now he is old but he would still fight if he could  is he a wahabi then why should he answer to a mahratta laonee if he be wahabior sikh said i  i do not know said wali dad he has lost perhaps his religion perhaps he wishes to be a king perhaps he is a king i do not know his name  that is a lie wali dad if you know his career you must know his name  that is quite true i belong to a nation of liars i would rather not tell you his name think for yourself  lalun finished her song pointed to the fort and said simply khem singh  hm said wali dad if the pearl chooses to tell you the pearl is a fool  i translated to lalun who laughed i choose to tell what i choose to tell they kept khem singh in burma said she they kept him there for many years until his mind was changed in him so great was the kindness of the government finding this they sent him back to his own country that he might look upon it before he died he is an old man but when he looks upon this his country his memory will come moreover there be many who remember him  he is an interesting survival said wali dad pulling at the huqa he returns to a country now full of educational and political reform but as the pearl says there are many who remember him he was once a great man there will never he any more great men in india they will all when they are boys go whoring after strange gods and they will become citizensfellowcitizensillustrious fellowcitizens what is it that the native papers call them  wali dad seemed to be in a very bad temper lalun looked out of the window and smiled into the dusthaze i went away thinking about khem singh who had once made history with a thousand followers and would have been a princeling but for the power of the supreme government aforesaid  the senior captain commanding fort amara was away on leave but the subaltern his deputy drifted down to the club where i found him and inquired of him whether it was really true that a political prisoner had been added to the attractions of the fort the subaltern explained at great length for this was the first time that he had held command of the fort and his glory lay heavy upon him  yes said he a man was sent in to me about a week ago from down the linea thorough gentleman whoever he is of course i did all i could for him he had his two servants and some silver cookingpots and he looked for all the world like a native officer i called him subadar sahib just as well to be on the safe side yknow look here subadar sahib i said youre handed over to my authority and im supposed to guard you now i dont want to make your life hard but you must make things easy for me all the fort is at your disposal from the flagstaff to the dry ditch and i shall be happy to entertain you in any way i can but you mustnt take advantage of it give me your word that you wont try to escape subadar sahib and ill give you my word that you shall have no heavy guard put over you i thought the best way of getting him was by going at him straight yknow and it was by jove the old man gave me his word and moved about the fort as contented as a sick crow hes a rummy chapalways asking to be told where he is and what the buildings about him are i had to sign a slip of blue paper when he turned up acknowledging receipt of his body and all that and im responsible yknow that he doesnt get away queer thing though looking after a johnnie old enough to be your grandfather isnt it come to the fort one of these days and see him  for reasons which will appear i never went to the fort while khem singh was then within its walls i knew him only as a grey head seen from laluns windowa grey head and a harsh voice but natives told me that day by day as he looked upon the fair lands round amara his memory came back to him and with it the old hatred against the government that had been nearly effaced in faroff burma so he raged up and down the west face of the fort from morning till noon and from evening till the night devising vain things in his heart and croaking warsongs when lalun sang on the city wall as he grew more acquainted with the subaltern he unburdened his old heart of some of the passions that had withered it sahib he used to say tapping his stick against the parapet when i was a young man i was one of twenty thousand horsemen who came out of the city and rode round the plain here sahib i was the leader of a hundred then of a thousand then of five thousand and nowhe pointed to his two servants but from the beginning to today i would cut the throats of all the sahibs in the land if i could hold me fast sahib lest i get away and return to those who would follow me i forgot them when i was in burma but now that i am in my own country again i remember everything  do you remember that you have given me your honor not to make your tendance a hard matter said the subaltern  yes to you only to you sahib said khem singh to you because you are of a pleasant countenance if my turn comes again sahib i will not hang you nor cut your throat  thank you said the subaltern gravely as he looked along the line of guns that could pound the city to powder in half an hour let us go into our own quarters khem singh come and talk with me after dinner  khem singh would sit on his own cushion at the subalterns feet drinking heavy scented aniseseed brandy in great gulps and telling strange stories of fort amara which had been a palace in the old days of begums and ranees tortured to deathaye in the very vaulted chamber that now served as a messroom would tell stories of sobraon that made the subalterns cheeks flush and tingle with pride of race and of the kuka rising from which so much was expected and the foreknowledge of which was shared by a hundred thousand souls but he never told tales of 57 because as he said he was the subalterns guest and 57 is a year that no man black or white cares to speak of once only when the aniseseed brandy had slightly affected his head he said sahib speaking now of a matter which lay between sobraon and the affair of the kukas it was ever a wonder to us that you stayed your hand at all and that having stayed it you did not make the land one prison now i hear from without that you do great honor to all men of our country and by your own hands are destroying the terror of your name which is your strong rock and defence this is a foolish thing will oil and water mix now in 57  i was not born then subadar sahib said the subaltern and khem singh reeled to his quarters  the subaltern would tell me of these conversations at the club and my desire to see khem singh increased but wali dad sitting in the windowseat of the house on the city wall said that it would be a cruel thing to do and lalun pretended that i preferred the society of a grizzled old sikh to hers  here is tobacco here is talk here are many friends and all the news of the city and above all here is myself i will tell you stories and sing you songs and wali dad will talk his english nonsense in your ears is that worse than watching the caged animal yonder go tomorrow then if you must but today such and such an one will be here and he will speak of wonderful things  it happened that tomorrow never came and the warm heat of the latter rains gave place to the chill of early october almost before i was aware of the flight of the year the captain commanding the fort returned from leave and took over charge of khem singh according to the laws of seniority the captain was not a nice man he called all natives niggers which besides being extreme bad form shows gross ignorance  whats the use of telling off two tommies to watch that old nigger said he  i fancy it soothes his vanity said the subaltern the men are ordered to keep well out of his way but he takes them as a tribute to his importance poor old wretch  i wont have line men taken off regular guards in this way put on a couple of native infantry  sikhs said the subaltern lifting his eyebrows  sikhs pathans dograstheyre all alike these black vermin and the captain talked to khem singh in a manner which hurt that old gentlemans feelings fifteen years before when he had been caught for the second time every one looked upon him as a sort of tiger he liked being regarded in this light but he forgot that the world goes forward in fifteen years and many subalterns are promoted to captaincies  the captainpig is in charge of the fort said khem singh to his native guard every morning and the native guard said yes subadar sahib in deference to his age and his air of distinction but they did not know who he was  in those days the gathering in laluns little white room was always large and talked more than before  the greeks said wali dad who had been borrowing my books the inhabitants of the city of athens where they were always hearing and telling some new thing rigorously secluded their womenwho were fools hence the glorious institution of the heterodox womenis it notwho were amusing and not fools all the greek philosophers delighted in their company tell me my friend how it goes now in greece and the other places upon the continent of europe are your womenfolk also fools  wali dad i said you never speak to us about your womenfolk and we never speak about ours to you that is the bar between us  yes said wali dad it is curious to think that our common meetingplace should be here in the house of a commonhow do you call her he pointed with the pipemouth to lalun  lalun is nothing but lalun i said and that was perfectly true but if you took your place in the world wali dad and gave up dreaming dreams  i might wear an english coat and trouser i might be a leading muhammadan pleader i might be received even at the commissioners tennisparties where the english stand on one side and the natives on the other in order to promote social intercourse throughout the empire hearts heart said he to lalun quickly the sahib says that i ought to quit you  the sahib is always talking stupid talk returned lalun with a laugh in this house i am a queen and thou art a king the sahibshe put her arms above her head and thought for a momentthe sahib shall be our vizierthine and mine wali dadbecause he has said that thou shouldst leave me  wali dad laughed immoderately and i laughed too be it so said he my friend are you willing to take this lucrative government appointment lalun what shall his pay be  but lalun began to sing and for the rest of the time there was no hope of getting a sensible answer from her or wall dad when the one stopped the other began to quote persian poetry with a triple pun in every other line some of it was not strictly proper but it was all very funny and it only came to an end when a fat person in black with gold pincenez sent up his name to lalun and wali dad dragged me into the twinkling night to walk in a big rosegarden and talk heresies about religion and governments and a mans career in life  the mohurrum the great mourningfestival of the muhammadans was close at hand and the things that wali dad said about religious fanaticism would have secured his expulsion from the loosestthinking muslim sect there were the rosebushes round us the stars above us and from every quarter of the city came the boom of the big mohurrum drums you must know that the city is divided in fairly equal proportions between the hindus and the musalmans and where both creeds belong to the fighting races a big religious festival gives ample chance for trouble when they canthat is to say when the authorities are weak enough to allow itthe hindus do their best to arrange some minor feastday of their own in time to clash with the period of general mourning for the martyrs hasan and hussain the heroes of the mohurrum gilt and painted paper presentations of their tombs are borne with shouting and wailing music torches and yells through the principal thoroughfares of the city which fakements are called tazias their passage is rigorously laid down beforehand by the police and detachments of police accompany each tazias lest the hindus should throw bricks at it and the peace of the queen and the heads of her loyal subjects should thereby be broken mohurrum time in a fighting town means anxiety to all the officials because if a riot breaks out the officials and not the rioters are held responsible the former must foresee everything and while not making their precautions ridiculously elaborate must see that they are at least adequate  listen to the drums said wali dad that is the heart of the peopleempty and making much noise how think you will the mohurrum go this year i think that there will be trouble  he turned down a sidestreet and left me alone with the stars and a sleepy police patrol then i went to bed and dreamed that wali dad had sacked the city and i was made vizier with laluns silver huqa for mark of office  all day the mohurrum drums beat in the city and all day deputations of tearful hindu gentlemen besieged the deputy commissioner with assurances that they would be murdered ere next dawning by the muhammadans which said the deputy commissioner in confidence to the head of police is a pretty fair indication that the hindus are going to make emselves unpleasant i think we can arrange a little surprise for them i have given the heads of both creeds fair warning if they choose to disregard it so much the worse for them  there was a large gathering in laluns house that night but of men that i had never seen before if i except the fat gentleman in black with the gold pincenez wali dad lay in the windowseat more bitterly scornful of his faith and its manifestations than i had ever known him laluns maid was very busy cutting up and mixing tobacco for the guests we could hear the thunder of the drums as the processions accompanying each tazia marched to the central gatheringplace in the plain outside the city preparatory to their triumphant reentry and circuit within the walls all the streets seemed ablaze with torches and only fort amara was black and silent  when the noise of the drums ceased no one in the white room spoke for a time the first tazia has moved off said wali dad looking to the plain  that is very early said the man with the pincenez  it is only halfpast eight the company rose and departed  some of them were men from ladakh said lalun when the last had gone they brought me bricktea such as the russians sell and a teaturn from peshawur show me now how the english memsahibs make tea  the bricktea was abominable when it was finished wali dad suggested going into the streets i am nearly sure that there will be trouble tonight he said all the city thinks so and vox populi is vox dei as the babus say now i tell you that at the corner of the padshahi gate you will find my horse all this night if you want to go about and to see things it is a most disgraceful exhibition where is the pleasure of saying ya hasan ya hussain twenty thousand times in a night  all the processionsthere were two and twenty of themwere now well within the city walls the drums were beating afresh the crowd were howling ya hasan ya hussain and beating their breasts the brass bands were playing their loudest and at every corner where space allowed muhammadan preachers were telling the lamentable story of the death of the martyrs it was impossible to move except with the crowd for the streets were not more than twenty feet wide in the hindu quarters the shutters of all the shops were up and crossbarred as the first tazia a gorgeous erection ten feet high was borne aloft on the shoulders of a score of stout men into the semidarkness of the gully of the horsemen a brickbat crashed through its talc and tinsel sides  into thy hands o lord murmured wali dad profanely as a yell went up from behind and a native officer of police jammed his horse through the crowd another brickbat followed and the tazia staggered and swayed where it had stopped  go on in the name of the sirkar go forward shouted the policeman but there was an ugly cracking and splintering of shutters and the crowd halted with oaths and growlings before the house whence the brickbat had been thrown  then without any warning broke the stormnot only in the gully of the horsemen but in half a dozen other places the tazias rocked like ships at sea the long poletorches dipped and rose round them while the men shouted the hindus are dishonoring the tazias strike strike into their temples for the faith the six or eight policemen with each tazia drew their batons and struck as long as they could in the hope of forcing the mob forward but they were overpowered and as contingents of hindus poured into the streets the fight became general half a mile away where the tazias were yet untouched the drums and the shrieks of ya hasan ya hussain continued but not for long the priests at the corners of the streets knocked the legs from the bedsteads that supported their pulpits and smote for the faith while stones fell from the silent houses upon friend and foe and the packed streets bellowed din din din a tazia caught fire and was dropped for a flaming barrier between hindu and musalman at the corner of the gully then the crowd surged forward and wali dad drew me close to the stone pillar of a well  it was intended from the beginning he shouted in my ear with more heat than blank unbelief should be guilty of the bricks were carried up to the houses beforehand these swine of hindus we shall be gutting kine in their temples tonight  tazia after tazia some burning others torn to pieces hurried past us and the mob with them howling shrieking and striking at the house doors in their flight at last we saw the reason of the rush hugonin the assistant district superintendent of police a boy of twenty had got together thirty constables and was forcing the crowd through the streets his old grey policehorse showed no sign of uneasiness as it was spurred breaston into the crowd and the long dogwhip with which he had armed himself was never still  they know we havent enough police to hold em he cried as he passed me mopping a cut on his face they know we havent arent any of the men from the club coming down to help get on you sons of burned fathers the dogwhip cracked across the writhing backs and the constables smote afresh with baton and gunbutt with these passed the lights and the shouting and wali dad began to swear under his breath from fort amara shot up a single rocket then two side by side it was the signal for troops  petitt the deputy commissioner covered with dust and sweat but calm and gently smiling cantered up the cleanswept street in rear of the main body of the rioters no one killed yet he shouted ill keep em on the run till dawn dont let em halt hugonin trot em about till the troops come  the science of the defence lay solely in keeping the mob on the move if they had breathingspace they would halt and fire a house and then the work of restoring order would be more difficult to say the least of it flames have the same effect on a crowd as blood has on a wild beast  word had reached the club and men in eveningdress were beginning to show themselves and lend a hand in heading off and breaking up the shouting masses with stirrupleathers whips or chancefound staves they were not very often attacked for the rioters had sense enough to know that the death of a european would not mean one hanging but many and possibly the appearance of the thricedreaded artillery the clamor in the city redoubled the hindus had descended into the streets in real earnest and ere long the mob returned it was a strange sight there were no taziasonly their riven platformsand there were no police here and there a city dignitary hindu or muhammadan was vainly imploring his coreligionists to keep quiet and behave themselvesadvice for which his white beard was pulled then a native officer of police unhorsed but still using his spurs with effect would be borne along warning all the crowd of the danger of insulting the government everywhere men struck aimlessly with sticks grasping each other by the throat howling and foaming with rage or beat with their bare hands on the doors of the houses  it is a lucky thing that they are fighting with natural weapons i said to wali dad else we should have half the city killed  i turned as i spoke and looked at his face his nostrils were distended his eyes were fixed and he was smiting himself softly on the breast the crowd poured by with renewed riota gang of musalmans hardpressed by some hundred hindu fanatics wali dad left my side with an oath and shouting ya hasan ya hussain plunged into the thick of the fight where i lost sight of him  i fled by a side alley to the padshahi gate where i found wali dads house and thence rode to the fort once outside the city wall the tumult sank to a dull roar very impressive under the stars and reflecting great credit on the fifty thousand angry ablebodied men who were making it the troops who at the deputy commissioners instance had been ordered to rendezvous quietly near the fort showed no signs of being impressed two companies of native infantry a squadron of native cavalry and a company of british infantry were kicking their heels in the shadow of the east face waiting for orders to march in i am sorry to say that they were all pleased unholily pleased at the chance of what they called a little fun the senior officers to be sure grumbled at having been kept out of bed and the english troops pretended to be sulky but there was joy in the hearts of all the subalterns and whispers ran up and down the line no ballcartridgewhat a beastly shame dyou think the beggars will really stand up to us hope i shall meet my moneylender there i owe him more than i can afford oh they wont let us even unsheathe swords hurrah up goes the fourth rocket fall in there  the garrison artillery who to the last cherished a wild hope that they might be allowed to bombard the city at a hundred yards range lined the parapet above the east gateway and cheered themselves hoarse as the british infantry doubled along the road to the main gate of the city the cavalry cantered on to the padshahi gate and the native infantry marched slowly to the gate of the butchers the surprise was intended to be of a distinctly unpleasant nature and to come on top of the defeat of the police who had been just able to keep the muhammadans from firing the houses of a few leading hindus the bulk of the riot lay in the north and northwest wards the east and southeast were by this time dark and silent and i rode hastily to laluns house for i wished to tell her to send some one in search of wali dad the house was unlighted but the door was open and i climbed upstairs in the darkness one small lamp in the white room showed lalun and her maid leaning half out of the window breathing heavily and evidently pulling at something that refused to come  thou art latevery late gasped lalun without turning her head help us now o fool if thou hast not spent thy strength howling among the tazias pull nasiban and i can do no more o sahib is it you the hindus have been hunting an old muhammadan round the ditch with clubs if they find him again they will kill him help us to pull him up  i put my hands to the long red silk waistcloth that was hanging out of the window and we three pulled and pulled with all the strength at our command there was something very heavy at the end and it swore in an unknown tongue as it kicked against the city wall  pull oh pull said lalun at the last a pair of brown hands grasped the windowsill and a venerable muhammadan tumbled upon the floor very much out of breath his jaws were tied up his turban had fallen over one eye and he was dusty and angry  lalun hid her face in her hands for an instant and said something about wali dad that i could not catch  then to my extreme gratification she threw her arms round my neck and murmured pretty things i was in no haste to stop her and nasiban being a handmaiden of tact turned to the big jewelchest that stands in the corner of the white room and rummaged among the contents the muhammadan sat on the floor and glared  one service more sahib since thou hast come so opportunely said lalun wilt thouit is very nice to be thoued by laluntake this old man across the citythe troops are everywhere and they might hurt him for he is oldto the kumharsen gate there i think he may find a carriage to take him to his house he is a friend of mine and thou artmore than a friendtherefore i ask this  nasiban bent over the old man tucked something into his belt and i raised him up and led him into the streets in crossing from the east to the west of the city there was no chance of avoiding the troops and the crowd long before i reached the gully of the horsemen i heard the shouts of the british infantry crying cheeringly hutt ye beggars hutt ye devils get along go forward there then followed the ringing of riflebutts and shrieks of pain the troops were banging the bare toes of the mob with their gunbuttsfor not a bayonet had been fixed my companion mumbled and jabbered as we walked on until we were carried back by the crowd and had to force our way to the troops i caught him by the wrist and felt a bangle therethe iron bangle of the sikhsbut i had no suspicions for lalun had only ten minutes before put her arms round me thrice we were carried back by the crowd and when we made our way past the british infantry it was to meet the sikh cavalry driving another mob before them with the butts of their lances  what are these dogs said the old man  sikhs of the cavalry father i said and we edged our way up the line of horses two abreast and found the deputy commissioner his helmet smashed on his head surrounded by a knot of men who had come down from the club as amateur constables and had helped the police mightily  well keep em on the run till dawn said petitt whos your villainous friend  i had only time to say the protection of the sirkar when a fresh crowd flying before the native infantry carried us a hundred yards nearer to the kumharsen gate and petitt was swept away like a shadow  i do not knowi cannot seethis is all new to me moaned my companion how many troops are there in the city  perhaps five hundred i said  a lakh of men beaten by five hundredand sikhs among them surely surely i am an old man butthe kumharsen gate is new who pulled down the stone lions where is the conduit sahib i am a very old man and alas ii cannot stand he dropped in the shadow of the kumharsen gate where there was no disturbance a fat gentleman wearing gold pincenez came out of the darkness  you are most kind to bring my old friend he said suavely he is a landholder of akala he should not be in a big city when there is religious excitement but i have a carriage here you are quite truly kind will you help me to put him into the carriage it is very late  we bundled the old man into a hired victoria that stood close to the gate and i turned back to the house on the city wall the troops were driving the people to and fro while the police shouted to your houses get to your houses and the dogwhip of the assistant district superintendent cracked remorselessly terrorstricken bunnias clung to the stirrups of the cavalry crying that their houses had been robbed which was a lie and the burly sikh horsemen patted them on the shoulder and bade them return to those houses lest a worse thing should happen parties of five or six british soldiers joining arms swept down the sidegullies their rifles on their backs stamping with shouting and song upon the toes of hindu and musalman never was religious enthusiasm more systematically squashed and never were poor breakers of the peace more utterly weary and footsore they were routed out of holes and corners from behind wellpillars and byres and bidden to go to their houses if they had no houses to go to so much the worse for their toes  on returning to laluns door i stumbled over a man at the threshold he was sobbing hysterically and his arms flapped like the wings of a goose it was wali dad agnostic and unbeliever shoeless turbanless and frothing at the mouth the flesh on his chest bruised and bleeding from the vehemence with which he had smitten himself a broken torchhandle lay by his side and his quivering lips murmured ya hasan ya hussain as i stooped over him i pushed him a few steps up the staircase threw a pebble at laluns city window and hurried home  most of the streets were very still and the cold wind that comes before the dawn whistled down them in the centre of the square of the mosque a man was bending over a corpse the skull had been smashed in by gunbutt or bamboostave  it is expedient that one man should die for the people said petitt grimly raising the shapeless head these brutes were beginning to show their teeth too much  and from afar we could hear the soldiers singing two lovely black eyes as they drove the remnant of the rioters within doors                                            of course you can guess what happened i was not so clever when the news went abroad that khem singh had escaped from the fort i did not since i was then living this story not writing it connect myself or lalun or the fat gentleman of the gold pincenez with his disappearance nor did it strike me that wali dad was the man who should have convoyed him across the city or that laluns arms round my neck were put there to hide the money that nasiban gave to kehm singh and that lalun had used me and my white face as even a better safeguard than wali dad who proved himself so untrustworthy all that i knew at the time was that when fort amara was taken up with the riots khem singh profited by the confusion to get away and that his two sikh guards also escaped  but later on i received full enlightenment and so did khem singh he fled to those who knew him in the old days but many of them were dead and more were changed and all knew something of the wrath of the government he went to the young men but the glamour of his name had passed away and they were entering native regiments of government offices and khem singh could give them neither pension decorations nor influencenothing but a glorious death with their backs to the mouth of a gun he wrote letters and made promises and the letters fell into bad hands and a wholly insignificant subordinate officer of police tracked them down and gained promotion thereby moreover khem singh was old and aniseseed brandy was scarce and he had left his silver cookingpots in fort amara with his nice warm bedding and the gentleman with the gold pincenez was told by those who had employed him that khem singh as a popular leader was not worth the money paid  great is the mercy of these fools of english said khem singh when the situation was put before him i will go back to fort amara of my own free will and gain honor give me good clothes to return in  so at his own time khem singh knocked at the wicketgate of the fort and walked to the captain and the subaltern who were nearly greyheaded on account of correspondence that daily arrived from simla marked private  i have come back captain sahib said khem singh put no more guards over me it is no good out yonder  a week later i saw him for the first time to my knowledge and he made as though there were an understanding between us  it was well done sahib said he and greatly i admired your astuteness in thus boldly facing the troops when i whom they would have doubtless torn to pieces was with you now there is a man in fort ooltagarh whom a bold man could with ease help to escape this is the position of the fort as i draw it on the sand  but i was thinking how i had become laluns vizier after all    the brokenlink handicap     while the snaffle holds or the longneck slings    while the big beam tilts or the last bell rings    while horses are horses to train and to race    then women and wine take a second place        for mefor me        while a short tenthree    has a field to squander or fence to face  song of the g r  there are more ways of running a horse to suit your book than pulling his head off in the straight some men forget this understand clearly that all racing is rottenas everything connected with losing money must be in india in addition to its inherent rottenness it has the merit of being twothirds sham looking pretty on paper only every one knows every one else far too well for business purposes how on earth can you rack and harry and post a man for his losings when you are fond of his wife and live in the same station with him he says on the monday following i cant settle just yet you say all right old man and think yourself lucky if you pull off nine hundred out of a twothousandrupee debt any way you look at it indian racing is immoral and expensively immoral which is much worse if a man wants your money he ought to ask for it or send round a subscriptionlist instead of juggling about the country with an australian larrikin a brumby with as much breed as the boy a brace of chumars in goldlaced caps three or four ekkaponies with hogged manes and a switchtailed demirep of a mare called arab because she has a kink in her flag racing leads to the shroff quicker than anything else but if you have no conscience and no sentiments and good hands and some knowledge of pace and ten years experience of horses and several thousand rupees a month i believe that you can occasionally contrive to pay your shoeingbills  did you ever know shacklesb w g 15 138coarse loose mulelike earsbarrel as long as a gateposttough as a telegraphwireand the queerest brute that ever looked through a bridle he was of no brand being one of an earnicked mob taken into the bucephalus at £410s a head to make up freight and sold raw and out of condition at calcutta for rs275 people who lost money on him called him a brumby but if ever any horse had harpoons shoulders and the gins temper shackles was that horse two miles was his own particular distance he trained himself ran himself and rode himself and if his jockey insulted him by giving him hints he shut up at once and bucked the boy off he objected to dictation two or three of his owners did not understand this and lost money in consequence at last he was bought by a man who discovered that if a race was to be won shackles and shackles only would win it in his own way so long as his jockey sat still this man had a ridingboy called brunta lad from perth west australiaand he taught brunt with a trainers whip the hardest thing a jock can learnto sit still to sit still and to keep on sitting still when brunt fairly grasped this truth shackles devastated the country no weight could stop him at his own distance and the fame of shackles spread from ajmir in the south to chedputter in the north there was no horse like shackles so long as he was allowed to do his work in his own way but he was beaten in the end and the story of his fall is enough to make angels weep  at the lower end of the chedputter racecourse just before the turn into the straight the track passes close to a couple of old brickmounds enclosing a funnelshaped hollow the big end of the funnel is not six feet from the railings on the offside the astounding peculiarity of the course is that if you stand at one particular place about half a mile away inside the course and speak at ordinary pitch your voice just hits the funnel of the brickmounds and makes a curious whining echo there a man discovered this one morning by accident while out training with a friend he marked the place to stand and speak from with a couple of bricks and he kept his knowledge to himself every peculiarity of a course is worth remembering in a country where rats play the mischief with the elephantlitter and stewards build jumps to suit their own stables this man ran a very fairish countrybred a long racking high mare with the temper of a fiend and the paces of an airy wandering serapha drifty glidy stretch the mare was as a delicate tribute to mrs reiver called the lady regula baddunor for short regula baddun  shackles jockey brunt was a quite wellbehaved boy but his nerve had been shaken he began his career by riding jumpraces in melbourne where a few stewards want lynching and was one of the jockeys who came through the awful butcheryperhaps you will recollect itof the maribyrnong plate the walls were colonial rampartslogs of jarrah spiked into masonrywith wings as strong as church buttresses once in his stride a horse had to jump or fall he couldnt run out in the maribyrnong plate twelve horses were jammed at the second wall red hat leading fell this side and threw out the gled and the ruck came up behind and the space between wing and wing was one struggling screaming kicking shambles four jockeys were taken out dead three were very badly hurt and brunt was among the three he told the story of the maribyrnong plate sometimes and when he described how whalley on red hat said as the mare fell under himgod ha mercy im done for and how next instant sithee there and white otter had crushed the life out of poor whalley and the dust hid a small hell of men and horses no one marveled that brunt had dropped jumpraces and australia together regula badduns owner knew that story by heart brunt never varied it in the telling he had no education  shackles came to the chedputter autumn races one year and his owner walked about insulting the sportsmen of chedputter generally till they went to the honorary secretary in a body and said appoint handicappers and arrange a race which shall break shackles and humble the pride of his owner the districts rose against shackles and sent up of their best ousel who was supposed to be able to do his mile in 153 petard the studbred trained by a cavalry regiment who knew how to train gringalet the ewelamb of the 75th bobolink the pride of peshawar and many others  they called that race the brokenlink handicap because it was to smash shackles and the handicappers piled on the weights and the fund gave eight hundred rupees and the distance was round the course for all horses shackles owner said you can arrange the race with regard to shackles only so long as you dont bury him under weightcloths i dont mind regula badduns owner said i throw in my mare to fret ousel six furlongs is regulas distance and she will then lie down and die so also will ousel for his jockey doesnt understand a waiting race now this was a lie for regula had been in work for two months at dehra and her chances were good always supposing that shackles broke a bloodvesselor brunt moved on him  the plunging in the lotteries was fine they filled eight thousandrupee lotteries on the brokenlink handicap and the account in the pioneer said that favoritism was divided in plain english the various contingents were wild on their respective horses for the handicappers had done their work well the honorary secretary shouted himself hoarse through the din and the smoke of the cheroots was like the smoke and the rattling of the diceboxes like the rattle of smallarm fire  ten horses startedvery leveland regula badduns owner cantered out on his hack to a place inside the circle of the course where two bricks had been thrown he faced toward the brickmounds at the lower end of the course and waited  the story of the running is in the pioneer at the end of the first mile shackles crept out of the ruck well on the outside ready to get round the turn lay hold of the bit and spin up the straight before the others knew he had got away brunt was sitting still perfectly happy listening to the drumdrumdrum of the hoofs behind and knowing that in about twenty strides shackles would draw one deep breath and go up the last halfmile like the flying dutchman as shackles went short to take the turn and came abreast of the brickmound brunt heard above the noise of the wind in his ears a whining wailing voice on the offside sayinggod ha mercy im done for in one stride brunt saw the whole seething smash of the maribyrnong plate before him started in his saddle and gave a yell of terror the start brought the heels into shackles side and the scream hurt shackles feelings he couldnt stop dead but he put out his feet and slid along for fifty yards and then very gravely and judicially bucked off brunta shaking terrorstricken lump while regula baddun made a neckandneck race with bobolink up the straight and won by a short headpetard a bad third shackles owner in the stand tried to think that his fieldglasses had gone wrong regula badduns owner waiting by the two bricks gave one deep sigh of relief and cantered back to the stand he had won in lotteries and bets about fifteen thousand  it was a brokenlink handicap with a vengeance it broke nearly all the men concerned and nearly broke the heart of shackles owner he went down to interview brunt the boy lay livid and gasping with fright where he had tumbled off the sin of losing the race never seemed to strike him all he knew was that whalley had called him that the call was a warning and were he cut in two for it he would never get up again his nerve had gone altogether and he only asked his master to give him a good thrashing and let him go he was fit for nothing he said he got his dismissal and crept up to the paddock white as chalk with blue lips his knees giving way under him people said nasty things in the paddock but brunt never heeded he changed into tweeds took his stick and went down the road still shaking with fright and muttering over and over againgod ha mercy im done for to the best of my knowledge and belief he spoke the truth  so now you know how the brokenlink handicap was run and won of course you dont believe it you would credit anything about russias designs on india or the recommendations of the currency commission but a little bit of sober fact is more than you can stand    on greenhow hill     to loves low voice she lent a careless ear      her hand within his rosy fingers lay    a chilling weight she would not turn or hear      but with averted face went on her way    but when pale death all featureless and grim      lifted his bony hand and beckoning    held out his cypresswreath she followed him      and love was left forlorn and wondering    that she who for his bidding would not stay    at deaths first whisper rose and went away    rivals  ohé ahmed din shafiz ulla ahoo bahadur khan where are you come out of the tents as i have done and fight against the english dont kill your own kin come out to me  the deserter from a native corps was crawling round the outskirts of the camp firing at intervals and shouting invitations to his old comrades misled by the rain and the darkness he came to the english wing of the camp and with his yelping and riflepractice disturbed the men they had been making roads all day and were tired  ortheris was sleeping at learoyds feet wots all that he said thickly learoyd snored and a snider bullet ripped its way through the tent wall the men swore its that bloomin deserter from the aurangabadis said ortheris git up some one an tell im es come to the wrong shop  go to sleep little man said mulvaney who was steaming nearest the door i cant arise and expaytiate with him tis rainin entrenchin tools outside  taint because you bloomin cant its cause you bloomin wont ye long limp lousy lazy beggar you ark to im owlin  wots the good of argifying put a bullet into the swine es keepin us awake said another voice  a subaltern shouted angrily and a dripping sentry whined from the darkness  taint no good sir i cant see im es idin somewhere down ill  ortheris tumbled out of his blanket shall i try to get im sir said he  no was the answer lie down i wont have the whole camp shooting all round the clock tell him to go and pot his friends  ortheris considered for a moment then putting his head under the tent wall he called as a bus conductor calls in a block igher up there igher up  the men laughed and the laughter was carried down wind to the deserter who hearing that he had made a mistake went off to worry his own regiment half a mile away he was received with shots the aurangabadis were very angry with him for disgracing their colors  an thats all right said ortheris withdrawing his head as he heard the hiccough of the sniders in the distance selp me gawd tho that mans not fit to livemessin with my beautysleep this way  go out and shoot him in the morning then said the subaltern incautiously silence in the tents now get your rest men  ortheris lay down with a happy little sigh and in two minutes there was no sound except the rain on the canvas and the allembracing and elemental snoring of learoyd  the camp lay on a bare ridge of the himalayas and for a week had been waiting for a flying column to make connection the nightly rounds of the deserter and his friends had become a nuisance  in the morning the men dried themselves in hot sunshine and cleaned their grimy accoutrements the native regiment was to take its turn of roadmaking that day while the old regiment loafed  im goin to lay for a shot at that man said ortheris when he had finished washing out his rifle e comes up the watercourse every evenin about five oclock if we go and lie out on the north ill a bit this afternoon well get im  youre a bloodthirsty little mosquito said mulvaney blowing blue clouds into the air but i suppose i will have to come wid you pwheres jock  gone out with the mixed pickles cause e thinks isself a bloomin marksman said ortheris with scorn  the mixed pickles were a detachment of picked shots generally employed in clearing spurs of hills when the enemy were too impertinent this taught the young officers how to handle men and did not do the enemy much harm mulvaney and ortheris strolled out of camp and passed the aurangabadis going to their roadmaking  youve got to sweat today said ortheris genially were going to get your man you didnt knock im out last night by any chance any of you  no the pig went away mocking us i had one shot at him said a private hes my cousin and i ought to have cleared our dishonor but good luck to you  they went cautiously to the north hill ortheris leading because as he explained this is a longrange show an ive got to do it his was an almost passionate devotion to his rifle which by barrackroom report he was supposed to kiss every night before turning in charges and scuffles he held in contempt and when they were inevitable slipped between mulvaney and learoyd bidding them to fight for his skin as well as their own they never failed him he trotted along questing like a hound on a broken trail through the wood of the north hill at last he was satisfied and threw himself down on the soft pineneedle slope that commanded a clear view of the watercourse and a brown bare hillside beyond it the trees made a scented darkness in which an army corps could have hidden from the sunglare without  eres the tail o the wood said ortheris es got to come up the watercourse cause it gives im cover well lay ere taint not arf so bloomin dusty neither  he buried his nose in a clump of scentless white violets no one had come to tell the flowers that the season of their strength was long past and they had bloomed merrily in the twilight of the pines  this is something like he said luxuriously wot a evinly clear drop for a bullet acrost how much dyou make it mulvaney  seven hunder maybe a trifle less bekaze the airs so thin  wop wop wop went a volley of musketry on the rear face of the north hill  curse them mixed pickles firin at nothin theyll scare arf the country  thry a sightin shot in the middle of the row said mulvaney the man of many wiles theres a red rock yonder hell be sure to pass quick  ortheris ran his sight up to six hundred yards and fired the bullet threw up a feather of dust by a clump of gentians at the base of the rock  good enough said ortheris snapping the scale down you snick your sights to mine or a little lower youre always firin high but remember first shot to me o lordy but its a lovely afternoon  the noise of the firing grew louder and there was a tramping of men in the wood the two lay very quiet for they knew that the british soldier is desperately prone to fire at anything that moves or calls then learoyd appeared his tunic ripped across the breast by a bullet looking ashamed of himself he flung down on the pineneedles breathing in snorts  one o them damned gardeners o th pickles said he fingering the rent firin to th right flank when he knowed i was there if i knew who he was id a rippen the hide offan him look at ma tunic  thats the spishil trustability av a marksman train him to hit a fly wid a stiddy rest at seven hunder an he loose on anythin he sees or hears up to th mile youre well out av that fancyfirin gang jock stay here  bin firin at the bloomin wind in the bloomin treetops said ortheris with a chuckle ill show you some firin later on  they wallowed in the pineneedles and the sun warmed them where they lay the mixed pickles ceased firing and returned to camp and left the wood to a few scared apes the watercourse lifted up its voice in the silence and talked foolishly to the rocks now and again the dull thump of a blasting charge three miles away told that the aurangabadis were in difficulties with their roadmaking the men smiled as they listened and lay still soaking in the warm leisure presently learoyd between the whiffs of his pipe  seems queerabout im yonderdesertin at all  ell be a bloomin side queerer when ive done with im said ortheris they were talking in whispers for the stillness of the wood and the desire of slaughter lay heavy upon them  i make no doubt he had his reasons for desertin but my faith i make less doubt ivry man has good reason for killin him said mulvaney  happen there was a lass tewed up wiit men do more than more for th sake of a lass  they make most av us list theyve no manner av right to make us desert  ah they make us list or their fathers do said learoyd softly his helmet over his eyes  ortheriss brows contracted savagely he was watching the valley if its a girl ill shoot the beggar twice over an second time for bein a fool youre blasted sentimental all of a sudden thinkin o your last near shave  nay lad ah was but thinkin o what had happened  an fwhat has happened ye lumberin child av calamity that youre lowing like a cowcalf at the back av the pasture an suggestin invidious excuses for the man stanleys goin to kill yell have to wait another hour yet little man spit it out jock an bellow melojus to the moon it takes an earthquake or a bullet graze to fetch aught out av you discourse don juan the amoors av lotharius learoyd stanley kape a rowlin rigmental eye on the valley  its along o yon hill there said learoyd watching the bare subhimalayan spur that reminded him of his yorkshire moors he was speaking more to himself than his fellows  ay said he rumbolds moor stands up ower skipton town an greenhow hill stands up ower pately brig i reckon youve never heeard tell o greenhow hill but yon bit o bare stuff if there was nobbut a white road windin is like ut strangely like moors an moors an moors wi never a tree for shelter an grey houses wi flagstone rooves and pewits cryin an a windhover goin to and fro just like these kites and cold a wind that cuts you like a knife you could tell greenhow hill folk by the redapple color o their cheeks an nose tips and their blue eyes driven into pinpoints by the wind miners mostly burrowin for lead i th hillsides followin the trail of th ore vein same as a fieldrat it was the roughest minin i ever seen yod come on a bit o creakin wood windlass like a wellhead an you was let down i th bight of a rope fendin yoursen off the side wi one hand carryin a candle stuck in a lump o clay with tother an clickin hold of a rope with tother hand  an thats three of them said mulvaney must be a good climate in those parts  learoyd took no heed  an then yo came to a level where you crept on your hands and knees through a mile o windin drift an you come out into a caveplace as big as leeds townhall with a engine pumpin water from workins at went deeper still its a queer country let alone minin for the hill is full of those natural caves an the rivers an the becks drops into what they call potholes an come out again miles away  wot was you doin there said ortheris  i was a young chap then an mostly went wi osses leadin coal and lead ore but at th time im tellin on i was drivin the waggonteam i th big sumph i didnt belong to that countryside by rights i went there because of a little difference at home an at fust i took up wi a rough lot one night wed been drinkin an i must ha hed more than i could stand or happen th ale was none so good though i them days by for god i never seed bad ale he flung his arms over his head and gripped a vast handful of white violets nah said he i never seed the ale i could not drink the bacca i could not smoke nor the lass i could not kiss well we mun have a race home the lot on us i lost all th others an when i was climbin ower one of them walls built o loose stones i comes down into the ditch stones and all an broke my arm not as i knawed much about it for i fell on th back of my head an was knocked stupid like an when i come to mysen it were mornin an i were lyin on the settle i jesse roantrees houseplace an liza roantree was settin sewin i ached all ower and my mouth were like a limekiln she gave me a drink out of a china mug wi gold lettersa present from leedsas i looked at many and many a time at after yore to lie still while dr warbottom comes because your arms broken and father has sent a lad to fetch him he found yo when he was goin to work an carried you here on his back sez she oa sez i an i shet my eyes for i felt ashamed o mysen fathers gone to his work these three hours an he said he tell em to get somebody to drive the tram the clock ticked an a bee comed in the house an they rung i my head like millwheels an she give me another drink an settled the pillow eh but yore young to be getten drunk an such like but yo wont do it again will yonoa sez i i wouldnt if shed not but stop they millwheels clatterin  faith its a good thing to be nursed by a woman when youre sick said mulvaney dir cheap at the price av twenty broken heads  ortheris turned to frown across the valley he had not been nursed by many women in his life  an then dr warbottom comes ridin up an jesse roantree along with im he was a highlarned doctor but he talked wi poor folk same as theirsens whats ta bin agaate on naa he sings out brekkin tha thick head an he felt me all ovver thats none broken tha nobbut knocked a bit sillier than ordinary an thats daaft eneaf an soa he went on callin me all the names he could think on but settin my arm wi jesses help as careful as could be yo mun let the big oaf bide here a bit jesse he says when he hed strapped me up an given me a dose o physic an you an liza will tend him though hes scarcelins worth the trouble an thall lose tha work sez he an thall be upon th sick club for a couple o months an more doesnt tha think thas a fool  but whin was a young man high or low the other av a fool id like to know said mulvaney sure follys the only safe way to wisdom for ive thried it  wisdom grinned ortheris scanning his comrades with uplifted chin youre bloomin solomons you two aint you  learoyd went calmly on with a steady eye like an ox chewing the cud  and that was how i come to know liza roantree theres some tunes as she used to singaw she were always singinthat fetches greenhow hill before my eyes as fair as yon brow across there and she would learn me to sing bass an i was to go to th chapel wi em where jesse and she led the singin th old man playin the fiddle he was a strange chap old jesse fair mad wi music an he made me promise to learn the big fiddle when my arm was better it belonged to him and it stood up in a big case alongside o th eightday clock but willie satterthwaite as played it in the chapel had getten deaf as a doorpost and it vexed jesse as he had to rap him ower his head wi th fiddlestick to make him give ower sawin at th right time  but there was a black drop in it all an it was a man in a black coat that brought it when th primitive methodist preacher came to greenhow he would always stop wi jesse roantree an he laid hold of me from th beginning it seemed i wor a soul to be saved and he meaned to do it at th same time i jealoused at he were keen o savin liza roantrees soul as well and i could ha killed him many a time an this went on till one day i broke out an borrowed th brass for a drink from liza after fower days i come back wi my tail between my legs just to see liza again but jesse were at home an th preacherth reverend amos barraclough liza said naught but a bit o red come into her face as were white of a regular thing says jesse tryin his best to be civil nay lad its like this youve getten to choose which way its goin to be ill ha nobody across ma doorstep as goes adrinkin an borrows my lasss money to spend i their drink hod tha tongue liza sez he when she wanted to put in a word at i were welcome to th brass and she were none afraid that i wouldnt pay it back then the reverend cuts in seein as jesse were losin his temper an they fair beat me among them but it were liza as looked an said naught as did more than either o their tongues an soa i concluded to get converted  fwhat shouted mulvaney then checking himself he said softly let be let be sure the blessed virgin is the mother of all religion an most women an theres a dale av piety in a girl if the men would only let ut stay there id ha been converted myself under the circumstances  nay but pursued learoyd with a blush i meaned it  ortheris laughed as loudly as he dared having regard to his business at the time  ay ortheris you may laugh but you didnt know yon preacher barraclougha little whitefaced chap wi a voice as ud wile a bird off an a bush and a way o layin hold of folks as made them think theyd never had a live man for a friend before you never saw him ananyou never seed liza roantreenever seed liza roantree happen it was as much liza as th preacher and her father but anyways they all meaned it an i was fair shamed o mysen an so i become what they call a changed character and when i think on its hard to believe as yon chap going to prayermeetins chapel and classmeetins were me but i never had naught to say for mysen though there was a deal o shoutin and old sammy strother as were almost clemmed to death and doubled up with the rheumatics would sing out joyful joyful and at it were better to go up to heaven in a coalbasket than down to hell i a coach an six and he would put his poor old claw on my shoulder sayin doesnt tha feel it tha great lump doesnt tha feel it an sometimes i thought i did and then again i thought i didnt an how was that  the iverlastin nature av mankind said mulvaney an furthermore i misdoubt you were built for the primitive methodians theyre a new corps anyways i hold by the ould church for shes the mother of them allay an the father too i like her bekase shes most remarkable regimental in her fittings i may die in honolulu nova zambra or cape cayenne but wherever i die me bein fwhat i am an a priest handy i go under the same orders an the same words an the same unction as tho the pope himself come down from the roof av st peters to see me off theres neither high nor low nor broad nor deep nor betwixt nor between wid her an thats what i like but mark you shes no manner av church for a wake man bekaze she takes the body and the soul av him onless he has his proper work to do i remember when my father died that was three months comin to his grave begad hed ha sold the shebeen above our heads for ten minutes quittance of purgathory an he did all he could thats why i say ut takes a strong man to deal with the ould church an for that reason youll find so many women go there an that sames a conundrum  wots the use o worritin bout these things said ortheris youre bound to find all out quicker nor you want to anyow he jerked the cartridge out of the breechblock into the palm of his hand eres my chaplain he said and made the venomous blackheaded bullet bow like a marionette es goin to teach a man all about which is which an wots true after all before sundown but wot appened after that jock  there was one thing they boggled at and almost shut th gate i my face for and that were my dog blast th only one saved out o a litter o pups as was blowed up when a keg o minin powder loosed off in th storekeepers hut they liked his name no better than his business which were fightin every dog he comed across a rare good dog wi spots o black and pink on his face one ear gone and lame o one side wi being driven in a basket through an iron roof a matter of half a mile  they said i mun give him up cause he were worldly and low and would i let mysen be shut out of heaven for the sake on a dog nay says i if th door isnt wide enough for th pair on us well stop outside for well none be parted and th preacher spoke up for blast as had a likin for him from th firsti reckon that was why i come to like th preacherand wouldnt hear o changin his name to bless as some o them wanted so th pair on us became reglar chapelmembers but its hard for a young chap o my build to cut traces from the world th flesh an the devil all uv a heap yet i stuck to it for a long time while th lads as used to stand about th townend an lean ower th bridge spittin into th beck o a sunday would call after me sitha learoyd whens ta bean to preach cause were comin to hear thahod tha jaw he hasnt getten th white choaker on ta morn another lad would say and i had to double my fists hard i th bottom of my sunday coat and say to mysen if twere monday and i warnt a member o the primitive methodists id leather all th lot of yond that was th hardest of allto know that i could fight and i mustnt fight  sympathetic grunts from mulvaney  so what wi singin practicin and classmeetins and th big fiddle as he made me take between my knees i spent a deal o time i jesse roantrees houseplace but often as i was there th preacher fared to me to go oftener and both th old man an th young woman were pleased to have him he lived i pately brig as were a goodish step off but he come he come all the same i liked him as well or better as any man id ever seen i one way and yet i hated him wi all my heart i tother and we watched each other like cat and mouse but civil as you please for i was on my best behavior and he was that fair and open that i was bound to be fair with him rare good company he was if i hadnt wanted to wring his cliver little neck half of the time often and often when he was goin from jesses id set him a bit on the road  see im ome you mean said ortheris  ay its a way we have i yorkshire o seein friends off you was a friend as i didnt want to come back and he didnt want me to come back neither and so wed walk together toward pately and then hed set me back again and there wed be wal two oclock i the mornin settin each other to an fro like a blasted pair o pendulums twixt hill and valley long after th light had gone out i lizas window as both on us had been looking at pretending to watch the moon  ah broke in mulvaney yed no chanst against the maraudin psalmsinger theyll take the airs an the graces instid av the man nine times out av ten an they only find the blunder laterthe wimmen  thats just where yore wrong said learoyd reddening under the freckled tan of his cheeks i was th first wi liza an yod think that were enough but th parson were a steadygaited sort o chap and jesse were strong o his side and all th women i the congregation dinned it to liza at she were fair fond to take up wi a wastrel neerdoweel like me as was scarcelins respectable an a fighting dog at his heels it was all very well for her to be doing me good and saving my soul but she must mind as she didnt do herself harm they talk o rich folk bein stuck up an genteel but for castiron pride o respectability theres naught like poor chapel folk its as cold as th wind o greenhow hillay and colder for twill never change and now i come to think on it one at strangest things i know is at they couldnt abide th thought o soldiering theres a vast o fightin i th bible and theres a deal of methodists i th army but to hear chapel folk talk yod think that soldierin were next door an tother side to hangin i their meetins all their talk is o fightin when sammy strother were stuck for summat to say in his prayers hed sing out th sword o th lord and o gideon they were allus at it about puttin on th whole armor o righteousness an fightin the good fight o faith and then atop o t all they held a prayermeetin ower a young chap as wanted to list and nearly deafened him till he picked up his hat and fair ran away and theyd tell tales in th sundayschool o bad lads as had been thumped and brayed for birdnesting o sundays and playin truant o week days and how they took to wrestlin dogfightin rabbitrunnin and drinkin till at last as if twere a hepitaph on a gravestone they damned him across th moors wi an then he went and listed for a soldier an theyd all fetch a deep breath and throw up their eyes like a hen drinkin  fwhy is ut said mulvaney bringing down his hand on his thigh with a crack in the name av god fwhy is ut ive seen ut tu they cheat an they swindle an they lie an they slander an fifty things fifty times worse but the last an the worst by their reckonin is to serve the widdy honest its like the talk av childerseein things all round  plucky lot of fightin good fights of whatsername theyd do if we didnt see they had a quiet place to fight in and such fightin as theirs is cats on the tiles tother callin to which to come on id give a months pay to get some o them broadbacked beggars in london sweatin through a days roadmakin an a nights rain theyd carry on a deal afterwardsame as were supposed to carry on ive bin turned out of a measly arflicense pub down lambeth way full o greasy kebmen fore now said ortheris with an oath  maybe you were dhrunk said mulvaney soothingly  worse nor that the forders were drunk i was wearin the queens uniform  id no particular thought to be a soldier i them days said learoyd still keeping his eye on the bare hill opposite but this sort o talk put it i my head they was so good th chapel folk that they tumbled ower tother side but i stuck to it for lizas sake specially as she was learning me to sing the bass part in a horotorio as jesse were gettin up she sung like a throstle hersen and we had practicins night after night for a matter of three months  i know what a horotorio is said ortheris pertly its a sort of chaplains singsongwords all out of the bible and hullabaloojah choruses  most greenhow hill folks played some instrument or tother an they all sung so you mignt have heard them miles away and they were so pleased wi the noise they made they didnt fair to want anybody to listen the preacher sung high seconds when he wasnt playin the flute an they set me as hadnt got far with big fiddle again willie satterthwaite to jog his elbow when he had to get a gate playin old jesse was happy if ever a man was for he were th conductor an th first fiddle an th leadin singer beatin time wi his fiddlestick till at times hed rap with it on the table and cry out now you mun all stop its my turn and hed face round to his front fair sweating wi pride to sing th tenor solos but he were grandest i th choruses waggin his head flinging his arms round like a windmill and singin hisself black in the face a rare singer were jesse  yo see i was not o much account wi em all exceptin to liza roantree and i had a deal o time settin quiet at meetings and horotorio practices to hearken their talk and if it were strange to me at beginnin it got stranger still at after when i was shut on it and could study what it meaned  just after th horotorios come off liza as had allus been weakly like was took very bad i walked dr warbottoms horse up and down a deal of times while he were inside where they wouldnt let me go though i fair ached to see her  shell be better i noo ladbetter i noo he used to say tha mun ha patience then they said if i was quiet i might go in and th reverend amos barraclough used to read to her lyin propped up among th pillows then she began to mend a bit and they let me carry her on to th settle and when it got warm again she went about same as afore th preacher and me and blast was a deal together i them days and i one way we was rare good comrades but i could ha stretched him time and again with a good will i mind one day he said he would like to go down into th bowels o th earth and see how th lord had builded th framework o th everlastin hills he were one of them chaps as had a gift o sayin things they rolled off the tip of his clever tongue same as mulvaney here as would ha made a rare good preacher if he had nobbut given his mind to it i lent him a suit o miners kit as almost buried th little man and his white face down i th coatcollar and hatflap looked like the face of a boggart and he cowered down i th bottom o the waggon i was drivin a tram as led up a bit of an incline up to th cave where the engine was pumpin and where th ore was brought up and put into th waggons as went down o themselves me puttin th brake on and th horses atrottin after long as it was daylight we were good friends but when we got fair into th dark and could nobbut see th day shinin at the hole like a lamp at a streetend i feeled downright wicked ma religion dropped all away from me when i looked back at him as were always comin between me and liza the talk was at they were to be wed when she got better an i couldnt get her to say yes or nay to it he began to sing a hymn in his thin voice and i came out wi a chorus that was all cussin an swearin at my horses an i began to know how i hated him he were such a little chap too i could drop him wi one hand down garstangs copperholea place where th beck slithered ower th edge on a rock and fell wi a bit of a whisper into a pit as no rope i greenhow could plump  again learoyd rooted up the innocent violets ay he should see th bowels o th earth an never naught else i could take him a mile or two along th drift and leave him wi his candle doused to cry hallelujah wi none to hear him and say amen i was to lead him down th ladderway to th drift where jesse roantree was workin and why shouldnt he slip on th ladder wi my feet on his fingers till they loosed grip and i put him down wi my heel if i went fust down th ladder i could click hold on him and chuck him over my head so as he should go squshin down the shaft breakin his bones at evry timberin as bill appleton did when he was fresh and hadnt a bone left when he wrought to th bottom niver a blasted leg to walk from pately niver an arm to put round liza roantrees waist niver no moreniver no more  the thick lips curled back over the yellow teeth and that flushed face was not pretty to look upon mulvaney nodded sympathy and ortheris moved by his comrades passion brought up the rifle to his shoulder and searched the hillside for his quarry muttering ribaldry about a sparrow a spout and a thunderstorm the voice of the watercourse supplied the necessary small talk till learoyd picked up his story  but its none so easy to kill a man like yon when id given up my horses to th lad as took my place and i was showin th preacher th workins shoutin into his ear across th clang o th pumpin engines i saw he were afraid o naught and when the lamplight showed his black eyes i could feel as he was masterin me again i were no better nor blast chained up short and growlin i the depths of him while a strange dog went safe past  th art a coward and a fool i said to mysen an i wrestled i my mind again him till when we come to garstangs copperhole i laid hold o the preacher and lifted him up over my head and held him into the darkest on it now lad i says its to be one or tother on usthee or mefor liza roantree why isnt thee afraid for thysen i says for he were still i my arms as a sack nay im but afraid for thee my poor lad as knows naught says he i set him down on th edge an th beck run stiller an there was no more buzzin in my head like when th bee come through th window o jesses house what dost tha mean says i  ive often thought as thou ought to know says he but twas hard to tell thee liza roantrees for neither on us nor for nobody o this earth dr warbottom saysand he knows her and her mother before herthat she is in a decline and she cannot live six months longer hes known it for many a day steady john steady says he and that weak little man pulled me further back and set me again him and talked it all over quiet and still me turnin a bunch o candles in my hand and counting them ower and ower again as i listened a deal on it were th regular preachin talk but there were a vast lot as made me begin to think as he were more of a man than id ever given him credit for till i were cut as deep for him as i were for mysen  six candles we had and we crawled and climbed all that day while they lasted and i said to mysen liza roantree hasnt six months to live and when we came into th daylight again we were like dead men to look at an blast come behind us without so much as waggin his tail when i saw liza again she looked at me a minute and says whos telled tha for i see tha knows and she tried to smile as she kissed me and i fair broke down  yo see i was a young chap i them days and had seen naught o life let alone death as is allus awaitin she telled me as dr warbottom said as greenhow air was too keen and they were goin to bradford to jesses brother david as worked i a mill and i mun hold up like a man and a christian and shed pray for me well and they went away and the preacher that same back end o th year were appointed to another circuit as they call it and i were left alone on greenhow hill  i tried and i tried hard to stick to th chapel but twerent th same thing at after i hadnt lizas voice to follow i th singin nor her eyes ashinin acrost their heads and i th classmeetings they said as i mun have some experiences to tell and i hadnt a word to say for mysen  blast and me moped a good deal and happen we didnt behave ourselves over well for they dropped us and wondered however theyd come to take us up i cant tell how we got through th time while i th winter i gave up my job and went to bradford old jesse were at th door o th house in a long street o little houses hed been sendin th children way as were clatterin their clogs in th causeway for she were asleep  is it thee he says but youre not to see her ill none have her wakened for a nowt like thee shes goin fast and she mun go in peace thou lt never be good for naught i th world and as long as thou lives thoull never play the big fiddle get away lad get away so he shut the door softly i my face  nobody never made jesse my master but it seemed to me he was about right and i went away into the town and knocked up against a recruiting sergeant the old tales o th chapel folk came buzzin into my head i was to get away and this were th regular road for the likes o me i listed there and then took th widows shillin and had a bunch o ribbons pinned i my hat  but next day i found my way to david roantrees door and jesse came to open it says he thous come back again wi th devils colors flyinthy true colors as i always telled thee  but i begged and prayed of him to let me see her nobbut to say goodbye till a woman calls down th stairway she says john learoyds to come up th old man shifts aside in a flash and lays his hand on my arm quite gentle like but thoult be quiet john says he for shes rare and weak thou was allus a good lad  her eyes were all alive wi light and her hair was thick on the pillow round her but her cheeks were thinthin to frighten a man thats strong nay father yo maynt say th devils colors them ribbons is pretty an she held out her hands for th hat an she put all straight as a woman will wi ribbons nay but what theyre pretty she says eh but id ha liked to see thee i thy red coat john for thou was allus my own ladmy very own lad and none else  she lifted up her arms and they come round my neck i a gentle grip and they slacked away and she seemed fainting now yo mun get away lad says jesse and i picked up my hat and i came downstairs  th recruiting sergeant were waitin for me at th corner publichouse youve seen your sweetheart says he yes ive seen her says i well well have a quart now and youll do your best to forget her says he bein one o them smart bustlin chaps ay sergeant says i forget her and ive been forgettin her ever since  he threw away the wilted clump of white violets as he spoke ortheris suddenly rose to his knees his rifle at his shoulder and peered across the valley in the clear afternoon light his chin cuddled the stock and there was a twitching of the muscles of the right cheek as he sighted private stanley ortheris was engaged on his business a speck of white crawled up the watercourse  see that beggar  got im  seven hundred yards away and a full two hundred down the hillside the deserter of the aurangabadis pitched forward rolled down a red rock and lay very still with his face in a clump of blue gentians while a big raven flapped out of the pine wood to make investigation  thats a clean shot little man said mulvaney  learoyd thoughtfully watched the smoke clear away happen there was a lass tewed up wi him too said he  ortheris did not reply he was staring across the valley with the smile of the artist who looks on the completed work    to be filed for reference     by the hoof of the wild goat uptossed    from the cliff where she lay in the sun        fell the stone    to the tarn where the daylight is lost    so she fell from the light of the sun        and alone     now the fall was ordained from the first    with the goat and the cliff and the tarn        but the stone    knows only her life is accursed    as she sinks in the depths of the tarn        and alone     oh thou who hast builded the world    oh thou who hast lighted the sun    oh thou who hast darkened the tarn        judge thou    the sin of the stone that was hurled    by the goat from the light of the sun    as she sinks in the mire of the tarn        even noweven noweven now  from the unpublished papers of mcintosh jellaluidin  say is it dawn is it dusk in thy bower thou whom i long for who longest for me oh be it nightbe ithere he fell over a little camelcolt that was sleeping in the serai where the horsetraders and the best of the blackguards from central asia live and because he was very drunk indeed and the night was dark he could not rise again till i helped him that was the beginning of my acquaintance with mcintosh jellaludin when a loafer and drunk sings the song of the bower he must be worth cultivating he got off the camels back and said rather thickly iiim a bit screwed but a dip in loggerhead will put me right again and i say have you spoken to symonds about the mares knees  now loggerhead was six thousand weary miles away from us close to mesopotamia where you mustnt fish and poaching is impossible and charley symonds stable a half mile farther across the paddocks it was strange to hear all the old names on a may night among the horses and camels of the sultan caravanserai then the man seemed to remember himself and sober down at the same time we leaned against the camel and pointed to a corner of the serai where a lamp was burning  i live there said he and i should be extremely obliged if you would be good enough to help my mutinous feet thither for i am more than usually drunkmostmost phenomenally tight but not in respect to my head my brain cries out againsthow does it go but my head rides on therolls on the dunghill i should have said and controls the qualm  i helped him through the gangs of tethered horses and he collapsed on the edge of the veranda in front of the line of native quarters  thanksa thousand thanks o moon and little little stars to think that a man should so shamelessly  infamous liquor too ovid in exile drank no worse better it was frozen alas i had no ice goodnight i would introduce you to my wife were i soberor she civilized  a native woman came out of the darkness of the room and began calling the man names so i went away he was the most interesting loafer that i had had the pleasure of knowing for a long time and later on he became a friend of mine he was a tall wellbuilt fair man fearfully shaken with drink and he looked nearer fifty than the thirtyfive which he said was his real age when a man begins to sink in india and is not sent home by his friends as soon as may be he falls very low from a respectable point of view by the time that he changes his creed as did mcintosh he is past redemption  in most big cities natives will tell you of two or three sahibs generally lowcaste who have turned hindu or mussulman and who live more or less as such but it is not often that you can get to know them as mcintosh himself used to say if i change my religion for my stomachs sake i do not seek to become a martyr to missionaries nor am i anxious for notoriety  at the outset of acquaintance mcintosh warned me remember this i am not an object for charity i require neither your money your food nor your castoff raiment i am that rare animal a selfsupporting drunkard if you choose i will smoke with you for the tobacco of the bazars does not i admit suit my palate and i will borrow any books which you may not specially value it is more than likely that i shall sell them for bottles of excessively filthy country liquors in return you shall share such hospitality as my house affords here is a charpoy on which two can sit and it is possible that there may from time to time be food in that platter drink unfortunately you will find on the premises at any hour and thus i make you welcome to all my poor establishment  i was admitted to the mcintosh householdi and my good tobacco but nothing else unluckily one cannot visit a loafer in the serai by day friends buying horses would not understand it consequently i was obliged to see mcintosh after dark he laughed at this and said simply you are perfectly right when i enjoyed a position in society rather higher than yours i should have done exactly the same thing good heavens i was oncehe spoke as though he had fallen from the command of a regimentan oxford man this accounted for the reference to charley symonds stable  you said mcintosh slowly have not had that advantage but to outward appearance you do not seem possessed of a craving for strong drinks on the whole i fancy that you are the luckier of the two yet i am not certain you areforgive my saying so even while i am smoking your excellent tobaccopainfully ignorant of many things  we were sitting together on the edge of his bedstead for he owned no chairs watching the horses being watered for the night while the native woman was preparing dinner i did not like being patronized by a loafer but i was his guest for the time being though he owned only one very torn alpacacoat and a pair of trousers made out of gunnybags he took the pipe out of his mouth and went on judicially all things considered i doubt whether you are the luckier i do not refer to your extremely limited classical attainments or your excruciating quantities but to your gross ignorance of matters more immediately under your notice that for instance he pointed to a woman cleaning a samovar near the well in the centre of the serai she was flicking the water out of the spout in regular cadenced jerks  there are ways and ways of cleaning samovars if you knew why she was doing her work in that particular fashion you would know what the spanish monk meant when he said     i the trinity illustrate        drinking watered orangepulp    in three sips the arian frustrate        while he drains his at one gulp  and many other things which now are hidden from your eyes however mrs mcintosh has prepared dinner let us come and eat after the fashion of the people of the countryof whom by the way you know nothing  the native woman dipped her hand in the dish with us this was wrong the wife should always wait until the husband has eaten mcintosh jellaludin apologized saying  it is an english prejudice which i have not been able to overcome and she loves me why i have never been able to understand i foregathered with her at jullundur three years ago and she has remained with me ever since i believe her to be moral and know her to be skilled in cookery  he patted the womans head as he spoke and she cooed softly she was not pretty to look at  mcintosh never told me what position he had held before his fall he was when sober a scholar and a gentleman when drunk he was rather more of the first than the second he used to get drunk about once a week for two days on those occasions the native woman tended him while he raved in all tongues except his own one day indeed he began reciting atalanta in calydon and went through it to the end beating time to the swing of the verse with a bedsteadleg but he did most of his ravings in greek or german the mans mind was a perfect ragbag of useless things once when he was beginning to get sober he told me that i was the only rational being in the inferno into which he had descendeda virgil in the shades he saidand that in return for my tobacco he would before he died give me the materials of a new inferno that should make me greater than dante then he fell asleep on a horseblanket and woke up quite calm  man said he when you have reached the uttermost depths of degradation little incidents which would vex a higher life are to you of no consequence last night my soul was among the gods but i make no doubt that my bestial body was writhing down here in the garbage  you were abominably drunk if thats what you mean i said  i was drunkfilthily drunk i who am the son of a man with whom you have no concerni who was once fellow of a college whose butteryhatch you have not seen i was loathsomely drunk but consider how lightly i am touched it is nothing to me less than nothing for i do not even feel the headache which should be my portion now in a higher life how ghastly would have been my punishment how bitter my repentance believe me my friend with the neglected education the highest is as the lowestalways supposing each degree extreme  he turned round on the blanket put his head between his fists and continued  on the soul which i have lost and on the conscience which i have killed i tell you that i cannot feel i am as the gods knowing good and evil but untouched by either is this enviable or is it not  when a man has lost the warning of next mornings head he must be in a bad state i answered looking at mcintosh on the blanket with his hair over his eyes and his lips bluewhite that i did not think the insensibility good enough  for pitys sake dont say that i tell you it is good and most enviable think of my consolations  have you so many then mcintosh  certainly your attempts at sarcasm which is essentially the weapon of a cultured man are crude first my attainments my classical and literary knowledge blurred perhaps by immoderate drinkingwhich reminds me that before my soul went to the gods last night i sold the pickering horace you so kindly loaned me ditta mull the clothesman has it it fetched ten annas and may be redeemed for a rupeebut still infinitely superior to yours secondly the abiding affection of mrs mcintosh best of wives thirdly a monument more enduring than brass which i have built up in the seven years of my degradation  he stopped here and crawled across the room for a drink of water he was very shaky and sick  he referred several times to his treasuresome great possession that he ownedbut i held this to be the raving of drink he was as poor and as proud as he could be his manner was not pleasant but he knew enough about the natives among whom seven years of his life had been spent to make his acquaintance worth having he used actually to laugh at strickland as an ignorant manignorant west and easthe said his boast was first that he was an oxford man of rare and shining parts which may or may not have been truei did not know enough to check his statementsand secondly that he had his hand on the pulse of native lifewhich was a fact as an oxford man he struck me as a prig he was always throwing his education about as a mohammedan faquiras mcintosh jellaludinhe was all that i wanted for my own ends he smoked several pounds of my tobacco and taught me several ounces of things worth knowing but he would never accept any gifts not even when the cold weather came and gripped the poor thin chest under the poor thin alpacacoat he grew very angry and said that i had insulted him and that he was not going into hospital he had lived like a beast and he would die rationally like a man  as a matter of fact he died of pneumonia and on the night of his death sent over a grubby note asking me to come and help him to die  the native woman was weeping by the side of the bed mcintosh wrapped in a cotton cloth was too weak to resent a fur coat being thrown over him he was very active as far as his mind was concerned and his eyes were blazing when he had abused the doctor who came with me so foully that the indignant old fellow left he cursed me for a few minutes and calmed down  then he told his wife to fetch out the book from a hole in the wall she brought out a big bundle wrapped in the tail of a petticoat of old sheets of miscellaneous notepaper all numbered and covered with fine cramped writing mcintosh ploughed his hand through the rubbish and stirred it up lovingly  this he said is my workthe book of mcintosh jellaludin showing what he saw and how he lived and what befell him and others being also an account of the life and sins and death of mother maturin what mirza murad ali begs book is to all other books on native life will my work be to mirza murad ali begs  this as will be conceded by any one who knows mirza murad ali begs book was a sweeping statement the papers did not look specially valuable but mcintosh handled them as if they were currencynotes then said he slowly  in despite the many weaknesses of your education you have been good to me i will speak of your tobacco when i reach the gods i owe you much thanks for many kindnesses but i abominate indebtedness for this reason i bequeath to you now the monument more enduring than brassmy one bookrude and imperfect in parts but oh how rare in others i wonder if you will understand it it is a gift more honorable than bah where is my brain rambling to you will mutilate it horribly you will knock out the gems you call latin quotations you philistine and you will butcher the style to carve into your own jerky jargon but you cannot destroy the whole of it i bequeath it to you ethel my brain again  mrs mcintosh bear witness that i give the sahib all these papers they would be of no use to you heart of my heart and i lay it upon you he turned to me here that you do not let my book die in its present form it is yours unconditionallythe story of mcintosh jellaludin which is not the story of mcintosh jellaludin but of a greater man than he and of a far greater woman listen now i am neither mad nor drunk that book will make you famous  i said thank you as the native woman put the bundle into my arms  my only baby said mcintosh with a smile he was sinking fast but he continued to talk as long as breath remained i waited for the end knowing that in six cases out of ten a dying man calls for his mother he turned on his side and said  say how it came into your possession no one will believe you but my name at least will live you will treat it brutally i know you will some of it must go the public are fools and prudish fools i was their servant once but do your mangling gentlyvery gently it is a great work and i have paid for it in seven years damnation  his voice stopped for ten or twelve breaths and then he began mumbling a prayer of some kind in greek the native woman cried very bitterly lastly he rose in bed and said as loudly as slowlynot guilty my lord  then he fell back and the stupor held him till he died the native woman ran into the serai among the horses and screamed and beat her breasts for she had loved him  perhaps his last sentence in life told what mcintosh had once gone through but saving the big bundle of old sheets in the cloth there was nothing in his room to say who or what he had been  the papers were in a hopeless muddle  strickland helped me to sort them and he said that the writer was either an extreme liar or a most wonderful person he thought the former one of these days you may be able to judge for yourselves the bundle needed much expurgation and was full of greek nonsense at the head of the chapters which has all been cut out  if the thing is ever published some one may perhaps remember this story now printed as a safeguard to prove that mcintosh jellaludin and not i myself wrote the book of mother maturin  i dont want the giants robe to come true in my case    the man who would be king  brother to a prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy  the law as quoted lays down a fair conduct of life and one not easy to follow i have been fellow to a beggar again and again under circumstances which prevented either of us finding out whether the other was worthy i have still to be brother to a prince though i once came near to kinship with what might have been a veritable king and was promised the reversion of a kingdomarmy lawcourts revenue and policy all complete but today i greatly fear that my king is dead and if i want a crown i must go and hunt it for myself  the beginning of everything was in a railway train upon the road to mhow from ajmir there had been a deficit in the budget which necessitated traveling not secondclass which is only half as dear as firstclass but by intermediate which is very awful indeed there are no cushions in the intermediate class and the population are either intermediate which is eurasian or native which for a long night journey is nasty or loafer which is amusing though intoxicated intermediates do not patronize refreshmentrooms they carry their food in bundles and pots and buy sweets from the native sweetmeatsellers and drink the roadside water that is why in the hot weather intermediates are taken out of the carriages dead and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon  my particular intermediate happened to be empty till i reached nasirabad when a huge gentleman in shirtsleeves entered and following the custom of intermediates passed the time of day he was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself but with an educated taste for whiskey he told tales of things he had seen and done of outoftheway corners of the empire into which he had penetrated and of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days food if india was filled with men like you and me not knowing more than the crows where theyd get their next days rations it isnt seventy millions of revenue the land would be payingits seven hundred millions said he and as i looked at his mouth and chin i was disposed to agree with him we talked politicsthe politics of loaferdom that sees things from the underside where the lath and plaster is not smoothed offand we talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram back from the next station to ajmir which is the turningoff place from the bombay to the mhow line as you travel westward my friend had no money beyond eight annas which he wanted for dinner and i had no money at all owing to the hitch in the budget before mentioned further i was going into a wilderness where though i should resume touch with the treasury there were no telegraph offices i was therefore unable to help him in any way  we might threaten a stationmaster and make him send a wire on tick said my friend but thatd mean inquiries for you and for me and ive got my hands full these days did you say you are traveling back along this line within any days  within ten i said  cant you make it eight said he mine is rather urgent business  i can send your telegram within ten days if that will serve you i said  i couldnt trust the wire to fetch him now i think of it its this way he leaves delhi on the 23d for bombay that means hell be running through ajmir about the night of the 23d  but im going into the indian desert i explained  well and good said he youll be changing at marwar junction to get into jodhpore territoryyou must do thatand hell be coming through marwar junction in the early morning of the 24th by the bombay mail can you be at marwar junction on that time twont be inconveniencing you because i know that theres precious few pickings to be got out of these central india stateseven though you pretend to be correspondent of the backwoodsman  have you ever tried that trick i asked  again and again but the residents find you out and then you get escorted to the border before youve time to get your knife into them but about my friend here i must give him a word o mouth to tell him whats come to me or else he wont know where to go i would take it more than kind of you if you was to come out of central india in time to catch him at marwar junction and say to himhe has gone south for the week hell know what that means hes a big man with a red beard and a great swell he is youll find him sleeping like a gentleman with all his luggage round him in a secondclass compartment but dont you be afraid slip down the window and sayhe has gone south for the week and hell tumble its only cutting your time of stay in those parts by two days i ask you as a strangergoing to the west he said with emphasis  where have you come from said i  from the east said he and i am hoping that you will give him the message on the squarefor the sake of my mother as well as your own  englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their mothers but for certain reasons which will be fully apparent i saw fit to agree  its more than a little matter said he and thats why i ask you to do itand now i know that i can depend on you doing it a secondclass carriage at marwar junction and a redhaired man asleep in it youll be sure to remember i get out at the next station and i must hold on there till he comes or sends me what i want  ill give the message if i catch him i said and for the sake of your mother as well as mine ill give you a word of advice dont try to run the central india states just now as the correspondent of the backwoodsman theres a real one knocking about here and it might lead to trouble  thank you said he simply and when will the swine be gone i cant starve because hes ruining my work i wanted to get hold of the degumber rajah down here about his fathers widow and give him a jump  what did he do to his fathers widow then  filled her up with red pepper and slippered her to death as she hung from a beam i found that out myself and im the only man that would dare going into the state to get hushmoney for it theyll try to poison me same as they did in chortumna when i went on the loot there but youll give the man at marwar junction my message  he got out at a little roadside station and i reflected i had heard more than once of men personating correspondents of newspapers and bleeding small native states with threats of exposure but i had never met any of the caste before they lead a hard life and generally die with great suddenness the native states have a wholesome horror of english newspapers which may throw light on their peculiar methods of government and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne or drive them out of their mind with fourinhand barouches they do not understand that nobody cares a straw for the internal administration of native states so long as oppression and crime are kept within decent limits and the ruler is not drugged drunk or diseased from one end of the year to the other native states were created by providence in order to supply picturesque scenery tigers and tallwriting they are the dark places of the earth full of unimaginable cruelty touching the railway and the telegraph on one side and on the other the days of harunalraschid when i left the train i did business with divers kings and in eight days passed through many changes of life sometimes i wore dressclothes and consorted with princes and politicals drinking from crystal and eating from silver sometimes i lay out upon the ground and devoured what i could get from a plate made of a flapjack and drank the running water and slept under the same rug as my servant it was all in the days work  then i headed for the great indian desert upon the proper date as i had promised and the night mail set me down at marwar junction where a funny little happygolucky nativemanaged railway runs to jodhpore the bombay mail from delhi makes a short halt at marwar she arrived as i got in and i had just time to hurry to her platform and go down the carriages there was only one secondclass on the train i slipped the window and looked down upon a flaming red beard half covered by a railway rug that was my man fast asleep and i dug him gently in the ribs he woke with a grunt and i saw his face in the light of the lamps it was a great and shining face  tickets again said he  no said i i am to tell you that he is gone south for the week he is gone south for the week  the train had begun to move out the red man rubbed his eyes he has gone south for the week he repeated now thats just like his impidence did he say that i was to give you anythingcause i wont  he didnt i said and dropped away and watched the red lights die out in the dark it was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off the sands i climbed into my own trainnot an intermediate carriage this timeand went to sleep  if the man with the beard had given me a rupee i should have kept it as a memento of a rather curious affair but the consciousness of having done my duty was my only reward  later on i reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers and might if they stuck up one of the little rattrap states of central india or southern rajputana get themselves into serious difficulties i therefore took some trouble to describe them as accurately as i could remember to people who would be interested in deporting them and succeeded so i was later informed in having them headed back from the degumber borders  then i became respectable and returned to an office where there were no kings and no incidents except the daily manufacture of a newspaper a newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person to the prejudice of discipline zenanamission ladies arrive and beg that the editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a christian prizegiving in a backslum of a perfectly inaccessible village colonels who have been overpassed for commands sit down and sketch the outline of a series of ten twelve or twentyfour leading articles on seniority versus selection missionaries wish to know why they have not been permitted to escape from their regular vehicles of abuse and swear at a brothermissionary under special patronage of the editorial we stranded theatrical companies troop up to explain that they cannot pay for their advertisements but on their return from new zealand or tahiti will do so with interest inventors of patent punkahpulling machines carriage couplings and unbreakable swords and axletrees call with specifications in their pockets and hours at their disposal teacompanies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens secretaries of ballcommittees clamor to have the glories of their last dance more fully expounded strange ladies rustle in and sayi want a hundred ladys cards printed at once please which is manifestly part of an editors duty and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped the grand trunk road makes it his business to ask for employment as a proofreader and all the time the telephonebell is ringing madly and kings are being killed on the continent and empires are sayingyoure another and mister gladstone is calling down brimstone upon the british dominions and the little black copyboys are whining kaapichayhayeh copy wanted like tired bees and most of the paper is as blank as modreds shield  but that is the amusing part of the year there are six other months wherein none ever come to call and the thermometer walks inch by inch up to the top of the glass and the office is darkened to just above readinglight and the press machines are redhot of touch and nobody writes anything but accounts of amusements in the hillstations or obituary notices then the telephone becomes a tinkling terror because it tells you of the sudden deaths of men and women that you knew intimately and the pricklyheat covers you as with a garment and you sit down and writea slight increase of sickness is reported from the khuda janta khan district the outbreak is purely sporadic in its nature and thanks to the energetic efforts of the district authorities is now almost at an end it is however with deep regret we record the death etc  then the sickness really breaks out and the less recording and reporting the better for the peace of the subscribers but the empires and the kings continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before and the foreman thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in twentyfour hours and all the people at the hillstations in the middle of their amusements saygood gracious why cant the paper be sparkling im sure theres plenty going on up here  that is the dark half of the moon and as the advertisements say must be experienced to be appreciated  it was in that season and a remarkably evil season that the paper began running the last issue of the week on saturday night which is to say sunday morning after the custom of a london paper this was a great convenience for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn would lower the thermometer from 96  to almost 84  for half an hour and in that chillyou have no idea how cold is 84  on the grass until you begin to pray for ita very tired man could set off to sleep ere the heat roused him  one saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed alone a king or courtier or a courtesan or a community was going to die or get a new constitution or do something that was important on the other side of the world and the paper was to be held open till the latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram it was a pitchy black night as stifling as a june night can be and the loo the redhot wind from the westward was booming among the tinderdry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with the flop of a frog but all our weary world knew that was only pretence it was a shade cooler in the pressroom than the office so i sat there while the type ticked and clicked and the nightjars hooted at the windows and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their foreheads and called for water the thing that was keeping us back whatever it was would not come off though the loo dropped and the last type was set and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat with its finger on its lip to wait the event i drowsed and wondered whether the telegraph was a blessing and whether this dying man or struggling people was aware of the inconvenience the delay was causing there was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make tension but as the clock hands crept up to three oclock and the machines spun their flywheels two and three times to see that all was in order before i said the word that would set them off i could have shrieked aloud  then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little bits i rose to go away but two men in white clothes stood in front of me the first one saidits him the second saidso it is and they both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared and mopped their foreheads we see there was a light burning across the road and we were sleeping in that ditch there for coolness and i said to my friend here the office is open lets come along and speak to him as turned us back from the degumber state said the smaller of the two he was the man i had met in the mhow train and his fellow was the redbearded man of marwar junction there was no mistaking the eyebrows of the one or the beard of the other  i was not pleased because i wished to go to sleep not to squabble with loafers what do you want i asked  half an hours talk with you cool and comfortable in the office said the redbearded man wed like some drinkthe contrack doesnt begin yet peachey so you neednt lookbut what we really want is advice we dont want money we ask you as a favor because you did us a bad turn about degumber  i led from the pressroom to the stifling office with the maps on the walls and the redhaired man rubbed his hands thats something like said he this was the proper shop to come to now sir let me introduce to you brother peachey carnehan thats him and brother daniel dravot that is me and the less said about our professions the better for we have been most things in our time soldier sailor compositor photographer proofreader streetpreacher and correspondents of the backwoodsman when we thought the paper wanted one carnehan is sober and so am i look at us first and see thats sure it will save you cutting into my talk well take one of your cigars apiece and you shall see us light  i watched the test the men were absolutely sober so i gave them each a tepid peg  well and good said carnehan of the eyebrows wiping the froth from his moustache let me talk now dan we have been all over india mostly on foot we have been boilerfitters enginedrivers petty contractors and all that and we have decided that india isnt big enough for such as us  they certainly were too big for the office dravots beard seemed to fill half the room and carnehans shoulders the other half as they sat on the big table carnehan continuedthe country isnt half worked out because they that governs it wont let you touch it they spend all their blessed time in governing it and you cant lift a spade nor chip a rock nor look for oil nor anything like that without all the government sayingleave it alone and let us govern therefore such as it is we will let it alone and go away to some other place where a man isnt crowded and can come to his own we are not little men and there is nothing that we are afraid of except drink and we have signed a contrack on that therefore we are going away to be kings  kings in our own right muttered dravot  yes of course i said youve been tramping in the sun and its a very warm night and hadnt you better sleep over the notion come tomorrow  neither drunk nor sunstruck said dravot we have slept over the notion half a year and require to see books and atlases and we have decided that there is only one place now in the world that two strong men can sarawhack they call it kafiristan by my reckoning its the top righthand corner of afghanistan not more than three hundred miles from peshawur they have two and thirty heathen idols there and well be the thirtythird its a mountaineous country and the women of those parts are very beautiful  but that is provided against in the contrack said carnehan neither women nor liquor daniel  and thats all we know except that no one has gone there and they fight and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill men can always be a king we shall go to those parts and say to any king we finddyou want to vanquish your foes and we will show him how to drill men for that we know better than anything else then we will subvert that king and seize his throne and establish a dynasty  youll be cut to pieces before youre fifty miles across the border i said you have to travel through afghanistan to get to that country its one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers and no englishman has been through it the people are utter brutes and even if you reached them you couldnt do anything  thats more like said carnehan if you could think us a little more mad we would be more pleased we have come to you to know about this country to read a book about it and to be shown maps we want you to tell us that we are fools and to show us your books he turned to the bookcases  are you at all in earnest i said  a little said dravot sweetly as big a map as you have got even if its all blank where kafiristan is and any books youve got we can read though we arent very educated  i uncased the big thirtytwomilestotheinch map of india and two smaller frontier maps hauled down volume infkan of the encyclopaedia britannica and the men consulted them  see here said dravot his thumb on the map up to jagdallak peachey and me know the road we was there with robertss army well have to turn off to the right at jagdallak through laghmann territory then we get among the hillsfourteen thousand feetfifteen thousandit will be cold work there but it dont look very far on the map  i handed him wood on the sources of the oxus carnehan was deep in the encyclopaedia  theyre a mixed lot said dravot reflectively and it wont help us to know the names of their tribes the more tribes the more theyll fight and the better for us from jagdallak to ashang hmm  but all the information about the country is as sketchy and inaccurate as can be i protested no one knows anything about it really heres the file of the united services institute read what bellew says  blow bellew said carnehan dan theyre an allfired lot of heathens but this book here says they think theyre related to us english  i smoked while the men pored over raverty wood the maps and the encyclopaedia  there is no use your waiting said dravot politely its about four oclock now well go before six oclock if you want to sleep and we wont steal any of the papers dont you sit up were two harmless lunatics and if you come tomorrow evening down to the serai well say goodbye to you  you are two fools i answered youll be turned back at the frontier or cut up the minute you set foot in afghanistan do you want any money or a recommendation downcountry i can help you to the chance of work next week  next week we shall be hard at work ourselves thank you said dravot it isnt so easy being a king as it looks when weve got our kingdom in going order well let you know and you can come up and help us to govern it  would two lunatics make a contrack like that said carnehan with subdued pride showing me a greasy halfsheet of notepaper on which was written the following i copied it then and there as a curiosity  this contract between me and you persuing witnesseth in the name of godamen and so forth     one that me and you will settle this matter together ie      to be kings of kafiristan     two that you and me will not while this matter is being settled      look at any liquor nor any woman black white or brown so      as to get mixed up with one or the other harmful     three that we conduct ourselves with dignity and discretion and      if one of us gets into trouble the other will stay by him     signed by you and me this day     peachey taliaferro carnehan     daniel dravot     both gentlemen at large  there was no need for the last article said carnehan blushing modestly but it looks regular now you know the sort of men that loafers arewe are loafers dan until we get out of indiaand do you think that we would sign a contrack like that unless we was in earnest we have kept away from the two things that make life worth having  you wont enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this idiotic adventure dont set the office on fire i said and go away before nine oclock  i left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back of the contrack be sure to come down to the serai tomorrow were their parting words  the kumharsen serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the strings of camels and horses from the north load and unload all the nationalities of central asia may be found there and most of the folk of india proper balkh and bokhara there meet bengal and bombay and try to draw eyeteeth you can buy ponies turquoises persian pussycats saddlebags fattailed sheep and musk in the kumharsen serai and get many strange things for nothing in the afternoon i went down there to see whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying about drunk  a priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me gravely twisting a childs paper whirligig behind him was his servant bending under the load of a crate of mud toys the two were loading up two camels and the inhabitants of the serai watched them with shrieks of laughter  the priest is mad said a horsedealer to me he is going up to kabul to sell toys to the amir he will either be raised to honor or have his head cut off he came in here this morning and has been behaving madly ever since  the witless are under the protection of god stammered a flatcheeked usbeg in broken hindi they foretell future events  would they could have foretold that my caravan would have been cut up by the shinwaris almost within shadow of the pass grunted the eusufzai agent of a rajputana tradinghouse whose goods had been feloniously diverted into the hands of other robbers just across the border and whose misfortunes were the laughingstock of the bazar ohé priest whence come you and whither do you go  from roum have i come shouted the priest waving his whirligig from roum blown by the breath of a hundred devils across the sea o thieves robbers liars the blessing of pir khan on pigs dogs and perjurers who will take the protected of god to the north to sell charms that are never still to the amir the camels shall not gall the sons shall not fall sick and the wives shall remain faithful while they are away of the men who give me place in their caravan who will assist me to slipper the king of the roos with a golden slipper with a silver heel the protection of pir khan be upon his labors he spread out the skirts of his gaberdine and pirouetted between the lines of tethered horses  there starts a caravan from peshawur to kabul in twenty days huzrut said the eusufzai trader my camels go therewith do thou also go and bring us good luck  i will go even now shouted the priest i will depart upon my winged camels and be at peshawur in a day ho hazar mir khan he yelled to his servant drive out the camels but let me first mount my own  he leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt and turning round to me criedcome thou also sahib a little along the road and i will sell thee a charman amulet that shall make thee king of kafiristan  then the light broke upon me and i followed the two camels out of the serai till we reached open road and the priest halted  what d you think o that said he in english carnehan cant talk their patter so ive made him my servant he makes a handsome servant tisnt for nothing that ive been knocking about the country for fourteen years didnt i do that talk neat well hitch on to a caravan at peshawur till we get to jagdallak and then well see if we can get donkeys for our camels and strike into kafiristan whirligigs for the amir o lor put your hand under the camelbags and tell me what you feel  i felt the butt of a martini and another and another  twenty of em said dravot placidly twenty of em and ammunition to correspond under the whirligigs and the mud dolls  heaven help you if you are caught with those things i said a martini is worth her weight in silver among the pathans  fifteen hundred rupees of capitalevery rupee we could beg borrow or stealare invested on these two camels said dravot we wont get caught were going through the khaiber with a regular caravan whod touch a poor mad priest  have you got everything you want i asked overcome with astonishment  not yet but we shall soon give us a memento of your kindness brother you did me a service yesterday and that time in marwar half my kingdom shall you have as the saying is i slipped a small charm compass from my watchchain and handed it up to the priest  goodbye said dravot giving me hand cautiously its the last time well shake hands with an englishman these many days shake hands with him carnehan he cried as the second camel passed me  carnehan leaned down and shook hands then the camels passed away along the dusty road and i was left alone to wonder my eye could detect no failure in the disguises the scene in serai attested that they were complete to the native mind there was just the chance therefore that carnehan and dravot would be able to wander through afghanistan without detection but beyond they would find death certain and awful death  ten days later a native friend of mine giving me the news of the day from peshawur wound up his letter withthere has been much laughter here on account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation to sell petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as great charms to hh the amir of bokhara he passed through peshawur and associated himself to the second summer caravan that goes to kabul the merchants are pleased because through superstition they imagine that such mad fellows bring goodfortune  the two then were beyond the border i would have prayed for them but that night a real king died in europe and demanded on obituary notice                                            the wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again summer passed and winter thereafter and came and passed again the daily paper continued and i with it and upon the third summer there fell a hot night a nightissue and a strained waiting for something to be telegraphed from the other side of the world exactly as had happened before a few great men had died in the past two years the machines worked with more clatter and some of the trees in the office garden were a few feet taller but that was all the difference  i passed over to the pressroom and went through just such a scene as i have already described the nervous tension was stronger than it had been two years before and i felt the heat more acutely at three oclock i cried print off and turned to go when there crept to my chair what was left of a man he was bent into a circle his head was sunk between his shoulders and he moved his feet one over the other like a bear i could hardly see whether he walked or crawledthis ragwrapped whining cripple who addressed me by name crying that he was come back can you give me a drink he whimpered for the lords sake give me a drink  i went back to the office the man following with groans of pain and i turned up the lamp  dont you know me he gasped dropping into a chair and he turned his drawn face surmounted by a shock of grey hair to the light  i looked at him intently once before had i seen eyebrows that met over the nose in an inchbroad black band but for the life of me i could not tell where  i dont know you i said handing him the whiskey what can i do for you  he took a gulp of the spirit raw and shivered in spite of the suffocating heat  ive come back he repeated and i was the king of kafiristanme and dravotcrowned kings we was in this office we settled ityou setting there and giving us the books i am peacheypeachey taliaferro carnehan and youve been setting here ever sinceo lord  i was more than a little astonished and expressed my feelings accordingly  its true said carnehan with a dry cackle nursing his feet which were wrapped in rags true as gospel kings we were with crowns upon our headsme and dravotpoor danoh poor poor dan that would never take advice not though i begged of him  take the whiskey i said and take your own time tell me all you can recollect of everything from beginning to end you got across the border on your camels dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant do you remember that  i aint madyet but i shall be that way soon of course i remember keep looking at me or maybe my words will go all to pieces keep looking at me in my eyes and dont say anything  i leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as i could he dropped one hand upon the table and i grasped it by the wrist it was twisted like a birds claw and upon the back was a ragged red diamondshaped scar  no dont look there look at me said carnehan  that comes afterward but for the lords sake dont distrack me we left with that caravan me and dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people we were with dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was cooking their dinnerscooking their dinners and  what did they do then they lit little fires with sparks that went into dravots beard and we all laughedfit to die little red fires they was going into dravots big red beardso funny his eyes left mine and he smiled foolishly  you went as far as jagdallak with that caravan i said at a venture after you had lit those fires to jagdallak where you turned off to try to get into kafiristan  no we didnt neither what are you talking about we turned off before jagdallak because we heard the roads was good but they wasnt good enough for our two camelsmine and dravots when we left the caravan dravot took off all his clothes and mine too and said we would be heathen because the kafirs didnt allow mohammedans to talk to them so we dressed betwixt and between and such a sight as daniel dravot i never saw yet nor expect to see again he burned half his beard and slung a sheepskin over his shoulder and shaved his head into patterns he shaved mine too and made me wear outrageous things to look like a heathen that was in a most mountaineous country and our camels couldnt go along any more because of the mountains they were tall and black and coming home i saw them fight like wild goatsthere are lots of goats in kafiristan and these mountains they never keep still no more than the goats always fighting they are and dont let you sleep at night  take some more whiskey i said very slowly what did you and daniel dravot do when the camels could go no further because of the rough roads that led into kafiristan  what did which do there was a party called peachey taliaferro carnehan that was with dravot shall i tell you about him he died out there in the cold slap from the bridge fell old peachey turning and twisting in the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the amirno they was two for three hapence those whirligigs or i am much mistaken and woful sore and then these camels were no use and peachey said to dravotfor the lords sake lets get out of this before our heads are chopped off and with that they killed the camels all among the mountains not having anything in particular to eat but first they took off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition till two men came along driving four mules dravot up and dances in front of them singingsell me four mules says the first manif you are rich enough to buy you are rich enough to rob but before ever he could put his hand to his knife dravot breaks his neck over his knee and the other party runs away so carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken off the camels and together we starts forward into those bitter cold mountaineous parts and never a road broader than the back of your hand  he paused for a moment while i asked him if he could remember the nature of the country through which he had journeyed  i am telling you as straight as i can but my head isnt as good as it might be they drove nails through it to make me hear better how dravot died the country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary and the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary they went up and up and down and down and that other party carnehan was imploring of dravot not to sing and whistle so loud for fear of bringing down the tremenjus avalanches but dravot says that if a king couldnt sing it wasnt worth being king and whacked the mules over the rump and never took no heed for ten cold days we came to a big level valley all among the mountains and the mules were near dead so we killed them not having anything in special for them or us to eat we sat upon the boxes and played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out  then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley chasing twenty men with bows and arrows and the row was tremenjus they was fair menfairer than you or mewith yellow hair and remarkable well built says dravot unpacking the gunsthis is the beginning of the business well fight for the ten men and with that he fires two rifles at the twenty men and drops one of them at two hundred yards from the rock where we was sitting the other men began to run but carnehan and dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all ranges up and down the valley then we goes up to the ten men that had run across the snow too and they fires a footy little arrow at us dravot he shoots above their heads and they all falls down flat then he walks over them and kicks them and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all round to make them friendly like he calls them and gives them the boxes to carry and waves his hand for all the world as though he was king already they takes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill into a pine wood on the top where there was half a dozen big stone idols dravot he goes to the biggesta fellow they call imbraand lays a rifle and a cartridge at his feet rubbing his nose respectful with his own nose patting him on the head and saluting in front of it he turns round to the men and nods his head and saysthats all right im in the know too and all these old jimjams are my friends then he opens his mouth and points down it and when the first man brings him food he saysno and when the second man brings him food he saysno but when one of the old priests and the boss of the village brings him food he saysyes very haughty and eats it slow that was how we came to our first village without any trouble just as though we had tumbled from the skies but we tumbled from one of those damned ropebridges you see and you couldnt expect a man to laugh much after that  take some more whiskey and go on i said that was the first village you came into how did you get to be king  i wasnt king said carnehan dravot he was the king and a handsome man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all him and the other party stayed in that village and every morning dravot sat by the side of old imbra and the people came and worshipped that was dravots order then a lot of men came into the valley and carnehan and dravot picks them off with the rifles before they knew where they was and runs down into the valley and up again the other side and finds another village same as the first one and the people all falls down flat on their faces and dravot says now what is the trouble between you two villages and the people points to a woman as fair as you or me that was carried off and dravot takes her back to the first village and counts up the deadeight there was for each dead man dravot pours a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig and thats all right says he then he and carnehan takes the big boss of each village by the arm and walks them down into the valley and shows them how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley and gives each a sod of turf from both sides o the line then all the people comes down and shouts like the devil and all and dravot saysgo and dig the land and be fruitful and multiply which they did though they didnt understand then we asks the names of things in their lingobread and water and fire and idols and such and dravot leads the priest of each village up to the idol and says he must sit there and judge the people and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot  next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as bees and much prettier and the priests heard all the complaints and told dravot in dumb show what it was about thats just the beginning says dravot they think were gods he and carnehan picks out twenty good men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and advance in line and they was very pleased to do so and clever to see the hang of it then he takes out his pipe and his baccypouch and leaves one at one village and one at the other and off we two goes to see what was to be done in the next valley that was all rock and there was a little village there and carnehan sayssend em to the old valley to plant and takes em there and gives em some land that wasnt took before they were a poor lot and we blooded em with a kid before letting em into the new kingdom that was to impress the people and then they settled down quiet and carnehan went back to dravot who had got into another valley all snow and ice and most mountaineous there was no people there and the army got afraid so dravot shoots one of them and goes on till he finds some people in a village and the army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better not shoot their little matchlocks for they had matchlocks we makes friends with the priest and i stays there alone with two of the army teaching the men how to drill and a thundering big chief comes across the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging because he heard there was a new god kicking about carnehan sights for the brown of the men half a mile across the snow and wings one of them then he sends a message to the chief that unless he wished to be killed he must come and shake hands with me and leave his arms behind the chief comes alone first and carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about same as dravot used and very much surprised that chief was and strokes my eyebrows then carnehan goes alone to the chief and asks him in dumb show if he had an enemy he hated i have says the chief so carnehan weeds out the pick of his men and sets the two of the army to show them drill and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre about as well as volunteers so he marches with the chief to a great big plain on the top of a mountain and the chiefs men rushes into a village and takes it we three martinis firing into the brown of the enemy so we took that village too and i gives the chief a rag from my coat and says occupy till i come which was scriptural by way of a reminder when me and the army was eighteen hundred yards away i drops a bullet near him standing on the snow and all the people falls flat on their faces then i sends a letter to dravot wherever he be by land or by sea  at the risk of throwing the creature out of train i interruptedhow could you write a letter up yonder  the letterohthe letter keep looking at me between the eyes please it was a stringtalk letter that wed learned the way of it from a blind beggar in the punjab  i remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with a knotted twig and a piece of string which he wound round the twig according to some cypher of his own he could after the lapse of days or hours repeat the sentence which he had reeled up he had reduced the alphabet to eleven primitive sounds and tried to teach me his method but failed  i sent that letter to dravot said carnehan and told him to come back because this kingdom was growing too big for me to handle and then i struck for the first valley to see how the priests were working they called the village we took along with the chief bashkai and the first village we took erheb the priests at erheb was doing all right but they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me and some men from another village had been firing arrows at night i went out and looked for that village and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards that used all the cartridges i cared to spend and i waited for dravot who had been away two or three months and i kept my people quiet  one morning i heard the devils own noise of drums and horns and dan dravot marches down the hill with his army and a tail of hundreds of men and which was the most amazinga great gold crown on his head my gord carnehan says daniel this is a tremenjus business and weve got the whole country as far as its worth having i am the son of alexander by queen semiramis and youre my younger brother and a god too its the biggest thing weve ever seen ive been marching and fighting for six weeks with the army and every footy little village for fifty miles has come in rejoiceful and more than that ive got the key of the whole show as youll see and ive got a crown for you i told em to make two of em at a place called shu where the gold lies in the rock like suet in mutton gold ive seen and turquoise ive kicked out of the cliffs and theres garnets in the sands of the river and heres a chunk of amber that a man brought me call up all the priests and here take your crown  one of the men opens a black hair bag and i slips the crown on it was too small and too heavy but i wore it for the glory hammered gold it wasfive pound weight like a hoop of a barrel  peachey says dravot we dont want to fight no more the crafts the trick so help me and he brings forward that same chief that i left at bashkaibilly fish we called him afterward because he was so like billy fish that drove the big tankengine at mach on the bolan in the old days shake hands with him says dravot and i shook hands and nearly dropped for billy fish gave me the grip i said nothing but tried him with the fellow craft grip he answers all right and i tried the masters grip but that was a slip a fellow craft he is i says to dan does he know the word he does says dan and all the priests know its a miracle the chiefs and the priests can work a fellow craft lodge in a way thats very like ours and theyve cut the marks on the rocks but they dont know the third degree and theyve come to find out its gords truth ive known these long years that the afghans knew up to the fellow craft degree but this is a miracle a god and a grandmaster of the craft am i and a lodge in the third degree i will open and well raise the head priests and the chiefs of the villages  its against all the law i says holding a lodge without warrant from any one and we never held office in any lodge  its a masterstroke of policy says dravot it means running the country as easy as a fourwheeled bogy on a down grade we cant stop to inquire now or theyll turn against us ive forty chiefs at my heel and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be billet these men on the villages and see that we run up a lodge of some kind the temple of imbra will do for the lodgeroom the women must make aprons as you show them ill hold a levee of chiefs tonight and lodge tomorrow  i was fair run off my legs but i wasnt such a fool as not to see what a pull this craft business gave us i showed the priests families how to make aprons of the degrees but for dravots apron the blue border and marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide not cloth we took a great square stone in the temple for the masters chair and little stones for the officers chairs and painted the black pavement with white squares and did what we could to make things regular  at the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big bonfires dravot gives out that him and me were gods and sons of alexander and past grandmasters in the craft and was come to make kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in quiet and specially obey us then the chiefs come round to shake hands and they was so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends we gave them names according as they was like men we had known in indiabilly fish holly dilworth pikky kergan that was bazarmaster when i was at mhow and so on and so on  the most amazing miracle was at lodge next night one of the old priests was watching us continuous and i felt uneasy for i knew wed have to fudge the ritual and i didnt know what the men knew the old priest was a stranger come in from beyond the village of bashkai the minute dravot puts on the masters apron that the girls had made for him the priest fetches a whoop and a howl and tries to overturn the stone that dravot was sitting on its all up now i says that comes of meddling with the craft without warrant dravot never winked an eye not when ten priests took and tilted over the grandmasters chairwhich was to say the stone of imbra the priest begins rubbing the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt and presently he shows all the other priests the masters mark same as was on dravots apron cut into the stone not even the priests of the temple of imbra knew it was there the old chap falls flat on his face at dravots feet and kisses em luck again says dravot across the lodge to me they say its the missing mark that no one could understand the why of were more than safe now then he bangs the butt of his gun for a gavel and saysby virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right hand and the help of peachey i declare myself grandmaster of all freemasonry in kafiristan in this the mother lodge o the country and king of kafiristan equally with peachey at that he puts on his crown and i puts on minei was doing senior wardenand we opens the lodge in most ample form it was a amazing miracle the priests moved in lodge through the first two degrees almost without telling as if the memory was coming back to them after that peachey and dravot raised such as was worthyhigh priests and chiefs of faroff villages billy fish was the first and i can tell you we scared the soul out of him it was not in any way according to ritual but it served our turn we didnt raise more than ten of the biggest men because we didnt want to make the degree common and they was clamoring to be raised  in another six months says dravot well hold another communication and see how you are working then he asks them about their villages and learns that they was fighting one against the other and were fair sick and tired of it and when they wasnt doing that they was fighting with the mohammedans you can fight those when they come into our country says dravot tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a frontier guard and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled nobody is going to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well and i know that you wont cheat me because youre white peoplesons of alexanderand not like common black mohammedans you are my people and by god says he running off into english at the endill make a damned fine nation of you or ill die in the making  i cant tell all we did for the next six months because dravot did a lot i couldnt see the hang of and he learned their lingo in a way i never could my work was to help the people plough and now and again go out with some of the army and see what the other villages were doing and make em throw ropebridges across the ravines which cut up the country horrid dravot was very kind to me but when he walked up and down in the pine wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both fists i knew he was thinking plans i could not advise him about and i just waited for orders  but dravot never showed me disrespect before the people they were afraid of me and the army but they loved dan he was the best of friends with the priests and the chiefs but any one could come across the hills with a complaint and dravot would hear him out fair and call four priests together and say what was to be done he used to call in billy fish from bashkai and pikky kergan from shu and an old chief we called kafuzelumit was like enough to his real nameand hold councils with em when there was any fighting to be done in small villages that was his council of war and the four priests of bashkai shu khawak and madora was his privy council between the lot of em they sent me with forty men and twenty rifles and sixty men carrying turquoises into the ghorband country to buy those handmade martini rifles that come out of the amirs workshops at kabul from one of the amirs herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out of their mouths for turquoises  i stayed in ghorband a month and gave the governor there the pick of my baskets for hushmoney and bribed the colonel of the regiment some more and between the two and the tribespeople we got more than a hundred handmade martinis a hundred good kohat jezails thatll throw to six hundred yards and forty manloads of very bad ammunition for the rifles i came back with what i had and distributed em among the men that the chiefs sent to me to drill dravot was too busy to attend to those things but the old army that we first made helped me and we turned out five hundred men that could drill and two hundred that knew how to hold arms pretty straight even those corkscrewed handmade guns was a miracle to them dravot talked big about powdershops and factories walking up and down in the pine wood when the winter was coming on  i wont make a nation says he ill make an empire these men arent niggers theyre english look at their eyeslook at their mouths look at the way they stand up they sit on chairs in their own houses theyre the lost tribes or something like it and theyve grown to be english ill take a census in the spring if the priests dont get frightened there must be a fair two million of em in these hills the villages are full o little children two million peopletwo hundred

and everywhere else  what is it i says there are no more men coming in to be drilled this autumn look at those fat black clouds theyre bringing the snow  it isnt that says daniel putting his hand very hard on my shoulder and i dont wish to say anything thats against you for no other living man would have followed me and made me what i am as you have done youre a firstclass commanderinchief and the people know you butits a big country and somehow you cant help me peachey in the way i want to be helped  go to your blasted priests then i said and i was sorry when i made that remark but it did hurt me sore to find daniel talking so superior when id drilled all the men and done all he told me  dont lets quarrel peachey says daniel without cursing youre a king too and the half of this kingdom is yours but cant you see peachey we want cleverer men than us nowthree or four of em that we can scatter about for our deputies its a hugeous great state and i cant always tell the right thing to do and i havent time for all i want to do and heres the winter coming on and all he put half his beard into his mouth and it was as red as the gold of his crown  im sorry daniel says i ive done all i could ive drilled the men and shown the people how to stack their oats better and ive brought in those tinware rifles from ghorbandbut i know what youre driving at i take it kings always feel oppressed that way  theres another thing too says dravot walking up and down the winters coming and these people wont be giving much trouble and if they do we cant move about i want a wife  for gords sake leave the women alone i says weve both got all the work we can though i am a fool remember the contrack and keep clear o women  the contrack only lasted till such time as we was kings and kings we have been these months past says dravot weighing his crown in his hand you go get a wife too peacheya nice strappin plump girl thatll keep you warm in the winter theyre prettier than english girls and we can take the pick of em boil em once or twice in hot water and theyll come as fair as chicken and ham  dont tempt me i says i will not have any dealings with a woman not till we are a dam side more settled than we are now ive been doing the work o two men and youve been doing the work o three lets lie off a bit and see if we can get some better tobacco from afghan country and run in some good liquor but no women  whos talking o women says dravot i said wifea queen to breed a kings son for the king a queen out of the strongest tribe thatll make them your bloodbrothers and thatll lie by your side and tell you all the people thinks about you and their own affairs thats what i want  do you remember that bengali woman i kept at mogul serai when i was a platelayer says i a fat lot o good she was to me she taught me the lingo and one or two other things but what happened she ran away with the station masters servant and half my months pay then she turned up at dadur junction in tow of a halfcaste and had the impidence to say i was her husbandall among the drivers in the runningshed  weve done with that says dravot these women are whiter than you or me and a queen i will have for the winter months  for the last time o asking dan do not i says itll only bring us harm the bible says that kings aint to waste their strength on women specially when theyve got a new raw kingdom to work over  for the last time of answering i will said dravot and he went away through the pinetrees looking like a big red devil the low sun hit his crown and beard on one side and the two blazed like hot coals  but getting a wife was not as easy as dan thought he put it before the council and there was no answer till billy fish said that hed better ask the girls dravot damned them all round whats wrong with me he shouts standing by the idol imbra am i a dog or am i not enough of a man for your wenches havent i put the shadow of my hand over this country who stopped the last afghan raid it was me really but dravot was too angry to remember who brought your guns who repaired the bridges whos the grandmaster of the sign cut in the stone and he thumped his hand on the block that he used to sit on in lodge and at council which opened like lodge always billy fish said nothing and no more did the others keep your hair on dan said i and ask the girls thats how its done at home and these people are quite english  the marriage of the king is a matter of state says dan in a whitehot rage for he could feel i hope that he was going against his better mind he walked out of the councilroom and the others sat still looking at the ground  billy fish says i to the chief of bashkai whats the difficulty here a straight answer to a true friend you know says billy fish how should a man tell you who know everything how can daughters of men marry gods or devils its not proper  i remembered something like that in the bible but if after seeing us as long as they had they still believed we were gods it wasnt for me to undeceive them  a god can do anything says i if the king is fond of a girl hell not let her die shell have to said billy fish there are all sorts of gods and devils in these mountains and now and again a girl marries one of them and isnt seen any more besides you two know the mark cut in the stone only the gods know that we thought you were men till you showed the sign of the master  i wished then that we had explained about the loss of the genuine secrets of a mastermason at the first gooff but i said nothing all that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple halfway down the hill and i heard a girl crying fit to die one of the priests told us that she was being prepared to marry the king  ill have no nonsense of that kind says dan i dont want to interfere with your customs but ill take my own wife the girls a little bit afraid says the priest she thinks shes going to die and they are aheartening of her up down in the temple  hearten her very tender then says dravot or ill hearten you with the butt of a gun so that youll never want to be heartened again he licked his lips did dan and stayed up walking about more than half the night thinking of the wife that he was going to get in the morning i wasnt any means comfortable for i knew that dealings with a woman in foreign parts though you was a crowned king twenty times over could not but be risky i got up very early in the morning while dravot was asleep and i saw the priests talking together in whispers and the chiefs talking together too and they looked at me out of the corners of their eyes  what is up fish i says to the bashkai man who was wrapped up in his furs and looking splendid to behold  i cant rightly say says he but if you can induce the king to drop all this nonsense about marriage youll be doing him and me and yourself a great service  that i do believe says i but sure you know billy as well as me having fought against and for us that the king and me are nothing more than two of the finest men that god almighty ever made nothing more i do assure you  that may be says billy fish and yet i should be sorry if it was he sinks his head upon his great fur cloak for a minute and thinks king says he be you man or god or devil ill stick by you today i have twenty of my men with me and they will follow me well go to bashkai until the storm blows over  a little snow had fallen in the night and everything was white except the greasy fat clouds that blew down and down from the north dravot came out with his crown on his head swinging his arms and stamping his feet and looking more pleased than punch  for the last time drop it dan says i in a whisper billy fish here says that there will be a row  a row among my people says dravot not much peachey youre a fool not to get a wife too wheres the girl says he with a voice as loud as the braying of a jackass call up all the chiefs and priests and let the emperor see if his wife suits him  there was no need to call anyone they were all there leaning on their guns and spears round the clearing in the centre of the pine wood a deputation of priests went down to the little temple to bring up the girl and the horns blew up fit to wake the dead billy fish saunters round and gets as close to daniel as he could and behind him stood his twenty men with matchlocks not a man of them under six feet i was next to dravot and behind me was twenty men of the regular army up comes the girl and a strapping wench she was covered with silver and turquoises but white as death and looking back every minute at the priests  shell do said dan looking her over whats to be afraid of lass come and kiss me he puts his arm round her she shuts her eyes gives a bit of a squeak and down goes her face in the side of dans flaming red beard  the sluts bitten me says he clapping his hand to his neck and sure enough his hand was red with blood billy fish and two of his matchlockmen catches hold of dan by the shoulders and drags him into the bashkai lot while the priests howls in their lingoneither god nor devil but a man i was all taken aback for a priest cut at me in front and the army behind began firing into the bashkai men  god amighty says dan what is the meaning o this  come back come away says billy fish ruin and mutiny is the matter well break for bashkai if we can  i tried to give some sort of orders to my menthe men o the regular armybut it was no use so i fired into the brown of em with an english martini and drilled three beggars in a line the valley was full of shouting howling creatures and every soul was shrieking not a god nor a devil but only a man the bashkai troops stuck to billy fish all they were worth but their matchlocks wasnt half as good as the kabul breechloaders and four of them dropped dan was bellowing like a bull for he was very wrathy and billy fish had a hard job to prevent him running out at the crowd  we cant stand says billy fish make a run for it down the valley the whole place is against us the matchlockmen ran and we went down the valley in spite of dravots protestations he was swearing horribly and crying out that he was a king the priests rolled great stones on us and the regular army fired hard and there wasnt more than six men not counting dan billy fish and me that came down to the bottom of the valley alive  then they stopped firing and the horns in the temple blew again come awayfor gords sake come away says billy fish theyll send runners out to all the villages before ever we get to bashkai i can protect you there but i cant do anything now  my own notion is that dan began to go mad in his head from that hour he stared up and down like a stuck pig then he was all for walking back alone and killing the priests with his bare hands which he could have done an emperor am i says daniel and next year i shall be a knight of the queen  all right dan says i but come along now while theres time  its your fault says he for not looking after your army better there was mutiny in the midst and you didnt knowyou damned enginedriving platelaying missionaryspasshunting hound he sat upon a rock and called me every foul name he could lay tongue to i was too heartsick to care though it was all his foolishness that brought the smash  im sorry dan says i but theres no accounting for natives this business is our fiftyseven maybe well make something out of it yet when weve got to bashkai  lets get to bashkai then says dan and by god when i come back here again ill sweep the valley so there isnt a bug in a blanket left  we walked all that day and all that night dan was stumping up and down on the snow chewing his beard and muttering to himself  theres no hope o getting clear said billy fish the priests will have sent runners to the villages to say that you are only men why didnt you stick on as gods till things was more settled im a dead man says billy fish and he throws himself down on the snow and begins to pray to his gods  next morning we was in a cruel bad countryall up and down no level ground at all and no food either the six bashkai men looked at billy fish hungrywise as if they wanted to ask something but they said never a word at noon we came to the top of a flat mountain all covered with snow and when we climbed up into it behold there was an army in position waiting in the middle  the runners have been very quick says billy fish with a little bit of a laugh they are waiting for us  three or four men began to fire from the enemys side and a chance shot took daniel in the calf of the leg that brought him to his senses he looks across the snow at the army and sees the rifles that we had brought into the country  were done for says he they are englishmen these peopleand its my blasted nonsense that has brought you to this get back billy fish and take your men away youve done what you could and now cut for it carnehan says he shake hands with me and go along with billy maybe they wont kill you ill go and meet em alone its me that did it me the king  go says i go to hell dan im with you here billy fish you clear out and we two will meet those folk  im a chief says billy fish quite quiet i stay with you my men can go  the bashkai fellows didnt wait for a second word but ran off and dan and me and billy fish walked across to where the drums were drumming and the horns were horning it was coldawful cold ive got that cold in the back of my head now theres a lump of it there  the punkahcoolies had gone to sleep two kerosene lamps were blazing in the office and the perspiration poured down my face and splashed on the blotter as i leaned forward carnehan was shivering and i feared that his mind might go i wiped my face took a fresh grip of the piteously mangled hands and saidwhat happened after that  the momentary shift of my eyes had broken the clear current  what was you pleased to say whined carnehan they took them without any sound not a little whisper all along the snow not though the king knocked down the first man that set hand on himnot though old peachey fired his last cartridge into the brown of em not a single solitary sound did those swines make they just closed up tight and i tell you their furs stunk there was a man called billy fish a good friend of us all and they cut his throat sir then and there like a pig and the king kicks up the bloody snow and saysweve had a dashed fine run for our money whats coming next but peachey peachey taliaferro i tell you sir in confidence as betwixt two friends he lost his head sir no he didnt neither the king lost his head so he did all along o one of those cunning ropebridges kindly let me have the papercutter sir it tilted this way they marched him a mile across that snow to a ropebridge over a ravine with a river at the bottom you may have seen such they prodded him behind like an ox damn your eyes says the king dyou suppose i cant die like a gentleman he turns to peacheypeachey that was crying like a child ive brought you to this peachey says he brought you out of your happy life to be killed in kafiristan where you was late commanderinchief of the emperors forces say you forgive me peachey i do says peachey fully and freely do i forgive you dan shake hands peachey says he im going now out he goes looking neither right nor left and when he was plumb in the middle of those dizzy dancing ropes cut you beggars he shouts and they cut and old dan fell turning round and round and round twenty thousand miles for he took half an hour to fall till he struck the water and i could see his body caught on a rock with the gold crown close beside  but do you know what they did to peachey between two pine trees they crucified him sir as peacheys hand will show they used wooden pegs for his hands and his feet and he didnt die he hung there and screamed and they took him down next day and said it was a miracle that he wasnt dead they took him downpoor old peachey that hadnt done them any harmthat hadnt done them any  he rocked to and fro and wept bitterly wiping his eyes with the back of his scarred hands and moaning like a child for some ten minutes  they was cruel enough to feed him up in the temple because they said he was more of a god than old daniel that was a man then they turned him out on the snow and told him to go home and peachey came home in about a year begging along the roads quite safe for daniel dravot he walked before and saidcome along peachey its a big thing were doing the mountains they danced at night and the mountains they tried to fall on peacheys head but dan he held up his hand and peachey came along bent double he never let go of dans hand and he never let go of dans head they gave it to him as a present in the temple to remind him not to come again and though the crown was pure gold and peachey was starving never would peachey sell the same you knew dravot sir you knew right worshipful brother dravot look at him now  he fumbled in the mass of rags round his bent waist brought out a black horsehair bag embroidered with silver thread and shook therefrom on to my tablethe dried withered head of daniel dravot the morning sun that had long been paling the lamps struck the red beard and blind sunken eyes struck too a heavy circlet of gold studded with raw turquoises that carnehan placed tenderly on the battered temples  you behold now said carnehan the emperor in his habit as he livedthe king of kafiristan with his crown upon his head poor old daniel that was a monarch once  i shuddered for in spite of defacements manifold i recognized the head of the man of marwar junction carnehan rose to go i attempted to stop him he was not fit to walk abroad let me take away the whiskey and give me a little money he gasped i was a king once ill go to the deputy commissioner and ask to set in the poorhouse till i get my health no thank you i cant wait till you get a carriage for me ive urgent private affairsin the southat marwar  he shambled out of the office and departed in the direction of the deputy commissioners house that day at noon i had occasion to go down the blinding hot mall and i saw a crooked man crawling along the white dust of the roadside his hat in his hand quavering dolorously after the fashion of streetsingers at home there was not a soul in sight and he was out of all possible earshot of the houses and he sang through his nose turning his head from right to left    the son of man goes forth to war      a golden crown to gain    his bloodred banner streams afar      who follows in his train  i waited to hear no more but put the poor wretch into my carriage and drove him off to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the asylum he repeated the hymn twice while he was with me whom he did not in the least recognize and i left him singing it to the missionary  two days later i inquired after his welfare of the superintendent of the asylum  he was admitted suffering from sunstroke he died early yesterday morning said the superintendent is it true that he was half an hour bareheaded in the sun at midday  yes said i but do you happen to know if he had anything upon him by any chance when he died  not to my knowledge said the superintendent  and there the matter rests    the gate of the hundred sorrows  if i can attain heaven for a pice why should you be enviousopium smokers proverb  this is no work of mine my friend gabral misquitta the halfcaste spoke it all between moonset and morning six weeks before he died and i took it down from his mouth as he answered my questions so  it lies between the coppersmiths gully and the pipestem sellers quarter within a hundred yards too as the crow flies of the mosque of wazir khan i dont mind telling any one this much but i defy him to find the gate however well he may think he knows the city you might even go through the very gully it stands in a hundred times and be none the wiser we used to call the gully the gully of the black smoke but its native name is altogether different of course a loaded donkey couldnt pass between the walls and at one point just before you reach the gate a bulged housefront makes people go along all sideways  it isnt really a gate though its a house old fungtching had it first five years ago he was a bootmaker in calcutta they say that he murdered his wife there when he was drunk that was why he dropped bazarrum and took to the black smoke instead later on he came up north and opened the gate as a house where you could get your smoke in peace and quiet mind you it was a pukka respectable opiumhouse and not one of those stifling sweltering chandookhanas that you can find all over the city no the old man knew his business thoroughly and he was most clean for a chinaman he was a oneeyed little chap not much more than five feet high and both his middle fingers were gone all the same he was the handiest man at rolling black pills i have ever seen never seemed to be touched by the smoke either and what he took day and night night and day was a caution ive been at it five years and i can do my fair share of the smoke with any one but i was a child to fungtching that way all the same the old man was keen on his money very keen and thats what i cant understand i heard he saved a good deal before he died but his nephew has got all that now and the old mans gone back to china to be buried  he kept the big upper room where his best customers gathered as neat as a new pin in one corner used to stand fungtchings jossalmost as ugly as fungtchingand there were always sticks burning under his nose but you never smelled em when the pipes were going thick opposite the joss was fungtchings coffin he had spent a good deal of his savings on that and whenever a new man came to the gate he was always introduced to it it was lacquered black with red and gold writings on it and ive heard that fungtching brought it out all the way from china i dont know whether thats true or not but i know that if i came first in the evening i used to spread my mat just at the foot of it it was a quiet corner you see and a sort of breeze from the gully came in at the window now and then besides the mats there was no other furniture in the roomonly the coffin and the old joss all green and blue and purple with age and polish  fungtching never told us why he called the place the gate of the hundred sorrows he was the only chinaman i know who used badsounding fancy names most of them are flowery as youll see in calcutta we used to find that out for ourselves nothing grows on you so much if youre white as the black smoke a yellow man is made different opium doesnt tell on him scarcely at all but white and black suffer a good deal of course there are some people that the smoke doesnt touch any more than tobacco would at first they just doze a bit as one would fall asleep naturally and next morning they are almost fit for work now i was one of that sort when i began but ive been at it for five years pretty steadily and its different now there was an old aunt of mine down agra way and she left me a little at her death about sixty rupees a month secured sixty isnt much i can recollect a time seems hundreds and hundreds of years ago that i was getting my three hundred a month and pickings when i was working on a big timbercontract in calcutta  i didnt stick to that work for long the black smoke does not allow of much other business and even though i am very little affected by it as men go i couldnt do a days work now to save my life after all sixty rupees is what i want when old fungtching was alive he used to draw the money for me give me about half of it to live on i eat very little and the rest he kept himself i was free of the gate at any time of the day and night and could smoke and sleep there when i liked so i didnt care i know the old man made a good thing out of it but thats no matter nothing matters much to me and besides the money always came fresh and fresh each month  there was ten of us met at the gate when the place was first opened me and two baboos from a government office somewhere in anarkulli but they got the sack and couldnt pay no man who has to work in the daylight can do the black smoke for any length of time straight on a chinaman that was fungtchings nephew a bazarwoman that had got a lot of money somehow an english loafermacsomebody i think but i have forgottenthat smoked heaps but never seemed to pay anything they said he had saved fungtchings life at some trial in calcutta when he was a barrister another eurasian like myself from madras a halfcaste woman and a couple of men who said they had come from the north i think they must have been persians or afghans or something there are not more than five of us living now but we come regular i dont know what happened to the baboos but the bazarwoman she died after six months of the gate and i think fungtching took her bangles and nosering for himself but im not certain the englishman he drank as well as smoked and he dropped off one of the persians got killed in a row at night by the big well near the mosque a long time ago and the police shut up the well because they said it was full of foul air they found him dead at the bottom of it so you see there is only me the chinaman the halfcaste woman that we call the memsahib she used to live with fungtching the other eurasian and one of the persians the memsahib looks very old now i think she was a young woman when the gate was opened but we are all old for the matter of that hundreds and hundreds of years old it is very hard to keep count of time in the gate and besides time doesnt matter to me i draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month a very very long while ago when i used to be getting three hundred and fifty rupees a month and pickings on a big timbercontract at calcutta i had a wife of sorts but shes dead now people said that i killed her by taking to the black smoke perhaps i did but its so long since that it doesnt matter sometimes when i first came to the gate i used to feel sorry for it but thats all over and done with long ago and i draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month and am quite happy not drunk happy you know but always quiet and soothed and contented  how did i take to it it began at calcutta i used to try it in my own house just to see what it was like i never went very far but i think my wife must have died then anyhow i found myself here and got to know fungtching i dont remember rightly how that came about but he told me of the gate and i used to go there and somehow i have never got away from it since mind you though the gate was a respectable place in fungtchings time where you could be comfortable and not at all like the chandookhanas where the niggers go no it was clean and quiet and not crowded of course there were others beside us ten and the man but we always had a mat apiece with a wadded woolen headpiece all covered with black and red dragons and things just like the coffin in the corner  at the end of ones third pipe the dragons used to move about and fight ive watched em many and many a night through i used to regulate my smoke that way and now it takes a dozen pipes to make em stir besides they are all torn and dirty like the mats and old fungtching is dead he died a couple of years ago and gave me the pipe i always use nowa silver one with queer beasts crawling up and down the receiverbottle below the cup before that i think i used a big bamboo stem with a copper cup a very small one and a green jade mouthpiece it was a little thicker than a walkingstick stem and smoked sweet very sweet the bamboo seemed to suck up the smoke silver doesnt and ive got to clean it out now and then thats a great deal of trouble but i smoke it for the old mans sake he must have made a good thing out of me but he always gave me clean mats and pillows and the best stuff you could get anywhere  when he died his nephew tsinling took up the gate and he called it the temple of the three possessions but we old ones speak of it as the hundred sorrows all the same the nephew does things very shabbily and i think the memsahib must help him she lives with him same as she used to do with the old man the two let in all sorts of low people niggers and all and the black smoke isnt as good as it used to be ive found burned bran in my pipe over and over again the old man would have died if that had happened in his time besides the room is never cleaned and all the mats are torn and cut at the edges the coffin is gonegone to china againwith the old man and two ounces of smoke inside it in case he should want em on the way  the joss doesnt get so many sticks burned under his nose as he used to thats a sign of illluck as sure as death hes all brown too and no one ever attends to him thats the memsahibs work i know because when tsinling tried to burn gilt paper before him she said it was a waste of money and if he kept a stick burning very slowly the joss wouldnt know the difference so now weve got the sticks mixed with a lot of glue and they take half an hour longer to burn and smell stinky let alone the smell of the room by itself no business can get on if they try that sort of thing the joss doesnt like it i can see that late at night sometimes he turns all sorts of queer colorsblue and green and redjust as he used to do when old fungtching was alive and he rolls his eyes and stamps his feet like a devil  i dont know why i dont leave the place and smoke quietly in a little room of my own in the bazar most like tsinling would kill me if i went awayhe draws my sixty rupees nowand besides its so much trouble and ive grown to be very fond of the gate its not much to look at not what it was in the old mans time but i couldnt leave it ive seen so many come in and out and ive seen so many die here on the mats that i should be afraid of dying in the open now ive seen some things that people would call strange enough but nothing is strange when youre on the black smoke except the black smoke and if it was it wouldnt matter fungtching used to be very particular about his people and never got in any one whod give trouble by dying messy and such but the nephew isnt half so careful he tells everywhere that he keeps a firstchop house never tries to get men in quietly and make them comfortable like fungtching did thats why the gate is getting a little bit more known than it used to be among the niggers of course the nephew darent get a white or for matter of that a mixed skin into the place he has to keep us three of courseme and the memsahib and the other eurasian were fixtures but he wouldnt give us credit for a pipefulnot for anything  one of these days i hope i shall die in the gate the persian and the madras man are terribly shaky now theyve got a boy to light their pipes for them i always do that myself most like i shall see them carried out before me i dont think i shall ever outlive the memsahib or tsinling women last longer than men at the black smoke and tsinling has a deal of the old mans blood in him though he does smoke cheap stuff the bazarwoman knew when she was going two days before her time and she died on a clean mat with a nicely wadded pillow and the old man hung up her pipe just above the joss he was always fond of her i fancy but he took her bangles just the same  i should like to die like the bazarwomanon a clean cool mat with a pipe of good stuff between my lips when i feel im going i shall ask tsinling for them and he can draw my sixty rupees a month fresh and fresh as long as he pleases then i shall lie back quiet and comfortable and watch the black and red dragons have their last big fight together and then well it doesnt matter nothing matters much to meonly i wish tsinling wouldnt put bran into the black smoke    the incarnation of krishna mulvaney     wohl auf my bully cavaliers      we ride to church today    the man that hasnt got a horse      must steal one straight away                                          be reverent men remember      this is a gottes haus    du conrad cut along der aisle      and schenck der whiskey aus  hans breitmanns ride to church  once upon a time very far from england there lived three men who loved each other so greatly that neither man nor woman could come between them they were in no sense refined nor to be admitted to the outerdoor mats of decent folk because they happened to be private soldiers in her majestys army and private soldiers of our service have small time for selfculture their duty is to keep themselves and their accoutrements specklessly clean to refrain from getting drunk more often than is necessary to obey their superiors and to pray for a war all these things my friends accomplished and of their own motion threw in some fightingwork for which the army regulations did not call their fate sent them to serve in india which is not a golden country though poets have sung otherwise there men die with great swiftness and those who live suffer many and curious things i do not think that my friends concerned themselves much with the social or political aspects of the east they attended a not unimportant war on the northern frontier another one on our western boundary and a third in upper burma then their regiment sat still to recruit and the boundless monotony of cantonment life was their portion they were drilled morning and evening on the same dusty paradeground they wandered up and down the same stretch of dusty white road attended the same church and the same grogshop and slept in the same limewashed barn of a barrack for two long years there was mulvaney the father in the craft who had served with various regiments from bermuda to halifax old in war scarred reckless resourceful and in his pious hours an unequalled soldier to him turned for help and comfort six and a half feet of slowmoving heavyfooted yorkshireman born on the wolds bred in the dales and educated chiefly among the carriers carts at the back of york railwaystation his name was learoyd and his chief virtue an unmitigated patience which helped him to win fights how ortheris a foxterrier of a cockney ever came to be one of the trio is a mystery which even today i cannot explain there was always three av us mulvaney used to say an by the grace av god so long as our service lasts three av us theyll always be tis betther so  they desired no companionship beyond their own and it was evil for any man of the regiment who attempted dispute with them physical argument was out of the question as regarded mulvaney and the yorkshireman and assault on ortheris meant a combined attack from these twaina business which no five men were anxious to have on their hands therefore they flourished sharing their drinks their tobacco and their money good luck and evil battle and the chances of death life and the chances of happiness from calicut in southern to peshawur in northern india  through no merit of my own it was my good fortune to be in a measure admitted to their friendshipfrankly by mulvaney from the beginning sullenly and with reluctance by learoyd and suspiciously by ortheris who held to it that no man not in the army could fraternize with a redcoat like to like said he im a bloomin sodgerhes a bloomin civilian taint naturalthats all  but that was not all they thawed progressively and in the thawing told me more of their lives and adventures than i am ever likely to write  omitting all else this tale begins with the lamentable thirst that was at the beginning of first causes never was such a thirstmulvaney told me so they kicked against their compulsory virtue but the attempt was only successful in the case of ortheris he whose talents were many went forth into the highways and stole a dog from a civilianvidelicet some one he knew not who not in the army now that civilian was but newly connected by marriage with the colonel of the regiment and outcry was made from quarters least anticipated by ortheris and in the end he was forced lest a worse thing should happen to dispose at ridiculously unremunerative rates of as promising a small terrier as ever graced one end of a leading string the purchasemoney was barely sufficient for one small outbreak which led him to the guardroom he escaped however with nothing worse than a severe reprimand and a few hours of punishment drill not for nothing had he acquired the reputation of being the best soldier of his inches in the regiment mulvaney had taught personal cleanliness and efficiency as the first articles of his companions creed a dhirty man he was used to say in the speech of his kind goes to clink for a weakness in the knees an is coortmartialled for a pair av socks missin but a clane man such as is an ornament to his servicea man whose buttons are gold whose coat is wax upon him an whose coutrements are widout a speckthat man may spakin in reason do fwhat he likes an dhrink from day to divil thats the pride av bein dacint  we sat together upon a day in the shade of a ravine far from the barracks where a watercourse used to run in rainy weather behind us was the scrub jungle in which jackals peacocks the grey wolves of the northwestern provinces and occasionally a tiger estrayed from central india were supposed to dwell in front lay the cantonment glaring white under a glaring sun and on either side ran the broad road that led to delhi  it was the scrub that suggested to my mind the wisdom of mulvaney taking a days leave and going upon a shootingtour the peacock is a holy bird throughout india and he who slays one is in danger of being mobbed by the nearest villagers but on the last occasion that mulvaney had gone forth he had contrived without in the least offending local religious susceptibilities to return with six beautiful peacock skins which he sold to profit it seemed just possible then  but fwhat manner av use is ut to me goin out widout a dhrink the grounds powdherdhry underfoot an ut gets unto the throat fit to kill wailed mulvaney looking at me reproachfully an a peacock is not a bird you can catch the tail av onless ye run can a man run on watheran junglewather too  ortheris had considered the question in all its bearings he spoke chewing his pipestem meditatively the while     go forth return in glory    to clusiums royal ome    an round these bloomin temples ang    the bloomin shields o rome  you better go you aint like to shoot yourselfnot while theres a chanst of liquor me an learoyd ll stay at ome an keep shopcase o anythin turnin up but you go out with a gaspipe gun an ketch the little peacockses or somethin you kin get one days leave easy as winkin go along an get it an get peacockses or somethin  jock said mulvaney turning to learoyd who was half asleep under the shadow of the bank he roused slowly  sitha mulvaaney go said he  and mulvaney went cursing his allies with irish fluency and barrackroom point  take note said he when he had won his holiday and appeared dressed in his roughest clothes with the only other regimental fowling piece in his hand take note jock an you orthris i am goin in the face av my own willall for to please you i misdoubt anythin will come av permiscuous huntin afther peacockses in a desolit lan an i know that i will lie down an die wid thirrrst me catch peacockses for you ye lazy scuttsan be sacrificed by the peasanthryugh  he waved a huge paw and went away  at twilight long before the appointed hour he returned emptyhanded much begrimed with dirt  peacockses queried ortheris from the safe rest of a barrackroom table whereon he was smoking crosslegged learoyd fast asleep on a bench  jock said mulvaney without answering as he stirred up the sleeper jock can ye fight will ye fight  very slowly the meaning of the words communicated itself to the halfroused man he understoodand againwhat might these things mean mulvaney was shaking him savagely meantime the men in the room howled with delight there was war in the confederacy at lastwar and the breaking of bonds  barrackroom etiquette is stringent on the direct challenge must follow the direct reply this is more binding than the ties of tried friendship once again mulvaney repeated the question learoyd answered by the only means in his power and so swiftly that the irishman had barely time to avoid the blow the laughter around increased learoyd looked bewilderedly at his friendhimself as greatly bewildered ortheris dropped from the table because his world was falling  come outside said mulvaney and as the occupants of the barrackroom prepared joyously to follow he turned and said furiously there will be no fight this nightonless any wan av you is wishful to assist the man that does follows on  no man moved the three passed out into the moonlight learoyd fumbling with the buttons of his coat the paradeground was deserted except for the scurrying jackals mulvaneys impetuous rush carried his companions far into the open ere learoyd attempted to turn round and continue the discussion  be still now twas my fault for beginnin things in the middle av an end jock i should ha comminst wid an explanation but jock dear on your sowl are ye fit think you for the finest fight that iver wasbetther than fightin me considher before ye answer  more than ever puzzled learoyd turned round two or three times felt an arm kicked tentatively and answered ahm fit he was accustomed to fight blindly at the bidding of the superior mind  they sat them down the men looking on from afar and mulvaney untangled himself in mighty words  followin your fools scheme i wint out into the thrackless desert beyond the barricks an there i met a pious hindu dhriving a bullockkyart i tuk ut for granted he wud be delighted for to convoy me a piece an i jumped in  you long lazy blackhaired swine drawled ortheris who would have done the same thing under similar circumstances  twas the height av policy that naygurman dhruv miles an

ut may be six  there was a long pause and the jackals howled merrily learoyd bared one arm and contemplated it in the moonlight then he nodded partly to himself and partly to his friends ortheris wriggled with suppressed emotion  i thought ye wud see the reasonableness av ut said mulvaney i make bould to say as much to the man before he was for a direct front attackfut horse an gunsan all for

widin reach that we can get so cheap an fwhats a fight afther all he has robbed the naygurman dishonust we rob him honust for the sake av the whisky he gave me  but wotll we do with the bloomin article when weve got it them palanquins are as big as ouses an uncommon ard to sell as mccleary said when ye stole the sentrybox from the curragh  whos goin to do t fightin said learoyd and ortheris subsided the three returned to barracks without a word mulvaneys last argument clinched the matter this palanquin was property vendible and to be attained in the simplest and least embarrassing fashion it would eventually become beer great was mulvaney  next afternoon a procession of three formed itself and disappeared into the scrub in the direction of the new railway line learoyd alone was without care for mulvaney dived darkly into the future and little ortheris feared the unknown what befell at that interview in the lonely payshed by the side of the halfbuilt embankment only a few hundred coolies know and their tale is a confusing one running thus  we were at work three men in red coats came they saw the sahibdearsley sahib they made oration and noticeably the small man among the redcoats dearsley sahib also made oration and used many very strong words upon this talk they departed together to an open space and there the fat man in the red coat fought with dearsley sahib after the custom of white menwith his hands making no noise and never at all pulling dearsley sahibs hair such of us as were not afraid beheld these things for just so long a time as a man needs to cook the midday meal the small man in the red coat had possessed himself of dearsley sahibs watch no he did not steal that watch he held it in his hand and at certain seasons made outcry and the twain ceased their combat which was like the combat of young bulls in spring both men were soon all red but dearsley sahib was much more red than the other seeing this and fearing for his lifebecause we greatly loved himsome fifty of us made shift to rush upon the redcoats but a certain manvery black as to the hair and in no way to be confused with the small man or the fat man who foughtthat man we affirm ran upon us and of us he embraced some ten or fifty in both arms and beat our heads together so that our livers turned to water and we ran away it is not good to interfere in the fightings of white men after that dearsley sahib fell and did not rise these men jumped upon his stomach and despoiled him of all his money and attempted to fire the payshed and departed is it true that dearsley sahib makes no complaint of these latter things having been done we were senseless with fear and do not at all remember there was no palanquin near the payshed what do we know about palanquins is it true that dearsley sahib does not return to this place on account of his sickness for ten days this is the fault of those bad men in the red coats who should be severely punished for dearsley sahib is both our father and mother and we love him much yet if dearsley sahib does not return to this place at all we will speak the truth there was a palanquin for the upkeep of which we were forced to pay ninetenths of our monthly wage on such mulctings dearsley sahib allowed us to make obeisance to him before the palanquin what could we do we were poor men he took a full half of our wages will the government repay us those moneys those three men in red coats bore the palanquin upon their shoulders and departed all the money that dearsley sahib had taken from us was in the cushions of that palanquin therefore they stole it thousands of rupees were thereall our money it was our bankbox to fill which we cheerfully contributed to dearsley sahib threesevenths of our monthly wage why does the white man look upon us with the eye of disfavor before god there was a palanquin and now there is no palanquin and if they send the police here to make inquisition we can only say that there never has been any palanquin why should a palanquin be near these works we are poor men and we know nothing  such is the simplest version of the simplest story connected with the descent upon dearsley from the lips of the coolies i received it dearsley himself was in no condition to say anything and mulvaney preserved a massive silence broken only by the occasional licking of the lips he had seen a fight so gorgeous that even his power of speech was taken from him i respected that reserve until three days after the affair i discovered in a disused stable in my quarters a palanquin of unchastened splendorevidently in past days the litter of a queen the pole whereby it swung between the shoulders of the bearers was rich with the painted papiermaché of cashmere the shoulderpads were of yellow silk the panels of the litter itself were ablaze with the loves of all the gods and goddesses of the hindu pantheonlacquer on cedar the cedar sliding doors were fitted with hasps of translucent jaipur enamel and ran in grooves shod with silver the cushions were of brocaded delhi silk and the curtains which once hid any glimpse of the beauty of the kings palace were stiff with gold closer investigation showed that the entire fabric was everywhere rubbed and discolored by time and wear but even thus it was sufficiently gorgeous to deserve housing on the threshold of a royal zenana i found no fault with it except that it was in my stable then trying to lift it by the silvershod shoulderpole i laughed the road from dearsleys payshed to the cantonment was a narrow and uneven one and traversed by three very inexperienced palanquinbearers one of whom was sorely battered about the head must have been a path of torment still i did not quite recognize the right of the three musketeers to turn me into a fence for stolen property  im askin you to warehouse ut said mulvaney when he was brought to consider the question theres no steal in ut dearsley tould us we cud have ut if we fought jock foughtan oh sorr when the throuble was at uts finest an jock was bleedin like a stuck pig an little orthris was shquealin on one leg chewin big bites out av dearsleys watch i wud ha given my place at the fight to have had you see wan round he tuk jock as i suspicioned he would an jock was deceptive nine rouns they were even matched an at the tenthabout that palanquin now theres not the least throuble in the world or we wud not ha brought ut here you will ondherstand that the queengod bless herdoes not reckon for a privit soldier to kape elephints an palanquins an sich in barricks afther we had dhragged ut down from dearsleys through that cruel scrub that near broke orthriss heart we set ut in the ravine for a night an a thief av a porcupine an a civetcat av a jackal roosted in ut as well we knew in the mornin i put ut to you sorr is an elegint palanquin fit for the princess the natural abidin place av all the vermin in cantonmints we brought ut to you afther dhark and put ut in your shtable do not let your conscience prick think av the rejoicin men in the payshed yonderlookin at dearsley wid his head tied up in a towelan well knowin that they can dhraw their pay ivry month widout stoppages for riffles indirectly sorr you have rescued from an onprincipled son av a nighthawk the peasanthry av a numerous village an besides will i let that sedanchair rot on our hands not i tis not every day a piece av pure joolry comes into the market theres not a king widin these forty mileshe waved his hand round the dusty horizonnot a king wud not be glad to buy ut some day meself whin i have leisure ill take ut up along the road an dishpose av ut  how said i for i knew the man was capable of anything  get into ut av coorse and keep wan eye open through the curtains whin i see a likely man av the native persuasion i will descind blushin from my canopy and say buy a palanquin ye black scutt i will have to hire four men to carry me first though and thats impossible till next payday  curiously enough learoyd who had fought for the prize and in the winning secured the highest pleasure life had to offer him was altogether disposed to undervalue it while ortheris openly said it would be better to break the thing up dearsley he argued might be a manysided man capable despite his magnificent fighting qualities of setting in motion the machinery of the civil lawa thing much abhorred by the soldier under any circumstances their fun had come and passed the next payday was close at hand when there would be beer for all wherefore longer conserve the painted palanquin  a firstclass rifleshot an a good little man av your inches you are said mulvaney but you niver had a head worth a softboiled egg tis me has to lie awake av nights schamin an plottin for the three av us orthris me son tis no matther av a few gallons av beerno nor twenty gallonsbut tubs an vats an firkins in that sedanchair who ut was an what ut was an how ut got there we do not know but i know in my bones that you an me an jock wid his sprained thumb will get a fortune thereby lave me alone an let me think  meantime the palanquin stayed in my stall the key of which was in mulvaneys hands  payday came and with it beer it was not in experience to hope that mulvaney dried by four weeks drought would avoid excess next morning he and the palanquin had disappeared he had taken the precaution of getting three days leave to see a friend on the railway and the colonel well knowing that the seasonal outburst was near and hoping it would spend its force beyond the limits of his jurisdiction cheerfully gave him all he demanded at this point mulvaneys history as recorded in the messroom stopped  ortheris carried it not much further no e wasnt drunk said the little man loyally the liquor was no more than feelin its way round inside of im but e went an filled that ole bloomin palanquin with bottles fore e went off es gone an ired six men to carry im an i ad to elp im into is nupshal couch cause e wouldnt ear reason es gone off in is shirt an trousies swearin tremenjusgone down the road in the palanquin wavin is legs out o windy  yes said i but where  now you arx me a question e said e was goin to sell that palanquin but from observations what happened when i was stuffin im through the door i fancy es gone to the new embankment to mock at dearsley soon as jocks off duty im goin there to see if es safenot mulvaney but tother man my saints but i pity im as elps terence out o the palanquin when es once fair drunk  hell come back without harm i said  corse e will ony question is what ll e be doin on the road killing dearsley like as not e shouldnt a gone without jock or me  reinforced by learoyd ortheris sought the foreman of the cooliegang dearsleys head was still embellished with towels mulvaney drunk or sober would have struck no man in that condition and dearsley indignantly denied that he would have taken advantage of the intoxicated brave  i had my pick o you two he explained to learoyd and you got my palanquinnot before id made my profit on it whyd i do harm when everythings settled your man did come heredrunk as davys sow on a frosty nightcame apurpose to mock mestuck his head out of the door an called me a crucified hodman i made him drunker an sent him along but i never touched him  to these things learoyd slow to perceive the evidences of sincerity answered only if owt comes to mulvaaney long o you ill gripple you clouts or no clouts on your ugly head an ill draw t throat twistyways man see there now  the embassy removed itself and dearsley the battered laughed alone over his supper that evening  three days passeda fourth and a fifth the week drew to a close and mulvaney did not return he his royal palanquin and his six attendants had vanished into air a very large and very tipsy soldier his feet sticking out of the litter of a reigning princess is not a thing to travel along the ways without comment yet no man of all the country round had seen any such wonder he was and he was not and learoyd suggested the immediate smashment of dearsley as a sacrifice to his ghost ortheris insisted that all was well and in the light of past experience his hopes seemed reasonable  when mulvaney goes up the road said he es like to go a very long ways up specially when es so blue drunk as e is now but what gits me is is not bein eard of pullin wool off the niggers somewheres about that dont look good the drink must ha died out in im by this unless es broke a bank an thenwhy dont e come back e didnt ought to ha gone off without us  even ortheriss heart sank at the end of the seventh day for half the regiment were out scouring the countryside and learoyd had been forced to fight two men who hinted openly that mulvaney had deserted to do him justice the colonel laughed at the notion even when it was put forward by his muchtrusted adjutant  mulvaney would as soon think of deserting as you would said he no hes either fallen into a mischief among the villagersand yet that isnt likely for hed blarney himself out of the pit or else he is engaged on urgent private affairssome stupendous devilment that we shall hear of at mess after it has been the round of the barrackrooms the worst of it is that i shall have to give him twentyeight days confinement at least for being absent without leave just when i most want him to lick the new batch of recruits into shape i never knew a man who could put a polish on young soldiers as quickly as mulvaney can how does he do it  with blarney and the buckleend of a belt sir said the adjutant he is worth a couple of noncommissioned officers when we are dealing with an irish draft and the london lads seem to adore him the worst of it is that if he goes to the cells the other two are neither to hold nor to bind till he comes out again i believe ortheris preaches mutiny on those occasions and i know that the mere presence of learoyd mourning for mulvaney kills all the cheerfulness of his room the sergeants tell me that he allows no man to laugh when he feels unhappy they are a queer gang  for all that i wish we had a few more of them i like a wellconducted regiment but these pastyfaced shiftyeyed mealymouthed young slouchers from the depôt worry me sometimes with their offensive virtue they dont seem to have backbone enough to do anything but play cards and prowl round the married quarters i believe id forgive that old villain on the spot if he turned up with any sort of explanation that i could in decency accept  not likely to be much difficulty about that sir said the adjutant mulvaneys explanations are only one degree less wonderful than his performances they say that when he was in the black tyrone before he came to us he was discovered on the banks of the liffey trying to sell his colonels charger to a donegal dealer as a perfect ladys hack shackbolt commanded the tyrone then  shackbolt must have had apoplexy at the thought of his ramping warhorses answering to that description he used to buy unbacked devils and tame them on some pet theory of starvation what did mulvaney say  that he was a member of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals anxious to sell the poor baste where he would get something to fill out his dimples shackbolt laughed but i fancy that was why mulvaney exchanged to ours  i wish he were back said the colonel for i like him and believe he likes me  that evening to cheer our souls learoyd ortheris and i went into the waste to smoke out a porcupine all the dogs attended but even their clamorand they began to discuss the shortcomings of porcupines before they left cantonmentscould not take us out of ourselves a large low moon turned the tops of the plumegrass to silver and the stunted camelthorn bushes and sour tamarisks into the likenesses of trooping devils the smell of the sun had not left the earth and little aimless winds blowing across the rosegardens to the southward brought the scent of dried roses and water our fire once started and the dogs craftily disposed to wait the dash of the porcupine we climbed to the top of a rainscarred hillock of earths and looked across the scrub seamed with cattle paths white with the long grass and dotted with spots of level pondbottom where the snipe would gather in winter  this said ortheris with a sigh as he took in the unkempt desolation of it all this is sanguinary this is unusually sanguinary sort o mad country like a grate when the fires put out by the sun he shaded his eyes against the moonlight an theres a loony dancin in the middle of it all quite right id dance too if i wasnt so downheart  there pranced a portent in the face of the moona huge and ragged spirit of the waste that flapped its wings from afar it had risen out of the earth it was coming toward us and its outline was never twice the same the toga tablecloth or dressinggown whatever the creature wore took a hundred shapes once it stopped on a neighboring mound and flung all its legs and arms to the winds  my but that scarecrow as got em bad said ortheris seems like if e comes any furder well ave to argify with im  learoyd raised himself from the dirt as a bull clears his flanks of the wallow and as a bull bellows so he after a short minute at gaze gave tongue to the stars  mulvaaney mulvaaney ahoo  oh then it was that we yelled and the figure dipped into the hollow till with a crash of rending grass the lost one strode up to the light of the fire and disappeared to the waist in a wave of joyous dogs then learoyd and ortheris gave greeting bass and falsetto together both swallowing a lump in the throat  you damned fool said they and severally pounded him with their fists  go easy he answered wrapping a huge arm around each i would have you to know that i am a god to be treated as suchtho by my faith i fancy ive got to go to the guardroom just like a privit soldier  the latter part of the sentence destroyed the suspicions raised by the former any one would have been justified in regarding mulvaney as mad he was hatless and shoeless and his shirt and trousers were dropping off him but he wore one wondrous garmenta gigantic cloak that fell from collarbone to heelof pale pink silk wrought all over in cunningest needlework of hands long since dead with the loves of the hindu gods the monstrous figures leaped in and out of the light of the fire as he settled the folds round him  ortheris handled the stuff respectfully for a moment while i was trying to remember where i had seen it before then he screamed what ave you done with the palanquin youre wearin the linin  i am said the irishman an by the same token the broidery is scrapin my hide off ive lived in this sumpshus counterpane for four days me son i begin to ondherstand why the naygur is no use widout me boots an me trousies like an openwork stocking on a gyurls leg at a dance i begin to feel like a naygurmanall fearful an timoreous give me a pipe an ill tell on  he lit a pipe resumed his grip of his two friends and rocked to and fro in a gale of laughter  mulvaney said ortheris sternly taint no time for laughin youve given jock an me more trouble than youre worth you ave been absent without leave an youll go into cells for that an you ave come back disgustinly dressed an most improper in the linin o that bloomin palanquin instid of which you laugh an we thought you was dead all the time  bhoys said the culprit still shaking gently whin ive done my tale you may cry if you like an little orthris here can thrample my inside out ha done an listen my performinces have been stupenjus my luck has been the blessed luck av the british armyan theres no betther than that i went out dhrunk an dhrinkin in the palanquin and i have come back a pink god did any of you go to dearsley afther my time was up he was at the bottom of ut all  ah said so murmured learoyd tomorrow ahll smash t face in upon his heead  ye will not dearsleys a jool av a man afther ortheris had put me into the palanquin an the six bearermen were gruntin down the road i tuk thought to mock dearsley for that fight so i tould thim go to the embankmint and there bein most amazin full i shtuck my head out av the concern an passed compliments wid dearsley i must ha miscalled him outrageous for whin i am that way the power av the tongue comes on me i can bare remimber tellin him that his mouth opened endways like the mouth av a skate which was thrue afther learoyd had handled ut an i clear remimber his takin no manner nor matter av offence but givin me a big dhrink of beer twas the beer did the thrick for i crawled back into the palanquin steppin on me right ear wid me left foot an thin slept like the dead wanst i halfroused an begad the noise in my head was tremenjusroarin and rattlin an poundin such as was quite new to me mother av mercy thinks i phwat a concertina i will have on my shoulders whin i wake an wid that i curls mysilf up to sleep before ut should get hould on me bhoys that noise was not dhrink twas the rattle av a thrain  there followed an impressive pause  yes he had put me on a thrainput me palanquin an all an six black assassins av his own coolies that was in his nefarious confidence on the flat av a ballastthruck and we were rowlin an bowlin along to benares glory be that i did not wake up thin an introjuce mysilf to the coolies as i was sayin i slept for the betther part av a day an a night but remimber you that that man dearsley had packed me off on wan av his materialthrains to benares all for to make me overstay my leave an get me into the cells  the explanation was an eminently rational one benares lay at least ten hours by rail from the cantonments and nothing in the world could have saved mulvaney from arrest as a deserter had he appeared there in the apparel of his orgies dearsley had not forgotten to take revenge learoyd drawing back a little began to place soft blows over selected portions of mulvaneys body his thoughts were away on the embankment and they meditated evil for dearsley mulvaney continued  whin i was full awake the palanquin was set down in a street i suspicioned for i cud hear people passin an talkin but i knew well i was far from home there is a queer smell upon our cantonmentsa smell av dried earth and brickkilns wid whiffs av cavalry stablelitter this place smelt marigold flowers an bad water an wanst somethin alive came an blew heavy with his muzzle at the chink av the shutter its in a village i am thinks i to myself an the parochial buffalo is investigatin the palanquin but anyways i had no desire to move only lie still whin youre in foreign parts an the standin luck av the british army will carry ye through that is an epigram i made ut  thin a lot av whishperin divils surrounded the palanquin take ut up sez wan man but wholl pay us sez another the maharanees minister av coorse sez the man oho sez i to mysilf im a quane in me own right wid a minister to pay me expenses ill be an emperor if i lie still long enough but this is no village ive found i lay quiet but i gummed me right eye to a crack av the shutters an i saw that the whole street was crammed wid palanquins an horses an a sprinklin av naked priests all yellow powder an tigers tails but i may tell you orthris an you learoyd that av all the palanquins ours was the most imperial an magnificent now a palanquin means a native lady all the world over except whin a soldier av the quane happens to be takin a ride women an priests sez i your fathers son is in the right pew this time terence there will be proceedins six black divils in pink muslin tuk up the palanquin an oh but the rowlin an the rockin made me sick thin we got fair jammed among the palanquinsnot more than fifty av theman we grated an bumped like queenstown potatosmacks in a runnin tide i cud hear the women gigglin and squirkin in their palanquins but mine was the royal equipage they made way for ut an begad the pink muslin men o mine were howlin room for the maharanee av gokralseetarun do you know aught av the lady sorr  yes said i she is a very estimable old queen of the central indian states and they say she is fat how on earth could she go to benares without all the city knowing her palanquin  twas the eternal foolishness av the naygurman they saw the palanquin lying loneful an forlornsome an the beauty av ut after dearsleys men had dhropped ut and gone away an they gave ut the best name that occurred to thim quite right too for aught we know the ould lady was travelin incoglike me im glad to hear shes fat i was no light weight mysilf an my men were mortial anxious to dhrop me under a great big archway promiscuously ornamented wid the most improper carvins an cuttins i iver saw begad they made me blushlike alike a maharanee  the temple of prithidevi i murmured remembering the monstrous horrors of that sculptured archway at benares  pretty devilskins savin your presence sorr there was nothin pretty about ut except me twas all half dhark an whin the coolies left they shut a big black gate behind av us an half a company av fat yellow priests began pullyhaulin the palanquins into a dharker place yeta big stone hall full av pillars an gods an incense an all manner av similar thruck the gate disconcerted me for i perceived i wud have to go forward to get out my retreat bein cut off by the same token a good priest makes a bad palanquincoolie begad they nearly turned me inside out draggin the palanquin to the temple now the disposishin av the forces inside was this way the maharanee av gokralseetarunthat was melay by the favor av providence on the far left flank behind the dhark av a pillar carved with elephints heads the remainder av the palanquins was in a big half circle facing in to the biggest fattest an most amazin shegod that iver i dreamed av her head ran up into the black above us an her feet stuck out in the light av a little fire av melted butter that a priest was feedin out av a butterdish thin a man began to sing an play on somethin back in the dhark an twas a queer song ut made my hair lift on the back av my neck thin the doors av all the palanquins slid back an the women bundled out i saw what ill niver see again twas more glorious than transformations at a pantomime for they was in pink an blue an silver an red an grass green wid dimonds an imralds an great red rubies all over thim but that was the least part av the glory o bhoys they were more lovely than the like av any loveliness in hiven ay their little bare feet were better than the white hands av a lords lady an their mouths were like puckered roses an their eyes were bigger an dharker than the eyes av any livin women ive seen ye may laugh but im speakin truth i niver saw the like an niver i will again  seeing that in all probability you were watching the wives and daughters of most of the kings of india the chances are that you wont i said for it was dawning on me that mulvaney had stumbled upon a big queens praying at benares  i niver will he said mournfully that sight doesnt come twist to any man it made me ashamed to watch a fat priest knocked at my door i didnt think hed have the insolince to disturb the maharanee av gokralseetarun so i lay still the old cows asleep sez he to another let her be sez that twill be long before she has a calf i might ha known before he spoke that all a woman prays for in injiaan for matter o that in england toois childher that made me more sorry id come me bein as you well know a childless man  he was silent for a moment thinking of his little son dead many years ago  they prayed an the butterfires blazed up an the incense turned everything blue an between that an the fires the women looked as tho they were all ablaze an twinklin they took hold av the shegods knees they cried out an they threw themselves about an that worldwithoutendamen music was dhrivin thim mad mother av hiven how they cried an the ould shegod grinnin above thim all so scornful the dhrink was dyin out in me fast an i was thinkin harder than the thoughts wud go through my headthinkin how to get out an all manner of nonsense as well the women were rockin in rows their dimond belts clickin an the tears runnin out betune their hands an the lights were goin lower an dharker thin there was a blaze like lightnin from the roof an that showed me the inside av the palanquin an at the end where my foot was stood the livin spit an image o mysilf worked on the linin this man here ut was  he hunted in the folds of his pink cloak ran a hand under one and thrust into the firelight a footlong embroidered presentment of the great god krishna playing on a flute the heavy jowl the staring eye and the blueblack moustache of the god made up a faroff resemblance to mulvaney  the blaze was gone in a wink but the whole schame came to me thin i believe i was mad too i slid the offshutter open an rowled out into the dhark behind the elephinthead pillar tucked up my trousies to my knees slipped off my boots an tuk a general hould av all the pink linin av the palanquin glory be ut ripped out like a womans dhriss whin you tread on ut at a sergeants ball an a bottle came with ut i tuk the bottle an the next minut i was out av the dhark av the pillar the pink linin wrapped round me most graceful the music thunderin like kettledrums an a could draft blowin round my bare legs by this hand that did ut i was khrishna tootlin on the flutethe god that the rigmental chaplain talks about a sweet sight i must ha looked i knew my eyes were big and my face was waxwhite an at the worst i must ha looked like a ghost but they took me for the livin god the music stopped and the women were dead dumb an i crooked my legs like a shepherd on a china basin an i did the ghostwaggle with my feet as i had done ut at the rigmental theatre many times an i slid acrost the width av that temple in front av the shegod tootlin on the beer bottle  wot did you toot demanded ortheris the practical  me oh mulvaney sprang up suiting the action to the word and sliding gravely in front of us a dilapidated but imposing deity in the half light i sang     only say      youll be mrs brallaghan    dont say nay      charmin judy callaghan  i didnt know me own voice when i sang an oh twas pitiful to see the women the darlins were down on their faces whin i passed the last wan i cud see her poor little fingers workin one in another as if she wanted to touch my feet so i dhrew the tail av this pink overcoat over her head for the greater honor an i slid into the dhark on the other side av the temple and fetched up in the arms av a big fat priest all i wanted was to get away clear so i tak him by his greasy throat an shut the speech out av him out sez i which way ye fat heathenoh sez he man sez i white man soldier man common soldier man where in the name av confusion is the back door the women in the temple were still on their faces an a young priest was holdin out his arms above their heads  this way sez my fat friend duckin behind a big bullgod an divin into a passage thin i remimbered that i must ha made the miraculous reputation av that temple for the next fifty years not so fast i sez an i held out both my hands wid a wink that ould thief smiled like a father i tuk him by the back av the neck in case he should be wishful to put a knife into me unbeknownst an i ran him up an down the passage twice to collect his sensibilities be quiet sez he in english now you talk sense i sez fwhatll you give me for the use av that most iligant palanquin i have no time to take awaydont tell sez he is ut like sez i but ye might give me my railway fare im far from my home an ive done you a service bhoys tis a good thing to be a priest the ould man niver throubled himself to dhraw from a bank as i will prove to you subsequint he philandered all round the slack av his clothes an began dribblin tenrupee notes old gold mohurs and rupees into my hand till i could hould no more  you lie said ortheris youre mad or sunstrook a native dont give coin unless you cut it out o im taint nature  then my lie an my sunstroke is concealed under that lump av sod yonder retorted mulvaney unruffled nodding across the scrub an theres a dale more in nature than your squidgy little legs have iver taken you to orthris me son four hundred an thirtyfour rupees by my reckoning an a big fat gold necklace that i took from him as a remimbrancer was our share in that business  an e give it you for love said ortheris  we were alone in that passage maybe i was a trifle too pressin but considher fwhat i had done for the good av the temple and the iverlastin joy av those women twas cheap at the price i wud ha taken more if i cud ha found ut i turned the ould man upside down at the last but he was milked dhry thin he opened a door in another passage an i found mysilf up to my knees in benares riverwater an bad smellin ut is more by token i had come out on the riverline close to the burnin ghat and contagious to a cracklin corpse this was in the heart av the night for i had been four hours in the temple there was a crowd av boats tied up so i tuk wan an wint across the river thin i came home acrost country lyin up by day  how on earth did you manage i said  how did sir frederick roberts get from cabul to candahar he marched an he niver tould how near he was to breakin down thats why he is fwhat he is an nowmulvaney yawned portentously now i will go an give myself up for absince widout leave its eight an twenty days an the rough end of the colonels tongue in orderly room any way you look at ut but tis cheap at the price  mulvaney said i softly if there happens to be any sort of excuse that the colonel can in any way accept i have a notion that youll get nothing more than the dressingdown the new recruits are in and  not a word more sorr is ut excuses the old man wants tis not my way but he shall have thim ill tell him i was engaged in financial operations connected wid a church and he flapped his way to cantonments and the cells singing lustily     so they sent a corprils file    and they put me in the gyardroom    for conduck unbecomin of a soldier  and when he was lost in the midst of the moonlight we could hear the refrain     bang upon the big drum bash upon the cymbals    as we go marchin along boys oh    for although in this campaign    theres no whisky nor champagne    well keep our spirits goin with a song boys  therewith he surrendered himself to the joyful and almost weeping guard and was made much of by his fellows but to the colonel he said that he had been smitten with sunstroke and had lain insensible on a villagers cot for untold hours and between laughter and goodwill the affair was smoothed over so that he could next day teach the new recruits how to fear god honor the queen shoot straight and keep clean    his majesty the king  where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto himwhat doest thou  yeth and chimo to sleep at ve foot of ve bed and ve pink pikkybook and ve bweadcause i will be hungwy in ve nightand vats all miss biddums and now give me one kiss and ill go to sleepso kite quiet ow ve pink pikkybook has slidded under ve pillow and ve bwead is cwumbling miss biddums miss biddums im so uncomfy come and tuck me up miss biddums  his majesty the king was going to bed and poor patient miss biddums who had advertised herself humbly as a young person european accustomed to the care of little children was forced to wait upon his royal caprices the going to bed was always a lengthy process because his majesty had a convenient knack of forgetting which of his many friends from the mehters son to the commissioners daughter he had prayed for and lest the deity should take offence was used to toil through his little prayers in all reverence five times in one evening his majesty the king believed in the efficacy of prayer as devoutly as he believed in chimo the patient spaniel or miss biddums who could reach him down his gunwith cursuffun capsreel onesfrom the upper shelves of the big nursery cupboard  at the door of the nursery his authority stopped beyond lay the empire of his father and mothertwo very terrible people who had no time to waste upon his majesty the king his voice was lowered when he passed the frontier of his own dominions his actions were fettered and his soul was filled with awe because of the grim man who lived among a wilderness of pigeonholes and the most fascinating pieces of red tape and the wonderful woman who was always getting into or stepping out of the big carriage  to the one belonged the mysteries of the duftarroom to the other the great reflected wilderness of the memsahibs room where the shiny scented dresses hung on pegs miles and miles up in the air and the justseen plateau of the toilettable revealed an acreage of speckly combs broidered hanafitch bags and whiteheaded brushes  there was no room for his majesty the king either in official reserve or mundane gorgeousness he had discovered that ages and ages agobefore even chimo came to the house or miss biddums had ceased grizzling over a packet of greasy letters which appeared to be her chief treasure on earth his majesty the king therefore wisely confined himself to his own territories where only miss biddums and she feebly disputed his sway  from miss biddums he had picked up his simple theology and welded it to the legends of gods and devils that he had learned in the servants quarters  to miss biddums he confided with equal trust his tattered garments and his more serious griefs she would make everything whole she knew exactly how the earth had been born and had reassured the trembling soul of his majesty the king that terrible time in july when it rained continuously for seven days and seven nights andthere was no ark ready and all the ravens had flown away she was the most powerful person with whom he was brought into contactalways excepting the two remote and silent people beyond the nursery door  how was his majesty the king to know that six years ago in the summer of his birth mrs austell turning over her husbands papers had come upon the intemperate letter of a foolish woman who had been carried away by the silent mans strength and personal beauty how could he tell what evil the overlooked slip of notepaper had wrought in the mind of a desperately jealous wife how could he despite his wisdom guess that his mother had chosen to make of it excuse for a bar and a division between herself and her husband that strengthened and grew harder to break with each year that she having unearthed this skeleton in the cupboard had trained it into a household god which should be about their path and about their bed and poison all their ways  these things were beyond the province of his majesty the king he only knew that his father was daily absorbed in some mysterious work for a thing called the sirkar and that his mother was the victim alternately of the nautch and the burrakhana to these entertainments she was escorted by a captainman for whom his majesty the king had no regard  he doesnt laugh he argued with miss biddums who would fain have taught him charity he only makes faces wiv his mouf and when he wants to omuse me i am not omused and his majesty the king shook his head as one who knew the deceitfulness of this world  morning and evening it was his duty to salute his father and motherthe former with a grave shake of the hand and the latter with an equally grave kiss once indeed he had put his arms round his mothers neck in the fashion he used toward miss biddums the openwork of his sleeveedge caught in an earring and the last stage of his majestys little overture was a suppressed scream and summary dismissal to the nursery  its wong thought his majesty the king to hug memsahibs wiv fings in veir ears i will amember he never repeated the experiment  miss biddums it must be confessed spoiled him as much as his nature admitted in some sort of recompense for what she called the hard ways of his papa and mamma she like her charge knew nothing of the trouble between man and wifethe savage contempt for a womans stupidity on the one side or the dull rankling anger on the other miss biddums had looked after many little children in her time and served in many establishments being a discreet woman she observed little and said less and when her pupils went over the sea to the great unknown which she with touching confidence in her hearers called home packed up her slender belongings and sought for employment afresh lavishing all her love on each successive batch of ingrates only his majesty the king had repaid her affection with interest and in his uncomprehending ears she had told the tale of nearly all her hopes her aspirations the hopes that were dead and the dazzling glories of her ancestral home in calcutta close to wellington square  everything above the average was in the eyes of his majesty the king calcutta good when miss biddums had crossed his royal will he reversed the epithet to vex that estimable lady and all things evil were until the tears of repentance swept away spite calcutta bad  now and again miss biddums begged for him the rare pleasure of a day in the society of the commissioners childthe wilful fouryearold patsie who to the intense amazement of his majesty the king was idolized by her parents on thinking the question out at length by roads unknown to those who have left childhood behind he came to the conclusion that patsie was petted because she wore a big blue sash and yellow hair  this precious discovery he kept to himself the yellow hair was absolutely beyond his power his own tousled wig being potatobrown but something might be done toward the blue sash he tied a large knot in his mosquitocurtains in order to remember to consult patsie on their next meeting she was the only child he had ever spoken to and almost the only one that he had ever seen the little memory and the very large and ragged knot held good  patsie lend me your blue wiband said his majesty the king  youll bewy it said patsie doubtfully mindful of certain fearful atrocities committed on her doll  no i wonttwoofanhonor its for me to wear  pooh said patsie boys dont wear saashes zeys only for dirls  i didnt know the face of his majesty the king fell  who wants ribands are you playing horses chickabiddies said the commissioners wife stepping into the veranda  toby wanted my sash explained patsie  i dont now said his majesty the king hastily feeling that with one of these terrible grownups his poor little secret would be shamelessly wrenched from him and perhapsmost burning desecration of alllaughed at  ill give you a crackercap said the commissioners wife come along with me toby and well choose it  the crackercap was a stiff threepointed vermilionandtinsel splendor his majesty the king fitted it on his royal brow the commissioners wife had a face that children instinctively trusted and her action as she adjusted the toppling middle spike was tender  will it do as well stammered his majesty the king  as what little one  as ve wiban  oh quite go and look at yourself in the glass  the words were spoken in all sincerity and to help forward any absurd dressingup amusement that the children might take into their minds but the young savage has a keen sense of the ludicrous his majesty the king swung the great chevalglass down and saw his head crowned with the staring horror of a fools capa thing which his father would rend to pieces if it ever came into his office he plucked it off and burst into tears  toby said the commissioners wife gravely you shouldnt give way to temper i am very sorry to see it its wrong  his majesty the king sobbed inconsolably and the heart of patsies mother was touched she drew the child on to her knee clearly it was not temper alone  what is it toby wont you tell me arent you well  the torrent of sobs and speech met and fought for a time with chokings and gulpings and gasps then in a sudden rush his majesty the king was delivered of a few inarticulate sounds followed by the wordsgo away youdirtylittle debbil  toby what do you mean  its what hed say i know it is he said vat when vere was only a little little eggy mess on my ttunic and hed say it again and laugh if i went in wif vat on my head  who would say that  mmmy papa and i fought if i had ve blue wiban hed let me play in ve wastepaper basket under ve table  what blue riband childie  ve same vat patsie hadve big blue wiban wwwound my tttummy  what is it toby theres something on your mind tell me all about it and perhaps i can help  isnt anyfing sniffed his majesty mindful of his manhood and raising his head from the motherly bosom upon which it was resting i only fought vat youyou petted patsie cause she had ve blue wiban andand if id had ve blue wiban too mmy papa wwould pet me  the secret was out and his majesty the king sobbed bitterly in spite of the arms round him and the murmur of comfort on his heated little forehead  enter patsie tumultuously embarrassed by several lengths of the commissioners pet mahseerrod tum along toby zeres a chuchu lizard in ze chick and ive told chimo to watch him till we turn if we poke him wiz zis his tail will go wigglewiggle and fall off tum along i cant weach  im comin said his majesty the king climbing down from the commissioners wifes knee after a hasty kiss  two minutes later the chuchu lizards tail was wriggling on the matting of the veranda and the children were gravely poking it with splinters from the chick to urge its exhausted vitality into just one wiggle more cause it doesnt hurt chuchu  the commissioners wife stood in the doorway and watchedpoor little mite a blue sash  and my own precious patsie i wonder if the best of us or we who love them best ever understand what goes on in their topsyturvy little heads  a big tear splashed on the commissioners wifes weddingring and she went indoors to devise a tea for the benefit of his majesty the king  their souls arent in their tummies at that age in this climate said the commissioners wife but they are not far off i wonder if i could make mrs austell understand poor little fellow  with simple craft the commissioners wife called on mrs austell and spoke long and lovingly about children inquiring specially for his majesty the king  hes with his governess said mrs austell and the tone intimated that she was not interested  the commissioners wife unskilled in the art of war continued her questionings i dont know said mrs austell these things are left to miss biddums and of course she does not illtreat the child  the commissioners wife left hastily the last sentence jarred upon her nerves doesnt illtreat the child as if that were all i wonder what tom would say if i only didnt illtreat patsie  thenceforward his majesty the king was an honored guest at the commissioners house and the chosen friend of patsie with whom he blundered into as many scrapes as the compound and the servants quarters afforded patsies mamma was always ready to give counsel help and sympathy and if need were and callers few to enter into their games with an abandon that would have shocked the sleekhaired subalterns who squirmed painfully in their chairs when they came to call on her whom they profanely nicknamed mother bunch  yet in spite of patsie and patsies mamma and the love that these two lavished upon him his majesty the king fell grievously from grace and committed no less a sin than that of theftunknown it is true but burdensome  there came a man to the door one day when his majesty was playing in the hall and the bearer had gone to dinner with a packet for his majestys mamma and he put it upon the halltable said that there was no answer and departed  presently the pattern of the dado ceased to interest his majesty while the packet a white neatly wrapped one of fascinating shape interested him very much indeed his mamma was out so was miss biddums and there was pink string round the packet he greatly desired pink string it would help him in many of his little businessesthe haulage across the floor of his small canechair the torturing of chimo who could never understand harnessand so forth if he took the string it would be his own and nobody would be any the wiser he certainly could not pluck up sufficient courage to ask mamma for it wherefore mounting upon a chair he carefully untied the string and behold the stiff white paper spread out in four directions and revealed a beautiful little leather box with gold lines upon it he tried to replace the string but that was a failure so he opened the box to get full satisfaction for his iniquity and saw a most beautiful star that shone and winked and was altogether lovely and desirable  vat said his majesty meditatively is a parkle cwown like what i will wear when i go to heaven i will wear it on my headmiss biddums says so i would like to wear it now i would like to play wiv it i will take it away and play wiv it very careful until mamma asks for it i fink it was bought for me to play wivsame as my cart  his majesty the king was arguing against his conscience and he knew it for he thought immediately after never mind i will keep it to play wiv until mamma says where is it and then i will sayi tookt it and i am sorry i will not hurt it because it is a parkle cwown but miss biddums will tell me to put it back i will not show it to miss biddums  if mamma had come in at that moment all would have gone well she did not and his majesty the king stuffed paper case and jewel into the breast of his blouse and marched to the nursery  when mamma asks i will tell was the salve that he laid upon his conscience but mamma never asked and for three whole days his majesty the king gloated over his treasure it was of no earthly use to him but it was splendid and for aught he knew something dropped from the heavens themselves still mamma made no inquiries and it seemed to him in his furtive peeps as though the shiny stones grew dim what was the use of a parkle cwown if it made a little boy feel all bad in his inside he had the pink string as well as the other treasure but greatly he wished that he had not gone beyond the string it was his first experience of iniquity and it pained him after the flush of possession and secret delight in the parkle cwown had died away  each day that he delayed rendered confession to the people beyond the nursery doors more impossible now and again he determined to put himself in the path of the beautifully attired lady as she was going out and explain that he and no one else was the possessor of a parkle cwown most beautiful and quite uninquired for but she passed hurriedly to her carriage and the opportunity was gone before his majesty the king could draw the deep breath which clinches noble resolve the dread secret cut him off from miss biddums patsie and the commissioners wife anddoubly hard fatewhen he brooded over it patsie said and told her mother that he was cross  the days were very long to his majesty the king and the nights longer still miss biddums had informed him more than once what was the ultimate destiny of fieves and when he passed the interminable mud flanks of the central jail he shook in his little strapped shoes  but release came after an afternoon spent in playing boats by the edge of the tank at the bottom of the garden his majesty the king went to tea and for the first time in his memory the meal revolted him his nose was very cold and his cheeks were burning hot there was a weight about his feet and he pressed his head several times to make sure that it was not swelling as he sat  i feel vevy funny said his majesty the king rubbing his nose veres a buzzbuzz in my head  he went to bed quietly miss biddums was out and the bearer undressed him  the sin of the parkle cwown was forgotten in the acuteness of the discomfort to which he roused after a leaden sleep of some hours he was thirsty and the bearer had forgotten to leave the drinkingwater miss biddums miss biddums im so kirsty  no answer miss biddums had leave to attend the wedding of a calcutta schoolmate his majesty the king had forgotten that  i want a dwink of water he cried but his voice was dried up in his throat i want a dwink vere is ve glass  he sat up in bed and looked round there was a murmur of voices from the other side of the nursery door it was better to face the terrible unknown than to choke in the dark he slipped out of bed but his feet were strangely wilful and he reeled once or twice then he pushed the door open and staggereda puffed and purplefaced little figureinto the brilliant light of the diningroom full of pretty ladies  im vevy hot im vevy uncomfitivle moaned his majesty the king clinging to the portière and veres no water in ve glass and im so kirsty give me a dwink of water  an apparition in black and whitehis majesty the king could hardly see distinctlylifted him up to the level of the table and felt his wrists and forehead the water came and he drank deeply his teeth chattering against the edge of the tumbler then every one seemed to go awayevery one except the huge man in black and white who carried him back to his bed the mother and father following and the sin of the parkle cwown rushed back and took possession of the terrified soul  im a fief he gasped i want to tell miss biddums vat im a fief vere is miss biddums  miss biddums had come and was bending over him im a fief he whispered a fieflike ve men in the pwison but ill tell now i tookt  i tookt ve parkle cwown when the man that came left it in ve hall i bwoke ve paper and ve little bwown box and it looked shiny and i tookt it to play wif and i was afwaid its in ve doolybox at ve bottom no one never asked for it but i was afwaid oh go an get ve doolybox  miss biddums obediently stooped to the lowest shelf of the almirah and unearthed the big paper box in which his majesty the king kept his dearest possessions under the tin soldiers and a layer of mud pellets for a pelletbow winked and blazed a diamond star wrapped roughly in a halfsheet of notepaper whereon were a few words  somebody was crying at the head of the bed and a mans hand touched the forehead of his majesty the king who grasped the packet and spread it on the bed  vat is ve parkle cwown he said and wept bitterly for now that he had made restitution he would fain have kept the shining splendor with him  it concerns you too said a voice at the head of the bed read the note this is not the time to keep back anything  the note was curt very much to the point and signed by a single initial if you wear this tomorrow night i shall know what to expect the date was three weeks old  a whisper followed and the deeper voice returned and you drifted as far apart as that i think it makes us quits now doesnt it oh cant we drop this folly once and for all is it worth it darling  kiss me too said his majesty the king dreamily you isnt vevy angwy is you  the fever burned itself out and his majesty the king slept  when he waked it was in a new worldpeopled by his father and mother as well as miss biddums and there was much love in that world and no morsel of fear and more petting than was good for several little boys his majesty the king was too young to moralize on the uncertainty of things human or he would have been impressed with the singular advantages of crimeay black sin behold he had stolen the parkle cwown and his reward was love and the right to play in the wastepaper basket under the table for always                                            he trotted over to spend an afternoon with patsie and the commissioners wife would have kissed him no not vere said his majesty the king with superb insolence fencing one corner of his mouth with his hand vats my mammas placevere she kisses me  oh said the commissioners wife briefly then to herself well i suppose i ought to be glad for his sake children are selfish little grubs andive got my patsie    the strange ride of morrowbie jukes  alive or deadthere is no other waynative proverb  there is as the conjurers say no deception about this tale jukes by accident stumbled upon a village that is well known to exist though he is the only englishman who has been there a somewhat similar institution used to flourish on the outskirts of calcutta and there is a story that if you go into the heart of bikanir which is in the heart of the great indian desert you shall come across not a village but a town where the dead who did not die but may not live have established their headquarters and since it is perfectly true that in the same desert is a wonderful city where all the rich moneylenders retreat after they have made their fortunes fortunes so vast that the owners cannot trust even the strong hand of the government to protect them but take refuge in the waterless sands and drive sumptuous cspring barouches and buy beautiful girls and decorate their palaces with gold and ivory and minton tiles and motheropearl i do not see why jukess tale should not be true he is a civil engineer with a head for plans and distances and things of that kind and he certainly would not take the trouble to invent imaginary traps he could earn more by doing his legitimate work he never varies the tale in the telling and grows very hot and indignant when he thinks of the disrespectful treatment he received he wrote this quite straightforwardly at first but he has since touched it up in places and introduced moral reflections thus  in the beginning it all arose from a slight attack of fever my work necessitated my being in camp for some months between pakpattan and mubarakpura desolate sandy stretch of country as every one who has had the misfortune to go there may know my coolies were neither more nor less exasperating than other gangs and my work demanded sufficient attention to keep me from moping had i been inclined to so unmanly a weakness  on the 23d december 1884 i felt a little feverish there was a full moon at the time and in consequence every dog near my tent was baying it the brutes assembled in twos and threes and drove me frantic a few days previously i had shot one loudmouthed singer and suspended his carcass in terrorem about fifty yards from my tentdoor but his friends fell upon fought for and ultimately devoured the body and as it seemed to me sang their hymns of thanksgiving afterward with renewed energy  the lightheadedness which accompanies fever acts differently on different men my irritation gave way after a short time to a fixed determination to slaughter one huge black and white beast who had been foremost in song and first in flight throughout the evening thanks to a shaking hand and a giddy head i had already missed him twice with both barrels of my shotgun when it struck me that my best plan would be to ride him down in the open and finish him off with a hogspear this of course was merely the semidelirious notion of a fever patient but i remember that it struck me at the time as being eminently practical and feasible  i therefore ordered my groom to saddle pornic and bring him round quietly to the rear of my tent when the pony was ready i stood at his head prepared to mount and dash out as soon as the dog should again lift up his voice pornic by the way had not been out of his pickets for a couple of days the night air was crisp and chilly and i was armed with a specially long and sharp pair of persuaders with which i had been rousing a sluggish cob that afternoon you will easily believe then that when he was let go he went quickly in one moment for the brute bolted as straight as a die the tent was left far behind and we were flying over the smooth sandy soil at racing speed in another we had passed the wretched dog and i had almost forgotten why it was that i had taken horse and hogspear  the delirium of fever and the excitement of rapid motion through the air must have taken away the remnant of my senses i have a faint recollection of standing upright in my stirrups and of brandishing my hogspear at the great white moon that looked down so calmly on my mad gallop and of shouting challenges to the camelthorn bushes as they whizzed past once or twice i believe i swayed forward on pornics neck and literally hung on by my spursas the marks next morning showed  the wretched beast went forward like a thing possessed over what seemed to be a limitless expanse of moonlit sand next i remember the ground rose suddenly in front of us and as we topped the ascent i saw the waters of the sutlej shining like a silver bar below then pornic blundered heavily on his nose and we rolled together down some unseen slope  i must have lost consciousness for when i recovered i was lying on my stomach in a heap of soft white sand and the dawn was beginning to break dimly over the edge of the slope down which i had fallen as the light grew stronger i saw that i was at the bottom of a horseshoeshaped crater of sand opening on one side directly on to the shoals of the sutlej my fever had altogether left me and with the exception of a slight dizziness in the head i felt no bad effects from the fall over night  pornic who was standing a few yards away was naturally a good deal exhausted but had not hurt himself in the least his saddle a favorite polo one was much knocked about and had been twisted under his belly it took me some time to put him to rights and in the meantime i had ample opportunities of observing the spot into which i had so foolishly dropped  at the risk of being considered tedious i must describe it at length inasmuch as an accurate mental picture of its peculiarities will be of material assistance in enabling the reader to understand what follows  imagine then as i have said before a horseshoeshaped crater of sand with steeply graded sand walls about thirtyfive feet high the slope i fancy must have been about 65  this crater enclosed a level piece of ground about fifty yards long by thirty at its broadest part with a rude well in the centre round the bottom of the crater about three feet from the level of the ground proper ran a series of eightythree semicircular ovoid square and multilateral holes all about three feet at the mouth each hole on inspection showed that it was carefully shored internally with driftwood and bamboos and over the mouth a wooden dripboard projected like the peak of a jockeys cap for two feet no sign of life was visible in these tunnels but a most sickening stench pervaded the entire amphitheatrea stench fouler than any which my wanderings in indian villages have introduced me to  having remounted pornic who was as anxious as i to get back to camp i rode round the base of the horseshoe to find some place whence an exit would be practicable the inhabitants whoever they might be had not thought fit to put in an appearance so i was left to my own devices my first attempt to rush pornic up the steep sandbanks showed me that i had fallen into a trap exactly on the same model as that which the antlion sets for its prey at each step the shifting sand poured down from above in tons and rattled on the dripboards of the holes like small shot a couple of ineffectual charges sent us both rolling down to the bottom half choked with the torrents of sand and i was constrained to turn my attention to the riverbank  here everything seemed easy enough the sand hills ran down to the river edge it is true but there were plenty of shoals and shallows across which i could gallop pornic and find my way back to terra firma by turning sharply to the right or the left as i led pornic over the sands i was startled by the faint pop of a rifle across the river and at the same moment a bullet dropped with a sharp whit close to pornics head  there was no mistaking the nature of the missilea regulation martinihenry picket about five hundred yards away a countryboat was anchored in midstream and a jet of smoke drifting away from its bows in the still morning air showed me whence the delicate attention had come was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse the treacherous sand slope allowed no escape from a spot which i had visited most involuntarily and a promenade on the river frontage was the signal for a bombardment from some insane native in a boat im afraid that i lost my temper very much indeed  another bullet reminded me that i had better save my breath to cool my porridge and i retreated hastily up the sands and back to the horseshoe where i saw that the noise of the rifle had drawn sixtyfive human beings from the badgerholes which i had up till that point supposed to be untenanted i found myself in the midst of a crowd of spectatorsabout forty men twenty women and one child who could not have been more than five years old they were all scantily clothed in that salmoncolored cloth which one associates with hindu mendicants and at first sight gave me the impression of a band of loathsome fakirs the filth and repulsiveness of the assembly were beyond all description and i shuddered to think what their life in the badgerholes must be  even in these days when local selfgovernment has destroyed the greater part of a natives respect for a sahib i have been accustomed to a certain amount of civility from my inferiors and on approaching the crowd naturally expected that there would be some recognition of my presence as a matter of fact there was but it was by no means what i had looked for  the ragged crew actually laughed at mesuch laughter i hope i may never hear again they cackled yelled whistled and howled as i walked into their midst some of them literally throwing themselves down on the ground in convulsions of unholy mirth in a moment i had let go pornics head and irritated beyond expression at the mornings adventure commenced cuffing those nearest to me with all the force i could the wretches dropped under my blows like ninepins and the laughter gave place to wails for mercy while those yet untouched clasped me round the knees imploring me in all sorts of uncouth tongues to spare them  in the tumult and just when i was feeling very much ashamed of myself for having thus easily given way to my temper a thin high voice murmured in english from behind my shouldersahib sahib do you not know me sahib it is gunga dass the telegraphmaster  i spun round quickly and faced the speaker  gunga dass i have of course no hesitation in mentioning the mans real name i had known four years before as a deccanee brahmin loaned by the punjab government to one of the khalsia states he was in charge of a branch telegraphoffice there and when i had last met him was a jovial fullstomached portly government servant with a marvelous capacity for making bad puns in englisha peculiarity which made me remember him long after i had forgotten his services to me in his official capacity it is seldom that a hindu makes english puns  now however the man was changed beyond all recognition castemark stomach slatecolored continuations and unctuous speech were all gone i looked at a withered skeleton turbanless and almost naked with long matted hair and deepset codfisheyes but for a crescentshaped scar on the left cheekthe result of an accident for which i was responsiblei should never have known him but it was indubitably gunga dass andfor this i was thankfulan englishspeaking native who might at least tell me the meaning of all that i had gone through that day  the crowd retreated to some distance as i turned toward the miserable figure and ordered him to show me some method of escaping from the crater he held a freshly plucked crow in his hand and in reply to my question climbed slowly on a platform of sand which ran in front of the holes and commenced lighting a fire there in silence dried bents sandpoppies and driftwood burn quickly and i derived much consolation from the fact that he lit them with an ordinary sulphurmatch when they were in a bright glow and the crow was neatly spitted in front thereof gunga dass began without a word of preamble  there are only two kinds of men sar the alive and the dead when you are dead you are dead but when you are alive you live here the crow demanded his attention for an instant as it twirled before the fire in danger of being burned to a cinder if you die at home and do not die when you come to the ghât to be burned you come here  the nature of the reeking village was made plain now and all that i had known or read of the grotesque and the horrible paled before the fact just communicated by the exbrahmin sixteen years ago when i first landed in bombay i had been told by a wandering armenian of the existence somewhere in india of a place to which such hindus as had the misfortune to recover from trance or catalepsy were conveyed and kept and i recollect laughing heartily at what i was then pleased to consider a travelers tale sitting at the bottom of the sandtrap the memory of watsons hotel with its swinging punkahs whiterobed attendants and the sallowfaced armenian rose up in my mind as vividly as a photograph and i burst into a loud fit of laughter the contrast was too absurd  gunga dass as he bent over the unclean bird watched me curiously hindus seldom laugh and his surroundings were not such as to move gunga dass to any undue excess of hilarity he removed the crow solemnly from the wooden spit and as solemnly devoured it then he continued his story which i give in his own words  in epidemics of the cholera you are carried to be burned almost before you are dead when you come to the riverside the cold air perhaps makes you alive and then if you are only little alive mud is put on your nose and mouth and you die conclusively if you are rather more alive more mud is put but if you are too lively they let you go and take you away i was too lively and made protestation with anger against the indignities that they endeavored to press upon me in those days i was brahmin and proud man now i am dead man and eathere he eyed the wellgnawed breast bone with the first sign of emotion that i had seen in him since we metcrows and other things they took me from my sheets when they saw that i was too lively and gave me medicines for one week and i survived successfully then they sent me by rail from my place to okara station with a man to take care of me and at okara station we met two other men and they conducted we three on camels in the night from okara station to this place and they propelled me from the top to the bottom and the other two succeeded and i have been here ever since two and a half years once i was brahmin and proud man and now i eat crows  there is no way of getting out  none of what kind at all when i first came i made experiments frequently and all the others also but we have always succumbed to the sand which is precipitated upon our heads  but surely i broke in at this point the riverfront is open and it is worth while dodging the bullets while at night  i had already matured a rough plan of escape which a natural instinct of selfishness forbade me sharing with gunga dass he however divined my unspoken thought almost as soon as it was formed and to my intense astonishment gave vent to a long low chuckle of derisionthe laughter be it understood of a superior or at least of an equal  you will nothe had dropped the sir completely after his opening sentencemake any escape that way but you can try i have tried once only  the sensation of nameless terror and abject fear which i had in vain attempted to strive against overmastered me completely my long fastit was now close upon ten oclock and i had eaten nothing since tiffin on the previous daycombined with the violent and unnatural agitation of the ride had exhausted me and i verily believe that for a few minutes i acted as one mad i hurled myself against the pitiless sandslope i ran round the base of the crater blaspheming and praying by turns i crawled out among the sedges of the riverfront only to be driven back each time in an agony of nervous dread by the riflebullets which cut up the sand round mefor i dared not face the death of a mad dog among that hideous crowdand finally fell spent and raving at the curb of the well no one had taken the slightest notice of an exhibition which makes me blush hotly even when i think of it now  two or three men trod on my panting body as they drew water but they were evidently used to this sort of thing and had no time to waste upon me the situation was humiliating gunga dass indeed when he had banked the embers of his fire with sand was at some pains to throw half a cupful of fetid water over my head an attention for which i could have fallen on my knees and thanked him but he was laughing all the while in the same mirthless wheezy key that greeted me on my first attempt to force the shoals and so in a semicomatose condition i lay till noon then being only a man after all i felt hungry and intimated as much to gunga dass whom i had begun to regard as my natural protector following the impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives i put my hand into my pocket and drew out four annas the absurdity of the gift struck me at once and i was about to replace the money  gunga dass however was of a different opinion give me the money said he all you have or i will get help and we will kill you all this as if it were the most natural thing in the world  a britons first impulse i believe is to guard the contents of his pockets but a moments reflection convinced me of the futility of differing with the one man who had it in his power to make me comfortable and with whose help it was possible that i might eventually escape from the crater i gave him all the money in my possession rs 985nine rupees eight annas and five piefor i always keep small change as bakshish when i am in camp gunga dass clutched the coins and hid them at once in his ragged loincloth his expression changing to something diabolical as he looked round to assure himself that no one had observed us  now i will give you something to eat said he  what pleasure the possession of my money could have afforded him i am unable to say but inasmuch as it did give him evident delight i was not sorry that i had parted with it so readily for i had no doubt that he would have had me killed if i had refused one does not protest against the vagaries of a den of wild beasts and my companions were lower than any beasts while i devoured what gunga dass had provided a coarse chapatti and a cupful of the foul wellwater the people showed not the faintest sign of curiositythat curiosity which is so rampant as a rule in an indian village  i could even fancy that they despised me at all events they treated me with the most chilling indifference and gunga dass was nearly as bad i plied him with questions about the terrible village and received extremely unsatisfactory answers so far as i could gather it had been in existence from time immemorialwhence i concluded that it was at least a century oldand during that time no one had ever been known to escape from it i had to control myself here with both hands lest the blind terror should lay hold of me a second time and drive me raving round the crater gunga dass took a malicious pleasure in emphasizing this point and in watching me wince nothing that i could do would induce him to tell me who the mysterious they were  it is so ordered he would reply and i do not yet know any one who has disobeyed the orders  only wait till my servants find that i am missing i retorted and i promise you that this place shall be cleared off the face of the earth and ill give you a lesson in civility too my friend  your servants would be torn in pieces before they came near this place and besides you are dead my dear friend it is not your fault of course but none the less you are dead and buried  at irregular intervals supplies of food i was told were dropped down from the land side into the amphitheatre and the inhabitants fought for them like wild beasts when a man felt his death coming on he retreated to his lair and died there the body was sometimes dragged out of the hole and thrown on to the sand or allowed to rot where it lay  the phrase thrown on to the sand caught my attention and i asked gunga dass whether this sort of thing was not likely to breed a pestilence  that said he with another of his wheezy chuckles you may see for yourself subsequently you will have much time to make observations  whereat to his great delight i winced once more and hastily continued the conversationand how do you live here from day to day what do you do the question elicited exactly the same answer as beforecoupled with the information that this place is like your european heaven there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage  gunga dass has been educated at a mission school and as he himself admitted had he only changed his religion like a wise man might have avoided the living grave which was now his portion but as long as i was with him i fancy he was happy  here was a sahib a representative of the dominant race helpless as a child and completely at the mercy of his native neighbors in a deliberate lazy way he set himself to torture me as a schoolboy would devote a rapturous halfhour to watching the agonies of an impaled beetle or as a ferret in a blind burrow might glue himself comfortably to the neck of a rabbit the burden of his conversation was that there was no escape of no kind whatever and that i should stay here till i died and was thrown on to the sand if it were possible to forejudge the conversation of the damned on the advent of a new soul in their abode i should say that they would speak as gunga dass did to me throughout that long afternoon i was powerless to protest or answer all my energies being devoted to a struggle against the inexplicable terror that threatened to overwhelm me again and again i can compare the feeling to nothing except the struggles of a man against the overpowering nausea of the channel passageonly my agony was of the spirit and infinitely more terrible  as the day wore on the inhabitants began to appear in full strength to catch the rays or the afternoon sun which were now sloping in at the mouth of the crater they assembled in little knots and talked among themselves without even throwing a glance in my direction about four oclock as far as i could judge gunga dass rose and dived into his lair for a moment emerging with a live crow in his hands the wretched bird was in a most draggled and deplorable condition but seemed to be in no way afraid of its master advancing cautiously to the river front gunga dass stepped from tussock to tussock until he had reached a smooth patch of sand directly in the line of the boats fire the occupants of the boat took no notice here he stopped and with a couple of dexterous turns of the wrist pegged the bird on its back with outstretched wings as was only natural the crow began to shriek at once and beat the air with its claws in a few seconds the clamor had attracted the attention of a bevy of wild crows on a shoal a few hundred yards away where they were discussing something that looked like a corpse half a dozen crows flew over at once to see what was going on and also as it proved to attack the pinioned bird gunga dass who had lain down on a tussock motioned to me to be quiet though i fancy this was a needless precaution in a moment and before i could see how it happened a wild crow who had grappled with the shrieking and helpless bird was entangled in the latters claws swiftly disengaged by gunga dass and pegged down beside its companion in adversity curiosity it seemed overpowered the rest of the flock and almost before gunga dass and i had time to withdraw to the tussock two more captives were struggling in the upturned claws of the decoys so the chaseif i can give it so dignified a namecontinued until gunga dass had captured seven crows five of them he throttled at once reserving two for further operations another day i was a good deal impressed by this to me novel method of securing food and complimented gunga dass on his skill  it is nothing to do said he tomorrow you must do it for me you are stronger than i am  this calm assumption of superiority upset me not a little and i answered peremptorilyindeed you old ruffian what do you think i have given you money for  very well was the unmoved reply perhaps not tomorrow nor the day after nor subsequently but in the end and for many years you will catch crows and eat crows and you will thank your european god that you have crows to catch and eat  i could have cheerfully strangled him for this but judged it best under the circumstances to smother my resentment an hour later i was eating one of the crows and as gunga dass had said thanking my god that i had a crow to eat never as long as i live shall i forget that evening meal the whole population were squatting on the hard sand platform opposite their dens huddled over tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes death having once laid his hand upon these men and forborne to strike seemed to stand aloof from them now for most of our company were old men bent and worn and twisted with years and women aged to all appearance as the fates themselves they sat together in knots and talkedgod only knows what they found to discussin low equable tones curiously in contrast to the strident babble with which natives are accustomed to make day hideous now and then an access of that sudden fury which had possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man or woman and with yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack the steep slope until baffled and bleeding he fell back on the platform incapable of moving a limb the others would never even raise their eyes when this happened as men too well aware of the futility of their fellows attempts and wearied with their useless repetition i saw four such outbursts in the course of that evening  gunga dass took an eminently businesslike view of my situation and while we were diningi can afford to laugh at the recollection now but it was painful enough at the timepropounded the terms on which he would consent to do for me my nine rupees eight annas he argued at the rate of three annas a day would provide me with food for fiftyone days or about seven weeks that is to say he would be willing to cater for me for that length of time at the end of it i was to look after myself for a further considerationvidelicet my bootshe would be willing to allow me to occupy the den next to his own and would supply me with as much dried grass for bedding as he could spare  very well gunga dass i replied to the first terms i cheerfully agree but as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you as you sit here and taking everything that you have i thought of the two invaluable crows at the time i flatly refuse to give you my boots and shall take whichever den i please  the stroke was a bold one and i was glad when i saw that it had succeeded gunga dass changed his tone immediately and disavowed all intention of asking for my boots at the time it did not strike me as at all strange that i a civil engineer a man of thirteen years standing in the service and i trust an average englishman should thus calmly threaten murder and violence against the man who had for a consideration it is true taken me under his wing i had left the world it seemed for centuries i was as certain then as i am now of my own existence that in the accursed settlement there was no law save that of the strongest that the living dead men had thrown behind them every canon of the world which had cast them out and that i had to depend for my own life on my strength and vigilance alone the crew of the illfated mignonette are the only men who would understand my frame of mind at present i argued to myself i am strong and a match for six of these wretches it is imperatively necessary that i should for my own sake keep both health and strength until the hour of my release comesif it ever does  fortified with these resolutions i ate and drank as much as i could and made gunga dass understand that i intended to be his master and that the least sign of insubordination on his part would be visited with the only punishment i had it in my power to inflictsudden and violent death shortly after this i went to bed that is to say gunga dass gave me a double armful of dried bents which i thrust down the mouth of the lair to the right of his and followed myself feet foremost the hole running about nine feet into the sand with a slight downward inclination and being neatly shored with timbers from my den which faced the riverfront i was able to watch the waters of the sutlej flowing past under the light of a young moon and compose myself to sleep as best i might  the horrors of that night i shall never forget my den was nearly as narrow as a coffin and the sides had been worn smooth and greasy by the contact of innumerable naked bodies added to which it smelled abominably sleep was altogether out of question to one in my excited frame of mind as the night wore on it seemed that the entire amphitheatre was filled with legions of unclean devils that trooping up from the shoals below mocked the unfortunates in their lairs  personally i am not of an imaginative temperamentvery few engineers arebut on that occasion i was as completely prostrated with nervous terror as any woman after half an hour or so however i was able once more to calmly review my chances of escape any exit by the steep sand walls was of course impracticable i had been thoroughly convinced of this some time before it was possible just possible that i might in the uncertain moonlight safely run the gauntlet of the rifle shots the place was so full of terror for me that i was prepared to undergo any risk in leaving it imagine my delight then when after creeping stealthily to the riverfront i found that the infernal boat was not there my freedom lay before me in the next few steps  by walking out to the first shallow pool that lay at the foot of the projecting left horn of the horseshoe i could wade across turn the flank of the crater and make my way inland without a moments hesitation i marched briskly past the tussocks where gunga dass had snared the crows and out in the direction of the smooth white sand beyond my first step from the tufts of dried grass showed me how utterly futile was any hope of escape for as i put my foot down i felt an indescribable drawing sucking motion of the sand below another moment and my leg was swallowed up nearly to the knee in the moonlight the whole surface of the sand seemed to be shaken with devilish delight at my disappointment i struggled clear sweating with terror and exertion back to the tussocks behind me and fell on my face  my only means of escape from the semicircle was protected with a quicksand  how long i lay i have not the faintest idea but i was roused at last by the malevolent chuckle of gunga dass at my ear i would advise you protector of the poor the ruffian was speaking english to return to your house it is unhealthy to lie down here moreover when the boat returns you will most certainly be rifled at he stood over me in the dim light of the dawn chuckling and laughing to himself  suppressing my first impulse to catch the man by the neck and throw him on to the quicksand i rose sullenly and followed him to the platform below the burrows  suddenly and futilely as i thought while i spoke i askedgunga dass what is the good of the boat if i cant get out anyhow i recollect that even in my deepest trouble i had been speculating vaguely on the waste of ammunition in guarding an already well protected foreshore  gunga dass laughed again and made answerthey have the boat only in daytime it is for the reason that there is a way i hope we shall have the pleasure of your company for much longer time it is a pleasant spot when you have been here some years and eaten roast crow long enough  i staggered numbed and helpless toward the fetid burrow allotted to me and fell asleep an hour or so later i was awakened by a piercing screamthe shrill highpitched scream of a horse in pain those who have once heard that will never forget the sound i found some little difficulty in scrambling out of the burrow when i was in the open i saw pornic my poor old pornic lying dead on the sandy soil how they had killed him i cannot guess gunga dass explained that horse was better than crow and greatest good of greatest number is political maxim we are now republic mister jukes and you are entitled to a fair share of the beast if you like we will pass a vote of thanks shall i propose  yes we were a republic indeed a republic of wild beasts penned at the bottom of a pit to eat and fight and sleep till we died i attempted no protest of any kind but sat down and stared at the hideous sight in front of me in less time almost than it takes me to write this pornics body was divided in some unclean way or other the men and women had dragged the fragments on to the platform and were preparing their morning meal gunga dass cooked mine the almost irresistible impulse to fly at the sand walls until i was wearied laid hold of me afresh and i had to struggle against it with all my might gunga dass was offensively jocular till i told him that if he addressed another remark of any kind whatever to me i should strangle him where he sat this silenced him till silence became insupportable and i bade him say something  you will live here till you die like the other feringhi he said coolly watching me over the fragment of gristle that he was gnawing  what other sahib you swine speak at once and dont stop to tell me a lie  he is over there answered gunga dass pointing to a burrowmouth about four doors to the left of my own you can see for yourself he died in the burrow as you will die and i will die and as all these men and women and the one child will also die  for pitys sake tell me all you know about him who was he when did he come and when did he die  this appeal was a weak step on my part gunga dass only leered and repliedi will notunless you give me something first  then i recollected where i was and struck the man between the eyes partially stunning him he stepped down from the platform at once and cringing and fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet led me round to the burrow which he had indicated  i know nothing whatever about the gentleman your god be my witness that i do not he was as anxious to escape as you were and he was shot from the boat though we all did all things to prevent him from attempting he was shot here gunga dass laid his hand on his lean stomach and bowed to the earth  well and what then go on  and thenand then your honor we carried him into his house and gave him water and put wet cloths on the wound and he laid down in his house and gave up the ghost  in how long in how long  about half an hour after he received his wound i call vishnu to witness yelled the wretched man that i did everything for him everything which was possible that i did  he threw himself down on the ground and clasped my ankles but i had my doubts about gunga dasss benevolence and kicked him off as he lay protesting  i believe you robbed him of everything he had but i can find out in a minute or two how long was the sahib here  nearly a year and a half i think he must have gone mad but hear me swear protector of the poor wont your honor hear me swear that i never touched an article that belonged to him what is your worship going to do  i had taken gunga dass by the waist and had hauled him on to the platform opposite the deserted burrow as i did so i thought of my wretched fellowprisoners unspeakable misery among all these horrors for eighteen months and the final agony of dying like a rat in a hole with a bulletwound in the stomach gunga dass fancied i was going to kill him and howled pitifully the rest of the population in the plethora that follows a full flesh meal watched us without stirring  go inside gunga dass said i and fetch it out  i was feeling sick and faint with horror now gunga dass nearly rolled off the platform and howled aloud  but i am brahmin sahiba highcaste brahmin by your soul by your fathers soul do not make me do this thing  brahmin or no brahmin by my soul and my fathers soul in you go i said and seizing him by the shoulders i crammed his head into the mouth of the burrow kicked the rest of him in and sitting down covered my face with my hands  at the end of a few minutes i heard a rustle and a creak then gunga dass in a sobbing choking whisper speaking to himself then a soft thudand i uncovered my eyes  the dry sand had turned the corpse entrusted to its keeping into a yellowbrown mummy i told gunga dass to stand off while i examined it the bodyclad in an olivegreen huntingsuit much stained and worn with leather pads on the shoulderswas that of a man between thirty and forty above middle height with light sandy hair long mustache and a rough unkempt beard the left canine of the upper jaw was missing and a portion of the lobe of the right ear was gone on the second finger of the left hand was a ringa shieldshaped bloodstone set in gold with a monogram that might have been either bk or bl on the third finger of the right hand was a silver ring in the shape of a coiled cobra much worn and tarnished gunga dass deposited a handful of trifles he had picked out of the burrow at my feet and covering the face of the body with my handkerchief i turned to examine these i give the full list in the hope that it may lead to the identification of the unfortunate man  1 bowl of a briarwood pipe serrated at the edge much worn and blackened bound with string at the screw  2 two patentlever keys wards of both broken  3 tortoiseshellhandled penknife silver or nickel nameplate marked with monogram bk  4 envelope postmark undecipherable bearing a victorian stamp addressed to miss mon rest illegiblehamnt  5 imitation crocodileskin notebook with pencil first fortyfive pages blank four and a half illegible fifteen others filled with private memoranda relating chiefly to three personsa mrs l singleton abbreviated several times to lot single mrs s may and garmison referred to in places as jerry or jack  6 handle of smallsized huntingknife blade snapped short bucks horn diamond cut with swivel and ring on the butt fragment of cotton cord attached  it must not be supposed that i inventoried all these things on the spot as fully as i have here written them down the notebook first attracted my attention and i put it in my pocket with a view to studying it later on the rest of the articles i conveyed to my burrow for safetys sake and there being a methodical man i inventoried them i then returned to the corpse and ordered gunga dass to help me to carry it out to the riverfront while we were engaged in this the exploded shell of an old brown cartridge dropped out of one of the pockets and rolled at my feet gunga dass had not seen it and i fell to thinking that a man does not carry exploded cartridgecases especially browns which will not bear loading twice about with him when shooting in other words that cartridgecase has been fired inside the crater consequently there must be a gun somewhere i was on the verge of asking gunga dass but checked myself knowing that he would lie we laid the body down on the edge of the quicksand by the tussocks it was my intention to push it out and let it be swallowed upthe only possible mode of burial that i could think of i ordered gunga dass to go away  then i gingerly put the corpse out on the quicksand in doing so it was lying face downward i tore the frail and rotten khaki shootingcoat open disclosing a hideous cavity in the back i have already told you that the dry sand had as it were mummified the body a moments glance showed that the gaping hole had been caused by a gunshot wound the gun must have been fired with the muzzle almost touching the back the shootingcoat being intact had been drawn over the body after death which must have been instantaneous the secret of the poor wretchs death was plain to me in a flash some one of the crater presumably gunga dass must have shot him with his own gunthe gun that fitted the brown cartridges he had never attempted to escape in the face of the riflefire from the boat  i pushed the corpse out hastily and saw it sink from sight literally in a few seconds i shuddered as i watched in a dazed halfconscious way i turned to peruse the notebook a stained and discolored slip of paper had been inserted between the binding and the back and dropped out as i opened the pages this is what it containedfour out from crowclump three left nine out two right three back two left fourteen out two left seven out one left nine back two right six back four right seven back the paper had been burned and charred at the edges what it meant i could not understand i sat down on the dried bents turning it over and over between my fingers until i was aware of gunga dass standing immediately behind me with glowing eyes and outstretched hands  have you got it he panted will you not let me look at it also i swear that i will return it  got what return what i asked  that which you have in your hands it will help us both he stretched out his long birdlike talons trembling with eagerness  i could never find it he continued he had secreted it about his person therefore i shot him but nevertheless i was unable to obtain it  gunga dass had quite forgotten his little fiction about the riflebullet i received the information perfectly calmly morality is blunted by consorting with the dead who are alive  what on earth are you raving about what is it you want me to give you  the piece of paper in the notebook it will help us both oh you fool you fool can you not see what it will do for us we shall escape  his voice rose almost to a scream and he danced with excitement before me i own i was moved at the chance of getting away  dont skip explain yourself do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us what does it mean  read it aloud read it aloud i beg and i pray you to read it aloud  i did so gunga dass listened delightedly and drew an irregular line in the sand with his fingers  see now it was the length of his gunbarrels without the stock i have those barrels four gunbarrels out from the place where i caught crows straight out do you follow me then three leftah how well i remember when that man worked it out night after night then nine out and so on out is always straight before you across the quicksand he told me so before i killed him  but if you knew all this why didnt you get out before  i did not know it he told me that he was working it out a year and a half ago and how he was working it out night after night when the boat had gone away and he could get out near the quicksand safely then he said that we would get away together but i was afraid that he would leave me behind one night when he had worked it all out and so i shot him besides it is not advisable that the men who once get in here should escape only i and i am a brahmin  the prospect of escape had brought gunga dasss caste back to him he stood up walked about and gesticulated violently eventually i managed to make him talk soberly and he told me how this englishman had spent six months night after night in exploring inch by inch the passage across the quicksand how he had declared it to be simplicity itself up to within about twenty yards of the river bank after turning the flank of the left horn of the horseshoe this much he had evidently not completed when gunga dass shot him with his own gun  in my frenzy of delight at the possibilities of escape i recollect shaking hands effusively with gunga dass after we had decided that we were to make an attempt to get away that very night it was weary work waiting throughout the afternoon  about ten oclock as far as i could judge when the moon had just risen above the lip of the crater gunga dass made a move for his burrow to bring out the gunbarrels whereby to measure our path all the other wretched inhabitants had retired to their lairs long ago the guardian boat drifted downstream some hours before and we were utterly alone by the crowclump gunga dass while carrying the gunbarrels let slip the piece of paper which was to be our guide i stooped down hastily to recover it and as i did so i was aware that the diabolical brahmin was aiming a violent blow at the back of my head with the gunbarrels it was too late to turn round i must have received the blow somewhere on the nape of my neck a hundred thousand fiery stars danced before my eyes and i fell forward senseless at the edge of the quicksand  when i recovered consciousness the moon was going down and i was sensible of intolerable pain in the back of my head gunga dass had disappeared and my mouth was full of blood i lay down again and prayed that i might die without more ado then the unreasoning fury which i have before mentioned laid hold upon me and i staggered inland toward the walls of the crater it seemed that some one was calling to me in a whispersahib sahib sahib exactly as my bearer used to call me in the mornings i fancied that i was delirious until a handful of sand fell at my feet then i looked up and saw a head peering down into the amphitheatrethe head of dunnoo my dogboy who attended to my collies as soon as he had attracted my attention he held up his hand and showed a rope i motioned staggering to and fro the while that he should throw it down it was a couple of leather punkahropes knotted together with a loop at one end i slipped the loop over my head and under my arms heard dunnoo urge something forward was conscious that i was being dragged face downward up the steep sand slope and the next instant found myself choked and half fainting on the sand hills overlooking the crater dunnoo with his face ashy grey in the moonlight implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once  it seems that he had tracked pornics footprints fourteen miles across the sands to the crater had returned and told my servants who flatly refused to meddle with any one white or black once fallen into the hideous village of the dead whereupon dunnoo had taken one of my ponies and a couple of punkahropes returned to the crater and hauled me out as i have described  to cut a long story short dunnoo is now my personal servant on a gold mohur a montha sum which i still think far too little for the services he has rendered nothing on earth will induce me to go near that devilish spot again or to reveal its whereabouts more clearly than i have done of gunga dass i have never found a trace nor do i wish to do my sole motive in giving this to be published is the hope that some one may possibly identify from the details and the inventory which i have given above the corpse of the man in the olivegreen huntingsuit    in the house of suddhoo     a stones throw out on either hand    from that wellordered road we tread      and all the world is wild and strange    churel and ghoul and djinn and sprite    shall bear us company tonight    for we have reached the oldest land      wherein the powers of darkness range  from the dusk to the dawn  the house of suddhoo near the taksali gate is twostoried with four carved windows of old brown wood and a flat roof you may recognize it by five red handprints arranged like the five of diamonds on the whitewash between the upper windows bhagwan dass the grocer and a man who says he gets his living by sealcutting live in the lower story with a troop of wives servants friends and retainers the two upper rooms used to be occupied by janoo and azizun and a little blackandtan terrier that was stolen from an englishmans house and given to janoo by a soldier today only janoo lives in the upper rooms suddhoo sleeps on the roof generally except when he sleeps in the street he used to go to peshawar in the cold weather to visit his son who sells curiosities near the edwardes gate and then he slept under a real mud roof suddhoo is a great friend of mine because his cousin had a son who secured thanks to my recommendation the post of headmessenger to a big firm in the station suddhoo says that god will make me a lieutenantgovernor one of these days i dare say his prophecy will come true he is very very old with white hair and no teeth worth showing and he has outlived his witsoutlived nearly everything except his fondness for his son at peshawar janoo and azizun are kashmiris ladies of the city and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable profession but azizun has since married a medical student from the northwest and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere near bareilly bhagwan dass is an extortionate and an adulterator he is very rich the man who is supposed to get his living by sealcutting pretends to be very poor this lets you know as much as is necessary of the four principal tenants in the house of suddhoo then there is me of course but i am only the chorus that comes in at the end to explain things so i do not count  suddhoo was not clever the man who pretended to cut seals was the cleverest of them allbhagwan dass only knew how to lieexcept janoo she was also beautiful but that was her own affair  suddhoos son at peshawar was attacked by pleurisy and old suddhoo was troubled the sealcutter man heard of suddhoos anxiety and made capital out of it he was abreast of the times he got a friend in peshawar to telegraph daily accounts of the sons health and here the story begins  suddhoos cousins son told me one evening that suddhoo wanted to see me that he was too old and feeble to come personally and that i should be conferring an everlasting honor on the house of suddhoo if i went to him i went but i think seeing how well off suddhoo was then that he might have sent something better than an ekka which jolted fearfully to haul out a future lieutenantgovernor to the city on a muggy april evening the ekka did not run quickly it was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of ranjit singhs tomb near the main gate of the fort here was suddhoo and he said that by reason of my condescension it was absolutely certain that i should become a lieutenantgovernor while my hair was yet black then we talked about the weather and the state of my health and the wheat crops for fifteen minutes in the huzuri bagh under the stars  suddhoo came to the point at last he said that janoo had told him that there was an order of the sirkar against magic because it was feared that magic might one day kill the empress of india i didnt know anything about the state of the law but i fancied that something interesting was going to happen i said that so far from magic being discouraged by the government it was highly commended the greatest officials of the state practiced it themselves if the financial statement isnt magic i dont know what is then to encourage him further i said that if there was any jadoo afoot i had not the least objection to giving it my countenance and sanction and to seeing that it was clean jadoowhite magic as distinguished from the unclean jadoo which kills folk it took a long time before suddhoo admitted that this was just what he had asked me to come for then he told me in jerks and quavers that the man who said he cut seals was a sorcerer of the cleanest kind that every day he gave suddhoo news of the sick son in peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly and that this news was always corroborated by the letters further that he had told suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son which could be removed by clean jadoo and of course heavy payment i began to see exactly how the land lay and told suddhoo that i also understood a little jadoo in the western line and would go to his house to see that everything was done decently and in order we set off together and on the way suddhoo told me that he had paid the sealcutter between one hundred and two hundred rupees already and the jadoo of that night would cost two hundred more which was cheap he said considering the greatness of his sons danger but i do not think he meant it  the lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived i could hear awful noises from behind the sealcutters shopfront as if some one were groaning his soul out suddhoo shook all over and while we groped our way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun janoo and azizun met us at the stairhead and told us that the jadoowork was coming off in their rooms because there was more space there janoo is a lady of a freethinking turn of mind she whispered that the jadoo was an invention to get money out of suddhoo and that the sealcutter would go to a hot place when he died suddhoo was nearly crying with fear and old age he kept walking up and down the room in the halflight repeating his sons name over and over again and asking azizun if the sealcutter ought not to make a reduction in the case of his own landlord janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved bowwindows the boards were up and the rooms were only lit by one tiny oillamp there was no chance of my being seen if i stayed still  presently the groans below ceased and we heard steps on the staircase that was the sealcutter he stopped outside the door as the terrier barked and azizun fumbled at the chain and he told suddhoo to blow out the lamp this left the place in jet darkness except for the red glow from the two huqas that belonged to janoo and azizun the sealcutter came in and i heard suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan azizun caught her breath and janoo backed on to one of the beds with a shudder there was a clink of something metallic and then shot up a pale bluegreen flame near the ground the light was just enough to show azizun pressed against one corner of the room with the terrier between her knees janoo with her hands clasped leaning forward as she sat on the bed suddhoo face down quivering and the sealcutter  i hope i may never see another man like that sealcutter he was stripped to the waist with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my wrist round his forehead a salmon colored loincloth round his middle and a steel bangle on each ankle this was not aweinspiring it was the face of the man that turned me cold it was bluegrey in the first place in the second the eyes were rolled back till you could only see the whites of them and in the third the face was the face of a demona ghoulanything you please except of the sleek oily old ruffian who sat in the daytime over his turninglathe downstairs he was lying on his stomach with his arms turned and crossed behind him as if he had been thrown down pinioned his head and neck were the only parts of him off the floor they were nearly at right angles to the body like the head of a cobra at spring it was ghastly in the centre of the room on the bare earth floor stood a big deep brass basin with a pale bluegreen light floating in the centre like a nightlight round that basin the man on the floor wriggled himself three times how he did it i do not know i could see the muscles ripple along his spine and fall smooth again but i could not see any other motion the head seemed the only thing alive about him except that slow curl and uncurl of the laboring backmuscles janoo from the bed was breathing seventy to the minute azizun held her hands before her eyes and old suddhoo fingering at the dirt that had got into his white beard was crying to himself the horror of it was that the creeping crawly thing made no soundonly crawled and remember this lasted for ten minutes while the terrier whined and azizun shuddered and janoo gasped and suddhoo cried  i felt the hair lift at the back of my head and my heart thump like a thermantidote paddle luckily the sealcutter betrayed himself by his most impressive trick and made me calm again after he had finished that unspeakable triple crawl he stretched his head away from the floor as high as he could and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils now i knew how firespouting is donei can do it myselfso i felt at ease the business was a fraud if he had only kept to that crawl without trying to raise the effect goodness knows what i might not have thought both the girls shrieked at the jet of fire and the head dropped chindown on the floor with a thud the whole body lying then like a corpse with its arms trussed there was a pause of five full minutes after this and the bluegreen flame died down janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets while azizun turned her face to the wall and took the terrier in her arms suddhoo put out an arm mechanically to janoos huqa and she slid it across the floor with her foot directly above the body and on the wall were a couple of flaming portraits in stampedpaper frames of the queen and the prince of wales they looked down on the performance and to my thinking seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all  just when the silence was getting unendurable the body turned over and rolled away from the basin to the side of the room where it lay stomachup there was a faint plop from the basinexactly like the noise a fish makes when it takes a flyand the green light in the centre revived  i looked at the basin and saw bobbing in the water the dried shrivelled black head of a native babyopen eyes open mouth and shaved scalp it was worse being so very sudden than the crawling exhibition we had no time to say anything before it began to speak  read poes account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man and you will realize less than one half of the horror of that heads voice  there was an interval of a second or two between each word and a sort of ring ring ring in the note of the voice like the timbre of a bell it pealed slowly as if talking to itself for several minutes before i got rid of my cold sweat then the blessed solution struck me i looked at the body lying near the doorway and saw just where the hollow of the throat joins on the shoulders a muscle that had nothing to do with any mans regular breathing twitching away steadily the whole thing was a careful reproduction of the egyptian teraphin that one reads about sometimes and the voice was as clever and as appalling a piece of ventriloquism as one could wish to hear all this time the head was lipliplapping against the side of the basin and speaking it told suddhoo on his face again whining of his sons illness and of the state of the illness up to the evening of that very night i always shall respect the sealcutter for keeping so faithfully to the time of the peshawar telegrams it went on to say that skilled doctors were night and day watching over the mans life and that he would eventually recover if the fee to the potent sorcerer whose servant was the head in the basin were doubled  here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in to ask for twice your stipulated fee in a voice that lazarus might have used when he rose from the dead is absurd janoo who is really a woman of masculine intellect saw this as quickly as i did i heard her say asli nahin fareib scornfully under her breath and just as she said so the light in the basin died out the head stopped talking and we heard the room door creak on its hinges then janoo struck a match lit the lamp and we saw that head basin and sealcutter were gone suddhoo was wringing his hands and explaining to any one who cared to listen that if his chances of eternal salvation depended on it he could not raise another two hundred rupees azizun was nearly in hysterics in the corner while janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss the probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao or makeup  i explained as much as i knew of the sealcutters way of jadoo but her argument was much more simplethe magic that is always demanding gifts is no true magic said she my mother told me that the only potent lovespells are those which are told you for love this sealcutter man is a liar and a devil i dare not tell do anything or get anything done because i am in debt to bhagwan dass the bunnia for two gold rings and a heavy anklet i must get my food from his shop the sealcutter is the friend of bhagwan dass and he would poison my food a fools jadoo has been going on for ten days and has cost suddhoo many rupees each night the sealcutter used black hens and lemons and mantras before he never showed us anything like this till tonight azizun is a fool and will be a purdahnashin soon suddhoo has lost his strength and his wits see now i had hoped to get from suddhoo many rupees while he lived and many more after his death and behold he is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a sheass the sealcutter  here i said but what induced suddhoo to drag me into the business of course i can speak to the sealcutter and he shall refund the whole thing is childs talkshameand senseless  suddhoo is an old child said janoo he has lived on the roofs these seventy years and is as senseless as a milchgoat he brought you here to assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the sirkar whose salt he ate many years ago he worships the dust off the feet of the sealcutter and that cowdevourer has forbidden him to go and see his son what does suddhoo know of your laws or the lightningpost i have to watch his money going day by day to that lying beast below  janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation while suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner and azizun was trying to guide the pipestem to his foolish old mouth                                            now the case stands thus unthinkingly i have laid myself open to the charge of aiding and abetting the sealcutter in obtaining money under false pretences which is forbidden by section 420 of the indian penal code i am helpless in the matter for these reasons i cannot inform the police what witnesses would support my statements janoo refuses flatly and azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near bareillylost in this big india of ours i dare not again take the law into my own hands and speak to the sealcutter for certain am i that not only would suddhoo disbelieve me but this step would end in the poisoning of janoo who is bound hand and foot by her debt to the bunnia suddhoo is an old dotard and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the sirkar rather patronizes the black art than otherwise his son is well now but suddhoo is completely under the influence of the sealcutter by whose advice he regulates the affairs of his life janoo watches daily the money that she hoped to wheedle out of suddhoo taken by the sealcutter and becomes daily more furious and sullen  she will never tell because she dare not but unless something happens to prevent her i am afraid that the sealcutter will die of cholerathe white arsenic kindabout the middle of may and thus i shall be privy to a murder in the house of suddhoo    black jack     to the wake av tim ohara      came company    all st patricks alley      was there to see        robert buchanan  as the three musketeers share their silver tobacco and liquor together as they protect each other in barracks or camp and as they rejoice together over the joy of one so do they divide their sorrows when ortheriss irrepressible tongue has brought him into cells for a season or learoyd has run amok through his kit and accoutrements or mulvaney has indulged in strong waters and under their influence reproved his commanding officer you can see the trouble in the faces of the untouched two and the rest of the regiment know that comment or jest is unsafe generally the three avoid orderly room and the corner shop that follows leaving both to the young bloods who have not sown their wild oats but there are occasions  for instance ortheris was sitting on the drawbridge of the main gate of fort amara with his hands in his pockets and his pipe bowl down in his mouth learoyd was lying at full length on the turf of the glacis kicking his heels

to say to walk up and down for certain hours in full marching order with rifle bayonet ammunition knapsack and overcoat and his offence was being dirty on parade i nearly fell into the fort ditch with astonishment and wrath for mulvaney is the smartest man that ever mounted guard and would as soon think of turning out uncleanly as of dispensing with his trousers  who was the sergeant that checked him i asked  mullins o course said ortheris there aint no other man would whip im on the peg so but mullins aint a man es a dirty little pigscraper thats wot e is  what did mulvaney say hes not the

prade but for avin said somthin to mullins tho i do not believe sez e you said wot e said you said an mulvaney fell away sayin nothin you know e never speaks to the colonel for fear o gettin imself fresh copped  mullins a very young and very much married sergeant whose manners were partly the result of innate depravity and partly of imperfectly digested board school came over the bridge and most rudely asked ortheris what he was doing  me said ortheris ow im waiting for my cmission seed it comin along yit  mullins turned purple and passed on there was the sound of a gentle chuckle from the glacis where learoyd lay  e expects to get is cmission some day explained orthris gawd elp the mess that ave to put their ands into the same kiddy as im wot time dyou make it sir fower mulvaney ll be

as he held the londoner over the ditch onything but t braass orthris ma son ahve got one rupee eight annas of ma own he showed two coins and replaced ortheris on the drawbridge rail  very good i said where are you going to  goin to walk im orf wen e comes outtwo miles or three or fower said ortheris  the footsteps within ceased i heard the dull thud of a knapsack falling on a bedstead followed by the rattle of arms ten minutes later mulvaney faultlessly dressed his lips tight and his face as black as a thunderstorm stalked into the sunshine on the drawbridge learoyd and ortheris sprang from my side and closed in upon him both leaning toward as horses lean upon the pole in an instant they had disappeared down the sunken road to the cantonments and i was left alone mulvaney had not seen fit to recognize me so i knew that his trouble must be heavy upon him  i climbed one of the bastions and watched the figures of the three musketeers grow smaller and smaller across the plain they were walking as fast as they could put foot to the ground and their heads were bowed they fetched a great compass round the paradeground skirted the cavalry lines and vanished in the belt of trees that fringes the low land by the river  i followed slowly and sighted themdusty sweating but still keeping up their long swinging trampon the river bank they crashed through the forest reserve headed toward the bridge of boats and presently established themselves on the bow of one of the pontoons i rode cautiously till i saw three puffs of white smoke rise and die out in the clear evening air and knew that peace had come again at the bridgehead they waved me forward with gestures of welcome  tie up your orse shouted ortheris an come on sir were all goin ome in this ere bloomin boat  from the bridgehead to the forest officers bungalow is but a step the messman was there and would see that a man held my horse did the sahib require aught elsea peg or beer ritchie sahib had left half a dozen bottles of the latter but since the sahib was a friend of ritchie sahib and he the messman was a poor man  i gave my order quietly and returned to the bridge mulvaney had taken off his boots and was dabbling his toes in the water learoyd was lying on his back on the pontoon and ortheris was pretending to row with a big bamboo  im an ould fool said mulvaney reflectively dhraggin you two out here

with a basket uncertain how to clamber down to the pontoon might a knowd youd a got liquor out o bloomin desert sir said ortheris gracefully to me then to the messman easy with them there bottles theyre worth their weight in gold jock ye longarmed beggar get out o that an hike em down  learoyd had the basket on the pontoon in an instant and the three musketeers gathered round it with dry lips they drank my health in due and ancient form and thereafter tobacco tasted sweeter than ever they absorbed all the beer and disposed themselves in picturesque attitudes to admire the setting sunno man speaking for a while  mulvaneys head dropped upon his chest and we thought that he was asleep  what on earth did you come so far for i whispered to ortheris  to walk im orf o course when es been checked we allus walks im orf e aint fit to be spoke to those timesnor e aint fit to leave alone neither so we takes im till e is  mulvaney raised his head and stared straight into the sunset i had my

evening hymn  one of the few advantages that india has over england is a great knowability after five years service a man is directly or indirectly acquainted with the two or three hundred civilians in his province all the messes of ten or twelve regiments and batteries and some fifteen hundred other people of the nonofficial caste in ten years his knowledge should be doubled and at the end of twenty he knows or knows something about every englishman in the empire and may travel anywhere and everywhere without paying hotelbills  globetrotters who expect entertainment as a right have even within my memory blunted this openheartedness but none the less today if you belong to the inner circle and are neither a bear nor a black sheep all houses are open to you and our small world is very very kind and helpful  rickett of kamartha stayed with polder of kumaon some fifteen years ago he meant to stay two nights but was knocked down by rheumatic fever and for six weeks disorganized polders establishment stopped polders work and nearly died in polders bedroom polder behaves as though he had been placed under eternal obligation by rickett and yearly sends the little ricketts a box of presents and toys it is the same everywhere the men who do not take the trouble to conceal from you their opinion that you are an incompetent ass and the women who blacken your character and misunderstand your wifes amusements will work themselves to the bone in your behalf if you fall sick or into serious trouble  heatherlegh the doctor kept in addition to his regular practice a hospital on his private accountan arrangement of loose boxes for incurables his friend called itbut it was really a sort of fittingup shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather the weather in india is often sultry and since the tale of bricks is always a fixed quantity and the only liberty allowed is permission to work overtime and get no thanks men occasionally break down and become as mixed as the metaphors in this sentence  heatherlegh is the dearest doctor that ever was and his invariable prescription to all his patients is lie low go slow and keep cool he says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this world justifies he maintains that overwork slew pansay who died under his hands about three years ago he has of course the right to speak authoritatively and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack in pansays head and a little bit of the dark world came through and pressed him to death pansay went off the handle says heatherlegh after the stimulus of long leave at home he may or he may not have behaved like a blackguard to mrs keithwessington my notion is that the work of the katabundi settlement ran him off his legs and that he took to brooding and making much of an ordinary p  o flirtation he certainly was engaged to miss mannering and she certainly broke off the engagement then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about ghosts developed overwork started his illness kept it alight and killed him poor devil write him off to the systemone man to take the work of two and a half men  i do not believe this i used to sit up with pansay sometimes when heatherlegh was called out to patients and i happened to be within claim the man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low even voice the procession that was always passing at the bottom of his bed he had a sick mans command of language when he recovered i suggested that he should write out the whole affair from beginning to end knowing that ink might assist him to ease his mind when little boys have learned a new bad word they are never happy till they have chalked it up on a door and this also is literature  he was in a high fever while he was writing and the bloodandthunder magazine diction he adopted did not calm him two months afterward he was reported fit for duty but in spite of the fact that he was urgently needed to help an undermanned commission stagger through a deficit he preferred to die vowing at the last that he was hagridden i got his manuscript before he died and this is his version of the affair dated 1885  my doctor tells me that i need rest and change of air it is not improbable that i shall get both ere longrest that neither the redcoated messenger nor the midday gun can break and change of air far beyond that which any homewardbound steamer can give me in the meantime i am resolved to stay where i am and in flat defiance of my doctors orders to take all the world into my confidence you shall learn for yourselves the precise nature of my malady and shall too judge for yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth was ever so tormented as i  speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere the dropbolts are drawn my story wild and hideously improbable as it may appear demands at least attention that it will ever receive credence i utterly disbelieve two months ago i should have scouted as mad or drunk the man who had dared tell me the like two months ago i was the happiest man in india today from peshawur to the sea there is no one more wretched my doctor and i are the only two who know this his explanation is that my brain digestion and eyesight are all slightly affected giving rise to my frequent and persistent delusions delusions indeed i call him a fool but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile the same bland professional manner the same neatly trimmed red whiskers till i begin to suspect that i am an ungrateful eviltempered invalid but you shall judge for yourselves  three years ago it was my fortunemy great misfortuneto sail from gravesend to bombay on return from long leave with one agnes keithwessington wife of an officer on the bombay side it does not in the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was be content with the knowledge that ere the voyage had ended both she and i were desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another heaven knows that i can make the admission now without one particle of vanity in matters of this sort there is always one who gives and another who accepts from the first day of our illomened attachment i was conscious that agness passion was a stronger a more dominant andif i may use the expressiona purer sentiment than mine whether she recognized the fact then i do not know afterward it was bitterly plain to both of as  arrived at bombay in the spring of the year we went our respective ways to meet no more for the next three or four months when my leave and her love took us both to simla there we spent the season together and there my fire of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the closing year i attempt no excuse i make no apology mrs wessington had given up much for my sake and was prepared to give up all from my own lips in august 1882 she learned that i was sick of her presence tired of her company and weary of the sound of her voice ninetynine women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as i wearied of them seventyfive of that number would have promptly avenged themselves by active and obtrusive flirtation with other men mrs wessington was the hundredth on her neither my openly expressed aversion nor the cutting brutalities with which i garnished our interviews had the least effect  jack darling was her one eternal cuckoo cry im sure its all a mistakea hideous mistake and well be good friends again some day please forgive me jack dear  i was the offender and i knew it that knowledge transformed my pity into passive endurance and eventually into blind hatethe same instinct i suppose which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider he has but half killed and with this hate in my bosom the season of 1882 came to an end  next year we met again at simlashe with her monotonous face and timid attempts at reconciliation and i with loathing of her in every fibre of my frame several times i could not avoid meeting her alone and on each occasion her words were identically the same still the unreasoning wail that it was all a mistake and still the hope of eventually making friends i might have seen had i cared to look that that hope only was keeping her alive she grew more wan and thin month by month you will agree with me at least that such conduct would have driven any one to despair it was uncalled for childish unwomanly i maintain that she was much to blame and again sometimes in the black feverstricken nightwatches i have begun to think that i might have been a little kinder to her but that really is a delusion i could not have continued pretending to love her when i didnt could i it would have been unfair to us both  last year we met againon the same terms as before the same weary appeals and the same curt answers from my lips at least i would make her see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the old relationship as the season wore on we fell apartthat is to say she found it difficult to meet me for i had other and more absorbing interests to attend to when i think it over quietly in my sickroom the season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade were fantastically intermingledmy courtship of little kitty mannering my hopes doubts and fears our long rides together my trembling avowal of attachment her reply and now and again a vision of a white face flitting by in the rickshaw with the black and white liveries i once watched for so earnestly the wave of mrs wessingtons gloved hand and when she met me alone which was but seldom the irksome monotony of her appeal i loved kitty mannering honestly heartily loved her and with my love for her grew my hatred for agnes in august kitty and i were engaged the next day i met those accursed magpie jhampanies at the back of jakko and moved by some passing sentiment of pity stopped to tell mrs wessington everything she knew it already  so i hear youre engaged jack dear then without a moments pauseim sure its all a mistakea hideous mistake we shall be as good friends some day jack as we ever were  my answer might have made even a man wince it cut the dying woman before me like the blow of a whip please forgive me jack i didnt mean to make you angry but its true its true  and mrs wessington broke down completely i turned away and left her to finish her journey in peace feeling but only for a moment or two that i had been an unutterably mean hound i looked back and saw that she had turned her rickshaw with the idea i suppose of overtaking me  the scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory the rainswept sky we were at the end of the wet weather the sodden dingy pines the muddy road and the black powderriven cliffs formed a gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of the jhampanies the yellowpaneled rickshaw and mrs wessingtons downbowed golden head stood out clearly she was holding her handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning back exhausted against the rickshaw cushions i turned my horse up a bypath near the sanjowlie reservoir and literally ran away once i fancied i heard a faint call of jack this may have been imagination i never stopped to verify it ten minutes later i came across kitty on horseback and in the delight of a long ride with her forgot all about the interview  a week later mrs wessington died and the inexpressible burden of her existence was removed from my life i went plainsward perfectly happy before three months were over i had forgotten all about her except that at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me unpleasantly of our bygone relationship by january i had disinterred what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered belongings and had burned it at the beginning of april of this year 1885 i was at simlasemideserted simlaonce more and was deep in lovers talks and walks with kitty it was decided that we should be married at the end of june you will understand therefore that loving kitty as i did i am not saying too much when i pronounce myself to have been at that time the happiest man in india  fourteen delightful days passed almost before i noticed their flight then aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals circumstanced as we were i pointed out to kitty that an engagement ring was the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl and that she must forthwith come to hamiltons to be measured for one up to that moment i give you my word we had completely forgotten so trivial a matter to hamiltons we accordingly went on the 15th of april 1885 remember thatwhatever my doctor may say to the contraryi was then in perfect health enjoying a wellbalanced mind and an absolutely tranquil spirit kitty and i entered hamiltons shop together and there regardless of the order of affairs i measured kitty for the ring in the presence of the amused assistant the ring was a sapphire with two diamonds we then rode out down the slope that leads to the combermere bridge and pelitis shop  while my waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale and kitty was laughing and chattering at my sidewhile all simla that is to say as much of it as had then come from the plains was grouped round the readingroom and pelitis verandai was aware that some one apparently at a vast distance was calling me by my christian name it struck me that i had heard the voice before but when and where i could not at once determine in the short space it took to cover the road between the path from hamiltons shop and the first plank of the combermere bridge i had thought over half a dozen people who might have committed such a solecism and had eventually decided that it must have been singing in my ears immediately opposite pelitis shop my eye was arrested by the sight of four jhampanies in magpie livery pulling a yellowpaneled cheap bazar rickshaw in a moment my mind flew back to the previous season and mrs wessington with a sense of irritation and disgust was it not enough that the woman was dead and done with without her black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the days happiness whoever employed them now i thought i would call upon and ask as a personal favor to change her jhampanies livery i would hire the men myself and if necessary buy their coats from off their backs it is impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable memories their presence evoked  kitty i cried there are poor mrs wessingtons jhampanies turned up again i wonder who has them now  kitty had known mrs wessington slightly last season and had always been interested in the sickly woman  what where she asked i cant see them anywhere  even as she spoke her horse swerving from a laden mule threw himself directly in front of the advancing rickshaw i had scarcely time to utter a word of warning when to my unutterable horror horse and rider passed through men and carriage as if they had been thin air  whats the matter cried kitty what made you call out so foolishly jack if i am engaged i dont want all creation to know about it there was lots of space between the mule and the veranda and if you think i cant ridethere  whereupon wilful kitty set off her dainty little head in the air at a handgallop in the direction of the bandstand fully expecting as she herself afterward told me that i should follow her what was the matter nothing indeed either that i was mad or drunk or that simla was haunted with devils i reined in my impatient cob and turned round the rickshaw had turned too and now stood immediately facing me near the left railing of the combermere bridge  jack jack darling there was no mistake about the words this time they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear its some hideous mistake im sure please forgive me jack and lets be friends again  the rickshawhood had fallen back and inside as i hope and pray daily for the death i dread by night sat mrs keithwessington handkerchief in hand and golden head bowed on her breast  how long i stared motionless i do not know finally i was aroused by my syce taking the walers bridle and asking whether i was ill from the horrible to the commonplace is but a step i tumbled off my horse and dashed half fainting into pelitis for a glass of cherrybrandy there two or three couples were gathered round the coffeetables discussing the gossip of the day their trivialities were more comforting to me just then than the consolations of religion could have been i plunged into the midst of the conversation at once chatted laughed and jested with a face when i caught a glimpse of it in a mirror as white and drawn as that of a corpse three or four men noticed my condition and evidently setting it down to the results of overmany pegs charitably endeavored to draw me apart from the rest of the loungers but i refused to be led away i wanted the company of my kindas a child rushes into the midst of the dinnerparty after a fright in the dark i must have talked for about ten minutes or so though it seemed an eternity to me when i heard kittys clear voice outside inquiring for me in another minute she had entered the shop prepared to roundly upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties something in my face stopped her  why jack she cried what have you been doing what has happened are you ill thus driven into a direct lie i said that the sun had been a little too much for me it was close upon five oclock of a cloudy april afternoon and the sun had been hidden all day i saw my mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth attempted to recover it blundered hopelessly and followed kitty in a regal rage out of doors amid the smiles of my acquaintances i made some excuse i have forgotten what on the score of my feeling faint and cantered away to my hotel leaving kitty to finish the ride by herself  in my room i sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter here was i theobald jack pansay a welleducated bengal civilian in the year of grace 1885 presumably sane certainly healthy driven in terror from my sweethearts side by the apparition of a woman who had been dead and buried eight months ago these were facts that i could not blink nothing was further from my thought than any memory of mrs wessington when kitty and i left hamiltons shop nothing was more utterly commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite pelitis it was broad daylight the road was full of people and yet here look you in defiance of every law of probability in direct outrage of natures ordinance there had appeared to me a face from the grave  kittys arab had gone through the rickshaw so that my first hope that some woman marvelously like mrs wessington had hired the carriage and the coolies with their old livery was lost again and again i went round this treadmill of thought and again and again gave up baffled and in despair the voice was as inexplicable as the apparition i had originally some wild notion of confiding it all to kitty of begging her to marry me at once and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the rickshaw after all i argued the presence of the rickshaw is in itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral illusion one may see ghosts of men and women but surely never of coolies and carriages the whole thing is absurd fancy the ghost of a hillman  next morning i sent a penitent note to kitty imploring her to overlook my strange conduct of the previous afternoon my divinity was still very wroth and a personal apology was necessary i explained with a fluency born of nightlong pondering over a falsehood that i had been attacked with a sudden palpitation of the heartthe result of indigestion this eminently practical solution had its effect and kitty and i rode out that afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us  nothing would please her save a canter round jakko with my nerves still unstrung from the previous night i feebly protested against the notion suggesting observatory hill jutogh the boileaugunge roadanything rather than the jakko round kitty was angry and a little hurt so i yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding and we set out together toward chota simla we walked a greater part of the way and according to our custom cantered from a mile or so below the convent to the stretch of level road by the sanjowlie reservoir the wretched horses appeared to fly and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we neared the crest of the ascent my mind had been full of mrs wessington all the afternoon and every inch of the jakko road bore witness to our oldtime walks and talks the bowlders were full of it the pines sang it aloud overhead the rainfed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen over the shameful story and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity aloud  as a fitting climax in the middle of the level men call the ladies mile the horror was awaiting me no other rickshaw was in sightonly the four black and white jhampanies the yellowpaneled carriage and the golden head of the woman withinall apparently just as i had left them eight months and one fortnight ago for an instant i fancied that kitty must see what i sawwe were so marvelously sympathetic in all things her next words undeceived menot a soul in sight come along jack and ill race you to the reservoir buildings her wiry little arab was off like a bird my waler following close behind and in this order we dashed under the cliffs half a minute brought us within fifty yards of the rickshaw i pulled my waler and fell back a little the rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road and once more the arab passed through it my horse following jack jack dear please forgive me rang with a wail in my ears and after an intervalits all a mistake a hideous mistake  i spurred my horse like a man possessed when i turned my head at the reservoir works the black and white liveries were still waitingpatiently waitingunder the grey hillside and the wind brought me a mocking echo of the words i had just heard kitty bantered me a good deal on my silence throughout the remainder of the ride i had been talking up till then wildly and at random to save my life i could not speak afterward naturally and from sanjowlie to the church wisely held my tongue  i was to dine with the mannerings that night and had barely time to canter home to dress on the road to elysium hill i overheard two men talking together in the duskits a curious thing said one how completely all trace of it disappeared you know my wife was insanely fond of the woman never could see anything in her myself and wanted me to pick up her old rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for love or money morbid sort of fancy i call it but ive got to do what the memsahib tells me would you believe that the man she hired it from tells me that all four of the menthey were brothersdied of cholera on the way to hardwar poor devils and the rickshaw has been broken up by the man himself told me he never used a dead memsahibs rickshaw spoiled his luck queer notion wasnt it fancy poor little mrs wessington spoiling any ones luck except her own i laughed aloud at this point and my laugh jarred on me as i uttered it so there were ghosts of rickshaws after all and ghostly employments in the other world how much did mrs wessington give her men what were their hours where did they go  and for visible answer to my last question i saw the infernal thing blocking my path in the twilight the dead travel fast and by short cuts unknown to ordinary coolies i laughed aloud a second time and checked my laughter suddenly for i was afraid i was going mad mad to a certain extent i must have been for i recollect that i reined in my horse at the head of the rickshaw and politely wished mrs wessington goodevening her answer was one i knew only too well i listened to the end and replied that i had heard it all before but should be delighted if she had anything further to say some malignant devil stronger than i must have entered into me that evening for i have a dim recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to the thing in front of me  mad as a hatter poor devilor drunk max try and get him to come home  surely that was not mrs wessingtons voice the two men had overheard me speaking to the empty air and had returned to look after me they were very kind and considerate and from their words evidently gathered that i was extremely drunk i thanked them confusedly and cantered away to my hotel there changed and arrived at the mannerings ten minutes late i pleaded the darkness of the night as an excuse was rebuked by kitty for my unloverlike tardiness and sat down  the conversation had already become general and under cover of it i was addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when i was aware that at the further end of the table a short redwhiskered man was describing with much embroidery his encounter with a mad unknown that evening  a few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident of half an hour ago in the middle of the story he looked round for applause as professional storytellers do caught my eye and straightway collapsed there was a moments awkward silence and the redwhiskered man muttered something to the effect that he had forgotten the rest thereby sacrificing a reputation as a good storyteller which he had built up for six seasons past i blessed him from the bottom of my heart andwent on with my fish  in the fulness of time that dinner came to an end and with genuine regret i tore myself away from kittyas certain as i was of my own existence that it would be waiting for me outside the door the redwhiskered man who had been introduced to me as doctor heatherlegh of simla volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay together i accepted his offer with gratitude  my instinct had not deceived me it lay in readiness in the mall and in what seemed devilish mockery of our ways with a lighted headlamp the redwhiskered man went to the point at once in a manner that showed he had been thinking over it all dinner time  i say pansay what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on the elysium road the suddenness of the question wrenched an answer from me before i was aware  that said i pointing to it  that may be either dt or eyes for aught i know now you dont liquor i saw as much at dinner so it cant be dt theres nothing whatever where youre pointing though youre sweating and trembling with fright like a scared pony therefore i conclude that its eyes and i ought to understand all about them come along home with me im on the blessington lower road  to my intense delight the rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept about twenty yards aheadand this too whether we walked trotted or cantered in the course of that long night ride i had told my companion almost as much as i have told you here  well youve spoiled one of the best tales ive ever laid tongue to said he but ill forgive you for the sake of what youve gone through now come home and do what i tell you and when ive cured you young man let this be a lesson to you to steer clear of women and indigestible food till the day of your death  the rickshaw kept steady in front and my redwhiskered friend seemed to derive great pleasure from my account of its exact whereabouts  eyes pansayall eyes brain and stomach and the greatest of these three is stomach youve too much conceited brain too little stomach and thoroughly unhealthy eyes get your stomach straight and the rest follows and all thats french for a liver pill ill take sole medical charge of you from this hour for youre too interesting a phenomenon to be passed over  by this time we were deep in the shadow of the blessington lower road and the rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pineclad overhanging shale cliff instinctively i halted too giving my reason heatherlegh rapped out an oath  now if you think im going to spend a cold night on the hillside for the sake of a stomachcumbraincumeye illusion  lord ha mercy whats that  there was a muffled report a blinding smother of dust just in front of us a crack the noise of rent boughs and about ten yards of the cliffsidepines undergrowth and allslid down into the road below completely blocking it up the uprooted trees swayed and tottered for a moment like drunken giants in the gloom and then fell prone among their fellows with a thunderous crash our two horses stood motionless and sweating with fear as soon as the rattle of falling earth and stone had subsided my companion mutteredman if wed gone forward we should have been ten feet deep in our graves by now there are more things in heaven and earth  come home pansay and thank god i want a peg badly  we retraced our way over the church ridge and i arrived at dr heatherleghs house shortly after midnight  his attempts toward my cure commenced almost immediately and for a week i never left his sight many a time in the course of that week did i bless the goodfortune which had thrown me in contact with simlas best and kindest doctor day by day my spirits grew lighter and more equable day by day too i became more and more inclined to fall in with heatherleghs spectral illusion theory implicating eyes brain and stomach i wrote to kitty telling her that a slight sprain caused by a fall from my horse kept me indoors for a few days and that i should be recovered before she had time to regret my absence  heatherleghs treatment was simple to a degree it consisted of liver pills coldwater baths and strong exercise taken in the dusk or at early dawnfor as he sagely observeda man with a sprained ankle doesnt walk a dozen miles a day and your young woman might be wondering if she saw you  at the end of the week after much examination of pupil and pulse and strict injunctions as to diet and pedestrianism heatherlegh dismissed me as brusquely as he had taken charge of me here is his parting benedictionman i certify to your mental cure and thats as much as to say ive cured most of your bodily ailments now get your traps out of this as soon as you can and be off to make love to miss kitty  i was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness he cut me short  dont think i did this because i like you i gather that youve behaved like a blackguard all through but all the same youre a phenomenon and as queer a phenomenon as you are a blackguard nochecking me a second timenot a rupee please go out and see if you can find the eyesbrainandstomach business again ill give you a lakh for each time you see it  half an hour later i was in the mannerings drawingroom with kittydrunk with the intoxication of present happiness and the foreknowledge that i should never more be troubled with its hideous presence strong in the sense of my newfound security i proposed a ride at once and by preference a canter round jakko  never had i felt so well so overladen with vitality and mere animal spirits as i did on the afternoon of the 30th of april kitty was delighted at the change in my appearance and complimented me on it in her delightfully frank and outspoken manner we left the mannerings house together laughing and talking and cantered along the chota simla road as of old  i was in haste to reach the sanjowlie reservoir and there make my assurance doubly sure the horses did their best but seemed all too slow to my impatient mind kitty was astonished at my boisterousness why jack she cried at last you are behaving like a child what are you doing  we were just below the convent and from sheer wantonness i was making my waler plunge and curvet across the road as i tickled it with the loop of my ridingwhip  doing i answered nothing dear thats just it if youd been doing nothing for a week except lie up youd be as riotous as i     singing and murmuring in your feastful mirth      joying to feel yourself alive    lord over nature lord of the visible earth      lord of the senses five  my quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had rounded the corner above the convent and a few yards further on could see across to sanjowlie in the centre of the level road stood the black and white liveries the yellowpaneled rickshaw and mrs keithwessington i pulled up looked rubbed my eyes and i believe must have said something the next thing i knew was that i was lying face downward on the road with kitty kneeling above me in tears  has it gone child i gasped kitty only wept more bitterly  has what gone jack dear what does it all mean there must be a mistake somewhere jack a hideous mistake her last words brought me to my feetmadraving for the time being  yes there is a mistake somewhere i repeated a hideous mistake come and look at it  i have an indistinct idea that i dragged kitty by the wrist along the road up to where it stood and implored her for pitys sake to speak to it to tell it that we were betrothed that neither death nor hell could break the tie between us and kitty only knows how much more to the same effect now and again i appealed passionately to the terror in the rickshaw to bear witness to all i had said and to release me from a torture that was killing me as i talked i suppose i must have told kitty of my old relations with mrs wessington for i saw her listen intently with white face and blazing eyes  thank you mr pansay she said thats quite enough syce ghora lao  the syces impassive as orientals always are had come up with the recaptured horses and as kitty sprang into her saddle i caught hold of the bridle entreating her to hear me out and forgive my answer was the cut of her ridingwhip across my face from mouth to eye and a word or two of farewell that even now i cannot write down so i judged and judged rightly that kitty knew all and i staggered back to the side of the rickshaw my face was cut and bleeding and the blow of the ridingwhip had raised a livid blue wheal on it i had no selfrespect just then heatherlegh who must have been following kitty and me at a distance cantered up  doctor i said pointing to my face heres miss mannerings signature to my order of dismissal and  ill thank you for that lakh as soon as convenient  heatherleghs face even in my abject misery moved me to laughter  ill stake my professional reputationhe began dont be a fool i whispered ive lost my lifes happiness and youd better take me home  as i spoke the rickshaw was gone then i lost all knowledge of what was passing the crest of jakko seemed to heave and roll like the crest of a cloud and fall in upon me  seven days later on the 7th of may that is to say i was aware that i was lying in heatherleghs room as weak as a little child heatherlegh was watching me intently from behind the papers on his writingtable his first words were not encouraging but i was too far spent to be much moved by them  heres miss kitty has sent back your letters you corresponded a good deal you young people heres a packet that looks like a ring and a cheerful sort of a note from mannering papa which ive taken the liberty of reading and burning the old gentlemans not pleased with you  and kitty i asked dully  rather more drawn than her father from what she says by the same token you must have been letting out any number of queer reminiscences just before i met you says that a man who would have behaved to a woman as you did to mrs wessington ought to kill himself out of sheer pity for his kind shes a hotheaded little virago your mash will have it too that you were suffering from d t when that row on the jakko road turned up says shell die before she ever speaks to you again  i groaned and turned over on the other side  now youve got your choice my friend this engagement has to be broken off and the mannerings dont want to be too hard on you was it broken through d t or epileptic fits sorry i cant offer you a better exchange unless youd prefer hereditary insanity say the word and ill tell em its fits all simla knows about that scene on the ladies mile come ill give you five minutes to think over it  during those five minutes i believe that i explored thoroughly the lowest circles of the inferno which it is permitted man to tread on earth and at the same time i myself was watching myself faltering through the dark labyrinths of doubt misery and utter despair i wondered as heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered which dreadful alternative i should adopt presently i heard myself answering in a voice that i hardly recognized  theyre confoundedly particular about morality in these parts give em fits heatherlegh and my love now let me sleep a bit longer  then my two selves joined and it was only i half crazed devildriven i that tossed in my bed tracing step by step the history of the past month  but i am in simla i kept repeating to myself i jack pansay am in simla and there are no ghosts here its unreasonable of that woman to pretend there are why couldnt agnes have left me alone i never did her any harm it might just as well have been me as agnes only id never have come back on purpose to kill her why cant i be left aloneleft alone and happy  it was high noon when i first awoke and the sun was low in the sky before i sleptslept as the tortured criminal sleeps on his rack too worn to feel further pain  next day i could not leave my bed heatherlegh told me in the morning that he had received an answer from mr mannering and that thanks to his heatherleghs friendly offices the story of my affliction had traveled through the length and breadth of simla where i was on all sides much pitied  and thats rather more than you deserve he concluded pleasantly though the lord knows youve been going through a pretty severe mill never mind well cure you yet you perverse phenomenon  i declined firmly to be cured youve been much too good to me already old man said i but i dont think i need trouble you further  in my heart i knew that nothing heatherlegh could do would lighten the burden that had been laid upon me  with that knowledge came also a sense of hopeless impotent rebellion against the unreasonableness of it all there were scores of men no better than i whose punishments had at least been reserved for another world and i felt that it was bitterly cruelly unfair that i alone should have been singled out for so hideous a fate this mood would in time give place to another where it seemed that the rickshaw and i were the only realities in a world of shadows that kitty was a ghost that mannering heatherlegh and all the other men and women i knew were all ghosts and the great grey hills themselves but vain shadows devised to torture me from mood to mood i tossed backward and forward for seven weary days my body growing daily stronger and stronger until the bedroom lookingglass told me that i had returned to everyday life and was as other men once more curiously enough my face showed no signs of the struggle i had gone through it was pale indeed but as expressionless and commonplace as ever i had expected some permanent alterationvisible evidence of the disease that was eating me away i found nothing  on the 15th of may i left heatherleghs house at eleven oclock in the morning and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the club there i found that every man knew my story as told by heatherlegh and was in clumsy fashion abnormally kind and attentive nevertheless i recognized that for the rest of my natural life i should be among but not of my fellows and i envied very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on the mall below i lunched at the club and at four oclock wandered aimlessly down the mall in the vague hope of meeting kitty close to the bandstand the black and white liveries joined me and i heard mrs wessingtons old appeal at my side i had been expecting this ever since i came out and was only surprised at her delay the phantom rickshaw and i went side by side along the chota simla road in silence close to the bazar kitty and a man on horseback overtook and passed us for any sign she gave i might have been a dog in the road she did not even pay me the compliment of quickening her pace though the rainy afternoon had served for an excuse  so kitty and her companion and i and my ghostly lightolove crept round jakko in couples the road was streaming with water the pines dripped like roofpipes on the rocks below and the air was full of fine driving rain two or three times i found myself saying to myself almost aloud im jack pansay on leave at simlaat simla everyday ordinary simla i mustnt forget thati mustnt forget that then i would try to recollect some of the gossip i had heard at the club the prices of soandsos horsesanything in fact that related to the workaday angloindian world i knew so well i even repeated the multiplication table rapidly to myself to make quite sure that i was not taking leave of my senses it gave me much comfort and must have prevented my hearing mrs wessington for a time  once more i wearily climbed the convent slope and entered the level road here kitty and the man started off at a canter and i was left alone with mrs wessington agnes said i will you put back your hood and tell me what it all means the hood dropped noiselessly and i was face to face with my dead and buried mistress she was wearing the dress in which i had last seen her alive carried the same tiny handkerchief in her right hand and the same cardcase in her left a woman eight months dead with a cardcase i had to pin myself down to the multiplicationtable and to set both hands on the stone parapet of the road to assure myself that that at least was real  agnes i repeated for pitys sake tell me what it all means mrs wessington leaned forward with that odd quick turn of the head i used to know so well and spoke  if my story had not already so madly overleaped the bounds of all human belief i should apologize to you now as i know that no oneno not even kitty for whom it is written as some sort of justification of my conductwill believe me i will go on mrs wessington spoke and i walked with her from the sanjowlie road to the turning below the commanderinchiefs house as i might walk by the side of any living womans rickshaw deep in conversation the second and most tormenting of my moods of sickness had suddenly laid hold upon me and like the prince in tennysons poem i seemed to move amid a world of ghosts there had been a gardenparty at the commanderinchiefs and we two joined the crowd of homewardbound folk as i saw them then it seemed that they were the shadowsimpalpable fantastic shadowsthat divided for mrs wessingtons rickshaw to pass through what we said during the course of that weird interview i cannotindeed i dare nottell heatherleghs comment would have been a short laugh and a remark that i had been mashing a braineyeandstomach chimera it was a ghastly and yet in some indefinable way a marvelously dear experience could it be possible i wondered that i was in this life to woo a second time the woman i had killed by my own neglect and cruelty  i met kitty on the homeward roada shadow among shadows  if i were to describe all the incidents of the next fortnight in their order my story would never come to an end and your patience would be exhausted morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly rickshaw and i used to wander through simla together wherever i went there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company to and from my hotel at the theatre i found them amid the crowd of yelling jhampanies outside the club veranda after a long evening of whist at the birthday ball waiting patiently for my reappearance and in broad daylight when i went calling save that it cast no shadow the rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and iron more than once indeed i have had to check myself from warning some hardriding friend against cantering over it more than once i have walked down the mall deep in conversation with mrs wessington to the unspeakable amazement of the passersby  before i had been out and about a week i learned that the fit theory had been discarded in favor of insanity however i made no change in my mode of life i called rode and dined out as freely as ever i had a passion for the society of my kind which i had never felt before i hungered to be among the realities of life and at the same time i felt vaguely unhappy when i had been separated too long from my ghostly companion it would be almost impossible to describe my varying moods from the 15th of may up to today  the presence of the rickshaw filled me by turns with horror blind fear a dim sort of pleasure and utter despair i dared not leave simla and i knew that my stay there was killing me i knew moreover that it was my destiny to die slowly and a little every day my only anxiety was to get the penance over as quietly as might be alternately i hungered for a sight of kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations with my successorto speak more accurately my successorswith amused interest she was as much out of my life as i was out of hers by day i wandered with mrs wessington almost content by night i implored heaven to let me return to the world as i used to know it above all these varying moods lay the sensation of dull numbing wonder that the seen and the unseen should mingle so strangely on this earth to hound one poor soul to its grave                                            august 27heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on me and only yesterday told me that i ought to send in an application for sick leave an application to escape the company of a phantom a request that the government would graciously permit me to get rid of five ghosts and an airy rickshaw by going to england heatherleghs proposition moved me to almost hysterical laughter i told him that i should await the end quietly at simla and i am sure that the end is not far off believe me that i dread its advent more than any word can say and i torture myself nightly with a thousand speculations as to the manner of my death  shall i die in my bed decently and as an english gentleman should die or in one last walk on the mall will my soul be wrenched from me to take its place forever and ever by the side of that ghastly phantasm shall i return to my old lost allegiance in the next world or shall i meet agnes loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity shall we two hover over the scene of our lives till the end of time as the day of my death draws nearer the intense horror that all living flesh feels toward escaped spirits from beyond the grave grows more and more powerful it is an awful thing to go down quick among the dead with scarcely onehalf of your life completed it is a thousand times more awful to wait as i do in your midst for i know not what unimaginable terror pity me at least on the score of my delusion for i know you will never believe what i have written here yet as surely as ever a man was done to death by the powers of darkness i am that man  in justice too pity her for as surely as ever woman was killed by man i killed mrs wessington and the last portion of my punishment is even now upon me    on the strength of a likeness  if your mirror be broken look into still water but have a care that you do not fall inhindu proverb  next to a requited attachment one of the most convenient things that a young man can carry about with him at the beginning of his career is an unrequited attachment it makes him feel important and businesslike and blasé and cynical and whenever he has a touch of fever or suffers from want of exercise he can mourn over his lost love and be very happy in a tender twilight fashion  hannasydes affair of the heart had been a godsend to him it was four years old and the girl had long since given up thinking of it she had married and had many cares of her own in the beginning she had told hannasyde that while she could never be anything more than a sister to him she would always take the deepest interest in his welfare this startlingly new and original remark gave hannasyde something to think over for two years and his own vanity filled in the other twentyfour months hannasyde was quite different from phil garron but none the less had several points in common with that far too lucky man  he kept his unrequited attachment by him as men keep a wellsmoked pipefor comforts sake and because it had grown dear in the using it brought him happily through one simla season hannasyde was not lovely there was a crudity in his manners and a roughness in the way in which he helped a lady on to her horse that did not attract the other sex to him even if he had cast about for their favor which he did not he kept his wounded heart all to himself for a while  then trouble came to him all who go to simla know the slope from the telegraph to the public works office hannasyde was loafing up the hill one september morning between calling hours when a rickshaw came down in a hurry and in the rickshaw sat the living breathing image of the girl who had made him so happily unhappy hannasyde leaned against the railings and gasped he wanted to run downhill after the rickshaw but that was impossible so he went forward with most of his blood in his temples it was impossible for many reasons that the woman in the rickshaw could be the girl he had known she was he discovered later the wife of a man from dindigul or coimbatore or some outoftheway place and she had come up to simla early in the season for the good of her health she was going back to dindigul or wherever it was at the end of the season and in all likelihood would never return to simla again her proper hillstation being ootacamund that night hannasyde raw and savage from the raking up of all old feelings took counsel with himself for one measured hour what he decided upon was this and you must decide for yourself how much genuine affection for the old love and how much a very natural inclination to go abroad and enjoy himself affected the decision mrs landyshaggert would never in all human likelihood cross his path again so whatever he did didnt much matter she was marvelously like the girl who took a deep interest and the rest of the formula all things considered it would be pleasant to make the acquaintance of mrs landyshaggert and for a little timeonly a very little timeto make believe that he was with alice chisane again every one is more or less mad on one point hannasydes particular monomania was his old love alice chisane  he made it his business to get introduced to mrs haggert and the introduction prospered he also made it his business to see as much as he could of that lady when a man is in earnest as to interviews the facilities which simla offers are startling there are gardenparties and tennisparties and picnics and luncheons at annandale and riflematches and dinners and balls besides rides and walks which are matters of private arrangement hannasyde had started with the intention of seeing a likeness and he ended by doing much more he wanted to be deceived he meant to be deceived and he deceived himself very thoroughly not only were the face and figure the face and figure of alice chisane but the voice and lower tones were exactly the same and so were the turns of speech and the little mannerisms that every woman has of gait and gesticulation were absolutely and identically the same the turn of the head was the same the tired look in the eyes at the end of a long walk was the same the stoopandwrench over the saddle to hold in a pulling horse was the same and once most marvelous of all mrs landyshaggert singing to herself in the next room while hannasyde was waiting to take her for a ride hummed note for note with a throaty quiver of the voice in the second line poor wandering one exactly as alice chisane had hummed it for hannasyde in the dusk of an english drawingroom in the actual woman herselfin the soul of herthere was not the least likeness she and alice chisane being cast in different moulds but all that hannasyde wanted to know and see and think about was this maddening and perplexing likeness of face and voice and manner he was bent on making a fool of himself that way and he was in no sort disappointed  open and obvious devotion from any sort of man is always pleasant to any sort of woman but mrs landyshaggert being a woman of the world could make nothing of hannasydes admiration  he would take any amount of troublehe was a selfish man habituallyto meet and forestall if possible her wishes anything she told him to do was law and he was there could be no doubting it fond of her company so long as she talked to him and kept on talking about trivialities but when she launched into expression of her personal views and her wrongs those small social differences that make the spice of simla life hannasyde was neither pleased nor interested he didnt want to know anything about mrs landyshaggert or her experiences in the pastshe had traveled nearly all over the world and could talk cleverlyhe wanted the likeness of alice chisane before his eyes and her voice in his ears anything outside that reminding him of another personality jarred and he showed that it did  under the new post office one evening mrs landyshaggert turned on him and spoke her mind shortly and without warning mr hannasyde said she will you be good enough to explain why you have appointed yourself my special cavalier servente i dont understand it but i am perfectly certain somehow or other that you dont care the least little bit in the world for me this seems to support by the way the theory that no man can act or tell lies to a woman without being found out hannasyde was taken off his guard his defence never was a strong one because he was always thinking of himself and he blurted out before he knew what he was saying this inexpedient answer no more i do  the queerness of the situation and the reply made mrs landyshaggert laugh then it all came out and at the end of hannasydes lucid explanation mrs haggert said with the least little touch of scorn in her voice so im to act as the layfigure for you to hang the rags of your tattered affections on am i  hannasyde didnt see what answer was required and he devoted himself generally and vaguely to the praise of alice chisane which was unsatisfactory now it is to be thoroughly made clear that mrs haggert had not the shadow of a ghost of an interest in hannasyde only  only no woman likes being made love through instead of tospecially on behalf of a musty divinity of four years standing  hannasyde did not see that he had made any very particular exhibition of himself he was glad to find a sympathetic soul in the arid wastes of simla  when the season ended hannasyde went down to his own place and mrs haggert to hers it was like making love to a ghost said hannasyde to himself and it doesnt matter and now ill get to my work but he found himself thinking steadily of the haggertchisane ghost and he could not be certain whether it was haggert or chisane that made up the greater part of the pretty phantom                                            he got understanding a month later  a peculiar point of this peculiar country is the way in which a heartless government transfers men from one end of the empire to the other you can never be sure of getting rid of a friend or an enemy till he or she dies there was a case oncebut thats another story  haggerts department ordered him up from dindigul to the frontier at two days notice and he went through losing money at every step from dindigul to his station he dropped mrs haggert at lucknow to stay with some friends there to take part in a big ball at the chutter munzil and to come on when he had made the new home a little comfortable lucknow was hannasydes station and mrs haggert stayed a week there hannasyde went to meet her as the train came in he discovered what he had been thinking of for the past month the unwisdom of his conduct also struck him the lucknow week with two dances and an unlimited quantity of rides together clinched matters and hannasyde found himself pacing this circle of thoughthe adored alice chisane at least he had adored her and he admired mrs landyshaggert because she was like alice chisane but mrs landyshaggert was not in the least like alice chisane being a thousand times more adorable now alice chisane was the bride of another and so was mrs landyshaggert and a good and honest wife too therefore he hannasyde was  here he called himself several hard names and wished that he had been wise in the beginning  whether mrs landyshaggert saw what was going on in his mind she alone knows he seemed to take an unqualified interest in everything connected with herself as distinguished from the alicechisane likeness and he said one or two things which if alice chisane had been still betrothed to him could scarcely have been excused even on the grounds of the likeness but mrs haggert turned the remarks aside and spent a long time in making hannasyde see what a comfort and a pleasure she had been to him because of her strange resemblance to his old love hannasyde groaned in his saddle and said yes indeed and busied himself with preparations for her departure to the frontier feeling very small and miserable  the last day of her stay at lucknow came and hannasyde saw her off at the railway station she was very grateful for his kindness and the trouble he had taken and smiled pleasantly and sympathetically as one who knew the alicechisane reason of that kindness and hannasyde abused the coolies with the luggage and hustled the people on the platform and prayed that the roof might fall in and slay him  as the train went out slowly mrs landyshaggert leaned out of the window to say goodbyeon second thoughts au revoir mr hannasyde i go home in the spring and perhaps i may meet you in town  hannasyde shook hands and said very earnestly and adoringlyi hope to heaven i shall never see your face again  and mrs haggert understood    private learoyds story  and he told a talechronicles of gautama buddha  far from the

bein a strainger she wor a bit shy at fost but yove heeard mulvaney talk an yo may believe as he fairly bewitched t awd lass wal she let out at she wanted to tek rip away wi her to munsooree pahar then mulvaney changes his tune an axes her solemnlike if shed thought o t consequences o gettin two poor but honest soldiers sent t andamning islands mrs desussa began to cry so mulvaney turns round oppen t other tack and smooths her down allowin at rip ud be a vast better off in t hills than down i bengal and twas a pity he shouldnt go wheer he was so well beliked and soa he went on backin an

dogs often get lost you know and then they stray an he likes me and i like him as i niver liked a dog yet an i must hev him if i got him at t last minute i could carry him off to munsooree pahar and nobody would niver knaw  now an again mulvaney looked acrost at me an though i could mak nowt o what he was after i concluded to take his leead  well mum i says i never thowt to coom down to dogsteealin but if my comrade sees how it could be done to oblige a laady like yosen im nut t man to hod back tho its a bad business im thinkin an three hundred rupees is a poor setoff again t chance of them damning islands as mulvaney talks on  ill mek it three fifty says mrs desussa only let me hev t dog  so we let her persuade us an she teks rips measure theer an then an sent to hamiltons to order a silver collar again t time when he was to be her awn which was to be t day she set off for munsooree pahar  sitha mulvaney says i when we was outside youre niver goin to let her hev rip  an

shadin off brown into black as nateral as life if rip hed a fault it was too mich markin but it was straingely reglar an orthris settled himself to make a fostrate job on it when he got haud o t canteen sargints dog theer niver was sich a dog as thot for bad temper an it did nut get no better when his tail hed to be fettled an inch an a half shorter but they may talk o theer royal academies

says yell be careful marm whin ye tek him out hes disaccustomed to traveling by t railway an hell be sure to want his rale mistress an his friend learoyd so yell make allowance for his feelings at fost  she would do all thot an more for the dear good rip an she would nut oppen t basket till they were miles away for fear anybody should recognize him an we were real good and kind soldiermen we

rupees thots what i can scarcelins tell yo but we melted itwe melted it it was share an share alike for mulvaney said if learoyd got hold of mrs desussa first sure twas i that remimbered the sargints dog just in the nick av time an orthris was the artist av janius that made a work av art out av that ugly piece av illnature yet by way av a thankofferin that i was not led into felony by that wicked ould woman ill send a thrifle to father victor for the poor people hes always beggin for  but me an orthris he bein cockney an i bein pretty far north did nut see it i t saame way wed getten t brass

got lost so reglar an was lost for good at last    wressley of the foreign office     i closed and drew for my loves sake        that now is false to me    and i slew the riever of tarrant moss        and set dumeny free     and ever they give me praise and gold        and ever i moan my loss    for i struck the blow for my false loves sake        and not for the men of the moss  tarrant moss  one of the many curses of our life in india is the want of atmosphere in the painters sense there are no halftints worth noticing men stand out all crude and raw with nothing to tone them down and nothing to scale them against they do their work and grow to think that there is nothing but their work and nothing like their work and that they are the real pivots on which the administration turns here is an instance of this feeling a halfcaste clerk was ruling forms in a pay office he said to me do you know what would happen if i added or took away one single line on this sheet then with the air of a conspirator it would disorganize the whole of the treasury payments throughout the whole of the presidency circle think of that  if men had not this delusion as to the ultraimportance of their own particular employments i suppose that they would sit down and kill themselves but their weakness is wearisome particularly when the listener knows that he himself commits exactly the same sin  even the secretariat believes that it does good when it asks an overdriven executive officer to take a census of wheatweevils through a district of five thousand square miles  there was a man once in the foreign officea man who had grown middleaged in the department and was commonly said by irreverent juniors to be able to repeat aitchisons treaties and sunnuds backward in his sleep what he did with his stored knowledge only the secretary knew and he naturally would not publish the news abroad this mans name was wressley and it was the shibboleth in those days to saywressley knows more about the central indian states than any living man if you did not say this you were considered one of mean understanding  nowadays the man who says that he knows the ravel of the intertribal complications across the border is more of use but in wressleys time much attention was paid to the central indian states they were called foci and factors and all manner of imposing names  and here the curse of angloindian life fell heavily when wressley lifted up his voice and spoke about suchandsuch a succession to suchandsuch a throne the foreign office were silent and heads of departments repeated the last two or three words of wressleys sentences and tacked yes yes on to them and knew that they were assisting the empire to grapple with serious political contingencies in most big undertakings one or two men do the work while the rest sit near and talk till the ripe decorations begin to fall  wressley was the workingmember of the foreign office firm and to keep him up to his duties when he showed signs of flagging he was made much of by his superiors and told what a fine fellow he was he did not require coaxing because he was of tough build but what he received confirmed him in the belief that there was no one quite so absolutely and imperatively necessary to the stability of india as wressley of the foreign office there might be other good men but the known honored and trusted man among men was wressley of the foreign office we had a viceroy in those days who knew exactly when to gentle a fractious big man and to heartenup a collargalled little one and so keep all his team level he conveyed to wressley the impression which i have just set down and even tough men are apt to be disorganized by a viceroys praise there was a case oncebut that is another story  all india knew wressleys name and officeit was in thacker and spinks directorybut who he was personally or what he did or what his special merits were not fifty men knew or cared his work filled all his time and he found no leisure to cultivate acquaintances beyond those of dead rajput chiefs with ahir blots in their scutcheons wressley would have made a very good clerk in the heralds college had he not been a bengal civilian  upon a day between office and office great trouble came to wressleyoverwhelmed him knocked him down and left him gasping as though he had been a little schoolboy without reason against prudence and at a moments notice he fell in love with a frivolous goldenhaired girl who used to tear about simla mall on a high rough waler with a blue velvet jockeycap crammed over her eyes her name was vennertillie vennerand she was delightful she took wressleys heart at a handgallop and wressley found that it was not good for man to live alone even with half the foreign office records in his presses  then simla laughed for wressley in love was slightly ridiculous he did his best to interest the girl in himselfthat is to say his workand she after the manner of women did her best to appear interested in what behind his back she called mr wressleys wajahs for she lisped very prettily she did not understand one little thing about them but she acted as if she did men have married on that sort of error before now  providence however had care of wressley he was immensely struck with miss venners intelligence he would have been more impressed had he heard her private and confidential accounts of his calls he held peculiar notions as to the wooing of girls he said that the best work of a mans career should be laid reverently at their feet ruskin writes something like this somewhere i think but in ordinary life a few kisses are better and save time  about a month after he had lost his heart to miss venner and had been doing his work vilely in consequence the first idea of his native rule in central india struck wressley and filled him with joy it was as he sketched it a great thingthe work of his lifea really comprehensive survey of a most fascinating subjectto be written with all the special and laboriously acquired knowledge of wressley of the foreign officea gift fit for an empress  he told miss venner that he was going to take leave and hoped on his return to bring her a present worthy of her acceptance would she wait certainly she would wressley drew seventeen hundred rupees a month she would wait a year for that her mamma would help her to wait  so wressley took one years leave and all the available documents about a truckload that he could lay hands on and went down to central india with his notion hot in his head he began his book in the land he was writing of too much official correspondence had made him a frigid workman and he must have guessed that he needed the white light of local color on his palette this is a dangerous paint for amateurs to play with  heavens how that man worked he caught his rajahs analyzed his rajahs and traced them up into the mists of time and beyond with their queens and their concubines he dated and crossdated pedigreed and triplepedigreed compared noted connoted wove strung sorted selected inferred calendared and countercalendared for ten hours a day and because this sudden and new light of love was upon him he turned those dry bones of history and dirty records of misdeeds into things to weep or to laugh over as he pleased his heart and soul were at the end of his pen and they got into the ink he was dowered with sympathy insight humor and style for two hundred and thirty days and nights and his book was a book he had his vast special knowledge with him so to speak but the spirit the wovenin human touch the poetry and the power of the output were beyond all special knowledge but i doubt whether he knew the gift that was in him then and thus he may have lost some happiness he was toiling for tillie venner not for himself men often do their best work blind for some one elses sake  also though this has nothing to do with the story in india where every one knows every one else you can watch men being driven by the women who govern them out of the rankandfile and sent to take up points alone a good man once started goes forward but an average man so soon as the woman loses interest in his success as a tribute to her power comes back to the battalion and is no more heard of  wressley bore the first copy of his book to simla and blushing and stammering presented it to miss venner she read a little of it i give her review verbatimoh your book its all about those howwid wajahs i didnt understand it                                            wressley of the foreign office was broken smashedi am not exaggeratingby this one frivolous little girl all that he could say feebly wasbutbut its my magnum opus the work of my life miss venner did not know what magnum opus meant but she knew that captain kerrington had won three races at the last gymkhana wressley didnt press her to wait for him any longer he had sense enough for that  then came the reaction after the years strain and wressley went back to the foreign office and his wajahs a compiling gazetteering reportwriting hack who would have been dear at three hundred rupees a month he abided by miss venners review which proves that the inspiration in the book was purely temporary and unconnected with himself nevertheless he had no right to sink in a hilltarn five packingcases brought up at enormous expense from bombay of the best book of indian history ever written  when he sold off before retiring some years later i was turning over his shelves and came across the only existing copy of native rule in central indiathe copy that miss venner could not understand i read it sitting on his muletrunks as long as the light lasted and offered him his own price for it he looked over my shoulder for a few pages and said to himself drearily  now how in the world did i come to write such damned good stuff as that  then to me  take it and keep it write one of your pennyfarthing yarns about its birth perhapsperhapsthe whole business may have been ordained to that end  which knowing what wressley of the foreign office was once struck me as about the bitterest thing that i had ever heard a man say of his own work    the solid muldoon    did ye see john malone wid his shinin brandnew hat   did ye see how he walked like a grand aristocrat   there was flags an banners wavin high     an dhress and shtyle were shown   but the best av all the company was misther john malone    john malone  there had been a royal dogfight in the ravine at the back of the riflebutts between learoyds jock and ortheriss blue rotboth mongrel rampur hounds chiefly ribs and teeth it lasted for twenty happy howling minutes and then blue rot collapsed and ortheris paid learoyd three rupees and we were all very thirsty a dogfight is a most heating entertainment quite apart from the shouting because rampurs fight over a couple of acres of ground later when the sound of beltbadges clicking against the necks of beerbottles had died away conversation drifted from dog to manfights of all kinds humans resemble reddeer in some respects any talk of fighting seems to wake up a sort of imp in their breasts and they bell one to the other exactly like challenging bucks this is noticeable even in men who consider themselves superior to privates of the line it shows the refining influence of civilization and the march of progress  tale provoked tale and each tale more beer even dreamy learoyds eyes began to brighten and he unburdened himself of a long history in which a trip to malham cove a girl at pateley brigg a ganger himself and a pair of clogs were mixed in drawling tangle  an so ah coots yead oppen from t chin to t hair an he was abed for t matter o a month concluded learoyd pensively  mulvaney came out of a reveryhe was lying downand flourished his heels in the air youre a man learoyd said he critically but youve only fought wid men an thats an ivryday expayrience but ive stud up to a ghost an that was not an ivryday expayrience  no said ortheris throwing a cork at him you git up an address the ouseyou an yer expayriences is it a bigger one nor usual  twas the livin trut answered mulvaney stretching out a huge arm and catching ortheris by the collar now where are ye me son will ye take the wurrud av the lorrd out av my mouth another time he shook him to emphasize the question  no somethin else though said ortheris making a dash at mulvaneys pipe capturing it and holding it at arms length ill chuck it acrost the ditch if you dont let me go  you maraudin hathen tis the only cutty i iver loved handle her tinder or ill chuck you acrost the nullah if that poipe was brukah give her back to me sorr  ortheris had passed the treasure to my hand it was an absolutely perfect clay as shiny as the black ball at pool i took it reverently but i was firm  will you tell us about the ghostfight if i do i said  is ut the shtory thats troublin you av course i will i mint to all along i was only gettin at ut my own way as popp doggle said whin they found him thrying to ram a cartridge down the muzzle orthris fall away  he released the little londoner took back his pipe filled it and his eyes twinkled he has the most eloquent eyes of any one that i know  did i iver tell you he began that i was wanst the divil of a man  you did said learoyd with a childish gravity that made ortheris yell with laughter for mulvaney was always impressing upon us his great merits in the old days  did i iver tell you mulvaney continued calmly that i was wanst more av a divil than i am now  merria you dont mean it said ortheris  whin i was corprili was rejuced aftherwardbut as i say whin i was corpril i was a divil of a man  he was silent for nearly a minute while his mind rummaged among old memories and his eye glowed he bit upon the pipestem and charged into his tale  eyah they was great times im ould now me hides wore off in patches sinthrygo has disconceited me an im a married man

 beyond the pale  love heeds not caste nor sleep a broken bed i went in search of love and lost myselfhindu proverb  a man should whatever happens keep to his own caste race and breed let the white go to the white and the black to the black then whatever trouble falls is in the ordinary course of thingsneither sudden alien nor unexpected  this is the story of a man who wilfully stepped beyond the safe limits of decent everyday society and paid for it heavily  he knew too much in the first instance and he saw too much in the second he took too deep an interest in native life but he will never do so again  deep away in the heart of the city behind jitha megjis bustee lies amir naths gully which ends in a deadwall pierced by one grated window at the head of the gully is a big cowbyre and the walls on either side of the gully are without windows neither suchet singh nor gaur chand approve of their womenfolk looking into the world if durga charan had been of their opinion he would have been a happier man today and little bisesa would have been able to knead her own bread her room looked out through the grated window into the narrow dark gully where the sun never came and where the buffaloes wallowed in the blue slime she was a widow about fifteen years old and she prayed the gods day and night to send her a lover for she did not approve of living alone  one day the mantrejago his name wascame into amir naths gully on an aimless wandering and after he had passed the buffaloes stumbled over a big heap of cattlefood  then he saw that the gully ended in a trap and heard a little laugh from behind the grated window it was a pretty little laugh and trejago knowing that for all practical purposes the old arabian nights are good guides went forward to the window and whispered that verse of the love song of har dyal which begins    can a man stand upright in the face of the naked sun     or a lover in the presence of his beloved    if my feet fail me o heart of my heart am i to blame     being blinded by the glimpse of your beauty  there came the faint tchink of a womans bracelets from behind the grating and a little voice went on with the song at the fifth verse     alas alas can the moon tell the lotus of her love      when the gate of heaven is shut and the clouds gather for the rains    they have taken my beloved and driven her      with the packhorses to the north    there are iron chains on the feet that were set on my heart    call to the bowmen to make ready  the voice stopped suddenly and trejago walked out of amir naths gully wondering who in the world could have capped the love song of har dyal so neatly  next morning as he was driving to office an old woman threw a packet into his dogcart in the packet was the half of a broken glassbangle one flower of the bloodred dhak a pinch of bhusa or cattlefood and eleven cardamoms that packet was a letternot a clumsy compromising letter but an innocent unintelligible lovers epistle  trejago knew far too much about these things as i have said no englishman should be able to translate objectletters but trejago spread all the trifles on the lid of his officebox and began to puzzle them out  a broken glassbangle stands for a hindu widow all india over because when her husband dies a womans bracelets are broken on her wrists trejago saw the meaning of the little bit of the glass the flower of the dhak means diversely desire come write or danger according to the other things with it one cardamom means jealousy but when any article is duplicated in an objectletter it loses its symbolic meaning and stands merely for one of a number indicating time or if incense curds or saffron be sent also place the message ran thena widowdhak flower and bhusaat eleven oclock the pinch of bhusa enlightened trejago he sawthis kind of letter leaves much to instinctive knowledgethat the bhusa referred to the big heap of cattlefood over which he had fallen in amir naths gully and that the message must come from the person behind the grating she being a widow so the message ran thena widow in the gully in which is the heap of bhusa desires you to come at eleven oclock  trejago threw all the rubbish into the fireplace and laughed he knew that men in the east do not make love under windows at eleven in the forenoon nor do women fix appointments a week in advance so he went that very night at eleven into amir naths gully clad in a boorka which cloaks a man as well as a woman directly the gongs of the city made the hour the little voice behind the grating took up the love song of har dyal at the verse where the panthan girl calls upon har dyal to return the song is really pretty in the vernacular in english you miss the wail of it it runs something like this     alone upon the housetops to the north    i turn and watch the lightning in the sky    the glamour of thy footsteps in the north    come back to me beloved or i die     below my feet the still bazar is laid    far far below the weary camels lie    the camels and the captives of thy raid    come back to me beloved or i die     my fathers wife is old and harsh with years    and drudge of all my fathers house am i    my bread is sorrow and my drink is tears    come back to me beloved or i die  as the song stopped trejago stepped up under the grating and whisperedi am here  bisesa was good to look upon  that night was the beginning of many strange things and of a double life so wild that trejago today sometimes wonders if it were not all a dream bisesa or her old handmaiden who had thrown the objectletter had detached the heavy grating from the brickwork of the wall so that the window slid inside leaving only a square of raw masonry into which an active man might climb  in the daytime trejago drove through his routine of officework or put on his callingclothes and called on the ladies of the station wondering how long they would know him if they knew of poor little bisesa at night when all the city was still came the walk under the evilsmelling boorka the patrol through jitha megjis bustee the quick turn into amir naths gully between the sleeping cattle and the dead walls and then last of all bisesa and the deep even breathing of the old woman who slept outside the door of the bare little room that durga charan allotted to his sisters daughter who or what durga charan was trejago never inquired and why in the world he was not discovered and knifed never occurred to him till his madness was over and bisesa  but this comes later  bisesa was an endless delight to trejago she was as ignorant as a bird and her distorted versions of the rumors from the outside world that had reached her in her room amused trejago almost as much as her lisping attempts to pronounce his namechristopher the first syllable was always more than she could manage and she made funny little gestures with her roseleaf hands as one throwing the name away and then kneeling before trejago asked him exactly as an englishwoman would do if he were sure he loved her trejago swore that he loved her more than any one else in the world which was true  after a month of this folly the exigencies of his other life compelled trejago to be especially attentive to a lady of his acquaintance you may take it for a fact that anything of this kind is not only noticed and discussed by a mans own race but by some hundred and fifty natives as well trejago had to walk with this lady and talk to her at the bandstand and once or twice to drive with her never for an instant dreaming that this would affect his dearer outoftheway life but the news flew in the usual mysterious fashion from mouth to mouth till bisesas duenna heard of it and told bisesa the child was so troubled that she did the household work evilly and was beaten by durga charans wife in consequence  a week later bisesa taxed trejago with the flirtation she understood no gradations and spoke openly trejago laughed and bisesa stamped her little feetlittle feet light as marigold flowers that could lie in the palm of a mans one hand  much that is written about oriental passion and impulsiveness is exaggerated and compiled at secondhand but a little of it is true and when an englishman finds that little it is quite as startling as any passion in his own proper life bisesa raged and stormed and finally threatened to kill herself if trejago did not at once drop the alien memsahib who had come between them trejago tried to explain and to show her that she did not understand these things from a western standpoint bisesa drew herself up and said simply  i do not i know only thisit is not good that i should have made you dearer than my own heart to me sahib you are an englishman i am only a black girlshe was fairer than bargold in the mintand the widow of a black man  then she sobbed and saidbut on my soul and my mothers soul i love you there shall no harm come to you whatever happens to me  trejago argued with the child and tried to soothe her but she seemed quite unreasonably disturbed nothing would satisfy her save that all relations between them should end he was to go away at once and he went as he dropped out of the window she kissed his forehead twice and he walked home wondering  a week and then three weeks passed without a sign from bisesa trejago thinking that the rupture had lasted quite long enough went down to amir naths gully for the fifth time in the three weeks hoping that his rap at the sill of the shifting grating would be answered he was not disappointed  there was a young moon and one stream of light fell down into amir naths gully and struck the grating which was drawn away as he knocked from the black dark bisesa held out her arms into the moonlight both hands had been cut off at the wrists and the stumps were nearly healed  then as bisesa bowed her head between her arms and sobbed some one in the room grunted like a wild beast and something sharpknife sword or spearthrust at trejago in his boorka the stroke missed his body but cut into one of the muscles of the groin and he limped slightly from the wound for the rest of his days  the grating went into its place there was no sign whatever from inside the housenothing but the moonlight strip on the high wall and the blackness of amir naths gully behind  the next thing trejago remembers after raging and shouting like a madman between those pitiless walls is that he found himself near the river as the dawn was breaking threw away his boorka and went home bareheaded                                            what was the tragedywhether bisesa had in a fit of causeless despair told everything or the intrigue had been discovered and she tortured to tell whether durga charan knew his name and what became of bisesatrejago does not know to this day something horrible had happened and the thought of what it must have been comes upon trejago in the night now and again and keeps him company till the morning one special feature of the case is that he does not know where lies the front of durga charans house it may open on to a courtyard common to two or more houses or it may lie behind any one of the gates of jitha megjis bustee trejago cannot tell he cannot get bisesapoor little bisesaback again he has lost her in the city where each mans house is as guarded and as unknowable as the grave and the grating that opens into amir naths gully has been walled up  but trejago pays his calls regularly and is reckoned a very decent sort of man  there is nothing peculiar about him except a slight stiffness caused by a ridingstrain in the right leg    the god from the machine  hit a man an help a woman an ye cant be far wrong anywaysmaxims of private mulvaney  the inexpressibles gave a ball they borrowed a sevenpounder from the gunners and wreathed it with laurels and made the dancingfloor plateglass and provided a supper the like of which had never been eaten before and set two sentries at the door of the room to hold the trays of programmecards my friend private mulvaney was one of the sentries because he was the tallest man in the regiment when the dance was fairly started the sentries were released and private mulvaney went to curry favor with the mess sergeant in charge of the supper whether the mess sergeant gave or mulvaney took i cannot say all that i am certain of is that at suppertime i found mulvaney with private ortheris twothirds of a ham a loaf of bread half a pâtédefoiegras and two magnums of champagne sitting on the roof of my carriage as i came up i heard

spit out  eyah he was a tricky man an a liar by natur some are born so he was wan i knew he was over his belt in money borrowed from natives besides a lot av other matthers which in regard for your presince sorr i will oblitherate a little av fwhat i knew the colonel knew for he wud have none av him an that im thinkin by fwhat happened aftherward the captin knew  wan day bein mortial idle or they wud never ha thried ut the rigmint gave amsure theatricalsorfcers an orfcers ladies youve seen the likes time an again sorr an poor fun tis for them that sit in the back row an stamp wid their boots for the honor av the rigmint i was told off for to shif the scenes haulin up this an draggin down that light work ut was wid lashins av beer and the gurl that dhressed the orfcers ladiesbut she died in aggra twelve years gone an my tongues gettin the betther av me they was actin a play thing called sweethearts which you may ha heard av an the colonels daughter she was a ladys maid the captn was a boy called broomspread broom was his name in the play thin i sawut come out in the actinfwhat i niver saw before an that was that he was no gentleman they was too much together thim two awhishperin behind the scenes i shifted an some av what they said i heard for i was deathblue death an ivyon the combcuttin he was iverlastinly oppressing her to fall in wid some sneakin schame av his an she was thryin to stand out against him but not as though she was set in her will i wonder now in thim days that my ears did not grow a yard on me head wid listnin but i looked straight forninst me an hauled up this an dragged down that such as was my duty an the orfcers ladies sez one to another thinkin i was out av listenreach fwhat an obligin young man is this corpril mulvaney i was a corpril then i was rejuced aftherward but no matther i was a corpril wanst  well this sweethearts business wint on like most amshure theatricals an barrin fwhat i suspicioned twasnt till the dhressrehearsal that i saw for certain that thim twohe the blackguard an she no wiser than she should ha beenhad put up an evasion  a what said i  evasion fwhat you call an elopemint evasion i calls it bekaze exceptin whin tis right an natural an proper tis wrong an dhirty to steal a mans wan child she not knowin her own mind there was a sargint in the commssariat who set my face upon evasions ill tell you about that  stick to the bloomin captains mulvaney said ortheris commssariat sargints is low  mulvaney accepted the amendment and went on  now i knew that the colonel was no fool any more than me for i was hild the smartest man in the rigmint an the colonel was the best orfcer commandin in asia so fwhat he said an i said was a mortial truth we knew that the captn was bad but for reasons which i have already oblitherated i knew more than me colonel i wud ha rolled out his face wid the butt av my gun before permittin av him to steal the gurl saints knew av he wud ha married her and av he didnt she wud be in great tormint an the divil av a scandal but i niver sthruck niver raised me hand on my shuperior orfcer an that was a merricle now i come to considher it  mulvaney the dawns risin said ortheris an were no nearer ome than we was at the beginnin lend me your pouch mines all dust  mulvaney pitched his pouch over and filled his pipe afresh  so the dhressrehearsal came to an end an

childher they make sarjints nowadays that an havin nothin to do i cant make ut out anyways  well what does it matter let him talk himself through  ortheris began singing a parody of the ramrod corps

mulvaneys anxiety he seemed to be trying to coax ortheris out of the fit for he shouted down the bank where the boy was lying  listen now you wid the pore pink toes an the glass eyes did you shwim the irriwaddy at night behin me as a bhoy shud or were you hidin under a bed as you was at ahmid kheyl  this was at once a gross insult and a direct lie and mulvaney meant it to bring on a fight but ortheris seemed shut up in some sort of trance he answered slowly without a sign of irritation in the same cadenced voice as he had used for his firingparty orders  hi swum the irriwaddy in the night

regment and mulvaney wired together theres the widder sittin at ome with a gold crownd on er ead and ere am hi stanley orthris the widders property a rottin fool  his voice rose at the end of the sentence and he wound up with a sixshot anglovernacular oath mulvaney said nothing but looked at me as if he expected that i could bring peace to poor ortheris troubled brain  i remembered once at rawal pindi having seen a man nearly mad with drink sobered by being made a fool of some regiments may know what i mean i hoped that we might slake off ortheris in the same way though he was perfectly sober so i said  whats the use of grousing there and speaking against the widow  i didnt said ortheris selp me gawd i never said a word agin er an i wouldntnot if i was to desert this minute  here was my opening well you meant to anyhow whats the use of crackingon for nothing would you slip it now if you got the chance  ony try me said ortheris jumping to his feet as if he had been stung  mulvaney jumped too fwhat are you going to do said he  help ortheris down to bombay or karachi whichever he likes you can report that he separated from you before tiffin and left his gun on the bank here  im to report thatam i said mulvaney slowly very well if orthris manes to desert now and will desert now an you sorr who have been a frind to me an to him will help him to ut i terence mulvaney on my oath which ive never bruk yet will report as you say buthere he stepped up to ortheris and shook the stock of the fowlingpiece in his faceyour fists help you stanley orthris if ever i come across you agin  i dont care said ortheris im sick o this dorgs life give me a chanst dont play with me le me go  strip said i and change with me and then ill tell you what to do  i hoped that the absurdity of this would check ortheris but he had kicked off his ammunitionboots and got rid of his tunic almost before i had loosed my shirtcollar mulvaney gripped me by the arm  the fits on him the fits workin on him still by my honor and sowl we shall be accessiry to a desartion yet only twentyeight days as you say sorr or fiftysix but think o the shamethe black shame to him an me i had never seen mulvaney so excited  but ortheris was quite calm and as soon as he had exchanged clothes with me and i stood up a private of the line he said shortly now come on what nex dye mean fair what must i do to get out o this ere ahell  i told him that if he would wait for two or three hours near the river i would ride into the station and come back with one hundred rupees he would with that money in his pocket walk to the nearest sidestation on the line about five miles away and would there take a firstclass ticket for karachi knowing that he had no money on him when he went out shooting his regiment would not immediately wire to the seaports but would hunt for him in the native villages near the river further no one would think of seeking a deserter in a firstclass carriage at karachi he was to buy white clothes and ship if he could on a cargosteamer  here he broke in if i helped him to karachi he would arrange all the rest then i ordered him to wait where he was until it was dark enough for me to ride into the station without my dress being noticed now god in his wisdom has made the heart of the british soldier who is very often an unlicked ruffian as soft as the heart of a little child in order that he may believe in and follow his officers into tight and nasty places he does not so readily come to believe in a civilian but when he does he believes implicitly and like a dog i had had the honor of the friendship of private ortheris at intervals for more than three years and we had dealt with each other as man by man consequently he considered that all my words were true and not spoken lightly  mulvaney and i left him in the high grass near the riverbank and went away still keeping to the high grass toward my horse the shirt scratched me horribly  we waited nearly two hours for the dusk to fall and allow me to ride off we spoke of ortheris in whispers and strained our ears to catch any sound from the spot where we had left him but we heard nothing except the wind in the plumegrass  ive bruk his head said mulvaney earnestly time an agin ive nearly kilt him wid the belt an yet i cant knock thim fits out av his soft head no an hes not soft for hes reasonable an likely by natur fwhat is ut is ut his breedin which is nothin or his edukashin which he niver got you that think ye know things answer me that  but i found no answer i was wondering how long ortheris in the bank of the river would hold out and whether i should be forced to help him to desert as i had given my word  just as the dusk shut down and with a very heavy heart i was beginning to saddle up my horse we heard wild shouts from the river  the devils had departed from private stanley ortheris no 22639 b company the loneliness the dusk and the waiting had driven them out as i had hoped we set off at the double and found him plunging about wildly through the grass with his coat offmy coat off i mean he was calling for us like a madman  when we reached him he was dripping with perspiration and trembling like a startled horse we had great difficulty in soothing him he complained that he was in civilian kit and wanted to tear my clothes off his body i ordered him to strip and we made a second exchange as quickly as possible  the rasp of his own greyback shirt and the squeak of his boots seemed to bring him to himself he put his hands before his eyes and said  wot was it i aint mad i aint sunstrook an ive bin an gone an said an bin an gone an done wot ave i bin an done  fwhat have you done said mulvaney youve dishgraced yourselfthough thats no matter youve dishgraced b compny an worst av all youve dishgraced me me that taught you how for to walk abroad like a manwhin you was a dhirty little fishbacked little whimperin little recruity as you are now stanley orthris  ortheris said nothing for a while then he unslung his belt heavy with the badges of half a dozen regiments that his own had lain with and handed it over to mulvaney  im too little for to mill you mulvaney he an youve strook me before but you can take an cut me in two with this ere if you like  mulvaney turned to me  lave me to talk to him sorr said mulvaney  i left and on my way home thought a good deal over ortheris in particular and my friend private thomas atkins whom i love in general  but i could not come to any conclusion of any kind whatever    lenvoi     and they were stronger hands than mine    that digged the ruby from the earth    more cunning brains that made it worth    the large desire of a king    and bolder hearts that through the brine    went down the perfect pearl to bring     lo i have wrought in common clay    rude figures of a roughhewn race    for pearls strew not the marketplace    in this my town of banishment    where with the shifting dust i play    and eat the bread of discontent    yet is there life in that i make    oh thou who knowest turn and see    as thou hast power over me    so have i power over these    because i wrought them for thy sake    and breathe in them mine agonies     small mirth was in the making now    i lift the cloth that cloaks the clay    and wearied at thy feet i lay    my wares ere i go forth to sell    the long bazar will praisebut thou    heart of my heart have i done well
