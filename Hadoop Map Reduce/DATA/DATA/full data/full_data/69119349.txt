series has had in view in the plan and method which he has followed in the preparation of the successive volumes has been to adapt them to the purposes of textbooks in schools the study of a general compend of history such as is frequently used as a textbook is highly useful if it comes in at the right stage of education when the mind is sufficiently matured and has acquired sufficient preliminary knowledge to understand and appreciate so condensed a generalization as a summary of the whole history of a nation contained in an ordinary volume must necessarily be without this degree of maturity of mind and this preparation the study of such a work will be as it too frequently is a mere mechanical committing to memory of names and dates and phrases which awaken no interest communicate no ideas and impart no useful knowledge to the mind  a class of ordinary pupils who have not yet become much acquainted with history would accordingly be more benefited by having their attention concentrated at first on detached and separate topics such as those which form the subjects respectively of these volumes by studying thus fully the history of individual monarchs or the narratives of single events they can go more fully into detail they conceive of the transactions described as realities their reflecting and reasoning powers are occupied on what they read they take notice of the motives of conduct of the gradual development of character the good or ill desert of actions and of the connection of causes and consequences both in respect to the influence of wisdom and virtue on the one hand and on the other of folly and crime in a word their minds and hearts are occupied instead of merely their memories they reason they sympathize they pity they approve and they condemn they enjoy the real and true pleasure which constitutes the charm of historical study for minds that are mature and they acquire a taste for truth instead of fiction which will tend to direct their reading into proper channels in all future years  the use of these works therefore as textbooks in classes has been kept continually in mind in the preparation of them the running index on the tops of the pages is intended to serve instead of questions these captions can be used in their present form as topics in respect to which when announced in the class the pupils are to repeat substantially what is said on the page or on the other hand questions in form if that mode is preferred can be readily framed from them by the teacher in all the volumes a very regular system of division is observed which will greatly facilitate the assignment of lessons      contents    chapter                                                    page      i the mother of xerxes

argumentsinfluence of atossathe spartan fugitivehis views of the successionthe decisiondeath of darius   the name of xerxes is associated in the minds of men with the idea of the highest attainable elevation of human magnificence and grandeur this monarch was the sovereign of the ancient persian empire when it was at the height of its prosperity and power it is probable however that his greatness and fame lose nothing by the manner in which his story comes down to us through the greek historians the greeks conquered xerxes and in relating his history they magnify the wealth the power and the resources of his empire by way of exalting the greatness and renown of their own exploits in subduing him  the mother of xerxes was atossa a daughter of cyrus the great who was the founder of the persian empire cyrus was killed in scythia a wild and barbarous region lying north of the black and caspian seas his son cambyses succeeded him  a kingdom or an empire was regarded in ancient days much in the light of an estate which the sovereign held as a species of property and which he was to manage mainly with a view to the promotion of his own personal aggrandizement and pleasure a king or an emperor could have more palaces more money and more wives than other men and if he was of an overbearing or ambitious spirit he could march into his neighbors territories and after gratifying his love of adventure with various romantic exploits and gaining great renown by his ferocious impetuosity in battle he could end his expedition perhaps by adding his neighbors palaces and treasures and wives to his own  divine providence however the mysterious power that overrules all the passions and impulses of men and brings extended and general good out of local and particular evil has made the ambition and the selfishness of princes the great means of preserving order and government among men these great ancient despots for example would not have been able to collect their revenues or enlist their armies or procure supplies for their campaigns unless their dominions were under a regular and complete system of social organization such as should allow all the industrial pursuits of commerce and of agriculture throughout the mass of the community to go regularly on thus absolute monarchs however ambitious and selfish and domineering in their characters have a strong personal interest in the establishment of order and of justice between man and man throughout all the regions which are under their sway in fact the greater their ambition their selfishness and their pride the stronger will this interest be for just in proportion as order industry and internal tranquillity prevail in a country just in that proportion can revenues be collected from it and armies raised and maintained  it is a mistake therefore to suppose of the great heroes and sovereigns and conquerors that have appeared from time to time among mankind that the usual and ordinary result of their influence and action has been that of disturbance and disorganization it is true that a vast amount of disturbance and disorganization has often followed from the march of their armies their sieges their invasions and the other local and temporary acts of violence which they commit but these are the exceptions not the rule it must be that such things are exceptions since in any extended and general view of the subject a much greater amount of social organization industry and peace is necessary to raise and maintain an army than that army can itself destroy the deeds of destruction which great conquerors perform attract more attention and make a greater impression upon mankind than the quiet patient and longcontinued labors by which they perfect and extend the general organization of the social state but these labors though less noticed by men have really employed the energies of great sovereigns in a far greater degree than mankind have generally imagined thus we should describe the work of cæsars life in a single word more truly by saying that he organized europe than that he conquered it his bridges his roads his systems of jurisprudence his coinage his calendar and other similar means and instruments of social arrangement and facilities for promoting the pursuits of industry and peace mark far more properly the real work which that great conqueror performed among mankind than his battles and his victories darius was in the same way the organizer of asia william the conqueror completed or rather advanced very far toward completing the social organization of england and even in respect to napoleon the true and proper memorial of his career is the successful working of the institutions the systems and the codes which he perfected and introduced into the social state and not the brazen column formed from captured cannon which stands in the place vendôme  these considerations obviously true though not always borne in mind are however to be considered as making the characters of the great sovereigns in a moral point of view neither the worse nor the better in all that they did whether in arranging and systematizing the functions of social life or in ruthless deeds of conquest and destruction they were actuated in a great measure by selfish ambition they arranged and organized the social state in order to form a more compact and solid pedestal for the foundation of their power they maintained peace and order among their people just as a master would suppress quarrels among his slaves because peace among laborers is essential to productive results they fixed and defined legal rights and established courts to determine and enforce them they protected property they counted and classified men they opened roads they built bridges they encouraged commerce they hung robbers and exterminated piratesall that the collection of their revenues and the enlistment of their armies might go on without hinderance or restriction many of them indeed may have been animated in some degree by a higher and nobler sentiment than this some may have felt a sort of pride in the contemplation of a great and prosperous and wealthy empire analogous to that which a proprietor feels in surveying a wellconditioned successful and productive estate others like alfred may have felt a sincere and honest interest in the welfare of their fellowmen and the promotion of human happiness may have been in a greater or less degree the direct object of their aim still it can not be denied that a selfish and reckless ambition has been in general the main spring of action with heroes and conquerors which while it aimed only at personal aggrandizement has been made to operate through the peculiar mechanism of the social state which the divine wisdom has contrived as a means in the main of preserving and extending peace and order among mankind and not of destroying them  but to return to atossa her father cyrus who laid the foundation of the great persian empire was for a hero and conqueror tolerably considerate and just and he desired probably to promote the welfare and happiness of his millions of subjects but his son cambyses atossas brother having been brought up in expectation of succeeding to vast wealth and power and having been as the sons of the wealthy and the powerful often are in all ages of the world wholly neglected by his father during the early part of his life and entirely unaccustomed to control became a wild reckless proud selfish and ungovernable young man his father was killed suddenly in battle as has already been stated and cambyses succeeded him cambysess career was short desperate and most tragical in its enda in fact he was one of the most savage reckless and abominable monsters that have ever lived  footnote a his history in given in the first chapter of darius the great  it was the custom in those days for the persian monarchs to have many wives and what is still more remarkable whenever any monarch died his successor inherited his predecessors family as well as his throne cyrus had several children by his various wives cambyses and smerdis were the only sons but there were daughters among whom atossa was the most distinguished the ladies of the court were accustomed to reside in different palaces or in different suites of apartments in the same palace so that they lived in a great measure isolated from each other when cambyses came to the throne and thus entered into possession of his fathers palaces he saw and fell in love with one of his fathers daughters he wished to make her one of his wives he was accustomed to the unrestricted indulgence of every appetite and passion but he seems to have had some slight misgivings in regard to such a step as this he consulted the persian judges they conferred upon the subject and then replied that they had searched among the laws of the realm and though they found no law allowing a man to marry his sister they found many which authorized a persian king to do whatever he pleased  cambyses therefore added the princess to the number of his wives and not long afterward he married another of his fathers daughters in the same way one of these princesses was atossa  cambyses invaded egypt and in the course of his mad career in that country he killed his brother smerdis and one of his sisters and at length was killed himself atossa escaped the dangers of this stormy and terrible reign and returned safely to susa after cambysess death  smerdis the brother of cambyses would have been cambysess successor if he had survived him but he had been privately assassinated by cambysess orders though his death had been kept profoundly secret by those who had perpetrated the deed there was another smerdis in susa the persian capital who was a magianthat is a sort of priestin whose hands as regent cambyses had left the government while he was absent on his campaigns this magian smerdis accordingly conceived the plan of usurping the throne as if he were smerdis the prince resorting to a great many ingenious and cunning schemes to conceal his deception among his other plans one was to keep himself wholly sequestered from public view with a few favorites such especially as had not personally known smerdis the prince in the same manner he secluded from each other and from himself all who had known smerdis in order to prevent their conferring with one another or communicating to each other any suspicions which they might chance to entertain such seclusion so far as related to the ladies of the royal family was not unusual after the death of a king and smerdis did not deviate from the ordinary custom except to make the isolation and confinement of the princesses and queens more rigorous and strict than common by means of this policy he was enabled to go on for some months without detection living all the while in the greatest luxury and splendor but at the same time in absolute seclusion and in unceasing anxiety and fear  one chief source of his solicitude was lest he should be detected by means of his ears some years before when he was in a comparatively obscure position he had in some way or other offended his sovereign and was punished by having his ears cut off it was necessary therefore to keep the marks of this mutilation carefully concealed by means of his hair and his headdress and even with these precautions he could never feel perfectly secure  at last one of the nobles of the court a sagacious and observing man suspected the imposture he had no access to smerdis himself but his daughter whose name was phædyma was one of smerdiss wives the nobleman was excluded from all direct intercourse with smerdis and even with his daughter but he contrived to send word to his daughter inquiring whether her husband was the true smerdis or not she replied that she did not know inasmuch as she had never seen any other smerdis if indeed there had been another the nobleman then attempted to communicate with atossa but he found it impossible to do so atossa had of course known her brother well and was on that very account very closely secluded by the magian as a last resort the nobleman sent to his daughter a request that she would watch for an opportunity to feel for her husbands ears while he was asleep he admitted that this would be a dangerous attempt but his daughter he said ought to be willing to make it since if her pretended husband were really an impostor she ought to take even a stronger interest than others in his detection phædyma was at first afraid to undertake so dangerous a commission but she at length ventured to do so and by passing her hand under his turban one night while he was sleeping on his couch she found that the ears were goneb  footnote b for a more particular account of the transaction and for an engraving illustrating this scene see the history of darius  the consequence of this discovery was that a conspiracy was formed to dethrone and destroy the usurper the plot was successful smerdis was killed his imprisoned queens were set free and darius was raised to the throne in his stead  atossa now by that strange principle of succession which has been already alluded to became the wife of darius and she figures frequently and conspicuously in history during his long and splendid reign  her name is brought into notice in one case in a remarkable manner in connection with an expedition which darius sent on an exploring tour into greece and italy she was herself the means in fact of sending the expedition she was sick and after suffering secretly and in silence as long as possiblethe nature of her complaint being such as to make her unwilling to speak of it to othersshe at length determined to consult a greek physician who had been brought to persia as a captive and had acquired great celebrity at susa by his medical science and skill the physician said that he would undertake her case on condition that she would promise to grant him a certain request that he would make she wished to know what it was beforehand but the physician would not tell her he said however that it was nothing that it would be in any way derogatory to her honor to grant him  on these conditions atossa concluded to agree to the physicians proposals he made her take a solemn oath that if he cured her of her malady she would do whatever he required of her provided that it was consistent with honor and propriety he then took her case under his charge prescribed for her and attended her and in due time she was cured the physician then told her that what he wished her to do for him was to find some means to persuade darius to send him home to his native land  atossa was faithful in fulfilling her promise she took a private opportunity when she was alone with darius to propose that he should engage in some plans of foreign conquest she reminded him of the vastness of the military power which was at his disposal and of the facility with which by means of it he might extend his dominions she extolled too his genius and energy and endeavored to inspire in his mind some ambitious desires to distinguish himself in the estimation of mankind by bringing his capacities for the performance of great deeds into action  darius listened to these suggestions of atossa with interest and with evident pleasure he said that he had been forming some such plans himself he was going to build a bridge across the hellespont or the bosporus to unite europe and asia and he was also going to make an incursion into the country of the scythians the people by whom cyrus his great predecessor had been defeated and slain it would be a great glory for him he said to succeed in a conquest in which cyrus had so totally failed  but these plans would not answer the purpose which atossa had in view she urged her husband therefore to postpone his invasion of the scythians till some future time and first conquer the greeks and annex their territory to his dominions the scythians she said were savages and their country not worth the cost of conquering it while greece would constitute a noble prize she urged the invasion of greece too rather than scythia as a personal favor to herself for she had been wanting she said some slaves from greece for a long timesome of the women of sparta of corinth and of athens of whose graces and accomplishments she had heard so much  there was something gratifying to the military vanity of darius in being thus requested to make an incursion to another continent and undertake the conquest of the mightiest nation of the earth for the purpose of procuring accomplished waitingmaids to offer as a present to his queen he became restless and excited while listening to atossas proposals and to the arguments with which she enforced them and it was obvious that he was very strongly inclined to accede to her views he finally concluded to send a commission into greece to explore the country and to bring back a report on their return and as he decided to make the greek physician the guide of the expedition atossa gained her end  a full account of this expedition and of the various adventures which the party met with on their voyage is given in our history of darius it may be proper to say here however that the physician fully succeeded in his plans of making his escape he pretended at first to be unwilling to go and he made only the most temporary arrangements in respect to the conduct of his affairs while he should be gone in order to deceive the king in regard to his intentions of not returning the king on his part resorted to some stratagems to ascertain whether the physician was sincere in his professions but he did not succeed in detecting the artifice and so the party went away the physician never returned  atossa had four sons xerxes was the eldest of them he was not however the eldest of the sons of darius as there were other sons the children of another wife whom darius had married before he ascended the throne the oldest of these children was named artobazanes artobazanes seems to have been a prince of an amiable and virtuous character and not particularly ambitious and aspiring in his disposition although as he was the eldest son of his father he claimed to be his heir atossa did not admit the validity of this claim but maintained that the oldest of her children was entitled to the inheritance  it became necessary to decide this question before dariuss death for darius in the prosecution of a war in which he was engaged formed the design of accompanying his army on an expedition into greece and before doing this he was bound according to the laws and usages of the persian realm to regulate the succession  there immediately arose an earnest dispute between the friends and partisans of artobazanes and xerxes each side urging very eagerly the claims of its own candidate the mother and the friends of artobazanes maintained that he was the oldest son and consequently the heir atossa on the other hand contended that xerxes was the grandson of cyrus and that he derived from that circumstance the highest possible hereditary rights to the persian throne  this was in some respects true for cyrus had been the founder of the empire and the legitimate monarch while darius had no hereditary claims he was originally a noble of high rank indeed but not of the royal line and he had been designated as cyruss successor in a time of revolution because there was at that time no prince of the royal family who could take the inheritance those therefore who were disposed to insist on the claims of a legitimate hereditary succession might very plausibly claim that dariuss government had been a regency rather than a reign that xerxes being the oldest son of atossa cyruss daughter was the true representative of the royal line and that although it might not be expedient to disturb the possession of darius during his lifetime yet that at his death xerxes was unquestionably entitled to the throne  there was obviously a great deal of truth and justice in this reasoning and yet it was a view of the subject not likely to be very agreeable to darius since it seemed to deny the existence of any real and valid title to the sovereignty in him it assigned the crown at his death not to his son as such but to his predecessors grandson for though xerxes was both the son of darius and the grandson of cyrus it was in the latter capacity that he was regarded as entitled to the crown in the argument referred to above the doctrine was very gratifying to the pride of atossa for it made xerxes the successor to the crown as her son and heir and not as the son and heir of her husband for this very reason it was likely to be not very gratifying to darius he hesitated very much in respect to adopting it atossas ascendency over his mind and her influence generally in the persian court was almost overwhelming and yet darius was very unwilling to seem by giving to the oldest grandson of cyrus the precedence over his own eldest son to admit that he himself had no legitimate and proper title to the throne  while things were in this state a greek named demaratus arrived at susa he was a dethroned prince from sparta and had fled from the political storms of his own country to seek refuge in dariuss capital demaratus found a way to reconcile dariuss pride as a sovereign with his personal preferences as a husband and a father he told the king that according to the principles of hereditary succession which were adopted in greece xerxes was his heir as well as cyruss for he was the oldest son who was born after his accession a son he said according to the greek ideas on the subject was entitled to inherit only such rank as his father held when the son was born and that consequently none of his children who had been born before his accession could have any claims to the persian throne artobazanes in a word was to be regarded he said only as the son of darius the noble while xerxes was the son of darius the king  in the end darius adopted this view and designated xerxes as his successor in case he should not return from his distant expedition he did not return he did not even live to set out upon it perhaps the question of the succession had not been absolutely and finally settled for it arose again and was discussed anew when the death of darius occurred the manner in which it was finally disposed of will be described in the next chapter

made to fix and determine the succession before his death did not entirely prevent the question from arising again when his death occurred xerxes was on the spot at the time and at once assumed the royal functions his brother was absent xerxes sent a messenger to artobazanesc informing him of their fathers death and of his intention of assuming the crown he said however that if he did so he should give his brother the second rank making him in all respects next to himself in office and honor he sent moreover a great many splendid presents to artobazanes to evince the friendly regard which he felt for him and to propitiate his favor  footnote c plutarch who gives an account of these occurrences varies the orthography of the name we however retain the name as given by herodotus  artobazanes sent back word to xerxes that he thanked him for his presents and that he accepted them with pleasure he said that he considered himself nevertheless as justly entitled to the crown though he should in the event of his accession treat all his brothers and especially xerxes with the utmost consideration and respect  soon after these occurrences artobazanes came to media where xerxes was and the question which of them should be the king was agitated anew among the nobles of the court in the end a public hearing of the cause was had before artabanus a brother of darius and of course an uncle of the contending princes the question seems to have been referred to him either because he held some public office which made it his duty to consider and decide such a question or else because he had been specially commissioned to act as judge in this particular case xerxes was at first quite unwilling to submit his claims to the decision of such a tribunal the crown was as he maintained rightfully his he thought that the public voice was generally in his favor then besides he was already in possession of the throne and by consenting to plead his cause before his uncle he seemed to be virtually abandoning all this vantage ground and trusting instead to the mere chance of artabanuss decision  atossa however recommended to him to accede to the plan of referring the question to artabanus he would consider the subject she said with fairness and impartiality and decide it right she had no doubt that he would decide it in xerxess favor and if he does not she added and you lose your cause you only become the second man in the kingdom instead of the first and the difference is not so very great after all  atossa may have had some secret intimation how artabanus would decide  however this may be xerxes at length concluded to submit the question a solemn court was held and the case was argued in the presence of all the nobles and great officers of state a throne was at hand to which the successful competitor was to be conducted as soon as the decision should be made artabanus heard the arguments and decided in favor of xerxes artobazanes his brother acquiesced in the decision with the utmost readiness and good humor he was the first to bow before the king in token of homage and conducted him himself to the throne  xerxes kept his promise faithfully of making his brother the second in his kingdom he appointed him to a very high command in the army and artobazanes on his part served the king with great zeal and fidelity until he was at last killed in battle in the manner hereafter to be described  as soon as xerxes found himself established on his throne he was called upon to decide immediately a great question namely which of two important wars in which his father had been engaged he should first undertake to prosecute the war in egypt or the war in greece  by referring to the map the reader will see that as the persian empire extended westward to asia minor and to the coasts of the mediterranean sea the great countries which bordered upon it in this direction were on the north greece and on the south egypt the one in europe and the other in africa the greeks and the egyptians were both wealthy and powerful and the countries which they respectively inhabited were fertile and beautiful beyond expression and yet in all their essential features and characteristics they were extremely dissimilar egypt was a long and narrow inland valley greece reposed as it were in the bosom of the sea consisting as it did of an endless number of islands promontories peninsulas and winding coasts laved on every side by the blue waters of the mediterranean egypt was a plain diversified only by the varieties of vegetation and by the towns and villages and the enormous monumental structures which had been erected by man greece was a picturesque and everchanging scene of mountains and valleys of precipitous cliffs winding beaches rocky capes and lofty headlands the character and genius of the inhabitants of these two countries took their cast in each case from the physical conformations of the soil the egyptians were a quiet gentle and harmless race of tillers of the ground they spent their lives in pumping water from the river in the patient persevering toil of sowing smooth and mellow fields or in reaping the waving grain the greeks drove flocks and herds up and down the declivities of the mountains or hunted wild beasts in forests and fastnesses they constructed galleys for navigating the seas they worked the mines and manufactured metals they built bridges citadels temples and towns and sculptured statuary from marble blocks which they chiseled from the strata of the mountains it is surprising what a difference is made in the genius and character of man by elevations here and there of a few thousand feet in the country where his genius and character are formed  the architectural wonders of egypt and of greece were as diverse from each other as the natural features of the soil and in each case the structures were in keeping and in harmony with the character of the landscape which they respectively adorned the harmony was however that of contrast and not of correspondence in greece where the landscape itself was grand and sublime the architect aimed only at beauty to have aimed at magnitude and grandeur in human structures among the mountains the cliffs the cataracts and the resounding ocean shores of greece would have been absurd the grecian artists were deterred by their unerring instincts from the attempt they accordingly built beautiful temples whose white and symmetrical colonnades adorned the declivities or crowned the summits of the hills they sculptured statues to be placed on pedestals in groves and gardens they constructed fountains they raised bridges and aqueducts on long ranges of arches and piers and the summits of ragged rocks crystallized as it were under their hands into towers battlements and walls in egypt on the other hand where the country itself was a level and unvarying plain the architecture took forms of prodigious magnitude of lofty elevation and of vast extent there were ranges of enormous columns colossal statues towering obelisks and pyramids rising like mountains from the verdure of the plain thus while nature gave to the country its elements of beauty man completed the landscape by adding to it the grand and the sublime  the shape and proportions of egypt would be represented by a green ribbon an inch wide and a yard long lying upon the ground in a serpentine form and to complete the model we might imagine a silver filament passing along the center of the green to denote the nile the real valley of verdure however is not of uniform breadth like the ribbon so representing it but widens as it approaches the sea as if there had been originally a gulf or estuary there which the sediment from the river had filled  in fact the rich and fertile plain which the alluvial deposits of the nile have formed has been protruded for some distance into the sea and the stream divides itself into three great branches about a hundred miles from its mouth two outermost of which with the seacoast in front inclose a vast triangle which was called the delta from the greek letter delta greek d which is of a triangular form in ascending the river beyond the delta the fertile plain at first twentyfive or thirty miles wide grows gradually narrower as the ranges of barren hills and tracts of sandy deserts on either hand draw nearer and nearer to the river thus the country consists of two long lines of rich and fertile intervals one on each side of the stream in the time of xerxes the whole extent was densely populated every little elevation of the land being covered with a village or a town the inhabitants tilled the land raising upon it vast stores of corn much of which was floated down the river to its mouth and taken thence to various countries of europe and asia in merchant ships over the mediterranean sea caravans too sometimes came across the neighboring deserts to obtain supplies of egyptian corn this was done by the sons of jacob when the crops failed them in the land of canaan as related in the sacred scriptures  there were two great natural wonders in egypt in ancient times as now first it never rained there or at least so seldom that rain was regarded as a marvelous phenomenon interrupting the ordinary course of nature like an earthquake in england or america the falling of drops of water out of clouds in the sky was an occurrence so strange so unaccountable that the whole population regarded it with astonishment and awe with the exception of these rare and wonderexciting instances there was no rain no snow no hail no clouds in the sky the sun was always shining and the heavens were always serene these meteorological characteristics of the country resulting as they do from permanent natural causes continue of course unchanged to the present day and the arabs who live now along the banks of the river keep their crops when harvested in heaps in the open air and require no roofs to their huts except a light covering of sheaves to protect the inmates from the sun  the other natural wonder of egypt was the annual rising of the nile about midsummer the peasantry who lived along the banks would find the river gradually beginning to rise the stream became more turbid too as the bosom of the waters swelled no cause for this mysterious increase appeared as the sky remained as blue and serene as before and the sun then nearly vertical continued to shine with even more than its wonted splendor the inhabitants however felt no surprise and asked for no explanation of the phenomenon it was the common course of nature at that season they had all witnessed it year after year from childhood they of course looked for it when the proper month came round and though they would have been amazed if the annual flood had failed they thought nothing extraordinary of its coming  when the swelling of the waters and the gradual filling of the channels and low grounds in the neighborhood of the river warned the people that the flood was at hand they all engaged busily in the work of completing their preparations the harvests were all gathered from the fields and the vast stores of fruit and corn which they yielded were piled in roofless granaries built on every elevated spot of ground where they would be safe from the approaching inundation the rise of the water was very gradual and slow streams began to flow in all directions over the land ponds and lakes growing every day more and more extended spread mysteriously over the surface of the meadows and all the time while this deluge of water was rising to submerge the land the air continued dry the sun was sultry and the sky was without a cloud  as the flood continued to rise the proportion of land and water and the conformation of the irregular and temporary shores which separated them were changed continually from day to day the inhabitants assembled in their villages which were built on rising grounds some natural others artificially formed the waters rose more and more until only these crowded islands appeared above its surfacewhen at length the valley presented to the view the spectacle of a vast expanse of water calm as a summers sea brilliant with the reflected rays of a tropical sun and canopied by a sky which displaying its spotless blue by day and its countless stars at night was always cloudless and serene  the inundation was at its height in october after that period the waters gradually subsided leaving a slimy and very fertilizing deposit all over the lands which they had covered though the inhabitants themselves who had been accustomed to this overflow from infancy felt no wonder or curiosity about its cause the philosophers of the day and travelers from other countries who visited egypt made many attempts to seek an explanation of the phenomenon they had three theories on the subject which herodotus mentions and discusses  the first explanation was that the rising of the river was occasioned by the prevalence of northerly winds on the mediterranean at that time of the year which drove back the waters at the mouth of the river and so caused the accumulation of the water in the upper parts of the valley herodotus thought that this was not a satisfactory explanation for sometimes as he said these northerly winds did not blow and yet the rising of the river took place none the less when the appointed season came besides there were other rivers similarly situated in respect to the influence of prevailing winds at sea in driving in the waters at their mouths which were nevertheless not subject to inundations like the nile  the second theory was that the nile took its rise not like other rivers in inland lakes or among inland mountains but in some remote and unknown ocean on the other side of the continent which ocean the advocates of this theory supposed might be subject to some great annual ebb and flow and from this it might result that at stated periods an unusual tide of waters might be poured into the channel of the river this however could not be true for the waters of the inundation were fresh not salt which proved that they were not furnished by any ocean  a third hypothesis was that the rising of the water was occasioned by the melting of the snows in summer on the mountains from which the sources of the river came against this supposition herodotus found more numerous and more satisfactory reasons even than he had advanced against the others in the first place the river came from the southa direction in which the heat increased in intensity with every league as far as travelers had explored it and beyond those limits they supposed that the burning sun made the country uninhabitable it was preposterous to suppose that there could be snow and ice there then besides the nile had been ascended to a great distance and reports from the natives had been brought down from regions still more remote and no tidings had ever been brought of ice and snow it was unreasonable therefore to suppose that the inundations could arise from such a cause  these scientific theories however were discussed only among philosophers and learned men the common people had a much more simple and satisfactory mode of disposing of the subject they in their imaginations invested the beneficent river with a sort of life and personality and when they saw its waters rising so gently but yet surely to overflow their whole land leaving it as they withdrew again endued with a new and exuberant fertility they imagined it a living and acting intelligence that in the exercise of some mysterious and inscrutable powers the nature of which was to them unknown and impelled by a kind and friendly regard for the country and its inhabitants came annually of its own accord to spread over the land the blessings of fertility and abundance the mysterious stream being viewed in this light its wonderful powers awakened their veneration and awe and its boundless beneficence their gratitude  illustration pheron defying the nile  among the ancient egyptian legends there is one relating to a certain king pheron which strikingly illustrates this feeling it seems that during one of the inundations while he was standing with his courtiers and watching the flow of the water the commotion in the stream was much greater than usual on account of a strong wind which was blowing at that time and which greatly increased the violence of the whirlpools and the force and swell of the boiling eddies there was given in fact to the appearance of the river an expression of anger and pheron who was of a proud and haughty character like most of the egyptian kings threw his javelin into one of the wildest of the whirlpools as a token of his defiance of its rage he was instantly struck blind  the sequel of the story is curious though it has no connection with the personality of the nile pheron remained blind for ten years at the end of that time it was announced to him by some supernatural communication that the period of his punishment had expired and that his sight might be brought back to him by the employment of a certain designated means of restoration which was the bathing of his eyes by a strictly virtuous woman pheron undertook compliance with the requisition without any idea that the finding of a virtuous woman would be a difficult task he first tried his own wife but her bathing produced no effect he then tried one after another various ladies of his court and afterward others of different rank and station selecting those who were most distinguished for the excellence of their characters he was disappointed however in them all the blindness continued unchanged at last however he found the wife of a peasant whose bathing produced the effect the monarchs sight was suddenly restored the king rewarded the peasant woman whose virtuous character was established by this indisputable test with the highest honors the others he collected together and then shut them up in one of his towns when they were all thus safely imprisoned he set the town on fire and burned them all up together  to return to the nile certain columns were erected in different parts of the valley on which cubits and the subdivisions of cubits were marked and numbered for the purpose of ascertaining precisely the rise of the water such a column was called a nilometer there was one near memphis which was at the upper point of the delta and others further up the river such pillars continue to be used to mark the height of the inundations to the present day  the object of thus accurately ascertaining the rise of the water was not mere curiosity for there were certain important business operations which depended upon the results the fertility and productiveness of the soil each year were determined almost wholly by the extent of the inundation and as the ability of the people to pay tribute depended upon their crops the nilometer furnished the government with a criterion by which they regulated the annual assessments of the taxes there were certain canals too made to convey the water to distant tracts of land which were opened or kept closed according as the water rose to a higher or lower point all these things were regulated by the indications of the nilometer  egypt was famed in the days of xerxes for those enormous structures and ruins of structures whose origin was then as now lost in a remote antiquity herodotus found the pyramids standing in his day and presenting the same spectacle of mysterious and solitary grandeur which they exhibited to napoleon he speculated on their origin and their history just as the philosophers and travelers of our day do in fact he knew less and could learn less about them than is known now it helps to impress our minds with an idea of the extreme antiquity of these and the other architectural wonders of egypt to compare them with things which are considered old in the western world the ancient and venerable colleges and halls of oxford and cambridge are many of them two or three hundred years old there are remains of the old wall of the city of london which has been standing seven hundred years this is considered a great antiquity there are however roman ruins in britain and in various parts of europe more ancient still they have been standing eighteen hundred years people look upon these with a species of wonder and awe that they have withstood the destructive influences of time so long but as to the pyramids if we go back twentyfive hundred years we find travelers visiting and describing them thenmonuments as ancient as venerable as mysterious and unknown in their eyes as they appear now in ours we judge that a mountain is very distant when after traveling many miles toward it it seems still as distant as ever now in tracing the history of the pyramids the obelisks the gigantic statues and the vast columnar ruins of the nile we may go back twentyfive hundred years without apparently making any progress whatever toward reaching their origin  such was egypt isolated as it was from the rest of the world and full of fertility and riches it offered a marked and definite object to the ambition of a conqueror in fact on account of the peculiar interest which this long and narrow valley of verdure with its wonderful structures the strange and anomalous course of nature which prevails in it and the extraordinary phases which human life in consequence exhibits there has always excited among mankind heroes and conquerors have generally considered it a peculiarly glorious field for their exploits cyrus the founder of the persian monarchy contemplated the subjugation of it he did not carry his designs into effect but left them for cambyses his son darius held the country as a dependency during his reign though near the close of his life it revolted this revolt took place while he was preparing for his grand expedition against greece and he was perplexed with the question which of the two undertakings the subjugation of the egyptians or the invasion of greece he should first engage in in the midst of this uncertainty he suddenly died leaving both the wars themselves and the perplexity of deciding between them as a part of the royal inheritance falling to his son  xerxes decided to prosecute the egyptian campaign first intending to postpone the conquest of greece till he had brought the valley of the nile once more under persian sway he deemed it dangerous to leave a province of his fathers empire in a state of successful rebellion while leading his armies off to new undertakings mardonius who was the commanderinchief of the army and the great general on whom xerxes mainly relied for the execution of his schemes was very reluctant to consent to this plan he was impatient for the conquest of greece there was little glory for him to acquire in merely suppressing a revolt and reconquering what had been already once subdued he was eager to enter upon a new field xerxes however overruled his wishes and the armies commenced their march for egypt they passed the land of judea on their way where the captives who had returned from babylon and their successors were rebuilding the cities and reoccupying the country xerxes confirmed them in the privileges which cyrus and darius had granted them and aided them in their work he then went on toward the nile the rebellion was easily put down in less than a year from the time of leaving susa he had reconquered the whole land of egypt punished the leaders of the revolt established his brother as viceroy of the country and returned in safety to susa  all this took place in the second year of his reign     chapter iii

of his plans were artabanus the uncle by whose decision the throne had been awarded to him and mardonius the commanderinchief of his armies xerxes himself was quite a young man of a proud and lofty yet generous character and full of selfconfidence and hope mardonius was much older but he was a soldier by profession and was eager to distinguish himself in some great military campaign it has always been unfortunate for the peace and happiness of mankind under all monarchical and despotic governments in every age of the world that through some depraved and unaccountable perversion of public sentiment those who are not born to greatness have had no means of attaining to it except as heroes in war many men have indeed by their mental powers or their moral excellences acquired an extended and lasting posthumous fame but in respect to all immediate and exalted distinction and honor it will be found on reviewing the history of the human race that there have generally been but two possible avenues to them on the one hand high birth and on the other the performance of great deeds of carnage and destruction there must be it seems as the only valid claim to renown either blood inherited or blood shed the glory of the latter is second indeed to that of the former but it is only second he who has sacked a city stands very high in the estimation of his fellows he yields precedence only to him whose grandfather sacked one  this state of things is now it is true rapidly undergoing a change the age of chivalry of military murder and robbery and of the glory of great deeds of carnage and blood is passing away and that of peace of industry and of achievements for promoting the comfort and happiness of mankind is coming the men who are now advancing to the notice of the world are those who through their commerce or their manufactures feed and clothe their fellowmen by millions or by opening new channels or new means for international intercourse civilize savages and people deserts while the glory of killing and destroying is less and less regarded and more and more readily forgotten  in the days of xerxes however there was no road to honor but by war and mardonius found that his only hope of rising to distinction was by conducting a vast torrent of military devastation over some portion of the globe and the fairer the richer the happier the scene which he was thus to inundate and overwhelm the greater would be the glory he was very much disposed therefore to urge on the invasion of greece by every means in his power  artabanus on the other hand the uncle of xerxes was a man advanced in years and of a calm and cautious disposition he was better aware than younger men of the vicissitudes and hazards of war and was much more inclined to restrain than to urge on the youthful ambition of his nephew xerxes had been able to present some show of reason for his campaign in egypt by calling the resistance which that country offered to his power a rebellion there was however no such reason in the case of greece there had been two wars between persia and the athenians already it is true in the first the athenians had aided their countrymen in asia minor in a fruitless attempt to recover their independence this the persian government considered as aiding and abetting a rebellion in the second the persians under datis one of dariuss generals had undertaken a grand invasion of greece and after landing in the neighborhood of athens were beaten with immense slaughter at the great battle of marathon near that city the former of these wars is known in history as the ionian rebellion the latter as the first persian invasion of greece they had both occurred during the reign of darius and the invasion under datis had taken place not many years before the accession of xerxes so that a great number of the officers who had served in that campaign were still remaining in the court and army of xerxes at susa these wars had however both been terminated and artabanus was very little inclined to have the contests renewed  xerxes however was bent upon making one more attempt to conquer greece and when the time arrived for commencing his preparations he called a grand council of the generals the nobles and the potentates of the realm to lay his plans before them the historian who narrated these proceedings recorded the debate that ensued in the following manner  xerxes himself first addressed the assembly to announce and explain his designs  the enterprise my friends said he in which i propose now to engage and in which i am about to ask your cooperation is no new scheme of my own devising what i design to do is on the other hand only the carrying forward of the grand course of measures marked out by my predecessors and pursued by them with steadiness and energy so long as the power remained in their hands that power has now descended to me and with it has devolved the responsibility of finishing the work which they so successfully began  it is the manifest destiny of persia to rule the world from the time that cyrus first commenced the work of conquest by subduing media to the present day the extent of our empire has been continually widening until now it covers all of asia and africa with the exception of the remote and barbarous tribes that like the wild beasts which share their forests with them are not worth the trouble of subduing these vast conquests have been made by the courage the energy and the military power of cyrus darius and cambyses my renowned predecessors they on their part have subdued asia and africa europe remains it devolves on me to finish what they have begun had my father lived he would himself have completed the work he had already made great preparations for the undertaking but he died leaving the task to me and it is plain that i can not hesitate to undertake it without a manifest dereliction of duty  you all remember the unprovoked and wanton aggressions which the athenians committed against us in the time of the ionian rebellion taking part against us with rebels and enemies they crossed the Ægean sea on that occasion invaded our territories and at last captured and burned the city of sardis the principal capital of our western empire i will never rest until i have had my revenge by burning athens many of you too who are here present remember the fate of the expedition under datis those of you who were attached to that expedition will have no need that i should urge you to seek revenge for your own wrongs i am sure that you will all second my undertaking with the utmost fidelity and zeal  my plan for gaining access to the grecian territories is not as before to convey the troops by a fleet of galleys over the Ægean sea but to build a bridge across the hellespont and march the army to greece by land this course which i am well convinced is practicable will be more safe than the other and the bridging of the hellespont will be of itself a glorious deed the greeks will be utterly unable to resist the enormous force which we shall be able to pour upon them we can not but conquer and inasmuch as beyond the greek territories there is as i am informed no other power at all able to cope with us we shall easily extend our empire on every side to the sea and thus the persian dominion will cover the whole habitable world  i am sure that i can rely on your cordial and faithful cooperation in these plans and that each one of you will bring me from his own province or territories as large a quota of men and of supplies for the war as is in his power they who contribute thus most liberally i shall consider as entitled to the highest honors and rewards  such was in substance the address of xerxes to his council he concluded by saying that it was not his wish to act in the affair in an arbitrary or absolute manner and he invited all present to express with perfect freedom any opinions or views which they entertained in respect to the enterprise  while xerxes had been speaking the soul of mardonius had been on fire with excitement and enthusiasm and every word which the king had uttered only fanned the flame he rose immediately when the king gave permission to the counselors to speak and earnestly seconded the monarchs proposals in the following words  for my part sire i can not refrain from expressing my high admiration of the lofty spirit and purpose on your part which leads you to propose to us an enterprise so worthy of your illustrious station and exalted personal renown your position and power at the present time are higher than those ever attained by any human sovereign that has ever lived and it is easy to foresee that there is a career of glory before you which no future monarch can ever surpass you are about to complete the conquest of the world that exploit can of course never be exceeded we all admire the proud spirit on your part which will not submit tamely to the aggressions and insults which we have received from the greeks we have conquered the people of india of egypt of ethiopia and of assyria and that too without having previously suffered any injury from them but solely from a noble love of dominion and shall we tamely stop in our career when we see nations opposed to us from whom we have received so many insults and endured so many wrongs every consideration of honor and manliness forbids it  we have nothing to fear in respect to the success of the enterprise in which you invite us to engage i know the greeks and i know that they can not stand against our arms i have encountered them many times and in various ways i met them in the provinces of asia minor and you all know the result i met them during the reign of darius your father in macedon and thraceor rather sought to meet them for though i marched through the country the enemy always avoided me they could not be found they have a great name it is true but in fact all their plans and arrangements are governed by imbecility and folly they are not ever united among themselves as they speak one common language any ordinary prudence and sagacity would lead them to combine together and make common cause against the nations that surround them instead of this they are divided into a multitude of petty states and kingdoms and all their resources and power are exhausted in fruitless contentions with each other i am convinced that once across the hellespont we can march to athens without finding any enemy to oppose our progress or if we should encounter any resisting force it will be so small and insignificant as to be instantly overwhelmed  in one point mardonius was nearly right in his predictions since it proved subsequently as will hereafter be seen that when the persian army reached the pass of thermopylæ which was the great avenue of entrance on the north into the territories of the greeks they found only three hundred men ready there to oppose their passage  when mardonius had concluded his speech he sat down and quite a solemn pause ensued the nobles and chieftains generally were less ready than he to encounter the hazards and uncertainties of so distant a campaign xerxes would acquire by the success of the enterprise a great accession to his wealth and to his dominion and mardonius too might expect to reap very rich rewards but what were they themselves to gain they did not dare however to seem to oppose the wishes of the king and notwithstanding the invitation which he had given them to speak they remained silent not knowing in fact exactly what to say  all this time artabanus the venerable uncle of xerxes sat silent like the rest hesitating whether his years his rank and the relation which he sustained to the young monarch would justify his interposing and make it prudent and safe for him to attempt to warn his nephew of the consequences which he would hazard by indulging his dangerous ambition at length he determined to speak  i hope said he addressing the king that it will not displease you to have other views presented in addition to those which have already been expressed it is better that all opinions should be heard the just and the true will then appear the more just and true by comparison with others it seems to me that the enterprise which you contemplate is full of danger and should be well considered before it is undertaken when darius your father conceived of the plan of his invasion of the country of the scythians beyond the danube i counseled him against the attempt the benefits to be secured by such an undertaking seemed to me wholly insufficient to compensate for the expense the difficulties and the dangers of it my counsels were however overruled your father proceeded on the enterprise he crossed the bosporus traversed thrace and then crossed the danube but after a long and weary contest with the hordes of savages which he found in those trackless wilds he was forced to abandon the undertaking and return with the loss of half his army the plan which you propose seems to me to be liable to the same dangers and i fear very much that it will lead to the same results  the greeks have the name of being a valiant and formidable foe it may prove in the end that they are so they certainly repulsed datis and all his forces vast as they were and compelled them to retire with an enormous loss your invasion i grant will be more formidable than his you will throw a bridge across the hellespont so as to take your troops round through the northern parts of europe into greece and you will also at the same time have a powerful fleet in the Ægean sea but it must be remembered that the naval armaments of the greeks in all those waters are very formidable they may attack and destroy your fleet suppose that they should do so and that then proceeding to the northward in triumph they should enter the hellespont and destroy your bridge your retreat would be cut off and in case of a reverse of fortune your army would be exposed to total ruin  your father in fact very narrowly escaped precisely this fate the scythians came to destroy his bridge across the danube while his forces were still beyond the river and had it not been for the very extraordinary fidelity and zeal of histiæus who had been left to guard the post they would have succeeded in doing it it is frightful to think that the whole persian army with the sovereign of the empire at their head were placed in a position where their being saved from overwhelming and total destruction depended solely on the fidelity and firmness of a single man should you place your forces and your own person in the same danger can you safely calculate upon the same fortunate escape  even the very vastness of your force may be the means of insuring and accelerating its destruction since whatever rises to extraordinary elevation and greatness is always exposed to dangers correspondingly extraordinary and great thus tall trees and lofty towers seem always specially to invite the thunderbolts of heaven  mardonius charges the greeks with a want of sagacity efficiency and valor and speaks contemptuously of them as soldiers in every respect i do not think that such imputations are just to the people against whom they are directed or honorable to him who makes them to disparage the absent especially an absent enemy is not magnanimous or wise and i very much fear that it will be found in the end that the conduct of the greeks will evince very different military qualities from those which mardonius has assigned them they are represented by common fame as sagacious hardy efficient and brave and it may prove that these representations are true  my counsel therefore is that you dismiss this assembly and take further time to consider this subject before coming to a final decision perhaps on more mature reflection you will conclude to abandon the project altogether if you should not conclude to abandon it but should decide on the other hand that it must be prosecuted let me entreat you not to go yourself in company with the expedition let mardonius take the charge and the responsibility if he does so i predict that he will leave the dead bodies of the soldiers that you intrust to him to be devoured by dogs on the plains of athens or lacedæmon  xerxes was exceedingly displeased at hearing such a speech as this from his uncle and he made a very angry reply he accused artabanus of meanness of spirit and of a cowardice disgraceful to his rank and station in thus advocating a tame submission to the arrogant pretensions of the greeks were it not he said for the respect which he felt for artabanus as his fathers brother he would punish him severely for his presumption in thus basely opposing his sovereigns plans as it is continued he i will carry my plans into effect but you shall not have the honor of accompanying me you shall remain at susa with the women and children of the palace and spend your time in the effeminate and ignoble pleasures suited to a spirit so mean as for myself i must and will carry my designs into execution i could not in fact long avoid a contest with the greeks even if i were to adopt the cowardly and degrading policy which you recommend for i am confident that they will very soon invade my dominions if i do not anticipate them by invading theirs  so saying xerxes dismissed the assembly  his mind however was not at ease though he had so indignantly rejected the counsel which artabanus had offered him yet the impressive words in which it had been uttered and the arguments with which it had been enforced weighed upon his spirit and oppressed and dejected him the longer he considered the subject the more serious his doubts and fears became until at length as the night approached he became convinced that artabanus was right and that he himself was wrong his mind found no rest until he came to the determination to abandon the project after all he resolved to make this change in his resolution known to artabanus and his nobles in the morning and to countermand the orders which he had given for the assembling of the troops having by this decision restored something like repose to his agitated mind he laid himself down upon his couch and went to sleep  in the night he saw a vision it seemed to him that a resplendent and beautiful form appeared before him and after regarding him a moment with an earnest look addressed him as follows  and do you really intend to abandon your deliberate design of leading an array into greece after having formally announced it to the realm and issued your orders such fickleness is absurd and will greatly dishonor you resume your plan and go on boldly and perseveringly to the execution of it  so saying the vision disappeared  when xerxes awoke in the morning and the remembrance of the events of the preceding day returned mingling itself with the new impressions which had been made by the dream he was again agitated and perplexed as however the various influences which pressed upon him settled to their final equilibrium the fears produced by artabanuss substantial arguments and warnings on the preceding day proved to be of greater weight than the empty appeal to his pride which had been made by the phantom of the night he resolved to persist in the abandonment of his scheme he called his council accordingly together again and told them that on more mature reflection he had become convinced that his uncle was right and that he himself had been wrong the project therefore was for the present suspended and the orders for the assembling of the forces were revoked the announcement was received by the members of the council with the most tumultuous joy  that night xerxes had another dream the same spirit appeared to him again his countenance however bearing now instead of the friendly look of the preceding night a new and stern expression of displeasure pointing menacingly at the frightened monarch with his finger he exclaimed you have rejected my advice you have abandoned your plan and now i declare to you that unless you immediately resume your enterprise and carry it forward to the end short as has been the time since you were raised to your present elevation a still shorter period shall elapse before your downfall and destruction  the spirit then disappeared as suddenly as it came leaving xerxes to awake in an agony of terror  as soon as it was day xerxes sent for artabanus and related to him his dreams i was willing said he after hearing what you said and maturely considering the subject to give up my plan but these dreams i can not but think are intimations from heaven that i ought to proceed  artabanus attempted to combat this idea by representing to xerxes that dreams were not to be regarded as indications of the will of heaven but only as a vague and disordered reproduction of the waking thoughts while the regular action of the reason and the judgment by which they were ordinarily controlled was suspended or disturbed by the influence of slumber xerxes maintained on the other hand that though this view of the case might explain his first vision the solemn repetition of the warning proved that it was supernatural and divine he proposed that to put the reality of the apparition still further to the test artabanus should take his place on the royal couch the next night to see if the specter would not appear to him you shall clothe yourself said he in my robes put the crown upon your head and take your seat upon the throne after that you shall retire to my apartment lie down upon the couch and go to sleep if the vision is supernatural it will undoubtedly appear to you if it does not so appear i will admit that it was nothing but a dream  artabanus made some objection at first to the details of the arrangement which xerxes proposed as he did not see he said of what advantage it could be for him to assume the guise and habiliments of the king if the vision was divine it could not be deceived by such artifices as those xerxes however insisted on his proposition and artabanus yielded he assumed for an hour the dress and the station of the king and then retired to the kings apartment and laid himself down upon the couch under the royal pavilion as he had no faith in the reality of the vision his mind was quiet and composed and he soon fell asleep  at midnight xerxes who was lying in an adjoining apartment was suddenly aroused by a loud and piercing cry from the room where artabanus was sleeping and in a moment afterward artabanus himself rushed in perfectly wild with terror he had seen the vision it had appeared before him with a countenance and gestures expressive of great displeasure and after loading him with reproaches for having attempted to keep xerxes back from his proposed expedition into greece it attempted to bore out his eyes with a redhot iron with which it was armed artabanus had barely succeeded in escaping by leaping from his couch and rushing precipitately out of the roomd  footnote d see frontispiece  artabanus said that he was now convinced and satisfied it was plainly the divine will that xerxes should undertake his projected invasion and he would himself thenceforth aid the enterprise by every means in his power the council was accordingly once more convened the story of the three apparitions was related to them and the final decision announced that the armies were to be assembled for the march without any further delay                                       it is proper here to repeat once for all in this volume a remark which has elsewhere often been made in the various works of this series that in studying ancient history at the present day it is less important now to know in regard to transactions so remote what the facts actually were which really occurred than it is to know the story respecting them which for the last two thousand years has been in circulation among mankind it is now for example of very little consequence whether there ever was or never was such a personage as hercules but it is essential that every educated man should know the story which ancient writers tell in relating his doings in this view of the case our object in this volume is simply to give the history of xerxes just as it stands without stopping to separate the false from the true in relating the occurrences therefore which have been described in this chapter we simply give the alleged facts to our readers precisely as the ancient historians give them to us leaving each reader to decide for himself how far he will believe the narrative in respect to this particular story we will add that some people think that mardonius was really the ghost by whose appearance artabanus and xerxes were so dreadfully frightened     chapter iv  preparations for the invasion of greece  bc

the various authorities and powers to make the necessary preparations there were men to be levied arms to be manufactured ships to be built and stores of food to be provided the expenditures too of so vast an armament as xerxes was intending to organize would require a large supply of money for all these things xerxes relied on the revenues and the contributions of the provinces and orders very full and very imperative were transmitted accordingly to all the governors and satraps of asia and especially to those who ruled over the countries which lay near the western confines of the empire and consequently near the greek frontiers  in modern times it is the practice of powerful nations to accumulate arms and munitions of war on storage in arsenals and naval depôts so that the necessary supplies for very extended operations whether of attack or defense can be procured in a very short period of time in respect to funds too modern nations have a great advantage over those of former days in case of any sudden emergency arising to call for great and unusual expenditures in consequence of the vast accumulation of capital in the hands of private individuals and the confidence which is felt in the mercantile honor and good faith of most established governments at the present day these governments can procure indefinite supplies of gold and silver at any time by promising to pay an annual interest in lieu of the principal borrowed it is true that in these cases a stipulation is made by which the government may at a certain specified period pay back the principal and so extinguish the annuity but in respect to a vast portion of the amount so borrowed it is not expected that this repayment will ever be made the creditors in fact do not desire that it should be as owners of property always prefer a safe annual income from it to the custody of the principal and thus governments in good credit have sometimes induced their creditors to abate the rate of interest which they were receiving by threatening otherwise to pay the debt in full  these inventions however by which a government in one generation may enjoy the pleasure and reap the glory of waging war and throw the burden of the expense on another were not known in ancient times xerxes did not understand the art of funding a national debt and there would besides have probably been very little confidence in persian stocks if any had been issued he had to raise all his funds by actual taxation and to have his arms and his ships and chariots of war manufactured express the food too to sustain the immense army which he was to raise was all to be produced and storehouses were to be built for the accumulation and custody of it all this as might naturally be expected would require time and the vastness of the scale on which these immense preparations were made is evinced by the fact that four years were the time allotted for completing them this period includes however a considerable time before the great debate on the subject described in the last chapter  the chief scene of activity during all this time was the tract of country in the western part of asia minor and along the shores of the Ægean sea taxes and contributions were raised from all parts of the empire but the actual material of war was furnished mainly from those provinces which were nearest to the future scene of it each district provided such things as it naturally and most easily produced one contributed horses another arms and ammunition another ships and another provisions the ships which were built were of various forms and modes of construction according to the purposes which they were respectively intended to serve some were strictly ships of war intended for actual combat others were transports their destination being simply the conveyance of troops or of military stores there were also a large number of vessels which were built on a peculiar model prescribed by the engineers being very long and straightsided and smooth and flat upon their decks these were intended for the bridge across the hellespont they were made long so that when placed side by side across the stream a greater breadth might be given to the platform of the bridge all these things were very deliberately and carefully planned  although it was generally on the asiatic side of the Ægean sea that these vast works of preparation were going on and the crossing of the hellespont was to be the first great movement of the persian army the reader must not suppose that even at this time the european shores were wholly in the hands of the greeks the persians had long before conquered thrace and a part of macedon and thus the northern shores of the Ægean sea and many of the islands were already in xerxess hands the greek dominions lay further south and xerxes did not anticipate any opposition from the enemy until his army after crossing the strait should have advanced to the neighborhood of athens in fact all the northern country through which his route would lie was already in his hands and in passing through it he anticipated no difficulties except such as should arise from the elements themselves and the physical obstacles of the way the hellespont itself was of course one principal point of danger the difficulty here was to be surmounted by the bridge of boats there was however another point which was in some respects still more formidable it was the promontory of mount athos  by looking at the map of greece placed at the commencement of the next chapter the reader will see that there are two or three singular promontories jutting out from the main land in the northwestern part of the Ægean sea the most northerly and the largest of these was formed by an immense mountainous mass rising out of the water and connected by a narrow isthmus with the main land the highest summit of this rocky pile was called mount athos in ancient times and is so marked upon the map in modern days it is called monte santo or holy mountain being covered with monasteries and convents and other ecclesiastical establishments built in the middle ages  mount athos is very celebrated in ancient history it extended along the promontory for many miles and terminated abruptly in lofty cliffs and precipices toward the sea where it was so high that its shadow as was said was thrown at sunset across the water to the island of lemnos a distance of twenty leagues it was a frightful specter in the eyes of the ancient navigators when as they came coasting along from the north in their frail galleys on their voyages to greece and italy they saw it frowning defiance to them as they came with threatening clouds hanging upon its summit and the surges and surf of the Ægean perpetually thundering upon its base below to make this stormy promontory the more terrible it was believed to be the haunt of innumerable uncouth and misshapen monsters of the sea that lived by devouring the hapless seamen who were thrown upon the rocks from their wrecked vessels by the merciless tumult of the waves  the plan which xerxes had formed for the advance of his expedition was that the army which was to cross the hellespont by the bridge should advance thence through macedonia and thessaly by land attended by a squadron of ships transports and galleys which was to accompany the expedition along the coast by sea the men could be marched more conveniently to their place of destination by land the stores on the other hand the arms the supplies and the baggage of every description could be transported more easily by sea mardonius was somewhat solicitous in respect to the safety of the great squadron which would be required for this latter service in doubling the promontory of mount athos  in fact he had special and personal reason for his solicitude for he had himself some years before met with a terrible disaster at this very spot it was during the reign of darius that this disaster occurred on one of the expeditions which darius had intrusted to his charge he was conducting a very large fleet along the coast when a sudden storm arose just as he was approaching this terrible promontory  he was on the northern side of the promontory when the storm came on and as the wind was from the north it blew directly upon the shore for the fleet to make its escape from the impending danger it seemed necessary therefore to turn the course of the ships back against the wind but this on account of the sudden and terrific violence of the gale it was impossible to do the sails when they attempted to use them were blown away by the howling gusts and the oars were broken to pieces by the tremendous dashing of the sea it soon appeared that the only hope of escape for the squadron was to press on in the desperate attempt to double the promontory and thus gain if possible the sheltered water under its lee the galleys accordingly went on the pilots and the seamen exerting their utmost to keep them away from the shore  all their efforts however to do this were vain the merciless gales drove the vessels one after another upon the rocks and dashed them to pieces while the raging sea wrenched the wretched mariners from the wrecks to which they attempted to cling and tossed them out into the boiling whirlpools around to the monsters that were ready there to devour them as if she were herself some ferocious monster feeding her offspring with their proper prey a few it is true of the hapless wretches succeeded in extricating themselves from the surf by crawling up upon the rocks through the tangled seaweed until they were above the reach of the surges but when they had done so they found themselves hopelessly imprisoned between the impending precipices which frowned above them and the frantic billows which were raging and roaring below they gained of course by their apparent escape only a brief prolongation of suffering for they all soon miserably perished from exhaustion exposure and cold  mardonius had no desire to encounter this danger again now the promontory of mount athos though high and rocky itself was connected with the main land by an isthmus level and low and not very broad xerxes determined on cutting a canal through this isthmus so as to take his fleet of galleys across the neck and thus avoid the stormy navigation of the outward passage such a canal would be of service not merely for the passage of the great fleet but for the constant communication which it would be necessary for xerxes to maintain with his own dominions during the whole period of the invasion  it might have been expected that the greeks would have interfered to prevent the execution of such a work as this but it seems that they did not and yet there was a considerable greek population in that vicinity the promontory of athos itself was quite extensive being about thirty miles long and four or five wide and it had several towns upon it the canal which xerxes was to cut across the neck of this peninsula was to be wide enough for two triremes to pass each other triremes were galleys propelled by three banks of oars and were vessels of the largest class ordinarily employed and as the oars by which they were impelled required almost as great a breadth of water as the vessels themselves the canal was consequently to be very wide  the engineers accordingly laid out the ground and marking the boundaries by stakes and lines as guides to the workmen the excavation was commenced immense numbers of men were set at work arranged regularly in gangs according to the various nations which furnished them as the excavation gradually proceeded and the trench began to grow deep they placed ladders against the sides and stationed a series of men upon them then the earth dug from the bottom was hauled up from one to another in a sort of basket or hod until it reached the top where it was taken by other men and conveyed away  the work was very much interrupted and impeded in many parts of the line by the continual caving in of the banks on account of the workmen attempting to dig perpendicularly down in one sectionthe one which had been assigned to the phoeniciansthis difficulty did not occur for the phoenicians more considerate than the rest had taken the precaution to make the breadth of their part of the trench twice as great at the top as it was below by this means the banks on each side were formed to a gradual slope and consequently stood firm the canal was at length completed and the water was let in  north of the promontory of mount athos the reader will find upon the map the river strymon flowing south not far from the boundary between macedon and thrace into the Ægean sea the army of xerxes in its march from the hellespont would of course have to cross this river and xerxes having by cutting the canal across the isthmus of mount athos removed an obstacle in the way of his fleet resolved next to facilitate the progress of his army by bridging the strymon  the king also ordered a great number of granaries and storehouses to be built at various points along the route which it was intended that his army should pursue some of these were on the coasts of macedonia and thrace and some on the banks of the strymon to these magazines the corn raised in asia for the use of the expedition was conveyed from time to time in transport ships as fast as it was ready and being safely deposited was protected by a guard no very extraordinary means of defense seems to have been thought necessary at these points for although the scene of all these preliminary arrangements was on the european side of the line and in what was called greek territory still this part of the country had been long under persian dominion the independent states and cities of greece were all further south and the people who inhabited them did not seem disposed to interrupt these preparations perhaps they were not aware to what object and end all these formidable movements on their northern frontier were tending  xerxes during all this time had remained in persia the period at length arrived when his preparations on the frontiers being far advanced toward completion he concluded to move forward at the head of his forces to sardis sardis was the great capital of the western part of his dominions and was situated not far from the frontier he accordingly assembled his forces and taking leave of his capital of susa with much parade and many ceremonies he advanced toward asia minor entering and traversing asia minor he crossed the halys which had been in former times the western boundary of the empire though its limits had now been extended very far beyond having crossed the halys the immense procession advanced into phrygia  a very romantic tale is told of an interview between xerxes and a certain nobleman named pythius who resided in one of the phrygian towns the circumstances were these after crossing the halys which river flows north into the euxine sea the army went on to the westward through nearly the whole extent of phrygia until at length they came to the sources of the streams which flowed west into the Ægean sea one of the most remarkable of these rivers was the meander there was a town built exactly at the source of the meanderso exactly in fact that the fountain from which the stream took its rise was situated in the public square of the town walled in and ornamented like an artificial fountain in a modern city the name of this town was celænæ  when the army reached celænæ and encamped there pythius made a great entertainment for the officers which as the number was very large was of course attended with an enormous expense not satisfied with this pythius sent word to the king that if he was in any respect in want of funds for his approaching campaign he pythius would take great pleasure in supplying him  xerxes was surprised at such proofs of wealth and munificence from a man in comparatively a private station he inquired of his attendants who pythius was they replied that next to xerxes himself he was the richest man in the world they said moreover that he was as generous as he was rich he had made darius a present of a beautiful model of a fruittree and of a vine of solid gold he was by birth they added a lydian  lydia was west of phrygia and was famous for its wealth the river pactolus which was so celebrated for its golden sands flowed through the country and as the princes and nobles contrived to monopolize the treasures which were found both in the river itself and in the mountains from which it flowed some of them became immensely wealthy  xerxes was astonished at the accounts which he heard of pythiuss fortune he sent for him and asked him what was the amount of his treasures this was rather an ominous question for under such despotic governments as those of the persian kings the only real safeguard of wealth was often the concealment of it inquiry on the part of a government in respect to treasures accumulated by a subject was often only a preliminary to the seizure and confiscation of them  pythius however in reply to the kings question said that he had no hesitation in giving his majesty full information in respect to his fortune he had been making he said a careful calculation of the amount of it with a view of determining how much he could offer to contribute in aid of the persian campaign he found he said that he had two thousand talents of silver and four millions wanting seven thousand of staters of gold  the stater was a persian coin even if we knew at the present day its exact value we could not determine the precise amount denoted by the sum which pythius named the value of money being subject to such vast fluctuations in different ages of the world scholars who have taken an interest in inquiring into such points as these have come to the conclusion that the amount of gold and silver coin which pythius thus reported to xerxes was equal to about thirty millions of dollars  pythius added after stating the amount of the gold and silver which he had at command that it was all at the service of the king for the purpose of carrying on the war he had he said besides his money slaves and farms enough for his own maintenance  xerxes was extremely gratified at this generosity and at the proof which it afforded of the interest which pythius felt in the cause of the king you are the only man said he who has offered hospitality to me or to my army since i set out upon this march and in addition to your hospitality you tender me your whole fortune i will not however deprive you of your treasure i will on the contrary order my treasurer to pay to you the seven thousand staters necessary to make your four millions complete i offer you also my friendship and will do any thing in my power now and hereafter to serve you continue to live in the enjoyment of your fortune if you always act under the influence of the noble and generous impulses which govern you now you will never cease to be prosperous and happy  if we could end the account of pythius and xerxes here what generous and nobleminded men we might suppose them to be but alas how large a portion of the apparent generosity and nobleness which shows itself among potentates and kings turns into selfishness and hypocrisy when closely examined pythius was one of the most merciless tyrants that ever lived he held all the people that lived upon his vast estates in a condition of abject slavery compelling them to toil continually in his mines in destitution and wretchedness in order to add more and more to his treasures the people came to his wife with their bitter complaints she pitied them but could not relieve them one day it is said that in order to show her husband the vanity and folly of living only to amass silver and gold and to convince him how little real power such treasures have to satisfy the wants of the human soul she made him a great entertainment in which there was a boundless profusion of wealth in the way of vessels and furniture of silver and gold but scarcely any food there was every thing to satisfy the eye with the sight of magnificence but nothing to satisfy hunger the noble guest sat starving in the midst of a scene of unexampled riches and splendor because it was not possible to eat silver and gold  and as for xerxess professions of gratitude and friendship for pythius they were put to the test a short time after the transactions which we have above described in a remarkable manner pythius had five sons they were all in xerxess army by their departure on the distant and dangerous expedition on which xerxes was to lead them their father would be left alone pythius under these circumstances resolved to venture so far on the sincerity of his sovereigns professions of regard as to request permission to retain one of his sons at home with his father on condition of freely giving up the rest  xerxes on hearing this proposal was greatly enraged how dare you said he come to me with such a demand you and all that pertain to you are my slaves and are bound to do my bidding without a murmur you deserve the severest punishment for such an insolent request in consideration however of your past good behavior i will not inflict upon you what you deserve i will only kill one of your sonsthe one that you seem to cling to so fondly i will spare the rest so saying the enraged king ordered the son whom pythius had endeavored to retain to be slain before his eyes and then directed that the dead body should be split in two and the two halves thrown the one on the right side of the road and the other on the left that his army as he said might march between them  on leaving phrygia the army moved on toward the west their immediate destination as has already been said was sardis where they were to remain until the ensuing spring the historian mentions a number of objects of interest which attracted the attention of xerxes and his officers on this march which mark the geographical peculiarities of the country or illustrate in some degree the ideas and manners of the times  there was one town for example situated not like celænæ where a river had its origin but where one disappeared the stream was a branch of the meander it came down from the mountains like any other mountain torrent and then at the town in question it plunged suddenly down into a gulf or chasm and disappeared it rose again at a considerable distance below and thence flowed on without any further evasions to the meander  on the confines between phrygia and lydia the army came to a place where the road divided one branch turned toward the north and led to lydia the other inclined to the south and conducted to caria here too on the frontier was a monument which had been erected by croesus the great king of lydia who lived in cyruss day to mark the eastern boundaries of his kingdom the persians were of course much interested in looking upon this ancient landmark which designated not only the eastern limit of croesuss empire but also what was in ancient times the western limit of their own  there was a certain species of tree which grew in these countries called the planetree xerxes found one of these trees so large and beautiful that it attracted his special admiration he took possession of it in his own name and adorned it with golden chains and set a guard over it this idolization of a tree was a striking instance of the childish caprice and folly by which the actions of the ancient despots were so often governed  as the army advanced they came to other places of interest and objects of curiosity and wonder there was a district where the people made a sort of artificial honey from grain and a lake from which the inhabitants procured salt by evaporation and mines too of silver and of gold these objects interested and amused the minds of the persians as they moved along without however at all retarding or interrupting their progress in due time they reached the great city of sardis in safety and here xerxes established his headquarters and awaited the coming of spring  in the mean time however he sent heralds into greece to summon the country to surrender to him this is a common formality when an army is about to attack either a town a castle or a kingdom xerxess heralds crossed the Ægean sea and made their demands in xerxess name upon the greek authorities as might have been expected the embassage was fruitless and the heralds returned bringing with them from the greeks not acts or proffers of submission but stern expressions of hostility and defiance nothing of course now remained but that both parties should prepare for the impending crisis     chapter v  crossing the hellespont  bc 480  winter in asia minordestruction of the bridgeindignation of xerxeshis ridiculous punishment of the

passagescene of confusion   although the ancient asia minor was in the same latitude as new york there was yet very little winter there snows fell indeed upon the summits of the mountains and ice formed occasionally upon quiet streams and yet in general the imaginations of the inhabitants in forming mental images of frost and snow sought them not in their own winters but in the cold and icy regions of the north of which however scarcely any thing was known to them except what was disclosed by wild and exaggerated rumors and legends  illustration map of greece  there was however a period of blustering winds and chilly rains which was called winter and xerxes was compelled to wait before commencing his invasion until the inclement season had passed as it was he did not wholly escape the disastrous effects of the wintery gales a violent storm arose while he was at sardis and broke up the bridge which he had built across the hellespont when the tidings of this disaster were brought to xerxes at his winter quarters he was very much enraged he was angry both with the sea for having destroyed the structure and with the architects who had built it for not having made it strong enough to stand against its fury he determined to punish both the waves and the workmen he ordered the sea to be scourged with a monstrous whip and directed that heavy chains should be thrown into it as symbols of his defiance of its power and of his determination to subject it to his control the men who administered this senseless discipline cried out to the sea as they did it in the following words which xerxes had dictated to them miserable monster this is the punishment which xerxes your master inflicts upon you on account of the unprovoked and wanton injury you have done him be assured that he will pass over you whether you will or no he hates and defies you object as you are through your insatiable cruelty and the nauseous bitterness of your waters of the common abomination of mankind  as for the men who had built the bridge which had been found thus inadequate to withstand the force of a wintery tempest he ordered every one of them to be beheaded  the vengeance of the king being thus satisfied a new set of engineers and workmen were designated and ordered to build another bridge knowing as of course they now did that their lives depended upon the stability of their structure they omitted no possible precaution which could tend to secure it they selected the strongest ships and arranged them in positions which would best enable them to withstand the pressure of the current each vessel was secured in its place by strong anchors placed scientifically in such a manner as to resist to the best advantage the force of the strain to which they would be exposed there were two ranges of these vessels extending from shore to shore containing over three hundred in each in each range one or two vessels were omitted on the asiatic side to allow boats and galleys to pass through in order to keep the communication open these omissions did not interfere with the use of the bridge as the superstructure and the roadway above was continued over them  the vessels which were to serve for the foundation of the bridge being thus arranged and secured in their places two immense cables were made and stretched from shore to shore each being fastened at the ends securely to the banks and resting in the middle on the decks of the vessels for the fastenings of these cables on the shore there were immense piles driven into the ground and huge rings attached to the piles the cables as they passed along the decks of the vessels over the water were secured to them all by strong cordage so that each vessel was firmly and indissolubly bound to all the rest  over these cables a platform was made of trunks of trees with branches placed upon them to fill the interstices and level the surface the whole was then covered with a thick stratum of earth which made a firm and substantial road like that of a public highway a high and close fence was also erected on each side so as to shut off the view of the water which might otherwise alarm the horses and the beasts of burden that were to cross with the army  when the news was brought to xerxes at sardis that the bridge was completed and that all things were ready for the passage he made arrangements for commencing his march a circumstance however here occurred that at first alarmed him it was no less a phenomenon than an eclipse of the sun eclipses were considered in those days as extraordinary and supernatural omens and xerxes was naturally anxious to know what this sudden darkness was meant to portend he directed the magi to consider the subject and to give him their opinion their answer was that as the sun was the guardian divinity of the greeks and the moon that of the persians the meaning of the sudden withdrawal of the light of day doubtless was that heaven was about to withhold its protection from the greeks in the approaching struggle xerxes was satisfied with this explanation and the preparations for the march went on  the movement of the grand procession from the city of sardis was inconceivably splendid first came the long trains of baggage on mules and camels and horses and other beasts of burden attended by the drivers and the men who had the baggage in charge next came an immense body of troops of all nations marching irregularly but under the command of the proper officers then after a considerable interval came a body of a thousand horse splendidly caparisoned and followed by a thousand spearmen who marched trailing their spears upon the ground in token of respect and submission to the king who was coming behind them  next to these troops and immediately in advance of the king were certain religious and sacred objects and personages on which the people who gazed upon this gorgeous spectacle looked with the utmost awe and veneration there were first ten sacred horses splendidly caparisoned each led by his groom who was clothed in appropriate robes as a sort of priest officiating in the service of a god behind these came the sacred car of jupiter this car was very large and elaborately worked and was profusely ornamented with gold it was drawn by eight white horses no human being was allowed to set his foot upon any part of it and consequently the reins of the horses were carried back under the car to the charioteer who walked behind xerxess own chariot came next drawn by very splendid horses selected especially for their size and beauty his charioteer a young persian noble sat by his side  then came great bodies of troops there was one corps of two thousand men the lifeguards of the king who were armed in a very splendid and costly manner to designate their high rank in the army and the exalted nature of their duty as personal attendants on the sovereign one thousand of these lifeguards were foot soldiers and the other thousand horsemen after the lifeguards came a body of ten thousand infantry and after them ten thousand cavalry this completed what was strictly the persian part of the army there was an interval of about a quarter of a mile in the rear of these bodies of troops and then came a vast and countless multitude of servants attendants adventurers and camp followers of every descriptiona confused promiscuous disorderly and noisy throng  the immediate destination of this vast horde was abydos for it was between sestos on the european shore and abydos on the asiatic that the bridge had been built to reach abydos the route was north through the province of mysia in their progress the guides of the army kept well inland so as to avoid the indentations of the coast and the various small rivers which here flow westward toward the sea thus advancing the army passed to the right of mount ida and arrived at last on the bank of the scamander here they encamped they were upon the plain of troy  the world was filled in those days with the glory of the military exploits which had been performed some ages before in the siege and capture of troy and it was the custom for every military hero who passed the site of the city to pause in his march and spend some time amid the scenes of those ancient conflicts that he might inspirit and invigorate his own ambition by the associations of the spot and also render suitable honors to the memories of those that fell there xerxes did this alexander subsequently did it xerxes examined the various localities ascended the ruins of the citadel of priam walked over the ancient battle fields and at length when his curiosity had thus been satisfied he ordered a grand sacrifice of a thousand oxen to be made and a libation of corresponding magnitude to be offered in honor of the shades of the dead heroes whose deeds had consecrated the spot  whatever excitement and exhilaration however xerxes himself may have felt in approaching under these circumstances the transit of the stream where the real labors and dangers of his expedition were to commence his miserable and helpless soldiers did not share them their condition and prospects were wretched in the extreme in the first place none of them went willingly in modern times at least in england and america armies are recruited by enticing the depraved and the miserable to enlist by tendering them a bounty as it is called that is a sum of ready money which as a means of temporary and often vicious pleasure presents a temptation they can not resist the act of enlistment is however in a sense voluntary so that those who have homes and friends and useful pursuits in which they are peacefully engaged are not disturbed it was not so with the soldiers of xerxes they were slaves and had been torn from their rural homes all over the empire by a merciless conscription from which there was no possible escape their life in camp too was comfortless and wretched at the present day when it is so much more difficult than it then was to obtain soldiers and when so much more time and attention are required to train them to their work in the modern art of war soldiers must be taken care of when obtained but in xerxess day it was much easier to get new supplies of recruits than to incur any great expense in providing for the health and comfort of those already in the service the arms and trappings it is true of such troops as were in immediate attendance on the king were very splendid and gay though this was only decoration after all and the kings decoration too not theirs in respect however to every thing like personal comfort whether of food and of clothing or the means of shelter and repose the common soldiers were utterly destitute and wretched they felt no interest in the campaign they had nothing to hope for from its success but a continuance if their lives were spared of the same miserable bondage which they had always endured there was however little probability even of this for whether in the case of such an invasion the aggressor was to succeed or to fail the destiny of the soldiers personally was almost inevitable destruction the mass of xerxess army was thus a mere herd of slaves driven along by the whips of their officers reluctant wretched and despairing  this helpless mass was overtaken one night among the gloomy and rugged defiles and passes of mount ida by a dreadful storm of wind and rain accompanied by thunder and lightning unprovided as they were with the means of protection against such tempests they were thrown into confusion and spent the night in terror great numbers perished struck by the lightning or exhausted by the cold and exposure and afterward when they encamped on the plains of troy near the scamander the whole of the water of the stream was not enough to supply the wants of the soldiers and the immense herds of beasts of burden so that many thousands suffered severely from thirst  all these things conspired greatly to depress the spirits of the men so that at last when they arrived in the vicinity of abydos the whole army was in a state of extreme dejection and despair this however was of little consequence the repose of a master so despotic and lofty as xerxes is very little disturbed by the mental sorrows of his slaves xerxes reached abydos and prepared to make the passage of the strait in a manner worthy of the grandeur of the occasion  the first thing was to make arrangements for a great parade of his forces not apparently for the purpose of accomplishing any useful end of military organization in the arrangement of the troops but to gratify the pride and pleasure of the sovereign with an opportunity of surveying them a great white throne of marble was accordingly erected on an eminence not far from the shore of the hellespont from which xerxes looked down with great complacency and pleasure on the one hand upon the long lines of troops the countless squadrons of horsemen the ranges of tents and the vast herds of beasts of burden which were assembled on the land and on the other hand upon the fleets of ships and boats and galleys at anchor upon the sea while the shores of europe were smiling in the distance and the long and magnificent roadway which he had made lay floating upon the water all ready to take his enormous armament across whenever he should issue the command  any deep emotion of the human soul in persons of a sensitive physical organization tends to tears and xerxess heart being filled with exultation and pride and with a sense of inexpressible grandeur and sublimity as he looked upon this scene was softened by the pleasurable excitements of the hour and though at first his countenance was beaming with satisfaction and pleasure his uncle artabanus who stood by his side soon perceived that tears were standing in his eyes artabanus asked him what this meant it made him sad xerxes replied to reflect that immensely vast as the countless multitude before him was in one hundred years from that time not one of them all would be alive  the tenderheartedness which xerxes manifested on this occasion taken in connection with the stern and unrelenting tyranny which he was exercising over the mighty mass of humanity whose mortality he mourned has drawn forth a great variety of comments from writers of every age who have repeated the story artabanus replied to it on the spot by saying that he did not think that the king ought to give himself too much uneasiness on the subject of human liability to death for it happened in a vast number of cases that the privations and sufferings of men were so great that often in the course of their lives they rather wished to die than to live and that death was consequently in some respects to be regarded not as in itself a woe but rather as the relief and remedy for woe  there is no doubt that this theory of artabanus so far as it applied to the unhappy soldiers of xerxes all marshaled before him when he uttered it was eminently true  xerxes admitted that what his uncle said was just but it was he said a melancholy subject and so he changed the conversation he asked his uncle whether he still entertained the same doubts and fears in respect to the expedition that he had expressed at susa when the plan was first proposed in the council artabanus replied that he most sincerely hoped that the prognostications of the vision would prove true but that he had still great apprehensions of the result i have been reflecting continued he with great care on the whole subject and it seems to me that there are two dangers of very serious character to which your expedition will be imminently exposed  xerxes wished to know what they were  they both arise said artabanus from the immense magnitude of your operations in the first place you have so large a number of ships galleys and transports in your fleet that i do not see how when you have gone down upon the greek coast if a storm should arise you are going to find shelter for them there are no harbors there large enough to afford anchorage ground for such an immense number of vessels  and what is the other danger asked xerxes  the other is the difficulty of finding food for such a vast multitude of men as you have brought together in your armies the quantity of food necessary to supply such countless numbers is almost incalculable your granaries and magazines will soon be exhausted and then as no country whatever that you can pass through will have resources of food adequate for such a multitude of mouths it seems to me that your march must inevitably end in a famine the less resistance you meet with and the further you consequently advance the worse it will be for you i do not see how this fatal result can possibly be avoided and so uneasy and anxious am i on the subject that i have no rest or peace  i admit said xerxes in reply that what you say is not wholly unreasonable but in great undertakings it will never do to take counsel wholly of our fears i am willing to submit to a very large portion of the evils to which i expose myself on this expedition rather than not accomplish the end which i have in view besides the most prudent and cautious counsels are not always the best he who hazards nothing gains nothing i have always observed that in all the affairs of human life those who exhibit some enterprise and courage in what they undertake are far more likely to be successful than those who weigh every thing and consider every thing and will not advance where they can see any remote prospect of danger if my predecessors had acted on the principles which you recommend the persian empire would never have acquired the greatness to which it has now attained in continuing to act on the same principles which governed them i confidently expect the same success we shall conquer europe and then return in peace i feel assured without encountering the famine which you dread so much or any other great calamity  on hearing these words and observing how fixed and settled the determinations of xerxes were artabanus said no more on the general subject but on one point he ventured to offer his counsel to his nephew and that was on the subject of employing the ionians in the war the ionians were greeks by descent their ancestors had crossed the Ægean sea and settled at various places along the coast of asia minor in the western part of the provinces of caria lydia and mysia artabanus thought it was dangerous to take these men to fight against their countrymen however faithfully disposed they might be in commencing the enterprise a thousand circumstances might occur to shake their fidelity and lead them to revolt when they found themselves in the land of their forefathers and heard the enemies against whom they had been brought to contend speaking their own mother tongue  xerxes however was not convinced by artabanuss arguments he thought that the employment of the ionians was perfectly safe they had been eminently faithful and firm he said under histiæus in the time of dariuss invasion of scythia when darius had left them to guard his bridge over the danube they had proved themselves trustworthy then and he would he said accordingly trust them now besides he added they have left their property their wives and their children and all else that they hold dear in our hands in asia and they will not dare while we retain such hostages to do any thing against us  xerxes said however that since artabanus was so much concerned in respect to the result of the expedition he should not be compelled to accompany it any further but that he might return to susa instead and take charge of the government there until xerxes should return  a part of the celebration on the great day of parade on which this conversation between the king and his uncle was held consisted of a naval sea fight waged on the hellespont between two of the nations of his army for the kings amusement the phoenicians were the victors in this combat xerxes was greatly delighted with the combat and in fact with the whole of the magnificent spectacle which the day had displayed  soon after this xerxes dismissed artabanus ordering him to return to susa and to assume the regency of the empire he convened also another general council of the nobles of his court and the officers of the army to announce to them that the time had arrived for crossing the bridge and to make his farewell address to them before they should take their final departure from asia he exhorted them to enter upon the great work before them with a determined and resolute spirit saying that if the greeks were once subdued no other enemies able at all to cope with the persians would be left on the habitable globe  on the dismission of the council orders were given to commence the crossing of the bridge the next day at sunrise the preparations were made accordingly in the morning as soon as it was light and while waiting for the rising of the sun they burned upon the bridge all manner of perfumes and strewed the way with branches of myrtle the emblem of triumph and joy as the time for the rising of the sun drew nigh xerxes stood with a golden vessel full of wine which he was to pour out as a libation as soon as the first dazzling beams should appear above the horizon when at length the moment arrived he poured out the wine into the sea throwing the vessel in which it had been contained after it as an offering he also threw in at the same time a golden goblet of great value and a persian cimeter the ancient historian who records these facts was uncertain whether these offerings were intended as acts of adoration addressed to the sun or as oblations presented to the seaa sort of peace offering perhaps to soothe the feelings of the mighty monster irritated and chafed by the chastisement which it had previously received  illustration xerxes crossing the hellespont  one circumstance indicated that the offering was intended for the sun for at the time of making it xerxes addressed to the great luminary a sort of petition which might be considered either an apostrophe or a prayer imploring its protection he called upon the sun to accompany and defend the expedition and to preserve it from every calamity until it should have accomplished its mission of subjecting all europe to the persian sway  the army then commenced its march the order of march was very much the same as that which had been observed in the departure from sardis the beasts of burden and the baggage were preceded and followed by immense bodies of troops of all nations the whole of the first day was occupied by the passing of this part of the army xerxes himself and the sacred portion of the train were to follow them on the second day accordingly there came on the second day first an immense squadron of horse with garlands on the heads of the horsemen next the sacred horses and the sacred car of jupiter then came xerxes himself in his war chariot with trumpets sounding and banners waving in the air at the moment when xerxess chariot entered upon the bridge the fleet of galleys which had been drawn up in preparation near the asiatic shore were set in motion and moved in a long and majestic line across the strait to the european side accompanying and keeping pace with their mighty master in his progress thus was spent the second day  five more days were consumed in getting over the remainder of the army and the immense trains of beasts and of baggage which followed the officers urged the work forward as rapidly as possible and toward the end as is always the case in the movement of such enormous masses it became a scene of inconceivable noise terror and confusion the officers drove forward men and beasts alike by the lashes of their whipsevery one struggling under the influence of such stimulants to get forwardwhile fallen animals broken wagons and the bodies of those exhausted and dying with excitement and fatigue choked the way the mighty mass was however at last transferred to the european continent full of anxious fears in respect to what awaited them but yet having very faint and feeble conceptions of the awful scenes in which the enterprise of their reckless leader was to end     chapter vi  the

at the canaldeath of the engineerburial of the engineera grand feastscene of revelrydesolation and depopulation of the country   as soon as the expedition of xerxes had crossed the hellespont and arrived safely on the european side as narrated in the last chapter it became necessary for the fleet and the army to separate and to move for a time in opposite directions from each other the reader will observe by examining the map that the army on reaching the european shore at the point to which they would be conducted by a bridge at abydos would find themselves in the middle of a long and narrow peninsula called the chersonesus and that before commencing its regular march along the northern coast of the Ægean sea it would be necessary first to proceed for fifteen or twenty miles to the eastward in order to get round the bay by which the peninsula is bounded on the north and west while therefore the fleet went directly westward along the coast the army turned to the eastward a place of rendezvous having been appointed on the northern coast of the sea where they were all soon to meet again  the army moved on by a slow and toilsome progress until it reached the neck of the peninsula and then turning at the head of the bay it moved westward again following the direction of the coast the line of march was however laid at some distance from the shore partly for the sake of avoiding the indentations made in the land by gulfs and bays and partly for the sake of crossing the streams from the interior at points so far inland that the water found in them should be fresh and pure notwithstanding these precautions however the water often failed so immense were the multitudes of men and of beasts and so craving was the thirst which the heat and the fatigues of the march engendered that in several instances they drank the little rivers dry  the first great and important river which the army had to pass after entering europe was the hebrus not far from the mouth of the hebrus where it emptied into the Ægean sea was a great plain which was called the plain of doriscus there was an extensive fortress here which had been erected by the orders of darius when he had subjugated this part of the country the position of this fortress was an important one because it commanded the whole region watered by the hebrus which was a very fruitful and populous district xerxes had been intending to have a grand review and enumeration of his forces on entering the european territories and he judged doriscus to be a very suitable place for his purpose he could establish his own headquarters in the fortress while his armies could be marshaled and reviewed on the plain the fleet too had been ordered to draw up to the shore at the same spot and when the army reached the ground they found the vessels already in the offing  the army accordingly halted and the necessary arrangements were made for the review the first thing was to ascertain the numbers of the troops and as the soldiers were too numerous to be counted xerxes determined to measure the mighty mass as so much bulk and then ascertain the numbers by a computation they made the measure itself in the following manner they counted off first ten thousand men and brought them together in a compact circular mass in the middle of the plain and then marked a line upon the ground inclosing them upon this line thus determined they built a stone wall about four feet high with openings on opposite sides of it by which men might enter and go out when the wall was built soldiers were sent into the inclosurejust as corn would be poured by a husbandman into a wooden peckuntil it was full the mass thus required to fill the inclosure was deemed and taken to be ten thousand men this was the first filling of the measure these men were then ordered to retire and a fresh mass was introduced and so on until the whole army was measured the inclosure was filled one hundred and seventy times with the foot soldiers before the process was completed indicating as the total amount of the infantry of the army a force of one million seven hundred thousand men this enumeration it must be remembered included the land forces alone  this method of measuring the army in bulk was applied only to the foot soldiers they constituted the great mass of the forces convened there were however various other bodies of troops in the army which from their nature were more systematically organized than the common foot soldiers and so their numbers were known by the regular enrollment there was for example a cavalry force of eighty thousand men there was also a corps of arabs on camels and another of egyptians in war chariots which together amounted to twenty thousand then besides these land forces there were half a million of men in the fleet immense as these numbers are they were still further increased as the army moved on by xerxess system of compelling the forces of every kingdom and province through which he passed to join the expedition so that at length when the persian king fairly entered the heart of the greek territory herodotus the great narrator of his history in summing up the whole number of men regularly connected with the army makes a total of about five millions of men one hundred thousand men which is but one fiftieth part of five millions is considered in modern times an immense army and in fact half even of that number was thought in the time of the american revolution a sufficient force to threaten the colonies with overwhelming destruction if ten thousand men will not do to put down the rebellion said an orator in the house of commons fifty thousand shall  herodotus adds that besides the five millions regularly connected with the army there was an immense and promiscuous mass of women slaves cooks bakers and camp followers of every description that no human powers could estimate or number  but to return to the review the numbers of the army having been ascertained the next thing was to marshal and arrange the men by nations under their respective leaders to be reviewed by the king a very full enumeration of these divisions of the army is given by the historians of the day with minute descriptions of the kind of armor which the troops of the several nations wore there were more than fifty of these nations in all some of them were highly civilized others were semibarbarous tribes and of course they presented as marshaled in long array upon the plain every possible variety of dress and equipment some were armed with brazen helmets and coats of mail formed of plates of iron others wore linen tunics or rude garments made of the skins of beasts the troops of one nation had their heads covered with helmets those of another with miters and of a third with tiaras there was one savagelooking horde that had caps made of the skin of the upper part of a horses head in its natural form with the ears standing up erect at the top and the mane flowing down behind these men held the skins of cranes before them instead of shields so that they looked like horned monsters half beast and half bird endeavoring to assume the guise and attitude of men there was another corps whose men were really horned since they wore caps made from the skins of the heads of oxen with the horns standing wild beasts were personated too as well as tame for some nations were clothed in lions skins and others in panthers skinsthe clothing being considered apparently the more honorable in proportion to the ferocity of the brute to which it had originally belonged  the weapons too were of every possible form and guise spearssome pointed with iron some with stone and others shaped simply by being burned to a point in the fire bows and arrows of every variety of material and form swords daggers slings clubs darts javelins and every other imaginable species of weapon which human ingenuity savage or civilized had then conceived even the lassothe weapon of the american aborigines of modern timeswas there it is described by the ancient historian as a long thong of leather wound into a coil and finished in a noose at the end which noose the rude warrior who used the implement launched through the air at the enemy and entangling rider and horse together by means of it brought them both to the ground  there was every variety of taste too in the fashion and the colors of the dresses which were worn some were of artificial fabrics and dyed in various and splendid hues some were very plain the wearers of them affecting a simple and savage ferocity in the fashion of their vesture some tribes had painted skinsbeauty in their view consisting apparently in hideousness there was one barbarian horde who wore very little clothing of any kind they had knotty clubs for weapons and in lieu of a dress they had painted their naked bodies half white and half a bright vermilion  in all this vast array the corps which stood at the head in respect to their rank and the costliness and elegance of their equipment was a persian squadron of ten thousand men called the immortals they had received this designation from the fact that the body was kept always exactly full as whenever any one of the number died another soldier was instantly put into his place whose life was considered in some respects a continuation of the existence of the man who had fallen thus by a fiction somewhat analogous to that by which the king in england never dies these ten thousand persians were an immortal band they were all carefullyselected soldiers and they enjoyed very unusual privileges and honors they were mounted troops and their dress and their armor were richly decorated with gold they were accompanied in their campaigns by their wives and families for whose use carriages were provided which followed the camp and there was a long train of camels besides attached to the service of the corps to carry their provisions and their baggage  while all these countless varieties of land troops were marshaling and arranging themselves upon the plain each under its own officers and around its own standards the naval commanders were employed in bringing up the fleet of galleys to the shore where they were anchored in a long line not far from the beach and with their prows toward the land thus there was a space of open water left between the line of vessels and the beach along which xerxess barge was to pass when the time for the naval part of the review should arrive  when all things were ready xerxes mounted his war chariot and rode slowly around the plain surveying attentively and with great interest and pleasure the long lines of soldiers in all their variety of equipment and costume as they stood displayed before him it required a progress of many miles to see them all when this review of the land forces was concluded the king went to the shore and embarked on board a royal galley which had been prepared for him and there seated upon the deck under a gilded canopy he was rowed by the oarsmen along the line of ships between their prows and the land the ships were from many nations as well as the soldiers and exhibited the same variety of fashion and equipment the land troops had come from the inland realms and provinces which occupied the heart of asia while the ships and the seamen had been furnished by the maritime regions which extended along the coasts of the black and the Ægean and the mediterranean seas thus the people of egypt had furnished two hundred ships the phoenicians three hundred cyprus fifty the cilicians and the ionians one hundred each and so with a great many other nations and tribes  the various squadrons which were thus combined in forming this immense fleet were manned and officered of course from the nations that severally furnished them and one of them was actually commanded in person by a queen the name of this lady admiral was artemisia she was the queen of caria a small province in the southwestern part of asia minor having halicarnassus for its capital artemisia though in history called a queen was in reality more properly a regent as she governed in the name of her son who was yet a child the quota of ships which caria was to furnish was five artemisia being a lady of ambitious and masculine turn of mind and fond of adventure determined to accompany the expedition not only her own vessels but also those from some neighboring islands were placed under her charge so that she commanded quite an important division of the fleet she proved also in the course of the voyage to be abundantly qualified for the discharge of her duties she became in fact one of the ablest and most efficient commanders in the fleet not only maneuvering and managing her own particular division in a very successful manner but also taking a very active and important part in the general consultations where what she said was listened to with great respect and always had great weight in determining the decisions in the great battle of salamis she acted a very conspicuous part as will hereafter appear  the whole number of galleys of the first class in xerxess fleet was more than twelve hundred a number abundantly sufficient to justify the apprehensions of artabanus that no harbor would be found capacious enough to shelter them in the event of a sudden storm the line which they formed on this occasion when drawn up side by side upon the shore for review must have extended many miles  xerxes moved slowly along this line in his barge attended by the officers of his court and the great generals of his army who surveyed the various ships as they passed them and noted the diverse national costumes and equipments of the men with curiosity and pleasure among those who attended the king on this occasion was a certain greek named demaratus an exile from his native land who had fled to persia and had been kindly received by darius some years before having remained in the persian court until xerxes succeeded to the throne and undertook the invasion of greece he concluded to accompany the expedition  the story of the political difficulties in which demaratus became involved in his native land and which led to his flight from greece was very extraordinary it was this  the mother of demaratus was the daughter of parents of high rank and great affluence in sparta but in her childhood her features were extremely plain and repulsive now there was a temple in the neighborhood of the place where her parents resided consecrated to helen a princess who while she lived enjoyed the fame of being the most beautiful woman in the world the nurse recommended that the child should be taken every day to this temple and that petitions should be offered there at the shrine of helen that the repulsive deformity of her features might be removed the mother consented to this plan only enjoining upon the nurse not to let any one see the face of her unfortunate offspring in going and returning the nurse accordingly carried the child to the temple day after day and holding it in her arms before the shrine implored the mercy of heaven for her helpless charge and the bestowal upon it of the boon of beauty  these petitions were it seems at length heard for one day when the nurse was coming down from the temple after offering her customary prayer she was met and accosted by a mysteriouslooking woman who asked her what it was that she was carrying in her arms the nurse replied that it was a child the woman wanted to look at it the nurse refused to show the face of the child saying that she had been forbidden to do so the woman however insisted upon seeing its face and at last the nurse consented and removed the coverings the stranger stroked down the face of the child saying at the same time that now that child should become the most beautiful woman of sparta  her words proved true the features of the young girl rapidly changed and her countenance soon became as wonderful for its loveliness as it had been before for its hideous deformity when she arrived at a proper age a certain spartan nobleman named agetus a particular friend of the kings made her his wife  the name of the king of sparta at that time was ariston he had been twice married and his second wife was still living but he had no children when he came to see and to know the beautiful wife of agetus he wished to obtain her for himself and began to revolve the subject in his mind with a view to discover some method by which he might hope to accomplish his purpose he decided at length upon the following plan he proposed to agetus to make an exchange of gifts offering to give to him any one object which he might choose from all his that is aristons effects provided that agetus would in the same manner give to ariston whatever ariston might choose agetus consented to the proposal without however giving it any serious consideration as ariston was already married he did not for a moment imagine that his wife could be the object which the king would demand the parties to this foolish agreement confirmed the obligation of it by a solemn oath and then each made known to the other what he had selected agetus gained some jewel or costly garment or perhaps a gilded and embellished weapon and lost forever his beautiful wife ariston repudiated his own second wife and put the prize which he had thus surreptitiously acquired in her place as a third  about seven or eight months after this time demaratus was born the intelligence was brought to ariston one day by a slave when he was sitting at a public tribunal ariston seemed surprised at the intelligence and exclaimed that the child was not his he however afterward retracted this disavowal and owned demaratus as his son the child grew up and in process of time when his father died he succeeded to the throne the magistrates however who had heard the declaration of his father at the time of his birth remembered it and reported it to others and when ariston died and demaratus assumed the supreme power the next heir denied his right to the succession and in process of time formed a strong party against him a long series of civil dissensions arose and at length the claims of demaratus were defeated his enemies triumphed and he fled from the country to save his life he arrived at susa near the close of dariuss reign and it was his counsel which led the king to decide the contest among his sons for the right of succession in favor of xerxes as described at the close of the first chapter xerxes had remembered his obligations to demaratus for this interposition he had retained him in the royal court after his accession to the throne and had bestowed upon him many marks of distinction and honor  demaratus had decided to accompany xerxes on his expedition into greece and now while the persian officers were looking with so much pride and pleasure on the immense preparations which they were making for the subjugation of a foreign and hostile state demaratus too was in the midst of the scene regarding the spectacle with no less of interest probably and yet doubtless with very different feelings since the country upon which this dreadful cloud of gloom and destruction was about to burst was his own native land  after the review was ended xerxes sent for demaratus to come to the castle when he arrived the king addressed him as follows  you are a greek demaratus and you know your countrymen well and now as you have seen the fleet and the army that have been displayed here today tell me what is your opinion do you think that the greeks will undertake to defend themselves against such a force or will they submit at once without attempting any resistance  demaratus seemed at first perplexed and uncertain as if not knowing exactly what answer to make to the question at length he asked the king whether it was his wish that he should respond by speaking the blunt and honest truth or by saying what would be polite and agreeable  xerxes replied that he wished him of course to speak the truth the truth itself would be what he should consider the most agreeable  since you desire it then said demaratus i will speak the exact truth greece is the child of poverty the inhabitants of the land have learned wisdom and discipline in the severe school of adversity and their resolution and courage are absolutely indomitable they all deserve this praise but i speak more particularly of my own countrymen the people of sparta i am sure that they will reject any proposal which you may make to them for submission to your power and that they will resist you to the last extremity the disparity of numbers will have no influence whatever on their decision if all the rest of greece were to submit to you leaving the spartans alone and if they should find themselves unable to muster more than a thousand men they would give you battle  xerxes expressed great surprise at this assertion and thought that demaratus could not possibly mean what he seemed to say i appeal to yourself said he would you dare to encounter alone ten men you have been the prince of the spartans and a prince ought at least to be equal to two common men so that to show that the spartans in general could be brought to fight a superiority of force of even ten to one it ought to appear that you would dare to engage twenty this is manifestly absurd in fact for any person to pretend to be able or willing to fight under such a disparity of numbers evinces only pride and insolent presumption and even this proportion of ten to one or even twenty to one is nothing compared to the real disparity for even if we grant to the spartans as large a force as there is any possibility of their obtaining i shall then have a thousand to one against them  besides continued the king there is a great difference in the character of the troops the greeks are all freemen while my soldiers are all slavesbound absolutely to do my bidding without complaint or murmur such soldiers as mine who are habituated to submit entirely to the will of another and who live under the continual fear of the lash might perhaps be forced to go into battle against a great superiority of numbers or under other manifest disadvantages but free men never i do not believe that a body of greeks could be brought to engage a body of persians man for man every consideration shows thus that the opinion which you have expressed is unfounded you could only have been led to entertain such an opinion through ignorance and unaccountable presumption  i was afraid replied demaratus from the first that by speaking the truth i should offend you i should not have given you my real opinion of the spartans if you had not ordered me to speak without reserve you certainly can not suppose me to have been influenced by a feeling of undue partiality for the men whom i commended since they have been my most implacable and bitter enemies and have driven me into hopeless exile from my native land your father on the other hand received and protected me and the sincere gratitude which i feel for the favors which i have received from him and from you incline me to take the most favorable view possible of the persian cause  i certainly should not be willing as you justly suppose to engage alone twenty men or ten or even one unless there was an absolute necessity for it i do not say that any single lacedæmonian could successfully encounter ten or twenty persians although in personal conflicts they are certainly not inferior to other men it is when they are combined in a body even though that body be small that their great superiority is seen  as to their being free and thus not easily led into battle in circumstances of imminent danger it must be considered that their freedom is not absolute like that of savages in a fray where each acts according to his own individual will and pleasure but it is qualified and controlled by law the spartan soldiers are not personal slaves governed by the lash of a master it is true but they have certain principles of obligation and duty which they all feel most solemnly bound to obey they stand in greater awe of the authority of this law than your subjects do of the lash it commands them never to fly from the field of battle whatever may be the number of their adversaries it commands them to preserve their ranks to stand firm at the posts assigned them and there to conquer or die  this is the truth in respect to them if what i say seems to you absurd i will in future be silent i have spoken honestly what i think because your majesty commanded me to do so and notwithstanding what i have said i sincerely wish that all your majestys desires and expectations may be fulfilled  the ideas which demaratus thus appeared to entertain of danger to the countless and formidable hosts of xerxess army from so small and insignificant a power as that of sparta seemed to xerxes too absurd to awaken any serious displeasure in his mind he only smiled therefore at demaratuss fears and dismissed him  leaving a garrison and a governor in possession of the castle of doriscus xerxes resumed his march along the northern shores of the Ægean sea the immense swarms of men filling all the roads devouring every thing capable of being used as food either for beast or man and drinking all the brooks and smaller rivers dry even with this total consumption of the food and the water which they obtained on the march the supplies would have been found insufficient if the whole army had advanced through one tract of country they accordingly divided the host into three great columns one of which kept near the shore the other marched far in the interior and the third in the intermediate space they thus exhausted the resources of a very wide region all the men too that were capable of bearing arms in the nations that these several divisions passed on the way they compelled to join them so that the army left as it moved along a very broad extent of country trampled down impoverished desolate and full of lamentation and woe the whole march was perhaps the most gigantic crime against the rights and the happiness of man that human wickedness has ever been able to commit  the army halted from time to time for various purposes sometimes for the performance of what they considered religions ceremonies which were intended to propitiate the supernatural powers of the earth and of the air when they reached the strymon where it will be recollected a bridge had been previously built so as to be ready for the army when it should arrive they offered a sacrifice of five white horses to the river in the same region too they halted at a place called the nine ways where xerxes resolved to offer a human sacrifice to a certain god whom the persians believed to reside in the interior of the earth the mode of sacrificing to this god was to bury the wretched victims alive the persians seized accordingly by xerxess orders nine young men and nine girls from among the people of the country and buried them alive  marching slowly on in this manner the army at length reached the point upon the coast where the canal had been cut across the isthmus of mount athos the town which was nearest to this spot was acanthus the situation of which together with that of the canal will be found upon the map the fleet arrived at this point by sea nearly at the same time with the army coming by land xerxes examined the canal and was extremely well satisfied with its construction he commended the chief engineer whose name was artachæes in the highest terms for the successful manner in which he had executed the work and rendered him very distinguished honors  it unfortunately happened however that a few days after the arrival of the fleet and the army at the canal and before the fleet had commenced the passage of it that artachæes died the king considered this event as a serious calamity to him as he expected that other occasions would arrive on which he would have occasion to avail himself of the engineers talents and skill he ordered preparations to be made for a most magnificent burial and the body was in due time deposited in the grave with imposing funeral solemnities a very splendid monument too was raised upon the spot which employed for some time all the mechanical force of the army in its erection  while xerxes remained at acanthus he required the people of the neighboring country to entertain his army at a grand feast the cost of which totally ruined them not only was all the food of the vicinity consumed but all the means and resources of the inhabitants of every kind were exhausted in the additional supplies which they had to procure from the surrounding regions at this feast the army in general ate seated in groups upon the ground in the open air but for xerxes and the nobles of the court a great pavilion was built where tables were spread and vessels and furniture of silver and gold suitable to the dignity of the occasion were provided almost all the property which the people of the region had accumulated by years of patient industry was consumed at once in furnishing the vast amount of food which was required for this feast and the gold and silver plate which was to be used in the pavilion during the entertainment the inhabitants of the country waited upon their exacting and insatiable guests until they were utterly exhausted by the fatigues of the service when at length the feast was ended and xerxes and his company left the pavilion the vast assembly outside broke up in disorder pulled the pavilion to pieces plundered the tables of the gold and silver plate and departed to their several encampments leaving nothing behind them  the inhabitants of the country were so completely impoverished and ruined by these exactions that those who were not impressed into xerxess service and compelled to follow his army abandoned their homes and roamed away in the hope of finding elsewhere the means of subsistence which it was no longer possible to obtain on their own lands and thus when xerxes at last gave orders to the fleet to pass through the canal and to his army to resume its march he left the whole region utterly depopulated and desolate  he went on to therma a port situated on the northwestern corner of the Ægean sea which was the last of his places of rendezvous before his actual advance into greece     chapter vii  the preparations of the greeks

fall back to thermopylæxerxes visits thessalybeautiful rural sceneconversation of xerxes at the olympic pass   we must now leave for a time the operations of xerxes and his army and turn our attention to the greeks and to the preparations which they were making to meet the emergency  the two states of greece which were most prominent in the transactions connected with the invasion of xerxes were athens and sparta by referring to the map athens will be found to have been situated upon a promontory just without the peloponnesus while sparta on the other hand was in the center of a valley which lay in the southern part of the peninsula each of these cities was the center and stronghold of a small but very energetic and powerful commonwealth the two states were entirely independent of each other and each had its own peculiar system of government of usages and of laws these systems and in fact the characters of the two communities in all respects were extremely dissimilar  both these states though in name republics had certain magistrates called commonly in history kings these kings were however in fact only military chieftains commanders of the armies rather than sovereign rulers of the state the name by which such a chieftain was actually called by the people themselves in those days was tyrannus the name from which our word tyrant is derived as however the word tyrannus had none of that opprobrious import which is associated with its english derivative the latter is not now a suitable substitute for the former historians therefore commonly use the word king instead though that word does not properly express the idea they were commanders chieftains hereditary generals but not strictly kings we shall however often call them kings in these narratives in conformity with the general usage demaratus who had fled from sparta to seek refuge with darius and who was now accompanying xerxes on his march to greece was one of these kings  it was a peculiarity in the constitution of sparta that from a very early period of its history there had been always two kings who had held the supreme command in conjunction with each other like the roman consuls in later times this custom was sustained partly by the idea that by this division of the executive power of the state the exercise of the power was less likely to become despotic or tyrannical it had its origin however according to the ancient legends in the following singular occurrences  at a very early period in the history of sparta when the people had always been accustomed like other states to have one prince or chieftain a certain prince died leaving his wife whose name was argia and two infant children as his survivors the children were twins and the father had died almost immediately after they were born now the office of king was in a certain sense hereditary and yet not absolutely so for the people were accustomed to assemble on the death of the king and determine who should be his successor choosing always however the oldest son of the former monarch unless there was some very extraordinary and imperious reason for not doing so in this case they decided as usual that the oldest son should be king  but here a very serious difficulty arose which was to determine which of the twins was the oldest son they resembled each other so closely that no stranger could distinguish one from the other at all the mother said that she could not distinguish them and that she did not know which was the firstborn this was not strictly true for she did in fact know and only denied her power to decide the question because she wished to have both of her children kings  in this perplexity the spartans sent to the oracle at delphi to know what they were to do the oracle gave as usual an ambiguous and unsatisfactory response it directed the people to make both the children kings but to render the highest honors to the firstborn when this answer was reported at sparta it only increased the difficulty for how were they to render peculiar honors to the firstborn unless they could ascertain which the firstborn was  in this dilemma some person suggested to the magistrates that perhaps argia really knew which was the eldest child and that if so by watching her to see whether she washed and fed one uniformly before the other or gave it precedence in any other way by which her latent maternal instinct or partiality might appear the question might possibly be determined this plan was accordingly adopted the magistrates contrived means to place a servant maid in the house to watch the mother in the way proposed and the result was that the true order of birth was revealed from that time forward while they were both considered as princes the one now supposed to be the firstborn took precedence of the other  when however the children arrived at an age to assume the exercise of the governmental power as there was no perceptible difference between them in age or strength or accomplishments the one who had been decided to be the younger was little disposed to submit to the other each had his friends and adherents parties were formed and a long and angry civil dissension ensued in the end the question was compromised the command was divided and the system of having two chief magistrates became gradually established the power descending in two lines from father to son through many generations of course there was perpetual jealousy and dissension and often open and terrible conflicts between these two rival lines  the spartans were an agricultural people cultivating the valley in the southeastern part of the peloponnesus the waters of which were collected and conveyed to the sea by the river eurotas and its branches they lived in the plainest possible manner and prided themselves on the stern and stoical resolution with which they rejected all the refinements and luxuries of society courage hardihood indifference to life and the power to endure without a murmur the most severe and protracted sufferings were the qualities which they valued they despised wealth just as other nations despise effeminacy and foppery their laws discouraged commerce lest it should make some of the people rich their clothes were scanty and plain their houses were comfortless their food was a coarse bread hard and brown and their money was of iron with all this however they were the most ferocious and terrible soldiers in the world  they were moreover with all their plainness of manners and of life of a very proud and lofty spirit all agricultural toil and every other species of manual labor in their state were performed by a servile peasantry while the free citizens whose profession was exclusively that of arms were as aristocratic and exalted in soul as any nobles on earth people are sometimes in our day when money is so much valued proud notwithstanding their poverty the spartans were proud of their poverty itself they could be rich if they chose but they despised riches they looked down on all the refinements and delicacies of dress and of living from an elevation far above them they looked down on labor too with the same contempt they were yet very nice and particular about their dress and military appearance though every thing pertaining to both was coarse and simple and they had slaves to wait upon them even in their campaigns  the athenians were a totally different people the leading classes in their commonwealth were cultivated intellectual and refined the city of athens was renowned for the splendor of its architecture its temples its citadels its statues and its various public institutions which in subsequent times made it the great intellectual center of europe it was populous and wealthy it had a great commerce and a powerful fleet the spartan character in a word was stern gloomy indomitable and wholly unadorned the athenians were rich intellectual and refined the two nations were nearly equal in power and were engaged in a perpetual and incessant rivalry  illustration fate of the persian embassadors at sparta  there were various other states and cities in greece but athens and sparta were at this time the most considerable and they were altogether the most resolute and determined in their refusal to submit to the persian sway in fact so well known and understood was the spirit of defiance with which these two powers were disposed to regard the persian invasion that when xerxes sent his summons demanding submission to the other states of greece he did not send any to these when darius invaded greece some years before he had summoned athens and sparta as well as the others but his demands were indignantly rejected it seems that the custom was for a government or a prince when acknowledging the dominion of a superior power to send as a token of territorial submission a little earth and water which was a sort of legal form of giving up possession of their country to the sovereign who claimed it accordingly when darius sent his embassadors into greece to summon the country to surrender the embassadors according to the usual form called upon the governments of the several states to send earth and water to the king the athenians as has been already said indignantly refused to comply with this demand the spartans not content with a simple refusal seized the embassadors and threw them into a well telling them as they went down that if they wanted earth and water for the king of persia they might get it there  the greeks had obtained some information of xerxess designs against them before they received his summons the first intelligence was communicated to the spartans by demaratus himself while he was at susa in the following singular manner it was the custom in those days to write with a steel point on a smooth surface of wax the wax was spread for this purpose on a board or tablet of metal in a very thin stratum forming a ground upon which the letters traced with the point were easily legible demaratus took two writingtablets such as these and removing the wax from them he wrote a brief account of the proposed persian invasion by tracing the characters upon the surface of the wood or metal itself beneath then restoring the wax so as to conceal the letters he sent the two tablets seemingly blank to leonidas king of sparta the messengers who bore them had other pretexts for their journey and they had various other articles to carry the persian guards who stopped and examined the messengers from time to time along the route thought nothing of the blank tablets and so they reached leonidas in safety  leonidas being a blunt rough soldier and not much accustomed to cunning contrivances himself was not usually much upon the watch for them from others and when he saw no obvious communication upon the tablets he threw them aside not knowing what the sending of them could mean and not feeling any strong interest in ascertaining his wife howeverher name was gorgohad more curiosity there was something mysterious about the affair and she wished to solve it she examined the tablets attentively in every part and at length removed cautiously a little of the wax the letters began to appear full of excitement and pleasure she proceeded with the work until the whole cereous coating was removed the result was that the communication was revealed and greece received the warning  when the greeks heard that xerxes was at sardis they sent three messengers in disguise to ascertain the facts in respect to the persian army assembled there and so far as possible to learn the plans and designs of the king notwithstanding all the efforts of these men to preserve their concealment and disguise they were discovered seized and tortured by the persian officer who took them until they confessed that they were spies the officer was about to put them to death when xerxes himself received information of the circumstances he forbade the execution and directed on the other hand that the men should be conducted through all his encampments and be allowed to view and examine every thing he then dismissed them with orders to return to greece and report what they had seen he thought he said that the greeks would be more likely to surrender if they knew how immense his preparations were for effectually vanquishing them if they attempted resistance  the city of athens being farther north than sparta would be the one first exposed to danger from the invasion and when the people heard of xerxess approach the whole city was filled with anxiety and alarm some of the inhabitants were panicstricken and wished to submit others were enraged and uttered nothing but threats and defiance a thousand different plans of defense were proposed and eagerly discussed at length the government sent messengers to the oracle at delphi to learn what their destiny was to be and to obtain if possible divine direction in respect to the best mode of averting the danger the messengers received an awful response portending in wild and solemn though dark and mysterious language the most dreadful calamities to the illfated city the messengers were filled with alarm at hearing this reply one of the inhabitants of delphi the city in which the oracle was situated proposed to them to make a second application in the character of the most humble supplicants and to implore that the oracle would give them some directions in respect to the best course for them to pursue in order to avoid or at least to mitigate the impending danger they did so and after a time they received an answer vague mysterious and almost unintelligible but which seemed to denote that the safety of the city was connected in some manner with salamis and with certain wooden walls to which the inspired distich of the response obscurely alluded  the messengers returned to athens and reported the answer which they had received the people were puzzled and perplexed in their attempts to understand it it seems that the citadel of athens had been formerly surrounded by a wooden palisade some thought that this was what was referred to by the wooden walls and that the meaning of the oracle was that they must rebuild the palisade and then retreat to the citadel when the persians should approach and defend themselves there  others conceived that the phrase referred to ships and that the oracle meant to direct them to meet their enemies with a fleet upon the sea salamis which was also mentioned by the oracle was an island not far from athens being west of the city between it and the isthmus of corinth those who supposed that by the wooden walls was denoted the fleet thought that salamis might have been alluded to as the place near which the great naval battle was to be fought this was the interpretation which seemed finally to prevail  the athenians had a fleet of about two hundred galleys these vessels had been purchased and built some time before this for the athenian government through the influence of a certain public officer of high rank and influence named themistocles it seems that a large sum had accumulated in the public treasury the produce of certain mines belonging to the city and a proposal was made to divide it among the citizens which would have given a small sum to each man themistocles opposed this proposition and urged instead that the government should build and equip a fleet with the money this plan was finally adopted the fleet was built and it was now determined to call it into active service to meet and repel the persians though the naval armament of xerxes was six times as large  the next measure was to establish a confederation if possible of the grecian states or at least of all those who were willing to combine and thus to form an allied army to resist the invader the smaller states were very generally panicstricken and had either already signified their submission to the persian rule or were timidly hesitating in doubt whether it would be safer for them to submit to the overwhelming force which was advancing against them or to join the athenians and the spartans in their almost desperate attempts to resist it the athenians and spartans settled for the time their own quarrels and held a council to take the necessary measures for forming a more extended confederation  all this took place while xerxes was slowly advancing from sardis to the hellespont and from the hellespont to doriscus as described in the preceding chapter  the council resolved on dispatching an embassy at once to all the states of greece as well as to some of the remoter neighboring powers asking them to join the alliance  the first greek city to which these embassadors came was argos which was the capital of a kingdom or state lying between athens and sparta though within the peloponnesus the states of argos and of sparta being neighbors had been constantly at war argos had recently lost six thousand men in a battle with the spartans and were consequently not likely to be in a very favorable mood for a treaty of friendship and alliance  when the embassadors had delivered their message the argolians replied that they had anticipated such a proposal from the time that they had heard that xerxes had commenced his march toward greece and that they had applied accordingly to the oracle at delphi to know what it would be best for them to do in case the proposal were made the answer of the oracle had been they said unfavorable to their entering into an alliance with the greeks they were willing however they added notwithstanding this to enter into an alliance offensive and defensive with the spartans for thirty years on condition that they should themselves have the command of half the peloponnesian troops they were entitled to the command of the whole being as they contended the superior nation in rank but they would waive their just claim and be satisfied with half if the spartans would agree to that arrangement  the spartans replied that they could not agree to those conditions they were themselves they said the superior nation in rank and entitled to the whole command and as they had two kings and argos but one there was a double difficulty in complying with the argive demand they could not surrender one half of the command without depriving one of their kings of his rightful power  thus the proposed alliance failed entirely the people of argos saying that they would as willingly submit to the dominion of xerxes as to the insolent demands and assumptions of superiority made by the government of sparta  the embassadors among other countries which they visited in their attempts to obtain alliance and aid went to sicily gelon was the king of sicily and syracuse was his capital here the same difficulty occurred which had broken up the negotiations at argos the embassadors when they arrived at syracuse represented to gelon that if the persians subdued greece they would come to sicily next and that it was better for him and for his countrymen that they should meet the enemy while he was still at a distance rather than to wait until he came near gelon admitted the justice of this reasoning and said that he would furnish a large force both of ships and men for carrying on the war provided that he might have the command of the combined army to this of course the spartans would not agree he then asked that he might command the fleet on condition of giving up his claim to the land forces this proposition the athenian embassadors rejected saying to gelon that what they were in need of and came to him to obtain was a supply of troops not of leaders the athenians they said were to command the fleet being not only the most ancient nation of greece but also the most immediately exposed to the invasion so that they were doubly entitled to be considered as the principals and leaders in the war  gelon then told the embassadors that since they wished to obtain every thing and to concede nothing they had better leave his dominions without delay and report to their countrymen that they had nothing to expect from sicily  the embassadors went then to corcyra a large island on the western coast of greece in the adriatic sea it is now called corfu here they seemed to meet with their first success the people of corcyra acceded to the proposals made to them and promised at once to equip and man their fleet and send it round into the Ægean sea they immediately engaged in the work and seemed to be honestly intent on fulfilling their promises they were however in fact only pretending they were really undecided which cause to espouse the greek or the persian and kept their promised squadron back by means of various delays until its aid was no longer needed  but the most important of all these negotiations of the athenians and spartans with the neighboring states were those opened with thessaly thessaly was a kingdom in the northern part of greece it was therefore the territory which the persian armies would first enter on turning the northwestern corner of the Ægean sea there were moreover certain points in its geographical position and in the physical conformation of the country that gave it a peculiar importance in respect to the approaching conflict  by referring to the map placed at the commencement of the fifth chapter it will be seen that thessaly was a vast valley surrounded on all sides by mountainous land and drained by the river peneus and its branches the peneus flows eastwardly to the Ægean sea and escapes from the great valley through a narrow and romantic pass lying between the mountains olympus and ossa this pass was called in ancient times the olympic straits and a part of it formed a romantic and beautiful glen called the vale of tempe there was a road through this pass which was the only access by which thessaly could be entered from the eastward  to the south of the vale of tempe the mountains as will appear from the map crowded so hard upon the sea as not to allow any passage to the eastward of them the natural route of xerxes therefore in descending into greece would be to come down along the coast until he reached the mouth of the peneus and then following the river up through the vale of tempe into thessaly to pass down toward the peloponnesus on the western side of ossa and pelion and of the other mountains near the sea if he could get through the olympic straits and the vale of tempe the way would be open and unobstructed until he should reach the southern frontier of thessaly where there was another narrow pass leading from thessaly into greece this last defile was close to the sea and was called the straits of thermopylæ  thus xerxes and his hosts in continuing their march to the southward must necessarily traverse thessaly and in doing so they would have two narrow and dangerous defiles to passone at mount olympus to get into the country and the other at thermopylæ to get out of it it consequently became a point of great importance to the greeks to determine at which of these two passes they should make their stand against the torrent which was coming down upon them  this question would of course depend very much upon the disposition of thessaly herself the government of that country understanding the critical situation in which they were placed had not waited for the athenians and spartans to send embassadors to them but at a very early period of the warbefore in fact xerxes had yet crossed the hellespont had sent messengers to athens to concert some plan of action these messengers were to say to the athenians that the government of thessaly were expecting every day to receive a summons from xerxes and that they must speedily decide what they were to do that they themselves were very unwilling to submit to him but they could not undertake to make a stand against his immense host alone that the southern greeks might include thessaly in their plan of defense or exclude it just as they thought best if they decided to include it then they must make a stand at the olympic straits that is at the pass between olympus and ossa and to do that it would be necessary to send a strong force immediately to take possession of the pass if on the contrary they decided not to defend thessaly then the pass of thermopylæ would be the point at which they must make their stand and in that case thessaly must be at liberty to submit on the first persian summons  the greeks after consultation on the subject decided that it would be best for them to defend thessaly and to take their stand accordingly at the straits of olympus they immediately put a large force on board their fleet armed and equipped for the expedition this was at the time when xerxes was just about crossing the hellespont the fleet sailed from the port of athens passed up through the narrow strait called euripus lying between the island of euboea and the main land and finally landed at a favorable point of disembarkation south of thessaly from this point the forces marched to the northward until they reached the peneus and then established themselves at the narrowest part of the passage between the mountains strengthened their position there as much as possible and awaited the coming of the enemy the amount of the force was ten thousand men  they had not been here many days before a messenger came to them from the king of macedon which country it will be seen lies immediately north of thessaly earnestly dissuading them from attempting to make a stand at the vale of tempe xerxes was coming on he said with an immense and overwhelming force one against which it would be utterly impossible for them to make good their defense at such a point as that it would be far better for them to fall back to thermopylæ which being a narrower and more rugged pass could be more easily defended  besides this the messenger said that it was possible for xerxes to enter thessaly without going through the vale of tempe at all the country between thessaly and macedon was mountainous but it was not impassable and xerxes would very probably come by that way the only security therefore for the greeks would be to fall back and intrench themselves at thermopylæ nor was there any time to be lost xerxes was crossing the hellespont and the whole country was full of excitement and terror  the greeks determined to act on this advice they broke up their encampment at the olympic straits and retreating to the southward established themselves at thermopylæ to await there the coming of the conqueror the people of thessaly then surrendered to xerxes as soon as they received his summons  xerxes from his encampment at therma where we left him at the close of the last chapter saw the peaks of olympus and ossa in the southern horizon they were distant perhaps fifty miles from where he stood he inquired about them and was told that the river peneus flowed between them to the sea and that through the same defile there lay the main entrance to thessaly he had previously determined to march his army round the other way as the king of macedon had suggested but he said that he should like to see this defile so he ordered a swift sidonian galley to be prepared and taking with him suitable guides and a fleet of other vessels in attendance on his galley he sailed to the mouth of the peneus and entering that river he ascended it until he came to the defile  seen from any of the lower elevations which projected from the bases of the mountains at the head of this defile thessaly lay spread out before the eye as one vast valleylevel verdant fertile and bounded by distant groups and ranges of mountains which formed a blue and beautiful horizon on every side through the midst of this scene of rural loveliness the peneus with its countless branches gracefully meandered gathering the water from every part of the valley and then pouring it forth in a deep and calm current through the gap in the mountains at the observers feet xerxes asked his guides if it would be possible to find any other place where the waters of the peneus could be conducted to the sea they replied that it would not be for the valley was bounded on every side by ranges of mountainous land  then said xerxes the thessalians were wise in submitting at once to my summons for if they had not done so i would have raised a vast embankment across the valley here and thus stopped the river turned their country into a lake and drowned them all     chapter viii  the advance of xerxes into greece  bc 480  advance of the armysailing of the fleetsciathuseuboeastraits of

which the persian army halted before its final descent upon greecethe army commenced its march and the fleet set sail nearly at the same time which was early in the summer the army advanced slowly meeting with the usual difficulties and delays but without encountering any special or extraordinary occurrences until after having passed through macedon into thessaly and through thessaly to the northern frontier of phocis they began to approach the straits of thermopylæ what took place at thermopylæ will be made the subject of the next chapter the movements of the fleet are to be narrated in this  in order distinctly to understand these movements it is necessary that the reader should first have a clear conception of the geographical conformation of the coasts and seas along which the path of the expedition lay by referring to the map of greece we shall see that the course which the fleet would naturally take from therma to the southeastward along the coast was unobstructed and clear for about a hundred miles we then come to a group of four islands extending in a range at right angles to the coast the only one of these islands with which we have particularly to do in this history is the innermost of them which was named sciathus opposite to these islands the line of the coast having passed around the point of a mountainous and rocky promontory called magnesia turns suddenly to the westward and runs in that direction for about thirty miles when it again turns to the southward and eastward as before in the sort of corner thus cut off by the deflection of the coast lies the long island of euboea which may be considered in fact as almost a continuation of the continent as it is a part of the same conformation of country and is separated from the main land only by submerged valleys on the north and on the east into these sunken valleys the sea of course flows forming straits or channels the one on the north was in ancient times called artemisium and the one on the west at its narrowest point euripus all these islands and coasts were high and picturesque they were also in the days of xerxes densely populated and adorned profusely with temples citadels and towns  on passing the southernmost extremity of the island of euboea and turning to the westward we come to a promontory of the main land which constituted attica and in the middle of which the city of athens was situated beyond this is a capacious gulf called the saronian gulf it lies between attica and the peloponnesus in the middle of the saronian gulf lies the island of Ægina and in the northern part of it the island of salamis the progress of the persian fleet was from therma down the coast to sciathus thence along the shores of euboea to its southern point and so round into the saronian gulf to the island of salamis the distance of this voyage was perhaps two hundred and fifty miles in accomplishing it the fleet encountered many dangers and met with a variety of incidents and events which we shall now proceed to describe  the country of course was every where in a state of the greatest excitement and terror the immense army was slowly coming down by land and the fleet scarcely less terrible since its descents upon the coast would be so fearfully sudden and overwhelming when they were made was advancing by sea the inhabitants of the country were consequently in a state of extreme agitation the sick and the infirm who were of course utterly helpless in such a danger exhibited every where the spectacle of silent dismay mothers wives maidens and children on the other hand were wild with excitement and terror the men too full of passion to fear or too full of pride to allow their fears to be seen were gathering in arms or hurrying to and fro with intelligence or making hasty arrangements to remove their wives and children from the scenes of cruel suffering which were to ensue they stationed watchmen on the hills to give warning of the approach of the enemy they agreed upon signals and raised piles of wood for beacon fires on every commanding elevation along the coast while all the roads leading from the threatened provinces to other regions more remote from the danger were covered with flying parties endeavoring to make their escape and carrying wearily and in sorrow whatever they valued most and were most anxious to save mothers bore their children men their gold and silver and sisters aided their sick or feeble brothers to sustain the toil and terror of the flight  all this time xerxes was sitting in his war chariot in the midst of his advancing army full of exultation happiness and pride at the thoughts of the vast harvest of glory which all this panic and suffering were bringing him in  the fleet at lengthwhich was under the command of xerxess brothers and cousins whom he had appointed the admirals of itbegan to move down the coast from therma with the intention of first sweeping the seas clear of any naval force which the greeks might have sent forward there to act against them and then of landing upon some point on the coast wherever they could do so most advantageously for cooperation with the army on the land the advance of the ships was necessarily slow so immense a flotilla could not have been otherwise kept together the admirals however selected ten of the swiftest of the galleys and after manning and arming them in the most perfect manner sent them forward to reconnoiter the ten galleys were ordered to advance rapidly but with the greatest circumspection they were not to incur any needless danger but if they met with any detached ships of the enemy they were to capture them if possible they were moreover to be constantly on the alert to observe every thing and to send back to the fleet all important intelligence which they could obtain  the ten galleys went on without observing any thing remarkable until they reached the island of sciathus here they came in sight of three greek ships a sort of advanced guard which had been stationed there to watch the movements of the enemy  the greek galleys immediately hoisted their anchors and fled the persian galleys manned their oars and pressed on after them  they overtook one of the guardships very soon and after a short conflict they succeeded in capturing it the persians made prisoners of the officers and crew and then selecting from among them the fairest and most noblelooking man just as they would have selected a bullock from a herd they sacrificed him to one of their deities on the prow of the captured ship this was a religious ceremony intended to signalize and sanctify their victory  the second vessel they also overtook and captured the crew of this ship were easily subdued as the overwhelming superiority of their enemies appeared to convince them that all resistance was hopeless and to plunge them into despair there was one man however who it seems could not be conquered he fought like a tiger to the last and only ceased to deal his furious thrusts and blows at the enemies that surrounded him when after being entirely covered with wounds he fell faint and nearly lifeless upon the bloody deck when the conflict with him was thus ended the murderous hostility of his enemies seemed suddenly to be changed into pity for his sufferings and admiration of his valor they gathered around him bathed and bound up his wounds gave him cordials and at length restored him to life finally when the detachment returned to the fleet some days afterward they carried this man with them and presented him to the commanders as a hero worthy of the highest admiration and honor the rest of the crew were made slaves  the third of the greek guardships contrived to escape or rather the crew escaped while the vessel itself was taken this ship in its flight had gone toward the north and the crew at last succeeded in running it on shore on the coast of thessaly so as to escape themselves by abandoning the vessel to the enemy the officers and crew thus escaping to the shore went through thessaly into greece spreading the tidings every where that the persians were at hand this intelligence was communicated also along the coast by beacon fires which the people of sciathus built upon the heights of the island as a signal to give the alarm to the country southward of them according to the preconcerted plan the alarm was communicated by other fires built on other heights and sentinels were stationed on every commanding eminence on the highlands of euboea toward the south to watch for the first appearance of the enemy  the persian galleys that had been sent forward having taken the three greek guardships and finding the sea before them now clear of all appearances of an enemy concluded to return to the fleet with their prizes and their report they had been directed when they were dispatched from the fleet to lay up a monument of stones at the furthest point which they should reach in their cruise a measure often resorted to in similar cases by way of furnishing proof that a party thus sent forward have really advanced as far as they pretend on their return the persian detachment had actually brought the stones for the erection of their landmark with them in one of their galleys the galley containing the stones and two others to aid it pushed on beyond sciathus to a small rocky islet standing in a conspicuous position in the sea and there they built their monument or cairn the detachment then returned to meet the fleet the time occupied by this whole expedition was eleven days  the fleet was in the mean time coming down along the coast of magnesia the whole company of ships had advanced safely and prosperously thus far but now a great calamity was about to befall themthe first of the series of disasters by which the expedition was ultimately ruined it was a storm at sea  the fleet had drawn up for the night in a long and shallow bay on the coast there was a rocky promontory at one end of this bay and a cape on the other with a long beach between them it was a very good place of refuge and rest for the night in calm weather but such a bay afforded very little shelter against a tempestuous wind or even against the surf and swell of the sea which were sometimes produced by a distant storm when the fleet entered this bay in the evening the sea was calm and the sky serene the commanders expected to remain there for the night and to proceed on the voyage on the following day  the bay was not sufficiently extensive to allow of the drawing up of so large a fleet in a single line along the shore the ships were accordingly arranged in several lines eight in all the innermost of these lines was close to the shore the others were at different distances from it and every separate ship was held to the place assigned it by its anchors in this position the fleet passed the night in safety but before morning there were indications of a storm the sky looked wild and lurid a heavy swell came rolling in from the offing the wind began to rise and to blow in fitful gusts its direction was from the eastward so that its tendency was to drive the fleet upon the shore the seamen were anxious and afraid and the commanders of the several ships began to devise each for his own vessel the best means of safety some whose vessels were small drew them up upon the sand above the reach of the swell others strengthened the anchoring tackle or added new anchors to those already down others raised their anchors altogether and attempted to row their galleys away up or down the coast in hope of finding some better place of shelter thus all was excitement and confusion in the fleet through the eager efforts made by every separate crew to escape the impending danger  in the mean time the storm came on apace the rising and roughening sea made the oars useless and the wind howled frightfully through the cordage and the rigging the galleys soon began to be forced away from their moorings some were driven upon the beach and dashed to pieces by the waves some were wrecked on the rocks at one or the other of the projecting points which bounded the bay on either hand some foundered at their place of anchorage vast numbers of men were drowned those who escaped to the shore were in hourly dread of an attack from the inhabitants of the country to save themselves if possible from this danger they dragged up the fragments of the wrecked vessels upon the beach and built a fort with them on the shore here they intrenched themselves and then prepared to defend their lives armed with the weapons which like the materials for their fort were washed up from time to time by the sea  the storm continued for three days it destroyed about three hundred galleys besides an immense number of provision transports and other smaller vessels great numbers of seamen also were drowned the inhabitants of the country along the coast enriched themselves with the plunder which they obtained from the wrecks and from the treasures and the gold and silver vessels which continued for some time to be driven up upon the beach by the waves the persians themselves recovered it was said a great deal of valuable treasure by employing a certain greek diver whom they had in their fleet to dive for it after the storm was over this diver whose name was scyllias was famed far and wide for his power of remaining under water as an instance of what they believed him capable of performing they said that when at a certain period subsequent to these transactions he determined to desert to the greeks he accomplished his design by diving into the sea from the deck of a persian galley and coming up again in the midst of the greek fleet ten miles distant  after three days the storm subsided the persians then repaired the damages which had been sustained so far as it was now possible to repair them collected what remained of the fleet took the shipwrecked mariners from their rude fortification on the beach and set sail again on their voyage to the southward  in the mean time the greek fleet had assembled in the arm of the sea lying north of euboea and between euboea and the main land it was an allied fleet made up of contributions from various states that had finally agreed to come into the confederacy as is usually the case however with allied or confederate forces they were not well agreed among themselves the athenians had furnished far the greater number of ships and they considered themselves therefore entitled to the command but the other allies were envious and jealous of them on account of that very superiority of wealth and power which enabled them to supply a greater portion of the naval force than the rest they were willing that one of the spartans should command but they would not consent to put themselves under an athenian if an athenian leader were chosen they would disperse they said and the various portions of the fleet return to their respective homes  the athenians though burning with resentment at this unjust declaration were compelled to submit to the necessity of the case they could not take the confederates at their word and allow the fleet to be broken up for the defense of athens was the great object for which it was assembled the other states might make their peace with the conqueror by submission but the athenians could not do so in respect to the rest of greece xerxes wished only for dominion in respect to athens he wished for vengeance the athenians had burned the persian city of sardis and he had determined to give himself no rest until he had burned athens in return  it was well understood therefore that the assembling of the fleet and giving battle to the persians where they now were was a plan adopted mainly for the defense and benefit of the athenians the athenians accordingly waived their claim to command secretly resolving that when the war was over they would have their revenge for the insult and injury  a spartan was accordingly appointed commander of the fleet his name was eurybiades  things were in this state when the two fleets came in sight of each other in the strait between the northern end of euboea and the main land fifteen of the persian galleys advancing incautiously some miles in front of the rest came suddenly upon the greek fleet and were all captured the crews were made prisoners and sent into greece the remainder of the fleet entered the strait and anchored at the eastern extremity of it sheltered by the promontory of magnesia which now lay to the north of them  the greeks were amazed at the immense magnitude of the persian fleet and the first opinion of the commanders was that it was wholly useless for them to attempt to engage them a council was convened and after a long and anxious debate they decided that it was best to retire to the southward the inhabitants of euboea who had been already in a state of great excitement and terror at the near approach of so formidable an enemy were thrown by this decision of the allies into a state of absolute dismay it was abandoning them to irremediable and hopeless destruction  the government of the island immediately raised a very large sum of money and went with it to themistocles one of the most influential of the athenian leaders and offered it to him if he would contrive any way to persuade the commanders of the fleet to remain and give the persians battle where they were themistocles took the money and agreed to the condition he went with a small part of itthough this part was a very considerable sumto eurybiades the commanderinchief and offered it to him if he would retain the fleet in its present position there were some other similar offerings made to other influential men judiciously selected all this was done in a very private manner and of course themistocles took care to reserve to himself the lions share of the euboean contribution the effect of this money in altering the opinions of the naval officers was marvelous a new council was called the former decision was annulled and the greeks determined to give their enemies battle where they were  the persians had not been unmindful of the danger that the greeks might retreat by retiring through the euripus and so escape them in order to prevent this they secretly sent off a fleet of two hundred of their strongest and fleetest galleys with orders to sail round euboea and enter the euripus from the south so as to cut off the retreat of the greeks in that quarter they thought that by this plan the greek fleet would be surrounded and could have no possible mode of escape they remained therefore with the principal fleet at the outer entrance of the northern strait for some days before attacking the greeks in order to give time for the detachment to pass round the island  the persians sent off the two hundred galleys with great secrecy not desiring that the greeks should discover their design of thus intercepting their retreat they did discover it however for this was the occasion on which the great diver scyllias made his escape from one fleet to the other by swimming under water ten miles and he brought the greeks the tidingse  footnote e there is reason to suppose that scyllias made his escape by night in a boat managing the circumstances however in such a way as to cause the story to be circulated that he swam  the greeks dispatched a small squadron of ships with orders to proceed southward into the euripus to meet this detachment which the persians sent round and in the mean time they determined themselves to attack the main persian fleet without any delay notwithstanding their absurd dissensions and jealousies and the extent to which the leaders were influenced by intrigues and bribes the greeks always evinced an undaunted and indomitable spirit when the day of battle came it was moreover in this case exceedingly important to defend the position which they had taken by referring to the map once more it will be seen that the euripus was the great highway to athens by sea as the pass of thermopylæ was by land thermopylæ was west of artemisium where the fleet was now stationed and not many miles from it the greek army had made its great stand at thermopylæ and xerxes was fast coming down the country with all his forces to endeavor to force a passage there the persian fleet in entering artemisium was making the same attempt by sea in respect to the narrow passage of euripus and for either of the two forces the fleet or the army to fail of making good the defense of its position without a desperate effort to do so would justly be considered a base betrayal and abandonment of the other  the greeks therefore advanced one morning to the attack of the persians to the utter astonishment of the latter who believed that their enemies were insane when they thus saw them coming into the jaws as they thought of certain destruction before night however they were to change their opinions in respect to the insanity of their foes the greeks pushed boldly on into the midst of the persian fleet where they were soon surrounded they then formed themselves into a circle with the prows of the vessels outward and the sterns toward the center within and fought in this manner with the utmost desperation all the day with the night a storm came on or rather a series of thundershowers and gusts of wind so severe that both fleets were glad to retire from the scene of contest the persians went back toward the east the greeks to the westward toward thermopylæeach party busy in repairing their wrecks taking care of their wounded and saving their vessels from the tempest it was a dreadful night the persians particularly spent it in the midst of scenes of horror the wind and the current it seems set outward toward the sea and carried the masses and fragments of the wrecked vessels and the swollen and ghastly bodies of the dead in among the persian fleet and so choked up the surface of the water that the oars became entangled and useless the whole mass of seamen in the persian fleet during this terrible night were panicstricken and filled with horror the wind the perpetual thunder the concussions of the vessels with the wrecks and with one another and the heavy shocks of the seas kept them in continual alarm and the black and inscrutable darkness was rendered the more dreadful while it prevailed by the hideous spectacle which at every flash of lightning glared brilliantly upon every eye from the wide surface of the sea the shouts and cries of officers vociferating orders of wounded men writhing in agony of watchmen and sentinels in fear of collisions mingled with the howling wind and roaring seas created a scene of indescribable terror and confusion  the violence of the sudden gale was still greater further out at sea and the detachment of ships which had been sent around euboea was wholly dispersed and destroyed by it  the storm was however after all only a series of summer evening showers such as to the inhabitants of peaceful dwellings on the land have no terror but only come to clear the sultry atmosphere in the night and in the morning are gone when the sun rose accordingly upon the greeks and persians on the morning after their conflict the air was calm the sky serene and the sea as blue and pure as ever the bodies and the wrecks had been floated away into the offing the courage or the ferocity whichever we choose to call it of the combatants returned and they renewed the conflict it continued with varying success for two more days  during all this time the inhabitants of the island of euboea were in the greatest distress and terror they watched these dreadful conflicts from the heights uncertain how the struggle would end but fearing lest their defenders should be beaten in which case the whole force of the persian fleet would be landed on their island to sweep it with pillage and destruction they soon began to anticipate the worst and in preparation for it they removed their goodsall that could be removedand drove their cattle down to the southern part of the island so as to be ready to escape to the main land the greek commanders finding that the fleet would probably be compelled to retreat in the end sent to them here recommending that they should kill their cattle and eat them roasting the flesh at fires which they should kindle on the plain the cattle could not be transported they said across the channel and it was better that the flying population should be fed than that the food should fall into persian hands if they would dispose of their cattle in this manner eurybiades would endeavor he said to transport the people themselves and their valuable goods across into attica  how many thousand peaceful and happy homes were broken up and destroyed forever by this ruthless invasion  in the mean time the persians irritated by the obstinate resistance of the greeks were on the fourth day preparing for some more vigorous measures when they saw a small boat coming toward the fleet from down the channel it proved to contain a countryman who came to tell them that the greeks had gone away the whole fleet he said had sailed off to the southward and abandoned those seas altogether the persians did not at first believe this intelligence they suspected some ambuscade or stratagem they advanced slowly and cautiously down the channel when they had gone half down to thermopylæ they stopped at a place called histiæa where upon the rocks on the shore they found an inscription addressed to the ionianswho it will be recollected had been brought by xerxes as auxiliaries contrary to the advice of artabanusentreating them not to fight against their countrymen this inscription was written in large and conspicuous characters on the face of the cliff so that it could be read by the ionian seamen as they passed in their galleys  the fleet anchored at histiæa the commanders being somewhat uncertain in respect to what it was best to do their suspense was very soon relieved by a messenger from xerxes who came in a galley up the channel from thermopylæ with the news that xerxes had arrived at thermopylæ had fought a great battle there defeated the greeks and obtained possession of the pass and that any of the officers of the fleet who chose to do so might come and view the battle ground this intelligence and invitation produced throughout the fleet a scene of the wildest excitement enthusiasm and joy all the boats and smaller vessels of the fleet were put into requisition to carry the officers down when they arrived at thermopylæ the tidings all proved true xerxes was in possession of the pass and the greek fleet was gone     chapter ix  the battle of thermopylÆ  bc 480  the pass of thermopylæits situationancient intrenchmentsview at thermopylæthe allied forcesleonidas the spartandebate in regard

leonidasmessage to the fleetxerxes sends for demaratusconversation with demaratusplans proposed by himopposition of the admiraldecision of xerxes   the pass of thermopylæ was not a ravine among mountains but a narrow space between mountains and the sea the mountains landward were steep and inaccessible the sea was shoal the passage between them was narrow for many miles along the shore being narrowest at the ingress and egress in the middle the space was broader the place was celebrated for certain warm springs which here issued from the rocks and which had been used in former times for baths  the position had been considered long before xerxess day a very important one in a military point of view as it was upon the frontier between two greek states that were frequently at war one of these states of course was thessaly the other was phocis which lay south of thessaly the general boundary between these two states was mountainous and impassable for troops so that each could invade the territories of the other only by passing round between the mountains and the shore at thermopylæ  the phocæans in order to keep the thessalians out had in former times built a wall across the way and put up gates there which they strongly fortified in order still further to increase the difficulty of forcing a passage they conducted the water of the warm springs over the ground without the wall in such a way as to make the surface continually wet and miry the old wall had now fallen to ruins but the miry ground remained the place was solitary and desolate and overgrown with a confused and wild vegetation on one side the view extended far and wide over the sea with the highlands of euboea in the distance and on the other dark and inaccessible mountains rose covered with forests indented with mysterious and unexplored ravines and frowning in a wild and gloomy majesty over the narrow passway which crept along the shore below  the greeks when they retired from thessaly fell back upon thermopylæ and established themselves there they had a force variously estimated from three to four thousand men these were from the different states of greece some within and some without the peloponnesusa few hundred men only being furnished in general from each state or kingdom each of these bodies of troops had its own officers though there was one generalinchief who commanded the whole this was leonidas the spartan he had brought with him three hundred spartans as the quota furnished by that city these men he had specially selected himself one by one from among the troops of the city as men on whom he could rely  it will be seen from the map that thermopylæ is at some distance from the isthmus of corinth and that of the states which would be protected by making a stand at the pass some were without the isthmus and some within these states in sending each a few hundred men only to thermopylæ did not consider that they were making their full contribution to the army but only sending forward for the emergency those that could be dispatched at once and they were all making arrangements to supply more troops as soon as they could be raised and equipped for the service in the mean time however xerxes and his immense hordes came on faster than they had expected and the news at length came to leonidas in the pass that the persians with one or two millions of men were at hand while he had only three or four thousand at thermopylæ to oppose them the question arose what was to be done  those of the greeks who came from the peloponnesus were in favor of abandoning thermopylæ and falling back to the isthmus the isthmus they maintained was as strong and as favorable a position as the place where they were and by the time they had reached it they would have received great reenforcements whereas with so small a force as they had then at command it was madness to attempt to resist the persian millions this plan however was strongly opposed by all those greeks who represented countries without the peloponnesus for by abandoning thermopylæ and falling back to the isthmus their states would be left wholly at the mercy of the enemy after some consultation and debate it was decided to remain at thermopylæ the troops accordingly took up their positions in a deliberate and formal manner and intrenching themselves as strongly as possible began to await the onset of the enemy leonidas and his three hundred were foremost in the defile so as to be the first exposed to the attack the rest occupied various positions along the passage except one corps which was stationed on the mountains above to guard the pass in that direction this corps was from phocis which being the state nearest to the scene of conflict had furnished a larger number of soldiers than any other their division numbered a thousand men these being stationed on the declivity of the mountain left only two or three thousand in the defile below  from what has been said of the stern and savage character of the spartans one would scarcely expect in them any indications or displays of personal vanity there was one particular it seems however in regard to which they were vain and that was in respect to their hair they wore it very long in fact the length of the hair was in their commonwealth a mark of distinction between freemen and slaves all the agricultural and mechanical labors were performed as has already been stated by the slaves a body which constituted in fact the mass of the population and the spartan freemen though very stern in their manners and extremely simple and plain in their habits of life were it must be remembered as proud and lofty in spirit as they were plain and poor they constituted a military aristocracy and a military aristocracy is always more proud and overbearing than any other  it must be understood therefore that these spartan soldiers were entirely above the performance of any useful labors and while they prized in character the savage ferocity of the tiger they had a taste in person for something like his savage beauty too they were never moreover more particular and careful in respect to their personal appearance than when they were going into battle the field of battle was their particular theater of display not only of the substantial qualities of strength fortitude and valor but also of such personal adornments as were consistent with the plainness and severity of their attire and could be appreciated by a taste as rude and savage as theirs they proceeded therefore when established at their post in the throat of the pass to adorn themselves for the approaching battle  in the mean time the armies of xerxes were approaching xerxes himself though he did not think it possible that the greeks could have a sufficient force to offer him any effectual resistance thought it probable that they would attempt to make a stand at the pass and when he began to draw near to it he sent forward a horseman to reconnoiter the ground the horseman rode into the pass a little way until he came in sight of the enemy he stopped upon an eminence to survey the scene being all ready to turn in an instant and fly at the top of his speed in case he should be pursued the spartans looked upon him as he stood there but seemed to consider his appearance as a circumstance of no moment and then went on with their avocations the horseman found as he leisurely observed them that there was an intrenchment thrown across the straits and that the spartans were in front of it there were other forces behind but these the horseman could not see the spartans were engaged some of them in athletic sports and gymnastic exercises and the rest in nicely arranging their dress which was red and showy in color though simple and plain in form and in smoothing adjusting and curling their hair in fact they seemed to be one and all preparing for an entertainment  and yet these men were actually preparing themselves to be slaughtered to be butchered one by one by slow degrees and in the most horrible and cruel manner and they knew perfectly well that it was so the adorning of themselves was for this express and particular end  the horseman when he had attentively noticed all that was to be seen rode slowly back to xerxes and reported the result the king was much amused at hearing such an account from his messenger he sent for demaratus the spartan refugee with whom the reader will recollect he held a long conversation in respect to the greeks at the close of the great review at doriscus when demaratus came xerxes related to him what the messenger had reported the spartans in the pass said he present in their encampment the appearance of being out on a party of pleasure what does it mean you will admit now i suppose that they do not intend to resist us  demaratus shook his head your majesty does not know the greeks said he and i am very much afraid that if i state what i know respecting them i shall offend you these appearances which your messenger observed indicate to me that the men he saw were a body of spartans and that they supposed themselves on the eve of a desperate conflict those are the men practicing athletic feats and smoothing and adorning their hair that are the most to be feared of all the soldiers of greece if you can conquer them you will have nothing beyond to fear  xerxes thought this opinion of demaratus extremely absurd he was convinced that the party in the pass was some small detachment that could not possibly be thinking of serious resistance they would he was satisfied now that they found that the persians were at hand immediately retire down the pass and leave the way clear he advanced therefore up to the entrance of the pass encamped there and waited several days for the greeks to clear the way the greeks remained quietly in their places paying apparently no attention whatever to the impending and threatening presence of their formidable foes  at length xerxes concluded that it was time for him to act on the morning therefore of the fifth day he called out a detachment of his troops sufficient as he thought for the purpose and sent them down the pass with orders to seize all the greeks that were there and bring them alive to him the detachment that he sent was a body of medes who were considered as the best troops in the army excepting always the immortals who as has been before stated were entirely superior to the rest the medes however xerxes supposed would find no difficulty in executing his orders  the detachment marched accordingly into the pass in a few hours a spent and breathless messenger came from them asking for reenforcements the reenforcements were sent toward night a remnant of the whole body came back faint and exhausted with a long and fruitless combat and bringing many of their wounded and bleeding comrades with them the rest they had left dead in the defile  xerxes was both astonished and enraged at these results he determined that this trifling should continue no longer he ordered the immortals themselves to be called out on the following morning and then placing himself at the head of them he advanced to the vicinity of the greek intrenchments here he ordered a seat or throne to be placed for him upon an eminence and taking his seat upon it prepared to witness the conflict the greeks in the mean time calmly arranged themselves on the line which they had undertaken to defend and awaited the charge upon the ground on every side were lying the mangled bodies of the persians slain the day before some exposed fully to view ghastly and horrid spectacles others trampled down and half buried in the mire  the immortals advanced to the attack but they made no impression their superior numbers gave them no advantage on account of the narrowness of the defile the greeks stood each corps at its own assigned station on the line forming a mass so firm and immovable that the charge of the persians was arrested on encountering it as by a wall in fact as the spears of the greeks were longer than those of the persians and their muscular and athletic strength and skill were greater it was found that in the desperate conflict which raged hour after hour along the line the persians were continually falling while the greek ranks continued entire sometimes the greeks would retire for a space falling back with the utmost coolness regularity and order and then when the persians pressed on in pursuit supposing that they were gaining the victory the greeks would turn so soon as they found that the ardor of pursuit had thrown the enemies lines somewhat into confusion and presenting the same firm and terrible front as before would press again upon the offensive and cut down their enemies with redoubled slaughter xerxes who witnessed all these things from among the group of officers around him upon the eminence was kept continually in a state of excitement and irritation three times he leaped from his throne with loud exclamations of vexation and rage  all however was of no avail when night came the immortals were compelled to withdraw and leave the greeks in possession of their intrenchments  things continued substantially in this state for one or two days longer when one morning a greek countryman appeared at the tent of xerxes and asked an audience of the king he had something he said of great importance to communicate to him the king ordered him to be admitted the greek said that his name was ephialtes and that he came to inform the king that there was a secret path leading along a wild and hidden chasm in the mountains by which he could guide a body of persians to the summit of the hills overhanging the pass at a point below the greek intrenchment this point being once attained it would be easy ephialtes said for the persian forces to descend into the pass below the greeks and thus to surround them and shut them in and that the conquest of them would then be easy the path was a secret one and known to very few he knew it however and was willing to conduct a detachment of troops through it on condition of receiving a suitable reward  the king was greatly surprised and delighted at this intelligence he immediately acceded to ephialtess proposals and organized a strong force to be sent up the path that very night  on the north of thermopylæ there was a small stream which came down through a chasm in the mountains to the sea the path which ephialtes was to show commenced here and following the bed of this stream up the chasm it at length turned to the southward through a succession of wild and trackless ravines till it came out at last on the declivities of the mountains near the lower part of the pass at a place where it was possible to descend to the defile below this was the point which the thousand phocæans had been ordered to take possession of and guard when the plan for the defense of the pass was first organized they were posted here not with the idea of repelling any attack from the mountains behind themfor the existence of the path was wholly unknown to thembut only that they might command the defile below and aid in preventing the persians from going through even if those who were in the defile were defeated or slain  the persian detachment toiled all night up the steep and dangerous pathway among rocks chasms and precipices frightful by day and now made still more frightful by the gloom of the night they came out at last in the dawn of the morning into valleys and glens high up the declivity of the mountain and in the immediate vicinity of the phocæan encampment the persians were concealed as they advanced by the groves and thickets of stunted oaks which grew here but the morning air was so calm and still that the phocæan sentinels heard the noise made by their trampling upon the leaves as they came up the glen the phocæans immediately gave the alarm both parties were completely surprised the persians had not expected to find a foe at this elevation and the greeks who had ascended there had supposed that all beyond and above them was an impassable and trackless desolation  there was a short conflict the phocæans were driven off their ground they retreated up the mountain and toward the southward the persians decided not to pursue them on the other hand they descended toward the defile and took up a position on the lower declivities of the mountain which enabled them to command the pass below there they paused and awaited xerxess orders  the greeks in the defile perceived at once that they were now wholly at the mercy of their enemies they might yet retreat it is true for the persian detachment had not yet descended to intercept them but if they remained where they were they would in a few hours be hemmed in by their foes and even if they could resist for a little time the double onset which would then be made upon them their supplies would be cut off and there would be nothing before them but immediate starvation they held hurried councils to determine what to do  there is some doubt as to what took place at these councils though the prevailing testimony is that leonidas recommended that they should retirethat is that all except himself and the three hundred spartans should do so you said he addressing the other greeks are at liberty by your laws to consider in such cases as this the question of expediency and to withdraw from a position which you have taken or stand and maintain it according as you judge best but by our laws such a question in such a case is not to be entertained wherever we are posted there we stand come life or death to the end we have been sent here from sparta to defend the pass of thermopylæ we have received no orders to withdraw here therefore we must remain and the persians if they go through the pass at all must go through it over our graves it is therefore your duty to retire our duty is here and we will remain and do it  after all that may be said of the absurdity and folly of throwing away the lives of three hundred men in a case like this so utterly and hopelessly desperate there is still something in the noble generosity with which leonidas dismissed the other greeks and in the undaunted resolution with which he determined himself to maintain his ground which has always strongly excited the admiration of mankind it was undoubtedly carrying the point of honor to a wholly unjustifiable extreme and yet all the world for the twenty centuries which have intervened since these transactions occurred while they have unanimously disapproved in theory of the course which leonidas pursued have none the less unanimously admired and applauded it  in dismissing the other greeks leonidas retained with him a body of thebans whom he suspected of a design of revolting to the enemy whether he considered his decision to keep them in the pass equivalent to a sentence of death and intended it as a punishment for their supposed treason or only that he wished to secure their continued fidelity by keeping them closely to their duty does not appear at all events he retained them and dismissed the other allies those dismissed retreated to the open country below the spartans and the thebans remained in the pass there were also it was said some other troops who not willing to leave the spartans alone in this danger chose to remain with them and share their fate the thebans remained very unwillingly  the next morning xerxes prepared for his final effort he began by solemn religious services in the presence of his army at an early hour and then after breakfasting quietly as usual and waiting in fact until the business part of the day had arrived he gave orders to advance his troops found leonidas and his party not at their intrenchments as before but far in advance of them they had come out and forward into a more open part of the defile as if to court and anticipate their inevitable and dreaded fate here a most terrible combat ensued one which for a time seemed to have no other object than mutual destruction until at length leonidas himself fell and then the contest for the possession of his body superseded the unthinking and desperate struggles of mere hatred and rage four times the body having been taken by the persians was retaken by the greeks at last the latter retreated bearing the dead body with them past their intrenchment until they gained a small eminence in the rear of it at a point where the pass was wider here the few that were still left gathered together the detachment which ephialtes had guided were coming up from below the spartans were faint and exhausted with their desperate efforts and were bleeding from the wounds they had received their swords and spears were broken to pieces their leader and nearly all their company were slain but the savage and tigerlike ferocity which animated them continued unabated till the last they fought with tooth and nail when all other weapons failed them and bit the dust at last as they fell in convulsive and unyielding despair the struggle did not cease till they were all slain and every limb of every man ceased to quiver  there were stories in circulation among mankind after this battle importing that one or two of the corps escaped the fate of the rest there were two soldiers it was said that had been left in a town near the pass as invalids being afflicted with a severe inflammation of the eyes one of them when he heard that the spartans were to be left in the pass went in of his own accord and joined them choosing to share the fate of his comrades it was said that he ordered his servant to conduct him to the place the servant did so and then fled himself in great terror the sick soldier remained and fought with the rest the other of the invalids was saved but on his return to sparta he was considered as stained with indelible disgrace for what his countrymen regarded a base dereliction from duty in not sharing his comrades fate  there was also a story of another man who had been sent away on some mission into thessaly and who did not return until all was over and also of two others who had been sent to sparta and were returning when they heard of the approaching conflict one of them hastened into the pass and was killed with his companions the other delayed and was saved whether any or all of these rumors were true is not now certain there is however no doubt that with at most a few exceptions such as these the whole three hundred were slain  the thebans early in the conflict went over in a body to the enemy  xerxes came after the battle to view the ground it was covered with many thousands of dead bodies nearly all of whom of course were persians the wall of the intrenchment was broken down and the breaches in it choked up by the bodies the morasses made by the water of the springs were trampled into deep mire and were full of the mutilated forms of men and of broken weapons when xerxes came at last to the body of leonidas and was told that that was the man who had been the leader of the band he gloried over it in great exaltation and triumph at length he ordered the body to be decapitated and the headless trunk to be nailed to a cross  xerxes then commanded that a great hole should be dug and ordered all the bodies of the persians that had been killed to be buried in it except only about a thousand which he left upon the ground the object of this was to conceal the extent of the loss which his army had sustained the more perfectly to accomplish this end he caused the great grave when it was filled up to be strewed over with leaves so as to cover and conceal all indications of what had been done this having been carefully effected he sent the message to the fleet which was alluded to at the close of the last chapter inviting the officers to come and view the ground  the operations of the fleet described in the last chapter and those of the army narrated in this took place it will be remembered at the same time and in the same vicinity too for by referring to the map it will appear that thermopylæ was upon the coast exactly opposite to the channel or arm of the sea lying north of euboea where the naval contests had been waged so that while xerxes had been making his desperate efforts to get through the pass his fleet had been engaged in a similar conflict with the squadrons of the greeks directly opposite to him twenty or thirty miles in the offing  after the battle of thermopylæ was over xerxes sent for demaratus and inquired of him how many more such soldiers there were in greece as leonidas and his three hundred spartans demaratus replied that he could not say how many precisely there were in greece but that there were eight thousand such in sparta alone xerxes then asked the opinion of demaratus as to the course best to be pursued for making the conquest of the country this conversation was held in the presence of various nobles and officers among whom was the admiral of the fleet who had come with the various other naval commanders as was stated in the last chapter to view the battlefield  demaratus said that he did not think that the king could easily get possession of the peloponnesus by marching to it directly so formidable would be the opposition that he would encounter at the isthmus there was however he said an island called cythera opposite to the territories of sparta and not far from the shore of which he thought that the king could easily get possession and which once fully in his power might be made the base of future operations for the reduction of the whole peninsula as bodies of troops could be dispatched from it to the main land in any numbers and at any time he recommended therefore that three hundred ships with a proper complement of men should be detached from the fleet and sent round at once to take possession of that island  to this plan the admiral of the fleet was totally opposed it was natural that he should be so since the detaching of three hundred ships for this enterprise would greatly weaken the force under his command it would leave the fleet he told the king a miserable remnant not superior to that of the enemy for they had already lost four hundred ships by storms he thought it infinitely preferable that the fleet and the army should advance together the one by sea and the other on the land and complete their conquests as they went along he advised the king too to beware of demaratuss advice he was a greek and as such his object was the admiral believed to betray and ruin the expedition  after hearing these conflicting opinions the king decided to follow the admirals advice i will adopt your counsel said he but i will not hear any thing said against demaratus for i am convinced that he is a true and faithful friend to me saying this he dismissed the council     chapter x  the burning of athens  bc 480  the officers return to their vesselsthe greek fleet retire to salamisthe thessalianstheir hostility to the

persian fleet had satisfied themselves with examining the battlefield at thermopylæ and had heard the narrations given by the soldiers of the terrible combats that had been fought with the desperate garrison which had been stationed to defend the pass they went back to their vessels and prepared to make sail to the southward in pursuit of the greek fleet the greek fleet had gone to salamis the persians in due time overtook them there and a great naval conflict occurred which is known in history as the battle of salamis and was one of the most celebrated naval battles of ancient times an account of this battle will form the subject of the next chapter in this we are to follow the operations of the army on the land  as the pass of thermopylæ was now in xerxess possession the way was open before him to all that portion of the great territory which lay north of the peloponnesus of course before he could enter the peninsula itself he must pass the isthmus of corinth where he might perhaps encounter some concentrated resistance north of the isthmus however there was no place where the greeks could make a stand the country was all open or rather there were a thousand ways open through the various valleys and glens and along the banks of the rivers all that was necessary was to procure guides and proceed  the thessalians were very ready to furnish guides they had submitted to xerxes before the battle of thermopylæ and they considered themselves accordingly as his allies they had besides a special interest in conducting the persian army on account of the hostile feelings which they entertained toward the people immediately south of the pass into whose territories xerxes would first carry his ravages this people were the phocæans their country as has already been stated was separated from thessaly by impassable mountains except where the straits of thermopylæ opened a passage and through this pass both nations had been continually making hostile incursions into the territory of the other for many years before the persian invasion the thessalians had surrendered readily to the summons of xerxes while the phocæans had determined to resist him and adhere to the cause of the greeks in the struggle they were suspected of having been influenced in a great measure in their determination to resist by the fact that the thessalians had decided to surrender they were resolved that they would not on any account be upon the same side with their ancient and inveterate foes  the hostility of the thessalians to the phocæans was equally implacable at the last incursion which they had made into the phocæan territory they had been defeated by means of stratagems in a manner which tended greatly to vex and irritate them there were two of these stratagems which were both completely successful and both of a very extraordinary character  the first was this the thessalians were in the phocæan country in great force and the phocæans had found themselves utterly unable to expel them under these circumstances a body of the phocæans six hundred in number one day whitened their faces their arms and hands their clothes and all their weapons with chalk and then at the dead of nightperhaps however when the moon was shiningmade an onset upon the camp of the enemy the thessalian sentinels were terrified and ran away and the soldiers awakened from their slumbers by these unearthlylooking troops screamed with fright and fled in all directions in utter confusion and dismay a night attack is usually a dangerous attempt even if the assaulting party is the strongest as in the darkness and confusion which then prevail the assailants can not ordinarily distinguish friends from foes and so are in great danger amid the tumult and obscurity of slaying one another that difficulty was obviated in this case by the strange disguise which the phocæans had assumed they knew that all were thessalians who were not whitened like themselves the thessalians were totally discomfited and dispersed by this encounter  the other stratagem was of a different character and was directed against a troop of cavalry the thessalian cavalry were renowned throughout the world the broad plains extending through the heart of their country contained excellent fields for training and exercising such troops and the mountains which surrounded it furnished grassy slopes and verdant valleys that supplied excellent pasturage for the rearing of horses the nation was very strong therefore in this species of force and many of the states and kingdoms of greece when planning their means of internal defense and potentates and conquerors when going forth on great campaigns often considered their armies incomplete unless there was included in them a corps of thessalian cavalry  a troop of this cavalry had invaded phocis and the phocæans conscious of their inability to resist them in open war contrived to entrap them in the following manner they dug a long trench in the ground and then putting in baskets or casks sufficient nearly to fill the space they spread over the top a thin layer of soil they then concealed all indications that the ground had been disturbed by spreading leaves over the surface the trap being thus prepared they contrived to entice the thessalians to the spot by a series of retreats and at length led them into the pitfall thus provided for them the substructure of casks was strong enough to sustain the phocæans who went over it as footmen but was too fragile to bear the weight of the mounted troops the horses broke through and the squadron was thrown into such confusion by so unexpected a disaster that when the phocæans turned and fell upon them they were easily overcome  these things had irritated and vexed the thessalians very much they were eager for revenge and they were very ready to guide the armies of xerxes into the country of their enemies in order to obtain it  the troops advanced accordingly awakening every where as they came on the greatest consternation and terror among the inhabitants and producing on all sides scenes of indescribable anguish and suffering they came into the valley of the cephisus a beautiful river flowing through a delightful and fertile region which contained many cities and towns and was filled every where with an industrious rural population through this scene of peace and happiness and plenty the vast horde of invaders swept on with the destructive force of a tornado they plundered the towns of every thing which could be carried away and destroyed what they were compelled to leave behind them there is a catalogue of twelve cities in this valley which they burned the inhabitants too were treated with the utmost cruelty some were seized and compelled to follow the army as slaves others were slain and others still were subjected to nameless cruelties and atrocities worse sometimes than death many of the women both mothers and maidens died in consequence of the brutal violence with which the soldiers treated them  the most remarkable of the transactions connected with xerxess advance through the country of phocis on his way to athens were those connected with his attack upon delphi delphi was a sacred town the seat of the oracle it was in the vicinity of mount parnassus and of the castalian spring places of very great renown in the greek mythology  parnassus was the name of a short mountainous range rather than of a single peak though the loftiest summit of the range was called parnassus too this summit is found by modern measurement to be about eight thousand feet high and it is covered with snow nearly all the year when bare it consists only of a desolate range of rocks with mosses and a few alpine plants growing on the sheltered and sunny sides of them from the top of parnassus travelers who now visit it look down upon almost all of greece as upon a map the gulf of corinth is a silver lake at their feet and the plains of thessaly are seen extending far and wide to the northward with olympus pelion and ossa blue and distant peaks bounding the view  parnassus has in fact a double summit between the peaks of which a sort of ravine commences which as it extends down the mountain becomes a beautiful valley shaded with rows of trees and adorned with slopes of verdure and banks of flowers in a glen connected with this valley there is a fountain of water springing copiously from among the rocks in a grove of laurels this fountain gives rise to a stream which after bounding over the rocks and meandering between mossy banks for a long distance down the mountain glens becomes a quiet lowland stream and flows gently through a fertile and undulating country to the sea this fountain was the famous castalian spring it was as the ancient greek legends said the favorite resort and residence of apollo and the muses and its waters became accordingly the symbol and the emblem of poetical inspiration  the city of delphi was built upon the lower declivities of the parnassian ranges and yet high above the surrounding country it was built in the form of an amphitheater in a sort of lap in the hill where it stood with steep precipices descending to a great depth on either side it was thus a position of difficult access and was considered almost impregnable in respect to its military strength besides its natural defenses it was considered as under the special protection of apollo  delphi was celebrated throughout the world in ancient times not only for the oracle itself but for the magnificence of the architectural structures the boundless profusion of the works of art and the immense value of the treasures which in process of time had been accumulated there the various powers and potentates that had resorted to it to obtain the responses of the oracle had brought rich presents or made costly contributions in some way to the service of the shrine some had built temples others had constructed porches or colonnades some had adorned the streets of the city with architectural embellishments others had caused statues to be erected and others had made splendid donations of vessels of gold and silver until at length the wealth and magnificence of delphi was the wonder of the world all nations resorted to it some to see its splendors and others to obtain the counsel and direction of the oracle in emergencies of difficulty or danger  in the time of xerxes delphi had been for several hundred years in the enjoyment of its fame as a place of divine inspiration it was said to have been originally discovered in the following manner some herdsmen on the mountains watching their flocks observed one day a number of goats performing very strange and unaccountable antics among some crevices in the rocks and going to the place they found that a mysterious wind was issuing from the crevices which produced an extraordinary exhilaration on all who breathed it every thing extraordinary was thought in those days to be supernatural and divine and the fame of this discovery was spread every where the people supposing that the effect produced upon the men and animals by breathing the mysterious air was a divine inspiration a temple was built over the spot priests and priestesses were installed a city began to rise and in process of time delphi became the most celebrated oracle in the world and as the vast treasures which had been accumulated there consisted mainly of gifts and offerings consecrated to a divine and sacred service they were all understood to be under divine protection they were defended it is true in part by the inaccessibleness of the position of delphi and by the artificial fortifications which had been added from time to time to increase the security but still more by the feeling which every where prevailed that any violence offered to such a shrine would be punished by the gods as sacrilege the account of the manner in which xerxes was repulsed as related by the ancient historians is somewhat marvelous we however in this case as in all others transmit the story to our readers as the ancient historians give it to us  the main body of the army pursued its way directly southward toward the city of athens which was now the great object at which xerxes aimed a large detachment however separating from the main body moved more to the westward toward delphi their plan was to plunder the temples and the city and send the treasures to the king the delphians on hearing this were seized with consternation they made application themselves to the oracle to know what they were to do in respect to the sacred treasures they could not defend them they said against such a host and they inquired whether they should bury them in the earth or attempt to remove them to some distant place of safety  the oracle replied that they were to do nothing at all in respect to the sacred treasures the divinity it said was able to protect what was its own they on their part had only to provide for themselves their wives and their children  on hearing this response the people dismissed all care in respect to the treasures of the temple and of the shrine and made arrangements for removing their families and their own effects to some place of safety toward the southward the military force of the city and a small number of the inhabitants alone remained  when the persians began to draw near a prodigy occurred in the temple which seemed intended to warn the profane invaders away it seems that there was a suit of arms of a costly character doubtless and highly decorated with gold and gemsthe present probably of some grecian state or kingwhich were hung in an inner and sacred apartment of the temple and which it was sacrilegious for any human hand to touch these arms were found on the day when the persians were approaching removed to the outward front of the temple the priest who first observed them was struck with amazement and awe he spread the intelligence among the soldiers and the people that remained and the circumstance awakened in them great animation and courage  nor were the hopes of divine interposition which this wonder awakened disappointed in the end for as soon as the detachment of persians came near the hill on which delphi was situated loud thunder burst from the sky and a bolt descending upon the precipices near the town detached two enormous masses of rock which rolled down upon the ranks of the invaders the delphian soldiers taking advantage of the scene of panic and confusion which this awful visitation produced rushed down upon their enemies and completed their discomfiture they were led on and assisted in this attack by the spirits of two ancient heroes who had been natives of the country and to whom two of the temples of delphi had been consecrated these spirits appeared in the form of tall and fullarmed warriors who led the attack and performed prodigies of strength and valor in the onset upon the persians and then when the battle was over disappeared as mysteriously as they came  in the mean time the great body of the army of xerxes with the monarch at their head was advancing on athens during his advance the city had been in a continual state of panic and confusion in the first place when the greek fleet had concluded to give up the contest in the artemisian channel before the battle of thermopylæ and had passed around to salamis the commanders in the city of athens had given up the hope of making any effectual defense and had given orders that the inhabitants should save themselves by seeking a refuge wherever they could find it this annunciation of course filled the city with dismay and the preparations for a general flight opened every where scenes of terror and distress of which those who have never witnessed the evacuation of a city by its inhabitants can scarcely conceive  the immediate object of the general terror was at this time the persian fleet for the greek fleet having determined to abandon the waters on that side of attica left the whole coast exposed and the persians might be expected at any hour to make a landing within a few miles of the city scarcely however had the impending of this danger been made known to the city before the tidings of one still more imminent reached it in the news that the pass of thermopylæ had been carried and that in addition to the peril with which the athenians were threatened by the fleet on the side of the sea the whole persian army was coming down upon them by land this fresh alarm greatly increased of course the general consternation all the roads leading from the city toward the south and west were soon covered with parties of wretched fugitives exhibiting as they pressed forward weary and wayworn on their toilsome and almost hopeless flight every possible phase of misery destitution and despair the army fell back to the isthmus intending to make a stand if possible there to defend the peloponnesus the fugitives made the best of their way to the seacoast where they were received on board transport ships sent thither from the fleet and conveyed some to Ægina some to salamis and others to other points on the coasts and islands to the south wherever the terrified exiles thought there was the best prospect of safety  some however remained at athens there was a part of the population who believed that the phrase wooden walls used by the oracle referred not to the ships of the fleet but to the wooden palisade around the citadel they accordingly repaired and strengthened the palisade and established themselves in the fortress with a small garrison which undertook to defend it  the citadel of athens or the acropolis as it was called was the richest and most splendid and magnificent fortress in the world it was built upon an oblong rocky hill the sides of which were perpendicular cliffs except at one end where alone the summit was accessible this summit presented an area of an oval form about a thousand feet in length and five hundred broad thus containing a space of about ten acres this area upon the summit and also the approaches at the western end were covered with the most grand imposing and costly architectural structures that then existed in the whole european world there were temples colonnades gateways stairways porticoes towers and walls which viewed as a whole presented a most magnificent spectacle that excited universal admiration and which when examined in detail awakened a greater degree of wonder still by the costliness of the materials the beauty and perfection of the workmanship and the richness and profusion of the decorations which were seen on every hand the number and variety of statues of bronze and of marble which had been erected in the various temples and upon the different platforms were very great there was one a statue of minerva which was executed by phidias the great athenian sculptor after the celebrated battle of marathon in the days of darius which with its pedestal was sixty feet high it stood on the left of the grand entrance towering above the buildings in full view from the country below and leaning upon its long spear like a colossal sentinel on guard in the distance on the right from the same point of view the great temple called the parthenon was to be seen a temple which was in some respects the most celebrated in the world the ruins of these edifices remain to the present day standing in desolate and solitary grandeur on the rocky hill which they once so richly adorned  when xerxes arrived at athens he found of course no difficulty in obtaining possession of the city itself since it had been deserted by its inhabitants and left defenseless the people that remained had all crowded into the citadel they had built the wooden palisade across the only approach by which it was possible to get near the gates and they had collected large stones on the tops of the rocks to roll down upon their assailants if they should attempt to ascend  illustration the citadel at athens  xerxes after ravaging and burning the town took up a position upon a hill opposite to the citadel and there he had engines constructed to throw enormous arrows on which tow that had been dipped in pitch was wound this combustible envelopment of the arrows was set on fire before the weapon was discharged and a shower of the burning missiles thus formed was directed toward the palisade the wooden walls were soon set on fire by them and totally consumed the access to the acropolis was however still difficult being by a steep acclivity up which it was very dangerous to ascend so long as the besiegers were ready to roll down rocks upon their assailants from above  at last however after a long conflict and much slaughter xerxes succeeded in forcing his way into the citadel some of his troops contrived to find a path by which they could climb up to the walls here after a desperate combat with those who were stationed to guard the place they succeeded in gaining admission and then opened the gates to their comrades below the persian soldiers exasperated with the resistance which they had encountered slew the soldiers of the garrison perpetrated every imaginable violence on the wretched inhabitants who had fled there for shelter and then plundered the citadel and set it on fire  the heart of xerxes was filled with exultation and joy as he thus arrived at the attainment of what had been the chief and prominent object of his campaign to plunder and destroy the city of athens had been the great pleasure that he had promised himself in all the mighty preparations that he had made this result was now realized and he dispatched a special messenger immediately to susa with the triumphant tidings     chapter xi  the battle of salamis  bc 480  situation of salamismovements of the fleet and the armypolicy of the

the battlefulfillment of an ancient prophecy   salamis is an island of a very irregular form lying in the saronian gulf north of Ægina and to the westward of athens what was called the port of athens was on the shore opposite to salamis the city itself being situated on elevated land four or five miles back from the sea from this port to the bay on the southern side of salamis where the greek fleet was lying it was only four or five miles more so that when xerxes burned the city the people on board the galleys in the fleet might easily see the smoke of the conflagration  the isthmus of corinth was west of salamis some fifteen miles across the bay the army in retreating from athens toward the isthmus would have necessarily to pass round the bay in a course somewhat circuitous while the fleet in following them would pass in a direct line across it the geographical relations of these places a knowledge of which is necessary to a full understanding of the operations of the greek and persian forces will be distinctly seen by comparing the above description with the map placed at the commencement of the fifth chapter  it had been the policy of the greeks to keep the fleet and army as much as possible together and thus during the time in which the troops were attempting a concentration at thermopylæ the ships made their rendezvous in the artemisian strait or channel directly opposite to that point of the coast there they fought maintaining their position desperately day after day as long as leonidas and his spartans held their ground on the shore their sudden disappearance from those waters by which the persians had been so much surprised was caused by their having received intelligence that the pass had been carried and leonidas destroyed they knew then that athens would be the next point of resistance by the land forces they therefore fell back to salamis or rather to the bay lying between salamis and the athenian shore that being the nearest position that they could take to support the operations of the army in their attempts to defend the capital when however the tidings came to them that athens had fallen and that what remained of the army had retreated to the isthmus the question at once arose whether the fleet should retreat too across the bay to the isthmus shore with a view to cooperate more fully with the army in the new position which the latter had taken or whether it should remain where it was and defend itself as it best could against the persian squadrons which would soon be drawing near the commanders of the fleet held a consultation to consider this question  in this consultation the athenian and the corinthian leaders took different views in fact they were very near coming into open collision such a difference of opinion considering the circumstances of the case was not at all surprising it might indeed have naturally been expected to arise from the relative situation of the two cities in respect to the danger which threatened them if the greek fleet were to withdraw from salamis to the isthmus it might be in a better position to defend corinth but it would by such a movement be withdrawing from the athenian territories and abandoning what remained in attica wholly to the conqueror the athenians were therefore in favor of maintaining the position at salamis while the corinthians were disposed to retire to the shores of the isthmus and cooperate with the army there  the council was convened to deliberate on this subject before the news arrived of the actual fall of athens although inasmuch as the persians were advancing into attica in immense numbers and there was no greek force left to defend the city they considered its fall as all but inevitable the tidings of the capture and destruction of athens came while the council was in session this seemed to determine the question the corinthian commanders and those from the other peloponnesian cities declared that it was perfectly absurd to remain any longer at salamis in a vain attempt to defend a country already conquered the council was broken up in confusion each commander retiring to his own ship and the peloponnesians resolving to withdraw on the following morning eurybiades who it will be recollected was the commanderinchief of all the greek fleet finding thus that it was impossible any longer to keep the ships together at salamis since a part of them would at all events withdraw concluded to yield to the necessity of the case and to conduct the whole fleet to the isthmus he issued his orders accordingly and the several commanders repaired to their respective ships to make the preparations it was night when the council was dismissed and the fleet was to move in the morning  one of the most influential and distinguished of the athenian officers was a general named themistocles very soon after he had returned to his ship from this council he was visited by another athenian named mnesiphilus who uneasy and anxious in the momentous crisis had come in his boat in the darkness of the night to themistocless ship to converse with him on the plans of the morrow mnesiphilus asked themistocles what was the decision of the council  to abandon salamis said themistocles and retire to the isthmus  then said mnesiphilus we shall never have an opportunity to meet the enemy i am sure that if we leave this position the fleet will be wholly broken up and that each portion will go under its own commander to defend its own state or seek its own safety independently of the rest we shall never be able to concentrate our forces again the result will be the inevitable dissolution of the fleet as a combined and allied force in spite of all that eurybiades or any one else can do to prevent it  mnesiphilus urged this danger with so much earnestness and eloquence as to make a very considerable impression on the mind of themistocles themistocles said nothing but his countenance indicated that he was very strongly inclined to adopt mnesiphiluss views mnesiphilus urged him to go immediately to eurybiades and endeavor to induce him to obtain a reversal of the decision of the council themistocles without expressing either assent or dissent took his boat and ordered the oarsmen to row him to the galley of eurybiades mnesiphilus having so far accomplished his object went away  themistocles came in his boat to the side of eurybiadess galley he said that he wished to speak with the general on a subject of great importance eurybiades when this was reported to him sent to invite themistocles to come on board themistocles did so and he urged upon the general the same arguments that mnesiphilus had pressed upon him namely that if the fleet were once to move from their actual position the different squadrons would inevitably separate and could never be assembled again he urged eurybiades therefore very strenuously to call a new council with a view of reversing the decision that had been made to retire and of resolving instead to give battle to the persians at salamis  eurybiades was persuaded and immediately took measures for convening the council again the summons sent around thus at midnight calling upon the principal officers of the fleet to repair again in haste to the commanders galley when they had only a short time before been dismissed from it produced great excitement the corinthians who had been in favor of the plan of abandoning salamis conjectured that the design might be to endeavor to reverse that decision and they came to the council determined to resist any such attempt if one should be made  when the officers had arrived themistocles began immediately to open the discussion before in fact eurybiades had stated why he had called them together a corinthian officer interrupted and rebuked him for presuming to speak before his time themistocles retorted upon the corinthian and continued his harangue he urged the council to review their former decision and to determine after all to remain at salamis he however now used different arguments from those which he had employed when speaking to eurybiades alone for to have directly charged the officers themselves with the design of which he had accused them to eurybiades namely that of abandoning their allies and retiring with their respective ships each to his own coast in case the position at salamis were to be given up would only incense them and arouse a hostility which would determine them against any thing that he might propose  he therefore urged the expediency of remaining at salamis on other grounds salamis was a much more advantageous position he said than the coast of the isthmus for a small fleet to occupy in awaiting an attack from a large one at salamis they were defended in part by the projections of the land which protected their flanks and prevented their being assailed except in front and their front they might make a very narrow one at the isthmus on the contrary there was a long unvaried and unsheltered coast with no salient points to give strength or protection to their position there they could not expect to derive serious advantage from any degree of cooperation with the army on the land which would be practicable at the isthmus while their situation at sea there would be far more exposed and dangerous than where they then were besides many thousands of the people had fled to salamis for refuge and protection and the fleet by leaving its present position would be guilty of basely abandoning them all to hopeless destruction without even making an effort to save them  this last was in fact the great reason why the athenians were so unwilling to abandon salamis the unhappy fugitives with which the island was thronged were their wives and children and they were extremely unwilling to go away and leave them to so cruel a fate as they knew would await them if the fleet were to be withdrawn the corinthians on the other hand considered athens as already lost and it seemed madness to them to linger uselessly in the vicinity of the ruin which had been made while there were other states and cities in other quarters of greece yet to be saved the corinthian speaker who had rebuked themistocles at first interrupted him again angrily before he finished his appeal  you have no right to speak said he you have no longer a country when you cease to represent a power you have no right to take a part in our councils  this cruel retort aroused in the mind of themistocles a strong feeling of indignation and anger against the corinthian he loaded his opponent in return with bitter reproaches and said in conclusion that as long as the athenians had two hundred ships in the fleet they had still a countryone too of sufficient importance to the general defense to give them a much better title to be heard in the common consultations than any corinthian could presume to claim  then turning to eurybiades again themistocles implored him to remain at salamis and give battle to the persians there as that was he said the only course by which any hope remained to them of the salvation of greece he declared that the athenian part of the fleet would never go to the isthmus if the others decided on going there they the athenians would gather all the fugitives they could from the island of salamis and from the coasts of attica and make the best of their way to italy where there was a territory to which they had some claim and abandoning greece forever they would found a new kingdom there  eurybiades the commanderinchief if he was not convinced by the arguments that themistocles had offered was alarmed at his declaration that the athenian ships would abandon the cause of the greeks if the fleet abandoned salamis he accordingly gave his voice very decidedly for remaining where they were the rest of the officers finally acquiesced in this decision and the council broke up the various members of it returning each to his own command it was now nearly morning the whole fleet had been necessarily during the night in a state of great excitement and suspense all anxious to learn the result of these deliberations the awe and solemnity which would of course pervade the minds of men at midnight while such momentous questions were pending were changed to an appalling sense of terror toward the dawn by an earthquake which then took place and which as is usually the case with such convulsions not only shook the land but was felt by vessels on the sea the men considered this phenomenon as a solemn warning from heaven and measures were immediately adopted for appeasing by certain special sacrifices and ceremonies the divine displeasure which the shock seemed to portend  in the mean time the persian fleet which we left it will be recollected in the channels between euboea and the main land near to thermopylæ had advanced when they found that the greeks had left those waters and following their enemies to the southward through the channel called the euripus had doubled the promontory called sunium which is the southern promontory of attica and then moving northward again along the western coast of attica had approached phalerum which was not far from salamis xerxes having concluded his operations at athens advanced to the same point by land  the final and complete success of the persian expedition seemed now almost sure all the country north of the peninsula had fallen the greek army had retreated to the isthmus having been driven from every other post and its last forlorn hope of being able to resist the advance of its victorious enemies was depending there and the commanders of the persian fleet having driven the greek squadrons in the same manner from strait to strait and from sea to sea saw the discomfited galleys drawn up in apparently their last place of refuge in the bay of salamis and only waiting to be captured and destroyed  in a word every thing seemed ready for the decisive and final blow and xerxes summoned a grand council of war on board one of the vessels of the fleet as soon as he arrived at phalerum to decide upon the time and manner of striking it  the convening of this council was arranged and the deliberations themselves conducted with great parade and ceremony the princes of the various nations represented in the army and in the fleet and the leading persian officers and nobles were summoned to attend it it was held on board one of the principal galleys where great preparations had been made for receiving so august an assemblage a throne was provided for the king and seats for the various commanders according to their respective ranks and a conspicuous place was assigned to artemisia the carian queen who the reader will perhaps recollect was described as one of the prominent naval commanders in the account given of the great review at doriscus mardonius appeared at the council as the kings representative and the conductor of the deliberations there being required according to the parliamentary etiquette of those days in such royal councils as these a sort of mediator to stand between the king and his counselors as if the monarch himself was on too sublime an elevation of dignity and grandeur to be directly addressed even by princes and nobles  accordingly when the council was convened and the time arrived for opening the deliberations the king directed mardonius to call upon the commanders present one by one for their sentiments on the question whether it were advisable or not to attack the greek fleet at salamis mardonius did so they all advised that the attack should be made urging severally various considerations to enforce their opinions and all evincing a great deal of zeal and ardor in the cause and an impatient desire that the great final conflict should come on  when however it came to artemisias turn to speak it appeared that she was of a different sentiment from the rest she commenced her speech with something like an apology for presuming to give the king her council she said that notwithstanding her sex she had performed her part with other commanders in the battles which had already occurred and that she was perhaps entitled accordingly in the consultations which were held to express her opinion say then to the king she continued addressing mardonius as all the others had done that my judgment is that we should not attack the greek fleet at salamis but on the contrary that we should avoid a battle it seems to me that we have nothing to gain but should put a great deal at hazard by a general naval conflict at the present time the truth is that the greeks always terrible as combatants are rendered desperate now by the straits to which they are reduced and the losses that they have sustained the seamen of our fleet are as inferior to them in strength and courage as women are to men i am sure that it will be a very dangerous thing to encounter them in their present chafed and irritated temper whatever others may think i myself should not dare to answer for the result  besides situated as they are continued artemisia a battle is what they must most desire and of course it is adverse to our interest to accord it to them i have ascertained that they have but a small supply of food either in their fleet or upon the island of salamis while they have besides their troops a great multitude of destitute and helpless fugitives to be fed if we simply leave them to themselves under the blockade in which our position here now places them they will soon be reduced to great distress or if we withdraw from them and proceed at once to the peloponnesus to cooperate with the army there we shall avoid all the risk of a battle and i am sure that the greek fleet will never dare to follow or to molest us  the several members of the council listened to this unexpected address of artemisia with great attention and interest but with very different feelings she had many friends among the counselors and they were anxious and uneasy at hearing her speak in this manner for they knew very well that it was the kings decided intention that a battle should be fought and they feared that by this bold and strenuous opposition to it artemisia would incur the mighty monarchs displeasure there were others who were jealous of the influence which artemisia enjoyed and envious of the favor with which they knew that xerxes regarded her these men were secretly pleased to hear her uttering sentiments by which they confidently believed that she would excite the anger of the king and wholly lose her advantageous position both the hopes and the fears however entertained respectively by the queens enemies and friends proved altogether groundless xerxes was not displeased on the contrary he applauded artemisias ingenuity and eloquence in the highest terms though he said nevertheless that he would follow the advice of the other counselors he dismissed the assembly and gave orders to prepare for battle  in the mean time a day or two had passed away and the greeks who had been originally very little inclined to acquiesce in the decision which eurybiades had made under the influence of themistocles to remain at salamis and give the persians battle became more and more dissatisfied and uneasy as the great crisis drew nigh in fact the discontent and disaffection which appeared in certain portions of the fleet became so decided and so open that themistocles feared that some of the commanders would actually revolt and go away with their squadrons in a body in defiance of the general decision to remain to prevent such a desertion as this he contrived the following very desperate stratagem  he had a slave in his family named sicinnus who was an intelligent and educated man though a slave in fact he was the teacher of themistocless children instances of this kind in which slaves were refined and cultivated men were not uncommon in ancient times as slaves were in many instances captives taken in war who before their captivity had occupied as high social positions as their masters themistocles determined to send sicinnus to the persian fleet with a message from him which should induce the persians themselves to take measures to prevent the dispersion of the greek fleet having given the slave therefore his secret instructions he put him into a boat when night came on with oarsmen who were directed to row him wherever he should require them to go the boat pushed off stealthily from themistocless galley and taking care to keep clear of the greek ships which lay at anchor near them went southward toward the persian fleet when the boat reached the persian galleys sicinnus asked to see the commander and on being admitted to an interview with him he informed him that he came from themistocles who was the leader he said of the athenian portion of the greek fleet  i am charged he added to say to you from themistocles that he considers the cause of the greeks as wholly lost and he is now accordingly desirous himself of coming over to the persian side this however he can not actually and openly do on account of the situation in which he is placed in respect to the rest of the fleet he has however sent me to inform you that the greek fleet is in a very disordered and helpless condition being distracted by the dissensions of the commanders and the general discouragement and despair of the men that some divisions are secretly intending to make their escape and that if you can prevent this by surrounding them or by taking such positions as to intercept any who may attempt to withdraw the whole squadron will inevitably fall into your hands  having made this communication sicinnus went on board his boat again and returned to the greek fleet as secretly and stealthily as he came  the persians immediately determined to resort to the measures which themistocles had recommended to prevent the escape of any part of the greek fleet there was a small island between salamis and the coast of attica that is on the eastern side of salamis called psyttalia which was in such a position as to command in a great measure the channel of water between salamis and the main land on this side the persians sent forward a detachment of galleys to take possession of this island in the night by this means they hoped to prevent the escape of any part of the greek squadron in that direction besides they foresaw that in the approaching battle the principal scene of the conflict must be in that vicinity and that consequently the island would become the great resort of the disabled ships and the wounded men since they would naturally seek refuge on the nearest land to preoccupy this ground therefore seemed an important step it would enable them when the terrible conflict should come on to drive back any wretched refugees who might attempt to escape from destruction by seeking the shore  by taking possession of this island and stationing galleys in the vicinity of it all which was done secretly in the night the persians cut off all possibility of escape for the greeks in that direction at the same time they sent another considerable detachment of their fleet to the westward which was the direction toward the isthmus ordering the galleys thus sent to station themselves in such a manner as to prevent any portion of the greek fleet from going round the island of salamis and making their escape through the northwestern channel by this means the greek fleet was environed on every sidehemmed in though they were not aware of it in such a way as to defeat any attempt which any division might make to retire from the scene  the first intelligence which the greeks received of their being thus surrounded was from an athenian general named aristides who came one night from the island of Ægina to the greek fleet making his way with great difficulty through the lines of persian galleys aristides had been in the political conflicts which had taken place in former years at athens themistocless great rival and enemy he had been defeated in the contests which had taken place and had been banished from athens he now however made his way through the enemys lines incurring in doing it extreme difficulty and danger in order to inform his countrymen of their peril and to assist if possible in saving them  when he reached the greek fleet the commanders were in council agitating in angry and incriminating debates the perpetually recurring question whether they should retire to the isthmus or remain where they were aristides called themistocles out of the council themistocles was very much surprised at seeing his ancient enemy thus unexpectedly appear aristides introduced the conversation by saying that he thought that at such a crisis they ought to lay aside every private animosity and only emulate each other in the efforts and sacrifices which they could respectively make to defend their country that he had accordingly come from Ægina to join the fleet with a view of rendering any aid that it might be in his power to afford that it was now wholly useless to debate the question of retiring to the isthmus for such a movement was no longer possible the fleet is surrounded said he the persian galleys are stationed on every side it was with the utmost difficulty that i could make my way through the lines even if the whole assembly and eurybiades himself were resolved on withdrawing to the isthmus the thing could not now be done return therefore and tell them this and say that to defend themselves where they are is the only alternative that now remains  in reply to this communication themistocles said that nothing could give him greater pleasure than to learn what aristides had stated the movement which the persians have made he said was in consequence of a communication which i myself sent to them i sent it in order that some of our greeks who seem so very reluctant to fight might be compelled to do so but you must come yourself into the assembly he added and make your statement directly to the commanders they will not believe it if they hear it from me come in and state what you have seen  aristides accordingly entered the assembly and informed the officers who were convened that to retire from their present position was no longer possible since the sea to the west was fully guarded by lines of persian ships which had been stationed there to intercept them he had just come in himself he said from Ægina and had found great difficulty in passing through the lines though he had only a single small boat and was favored by the darkness of the night he was convinced that the greek fleet was entirely surrounded  having said this aristides withdrew although he could come as a witness to give his testimony in respect to facts he was not entitled to take any part in the deliberations  the assembly was thrown into a state of the greatest possible excitement by the intelligence which aristides had communicated instead of producing harmony among them it made the discord more violent and uncontrollable of those who had before wished to retire some were now enraged that they had not been allowed to do so while the opportunity remained others disbelieved aristidess statements and were still eager to go while the rest confirmed in their previous determination to remain where they were rejoiced to find that retreat was no longer possible the debate was confused and violent it turned in a great measure on the degree of credibility to be attached to the account which aristides had given them many of the assembly wholly disbelieved it it was a stratagem they maintained contrived by the athenian party and those who wished to remain in order to accomplish their end of keeping the fleet from changing its position  the doubts however which the assembly felt in respect to the truth of aristidess tidings were soon dispelled by new and incontestable evidence for while the debate was going on it was announced that a large galleya trireme as it was calledhad come in from the persian fleet this galley proved to be a greek ship from the island of tenos one which xerxes in prosecution of his plan of compelling those portions of the grecian territories that he had conquered or that had surrendered to him to furnish forces to aid him in subduing the rest had pressed into his service the commander of this galley unwilling to take part against his countrymen in the conflict had decided to desert the persian fleet by taking advantage of the night and to come over to the greeks the name of the commander of this trireme was parætius he confirmed fully all that aristides had said he assured the greeks that they were completely surrounded and that nothing remained for them but to prepare where they were to meet the attack which would certainly be made upon them in the morning the arrival of this trireme was thus of very essential service to the greeks it put an end to their discordant debates and united them one and all in the work of making resolute preparations for action this vessel was also of very essential service in the conflict itself which ensued and the greeks were so grateful to parætius and to his comrades for the adventurous courage which they displayed in coming over under such circumstances in such a night to espouse the cause and to share the dangers of their countrymen that after the battle they caused all their names to be engraved upon a sacred tripod made in the most costly manner for the purpose and then sent the tripod to be deposited at the oracle of delphi where it long remained a monument of this example of delian patriotism and fidelity  as the morning approached the preparations were carried forward with ardor and energy on board both fleets for the great struggle which was to ensue plans were formed orders were given arms were examined and placed on the decks of the galleys where they would be most ready at hand the officers and soldiers gave mutual charges and instructions to each other in respect to the care of their friends and the disposal of their effectscharges and instructions which each one undertook to execute for his friend in case he should survive him the commanders endeavored to animate and encourage their men by cheerful looks and by words of confidence and encouragement they who felt resolute and strong endeavored to inspirit the weak and irresolute while those who shrank from the approaching contest and dreaded the result of it concealed their fears and endeavored to appear impatient for the battle  xerxes caused an elevated seat or throne to be prepared for himself on an eminence near the shore upon the main land in order that he might be a personal witness of the battle he had a guard and other attendants around him among these were a number of scribes or secretaries who were prepared with writing materials to record the events which might take place as they occurred and especially to register the names of those whom xerxes should see distinguishing themselves by their courage or by their achievements he justly supposed that these arrangements the whole fleet being fully informed in regard to them would animate the several commanders with strong emulation and excite them to make redoubled exertions to perform their part well the record which was thus to be kept under the personal supervision of the sovereign was with a view to punishments too as well as to honors and rewards and it happened in many instances during the battle that ensued that commanders who after losing their ships escaped to the shore were brought up before xerxess throne and there expiated their fault or their misfortune whichever it might have been by being beheaded on the spot without mercy some of the officers thus executed were greeks brutally slaughtered for not being successful in fighting by compulsion against their own countrymen  as the dawn approached themistocles called together as many of the athenian forces as it was possible to convene assembling them at a place upon the shore of salamis where he could conveniently address them and there made a speech to them as was customary with the greek commanders before going into battle he told them that in such contests as that in which they were about to engage the result depended not on the relative numbers of the combatants but on the resolution and activity which they displayed he reminded them of the instances in which small bodies of men firmly banded together by a strict discipline and animated by courage and energy had overthrown enemies whose numbers far exceeded their own the persians were more numerous he admitted than they but still the greeks would conquer them if they faithfully obeyed their orders and acted strictly and perseveringly in concert according to the plans formed by the commanders and displayed the usual courage and resolution of greeks he was sure of victory  as soon as themistocles had finished his speech he ordered his men to embark and the fleet immediately afterward formed itself in battle array  notwithstanding the strictness of the order and discipline which generally prevailed in greek armaments of every kind there was great excitement and much confusion in the fleet while making all these preparations and this excitement and confusion increased continually as the morning advanced and the hour for the conflict drew nigh the passing of boats to and fro the dashing of the oars the clangor of the weapons the vociferations of orders by the officers and of responses by the men mingled with each other in dreadful turmoil while all the time the vast squadrons were advancing toward each other each party of combatants eager to begin the contest in fact so full of wild excitement was the scene that at length the battle was found to be raging on every side while no one knew or could remember how it began some said that a ship which had been sent away a short time before to Ægina to obtain succors was returning that morning and that she commenced the action as she came through the persian lines others said the greek squadron advanced as soon as they could see and attacked the persians and there were some whose imaginations were so much excited by the scene that they saw a female form portrayed among the dim mists of the morning that urged the greeks onward by beckonings and calls they heard her voice they said crying to them come on come on this is no time to linger on your oars  however this may be the battle was soon furiously raging on every part of the bay of salamis exhibiting a widespread scene of conflict fury rage despair and death such as had then been seldom witnessed in any naval conflict and such as human eyes can now never look upon again in modern warfare the smoke of the guns soon draws an impenetrable veil over the scene of horror and the perpetual thunder of the artillery overpowers the general din in a modern battle therefore none of the real horrors of the conflict can either be heard or seen by any spectator placed beyond the immediate scene of it the sights and the sounds are alike buried and concealed beneath the smoke and the noise of the cannonading there were however no such causes in this case to obstruct the observations which xerxes was making from his throne on the shore the air was calm the sky serene the water was smooth and the atmosphere was as transparent and clear at the end of the battle as at the beginning xerxes could discern every ship and follow it with his eye in all its motions he could see who advanced and who retreated out of the hundreds of separate conflicts he could choose any one and watch the progress of it from the commencement to the termination he could see the combats on the decks the falling of repulsed assailants into the water the weapons broken the wounded carried away and swimmers struggling like insects on the smooth surface of the sea he could see the wrecks too which were drifted upon the shores and the captured galleys which after those who defended them had been vanquishedsome killed others thrown overboard and others made prisonerswere slowly towed away by the victors to a place of safety  there was one incident which occurred in this scene as xerxes looked down upon it from the eminence where he sat which greatly interested and excited him though he was deceived in respect to the true nature of it the incident was one of artemisias stratagems it must be premised in relating the story that artemisia was not without enemies among the officers of the persian fleet many of them were envious of the high distinction which she enjoyed and jealous of the attention which she received from the king and of the influence which she possessed over him this feeling showed itself very distinctly at the grand council when she gave her advice in connection with that of the other commanders to the king among the most decided of her enemies was a certain captain named damasithymus artemisia had had a special quarrel with him while the fleet was coming through the hellespont which though settled for the time left the minds of both parties in a state of great hostility toward each other  it happened in the course of the battle that the ship which artemisia personally commanded and that of damasithymus were engaged together with other persian vessels in the same part of the bay and at a time when the ardor and confusion of the conflict was at its height the galley of artemisia and some others that were in company with hers became separated from the rest perhaps by the too eager pursuit of an enemy and as other greek ships came up suddenly to the assistance of their comrades the persian vessels found themselves in great danger and began to retreat followed by their enemies we speak of the retreating galleys as persian because they were on the persian side in the contest though it happened that they were really ships from greek nations which xerxes had bribed or forced into his service the greeks knew them to be enemies by the persian flag which they bore  in the retreat and while the ships were more or less mingled together in the confusion artemisia perceived that the persian galley nearest her was that of damasithymus she immediately caused her own persian flag to be pulled down and resorting to such other artifices as might tend to make her vessel appear to be a greek galley she began to act as if she were one of the pursuers instead of one of the pursued she bore down upon the ship of damasithymus saying to her crew that to attack and sink that ship was the only way to save their own lives they accordingly attacked it with the utmost fury the athenian ships which were near seeing artemisias galley thus engaged supposed that it was one of their own and pressed on leaving the vessel of damasithymus at artemisias mercy it was such mercy as would be expected of a woman who would volunteer to take command of a squadron of ships of war and go forth on an active campaign to fight for her life among such ferocious tigers as greek soldiers always were considering it all an excursion of pleasure artemisia killed damasithymus and all of his crew and sunk his ship and then the crisis of danger being past she made good her retreat back to the persian lines she probably felt no special animosity against the crew of this illfated vessel but she thought it most prudent to leave no man alive to tell the story  xerxes watched this transaction from his place on the hill with extreme interest and pleasure he saw the vessel of artemisia bearing down upon the other which last he supposed of course from artemisias attacking it was a vessel of the enemy the only subject of doubt was whether the attacking ship was really that of artemisia the officers who stood about xerxes at the time that the transaction occurred assured him that it was they knew it well by certain peculiarities in its construction xerxes then watched the progress of the contest with the most eager interest and when he saw the result of it he praised artemisia in the highest terms saying that the men in his fleet behaved like women while the only woman in it behaved like a man  thus artemisias exploit operated like a double stratagem both the greeks and the persians were deceived and she gained an advantage by both the deceptions she saved her life by leading the greeks to believe that her galley was their friend and she gained great glory and renown among the persians by making them believe that the vessel which she sunk was that of an enemy  though these and some of the other scenes and incidents which xerxes witnessed as he looked down upon the battle gave him pleasure yet the curiosity and interest with which he surveyed the opening of the contest were gradually changed to impatience vexation and rage as he saw in its progress that the greeks were every where gaining the victory notwithstanding the discord and animosity which had reigned among the commanders in their councils and debates the men were united resolute and firm when the time arrived for action and they fought with such desperate courage and activity and at the same time with so much coolness circumspection and discipline that the persian lines were before many hours every where compelled to give way a striking example of the indomitable and efficient resolution which on such occasions always characterized the greeks was shown in the conduct of aristides the reader will recollect that the persians on the night before the battle had taken possession of the island of psyttaliawhich was near the center of the scene of contestfor the double purpose of enabling themselves to use it as a place of refuge and retreat during the battle and of preventing their enemies from doing so now aristides had no command he had been expelled from athens by the influence of themistocles and his other enemies he had come across from Ægina to the fleet at salamis alone to give his countrymen information of the dispositions which the persians had made for surrounding them when the battle began he had been left it seems on the shore of salamis a spectator there was a small body of troops left there also as a guard to the shore in the course of the combat when aristides found that the services of this guard were no longer likely to be required where they were he placed himself at the head of them obtained possession of boats or a galley transported the men across the channel landed them on the island of psyttalia conquered the post and killed every man that the persians had stationed there  when the day was spent and the evening came on it was found that the result of the battle was a greek victory and yet it was not a victory so decisive as to compel the persians wholly to retire vast numbers of the persian ships were destroyed but still so many remained that when at night they drew back from the scene of the conflict toward their anchorage ground at phalerum the greeks were very willing to leave them unmolested there the greeks in fact had full employment on the following day in reassembling the scattered remnants of their own fleet repairing the damages that they had sustained taking care of their wounded men and in a word attending to the thousand urgent and pressing exigencies always arising in the service of a fleet after a battle even when it has been victorious in the contest they did not know in exactly what condition the persian fleet had been left nor how far there might be danger of a renewal of the conflict on the following day they devoted all their time and attention therefore to strengthening their defenses and reorganizing the fleet so as to be ready in case a new assault should be made upon them  but xerxes had no intention of any new attack the loss of this battle gave a final blow to his expectations of being able to carry his conquests in greece any further he too like the greeks employed his men in industrious and vigorous efforts to repair the damages which had been done and to reassemble and reorganize that portion of the fleet which had not been destroyed while however his men were doing this he was himself revolving in his mind moodily and despairingly plans not for new conflicts but for the safest and speediest way of making his own personal escape from the dangers around him back to his home in susa  in the mean time the surface of the sea far and wide in every direction was covered with the wrecks and remnants and fragments strewed over it by the battle dismantled hulks masses of entangled spars and rigging broken oars weapons of every description and the swollen and ghastly bodies of the dead floated on the rolling swell of the sea wherever the winds or the currents carried them at length many of these mournful memorials of the strife found their way across the whole breadth of the mediterranean and were driven up upon the beach on the coast of africa at a barbarous country called colias the savages dragged the fragments up out of the sand to use as fuel for their fires pleased with their unexpected acquisitions but wholly ignorant of course of the nature of the dreadful tragedy to which their coming was due the circumstance however explained to the greeks an ancient prophecy which had been uttered long before in athens and which the interpreters of such mysteries had never been able to understand the prophecy was this       the colian dames on africs shores      shall roast their food with persian oars     chapter xii  the return of xerxes to persia

the expedition he was in fact a sort of prime minister on whom the responsibility for almost all the measures for the government and conduct of the expedition had been thrown men in such positions while they may expect the highest rewards and honors from their sovereign in case of success have always reason to apprehend the worst of consequences to themselves in case of failure the night after the battle of salamis accordingly mardonius was in great fear he did not distrust the future success of the expedition if it were allowed to go on but knowing the character of such despots as those who ruled great nations in that age of the world he was well aware that he might reasonably expect at any moment the appearance of officers sent from xerxes to cut off his head  his anxiety was increased by observing that xerxes seemed very much depressed and very restless and uneasy after the battle as if he were revolving in his mind some extraordinary design he presently thought that he perceived indications that the king was planning a retreat mardonius after much hesitation concluded to speak to him and endeavor to dispel his anxieties and fears and lead him to take a more favorable view of the prospects of the expedition he accordingly accosted him on the subject somewhat as follows  it is true said he that we were not as successful in the combat yesterday as we desired to be but this reverse as well as all the preceding disasters that we have met with is after all of comparatively little moment your majesty has gone steadily on accomplishing most triumphantly all the substantial objects aimed at in undertaking the expedition your troops have advanced successfully by land against all opposition with them you have traversed thrace macedon and thessaly you have fought your way against the most desperate resistance through the pass of thermopylæ you have overrun all northern greece you have burned athens thus far from there being any uncertainty or doubt in respect to the success of the expedition we see that all the great objects which you proposed by it are already accomplished the fleet it is true has now suffered extensive damage but we must remember that it is upon the army not upon the fleet that our hopes and expectations mainly depend the army is safe and it can not be possible that the greeks can hereafter bring any force into the field by which it can be seriously endangered  by these and similar sentiments mardonius endeavored to revive and restore the failing courage and resolution of the king he found however that he met with very partial success xerxes was silent thoughtful and oppressed apparently with a sense of anxious concern mardonius finally proposed that even if the king should think it best to return himself to susa he should not abandon the enterprise of subduing greece but that he should leave a portion of the army under his mardoniuss charge and he would undertake he said to complete the work which had been so successfully begun three hundred thousand men he was convinced would be sufficient for the purpose  this suggestion seems to have made a favorable impression on the mind of xerxes he was disposed in fact to be pleased with any plan provided it opened the way for his own escape from the dangers in which he imagined that he was entangled he said that he would consult some of the other commanders upon the subject he did so and then before coming to a final decision he determined to confer with artemisia he remembered that she had counseled him not to attack the greeks at salamis and as the result had proved that counsel to be eminently wise he felt the greater confidence in asking her judgment again  he accordingly sent for artemisia and directing all the officers as well as his own attendants to retire he held a private consultation with her in respect to his plans  mardonius proposes said he that the expedition should on no account be abandoned in consequence of this disaster for he says that the fleet is a very unimportant part of our force and that the army still remains unharmed he proposes that if i should decide myself to return to persia i should leave three hundred thousand men with him and he undertakes if i will do so to complete with them the subjugation of greece tell me what you think of this plan you evinced so much sagacity in foreseeing the result of this engagement at salamis that i particularly wish to know your opinion  artemisia after pausing a little to reflect upon the subject saying as she hesitated that it was rather difficult to decide under the extraordinary circumstances in which they were placed what it really was best to do came at length to the conclusion that it would be wisest for the king to accede to mardoniuss proposal since he offers of his own accord to remain and undertake to complete the subjugation of greece you can very safely to yourself allow him to make the experiment the great object which was announced as the one which you had chiefly in view in the invasion of greece was the burning of athens this is already accomplished you have done therefore what you undertook to do and can consequently now return yourself without dishonor if mardonius succeeds in his attempt the glory of it will redound to you his victories will be considered as only the successful completion of what you began on the other hand if he fails the disgrace of failure will be his alone and the injury will be confined to his destruction in any event your person your interests and your honor are safe and if mardonius is willing to take the responsibility and incur the danger involved in the plan that he proposes i would give him the opportunity  xerxes adopted the view of the subject which artemisia thus presented with the utmost readiness and pleasure that advice is always very welcome which makes the course that we had previously decided upon as the most agreeable seem the most wise xerxes immediately determined on returning to persia himself and leaving mardonius to complete the conquest in carrying out this design he concluded to march to the northward by land accompanied by a large portion of his army and by all his principal officers until he reached the hellespont then he was to give up to mardonius the command of such troops as should be selected to remain in greece and crossing the hellespont return himself to persia with the remainder  if as is generally the case it is a panic that causes a flight a flight in its turn always increases a panic it happened in accordance with this general law that as soon as the thoughts of xerxes were once turned toward an escape from greece his fears increased and his mind became more and more the prey of a restless uneasiness and anxiety lest he should not be able to effect his escape he feared that the bridge of boats would have been broken down and then how would he be able to cross the hellespont to prevent the greek fleet from proceeding to the northward and thus intercepting his passage by destroying the bridge he determined to conceal as long as possible his own departure accordingly while he was making the most efficient and rapid arrangements on the land for abandoning the whole region he brought up his fleet by sea and began to build by means of the ships a floating bridge from the main land to the island of salamis as if he were intent only on advancing he continued this work all day postponing his intended retreat until the night should come in order to conceal his movements in the course of the day he placed all his family and family relatives on board of artemisias ship under the charge of a tried and faithful domestic artemisia was to convey them as rapidly as possible to ephesus a strong city in asia minor where xerxes supposed that they would be safe  in the night the fleet in obedience to the orders which xerxes had given them abandoned their bridge and all their other undertakings and set sail they were to make the best of their way to the hellespont and post themselves there to defend the bridge of boats until xerxes should arrive on the following morning accordingly when the sun rose the greeks found to their utter astonishment that their enemies were gone  a scene of the greatest animation and excitement on board the greek fleet at once ensued the commanders resolved on an immediate pursuit the seamen hoisted their sails raised their anchors and manned their oars and the whole squadron was soon in rapid motion the fleet went as far as to the island of andros looking eagerly all around the horizon in every direction as they advanced but no signs of the fugitives were to be seen the ships then drew up to the shore and the commanders were convened in an assembly summoned by eurybiades on the land for consultation  a debate ensued in which the eternal enmity and dissension between the athenian and peloponnesian greeks broke out anew there was however now some reason for the disagreement the athenian cause was already ruined their capital had been burned their country ravaged and their wives and children driven forth to exile and misery nothing remained now for them but hopes of revenge they were eager therefore to press on and overtake the persian galleys in their flight or if this could not be done to reach the hellespont before xerxes should arrive there and intercept his passage by destroying the bridge this was the policy which themistocles advocated eurybiades on the other hand and the peloponnesian commanders urged the expediency of not driving the persians to desperation by harassing them too closely on their retreat they were formidable enemies after all and if they were now disposed to retire and leave the country it was the true policy of the greeks to allow them to do so to destroy the bridge of boats would only be to take effectual measures for keeping the pest among them themistocles was outvoted it was determined best to allow the persian forces to retire  themistocles when he found that his counsels were overruled resorted to another of the audacious stratagems that marked his career which was to send a second pretended message of friendship to the persian king he employed the same sicinnus on this occasion that he had sent before into the persian fleet on the eve of the battle of salamis a galley was given to sicinnus with a select crew of faithful men they were all put under the most solemn oaths never to divulge to any person under any circumstances the nature and object of their commission with this company sicinnus left the fleet secretly in the night and went to the coast of attica landing here he left the galley with the crew in charge of it upon the shore and with one or two select attendants he made his way to the persian camp and desired an interview with the king on being admitted to an audience he said to xerxes that he had been sent to him by themistocles whom he represented as altogether the most prominent man among the greek commanders to say that the greeks had resolved on pressing forward to the hellespont to intercept him on his return but that he themistocles had dissuaded them from it under the influence of the same friendship for xerxes which had led him to send a friendly communication to the persians before the late battle that in consequence of the arguments and persuasions of themistocles the greek squadrons would remain where they then were on the southern coasts leaving xerxes to retire without molestation  all this was false but themistocles thought it would serve his purpose well to make the statement for in case he should at any future time in following the ordinary fate of the bravest and most successful greek generals be obliged to fly in exile from his country to save his life it might be important for him to have a good understanding beforehand with the king of persia though a good understanding founded on pretensions so hypocritical and empty as these would seem to be worthy of very little reliance in fact for a greek general discomfited in the councils of his own nation to turn to the persian king with such prompt and cool assurance for the purpose of gaining his friendship by tendering falsehoods so bare and professions so hollow was an instance of audacious treachery so original and lofty as to be almost sublime  xerxes pressed on with the utmost diligence toward the north the country had been ravaged and exhausted by his march through it in coming down and now in returning he found infinite difficulty in obtaining supplies of food and water for his army fortyfive days were consumed in getting back to the hellespont during all this time the privations and sufferings of the troops increased every day the soldiers were spent with fatigue exhausted with hunger and harassed with incessant apprehensions of attacks from their enemies thousands of the sick and wounded that attempted at first to follow the army gave out by degrees as the columns moved on some were left at the encampments others lay down by the roadsides in the midst of the days march wherever their waning strength finally failed them and every where broken chariots dead and dying beasts of burden and the bodies of soldiers that lay neglected where they fell encumbered and choked the way in a word all the roads leading toward the northern provinces exhibited in full perfection those awful scenes which usually mark the track of a great army retreating from an invasion  the men were at length reduced to extreme distress for food they ate the roots and stems of the herbage and finally stripped the very bark from the trees and devoured it in the vain hope that it might afford some nutriment to reenforce the vital principle for a little time at least in the dreadful struggle which it was waging within them there are certain forms of pestilential disease which in cases like this always set in to hasten the work which famine alone would be too slow in performing accordingly as was to have been expected camp fevers choleras and other corrupt and infectious maladies broke out with great violence as the army advanced along the northern shores of the Ægean sea and as every victim to these dreadful and hopeless disorders helped by his own dissolution to taint the air for all the rest the wretched crowd was in the end reduced to the last extreme of misery and terror  at length xerxes with a miserable remnant of his troops arrived at abydos on the shores of the hellespont he found the bridge broken down the winds and storms had demolished what the greeks had determined to spare the immense structure which it had cost so much toil and time to rear had wholly disappeared leaving no traces of its existence except the wrecks which lay here and there half buried in the sand along the shore there were some small boats at hand and xerxes embarking in one of them with a few attendants in the others and leaving the exhausted and wretched remnant of his army behind was rowed across the strait and landed at last safely again on the asiatic shores  illustration the return of xerxes to persia  the place of his landing was sestos from sestos he went to sardis and from sardis he proceeded in a short time to susa mardonius was left in greece mardonius was a general of great military experience and skill and when left to himself he found no great difficulty in reorganizing the army and in putting it again in an efficient condition he was not able however to accomplish the undertaking which he had engaged to perform after various adventures prosperous and adverse which it would be foreign to our purpose here to detail he was at last defeated in a great battle and killed on the field the persian army was now obliged to give up the contest and was expelled from greece finally and forever  when xerxes reached susa he felt overjoyed to find himself once more safe as he thought in his own palaces he looked back upon the hardships exposures and perils through which he had passed and thankful for having so narrowly escaped from them he determined to encounter no such hazards again he had had enough of ambition and glory he was now going to devote himself to ease and pleasure such a man would not naturally be expected to be very scrupulous in respect to the means of enjoyment or to the character of the companions whom he would select to share his pleasures and the life of the king soon presented one continual scene of dissipation revelry and vice he gave himself up to such prolonged carousals that one night was sometimes protracted through the following day into another the administration of his government was left wholly to his ministers and every personal duty was neglected that he might give himself to the most abandoned and profligate indulgence of his appetites and passions  he had three sons who might be considered as heirs to his thronedarius hystaspes and artaxerxes hystaspes was absent in a neighboring province the others were at home he had also a very prominent officer in his court whose name artabanus was the same with that of the uncle who had so strongly attempted to dissuade him from undertaking the conquest of greece artabanus the uncle disappears finally from view at the time when xerxes dismissed him to return to susa at the first crossing of the hellespont this second artabanus was the captain of the kings bodyguard and consequently the common executioner of the despots decrees being thus established in his palace surrounded by his family and protected by artabanus and his guard the monarch felt that all his toils and dangers were over and that there was nothing now before him but a life of ease of pleasure and of safety instead of this he was in fact in the most imminent danger artabanus was already plotting his destruction  one day in the midst of one of his carousals he became angry with his oldest son darius for some cause and gave artabanus an order to kill him artabanus neglected to obey this order the king had been excited with wine when he gave it and artabanus supposed that all recollection of the command would pass away from his mind with the excitement that occasioned it the king did not however so readily forget the next day he demanded why his order had not been obeyed artabanus now began to fear for his own safety and he determined to proceed at once to the execution of a plan which he had long been revolving of destroying the whole of xerxess family and placing himself on the throne in their stead he contrived to bring the kings chamberlain into his schemes and with the connivance and aid of this officer he went at night into the kings bedchamber and murdered the monarch in his sleep  leaving the bloody weapon with which the deed had been perpetrated by the side of the victim artabanus went immediately into the bedchamber of artaxerxes the youngest son and awaking him suddenly he told him with tones of voice and looks expressive of great excitement and alarm that his father had been killed and that it was his brother darius that had killed him his motive is continued artabanus to obtain the throne and to make the more sure of an undisturbed possession of it he is intending to murder you next rise therefore and defend your life  artaxerxes was aroused to a sudden and uncontrollable paroxysm of anger at this intelligence he seized his weapon and rushed into the apartment of his innocent brother and slew him on the spot other summary assassinations of a similar kind followed in this complicated tragedy among the victims artabanus and all his adherents were slain and at length artaxerxes took quiet possession of the throne and reigned in his fathers stead                           the end
