little room in a small street in westminster his age was some fifteen or sixteen years his face was clearcut and intelligent and was altogether free from the expression either of discontent or of shrinking sadness so often seen in the face of those afflicted had he been sitting on a chair at a table indeed he would have been remarked as a handsome and wellgrown young fellow his shoulders were broad his arms powerful and his head erect he had not been born a cripple but had been disabled for life when a tiny child by a cart passing over his legs above the knees he was talking to a lad a year or so younger than himself while a strong heartylooking woman somewhat past middle age stood at a washtub  what is all that noise about the cripple exclaimed as an uproar was heard in the street at some little distance from the house  drink as usual i suppose the woman said  the younger lad ran to the door  no mother its them scholars acoming back from cricket aint there a fight jist  the cripple wheeled his box to the door and then taking a pair of crutches which rested in hooks at its side when not wanted swung himself from the box and propped himself in the doorway so as to command a view down the street  it was indeed a serious fight a party of westminster boys on their way back from their cricketground in st vincents square had been attacked by the skies the quarrel was an old standing one but had broken out afresh from a thrashing which one of the older lads had administered on the previous day to a young chimneysweep about his own age who had taken possession of the cricketball when it had been knocked into the roadway and had with much strong language refused to throw it back when requested  the friends of the sweep determined to retaliate upon the following day and gathered so threateningly round the gate that instead of the boys coming home in twos and threes as was their wont when playtime expired they returned in a body they were some forty in number and varied in age from the little fags of the under school ten or twelve years old to brawny muscular young fellows of seventeen or eighteen senior queens scholars or sixth form town boys the queens scholars were in their caps and gowns the town boys were in ordinary attire a few only having flannel cricketing trousers  on first leaving the field they were assailed only by volleys of abuse but as they made their way down the street their assailants grew bolder and from words proceeded to blows and soon a desperate fight was raging in point of numbers the skies were vastly superior and many of them were grown men but the knowledge of boxing which almost every westminster boy in those days possessed and the activity and quickness of hitting of the boys went far to equalise the odds  pride in their school too would have rendered it impossible for any to show the white feather on such an occasion as this and with the younger boys as far as possible in their centre the seniors faced their opponents manfully even the lads of but thirteen and fourteen years old were not idle taking from the fags the bats which several of the latter were carrying they joined in the conflict not striking at their opponents heads but occasionally aiding their seniors when attacked by three or four at once by swinging blows on their assailants shins  man after man among the crowd had gone down before the blows straight from the shoulder of the boys and many had retired from the contest with faces which would for many days bear marks of the fight but their places were speedily filled up and the numbers of the assailants grew stronger every minute  how well they fight the cripple exclaimed splendid isnt it mother but there are too many against them run evan quick down to deans yard you are sure to find some of them playing at racquets in the little yard tell them that the boys coming home from cricket have been attacked and that unless help comes they will be terribly knocked about  evan dashed off at full speed deans yard was but a few minutes run distant he dashed through the little archway into the yard down the side and then in at another archway into little deans yard where some elder boys were playing at racquets a fag was picking up the balls and two or three others were standing at the top of the steps of the two boardinghouses  if you please sir evan said running up to one of the racquetplayers there is just a row going on they are all pitching into the scholars on their way back from vincent square and if you dont send help they will get it nicely though they are all fighting like bricks  here all of you the lad he addressed shouted to the others our fellows are attacked by the skies on their way back from fields run up college james the fellows from the water have come back then he turned to the boys on the steps bring all the fellows out quick the skies are attacking us on the way back from the fields dont let them wait a moment  it was lucky that the boys who had been on the water in the two eights the six and the fours had returned or at that hour there would have been few in the boardinghouses or up college ere a minute had elapsed these with a few others who had been kept off field and water from indisposition or other causes came pouring out at the summonsa body some thirty strong of whom fully half were big boys they dashed out of the gate in a body and made their way to the scene of the conflict they were but just in time the compact group of the boys had been broken up and every one now was fighting for himself  they had made but little progress towards the school since evan had started and the fight was now raging opposite his house the cripple was almost crying with excitement and at his own inability to join in the fight going on his sympathies were wholly with the boys towards whose side he was attached by the disparity of their numbers compared to those of their opponents and by the coolness and resolution with which they fought  just look at those two motherthose two fighting back to back isnt it grand there there is another one down that is the fifth i have counted dont they fight cool and steady and they almost look smiling though the odds against them are ten to one o mother if i could but go to help them  mrs holl herself was not without sharing his excitement several times she made sorties from her doorstep and seized more than one hulking fellow in the act of pummelling a youngster half his size and shook him with a vigour which showed that constant exercise at the washtub had strengthened her arms  yer ought to be ashamed of yerselves yer ought a whole crowd of yer pitching into a handful o boys  but her remonstrances were unheeded in the dinwhich however was raised entirely by the assailants the boys fighting silently save when an occasional shout of hurrah westminster was raised presently evan dashed through the crowd up to the door  are they coming evan the cripple asked eagerly  yes arry they will be ere in a jiffy  a halfminute later and with shouts of westminster westminster the reinforcement came tearing up the street  their arrival in an instant changed the face of things the skies for a moment or two resisted but the muscles of the eighthardened by the training which had lately given them victory over eton in their annual racestood them in good stead and the hard hitting of the water soon beat back the lately triumphant assailants of cricket the united band took the offensive and in two or three minutes the skies were in full flight  we were just in time norris one of the newcomers said to the tall lad in cricketing flannels whose straight hitting had particularly attracted the admiration of harry holl  only just the other said smiling it was a hot thing and a pretty sight we shall look up school tomorrow i shall have two thundering black eyes and my mouth wont look pretty for a fortnight and by the look of them most of the others have fared worse its the biggest fight we have had for years but i dont think the skies will interfere with us again for some time for every mark weve got theyve got ten wont there be a row in school tomorrow when litter sees that half the sixth cant see out of their eyes  not for many years had the lessons at westminster been so badly prepared as they were upon the following morningindeed with the exception of the half and homeboarders few of whom had shared in the fight not a single boy from the under school to the sixth had done an exercise or prepared a lesson study indeed had been out of the question for all were too excited and too busy talking over the details of the battle to be able to give the slightest attention to their work  many were the tales of feats of individual prowess but all who had taken part agreed that none had so distinguished themselves as frank norris a sixth form town boy and captain of the eightwho for a wonder had for once been up at fieldsand fred barkley a senior in the sixth but grievous and general as was the breakdown in lessons next day no impositions were set the boardinghouse masters richards and sargent had of course heard all about it at teatime as had johns who did not himself keep a boardinghouse but resided at carrs the boardinghouse down by the great gate  these therefore were prepared for the state of things and contented themselves by ordering the forms under their charge to set to work with their dictionaries and write out the lessons they should have prepared the sixth did not get off so easily dr litter in his lofty solitude as headmaster had heard nothing of what had passed nor was it until the sixth took their places in the library and began to construe that his attention was called to the fact that something unusual had happened but the sudden hesitation and blundering of the first put on and the inability of those next to him to correct him were too marked to be passed over and he raised his goldrimmed eyeglasses to his eyes and looked round  dr litter was a man standing some six feet two in height stately in manner somewhat sarcastic in speecha very prodigy in classical learning and joint author of the great treatise on the uses of the greek particle searchingly he looked from face to face round the library  i cannot he said with a curl of his upper lip and the cold and somewhat nasal tone which set every nerve in a boys body twitching when he heard it raised in reproof i really cannot congratulate you on your appearance i thought that the sixth form of westminster was composed of gentlemen but it seems to me now as if it consisted of a number of singularly disreputablelooking prizefighters what does all this mean williams he asked addressing the captain your face appears to have met with better usage than some of the others  it means sir williams said that as the party from fields were coming back yesterday evening they were attacked by the skiesi mean by the roughsand got terribly knocked about when the news came to us i was up college and the fellows had just come back from the water so of course we all sallied out to rescue them  did it not occur to you williams that there is a body called the police whose duty it is to interfere in disgraceful uproars of this sort  if we had waited for the police sir williams said half the school would not have been fit to take their places in form again before the end of the term  it does not appear to me dr litter said that a great many of them are fit to take their places at present i can scarcely see norriss eyes and i suppose that boy is barkley as he sits in the place that he usually occupies otherwise i should not have recognised him and smart robertson and barker and barret are nearly as bad i suppose you feel satisfied with yourselves boys and consider that this sort of thing is creditable to you to my mind it is simply disgraceful there i dont want to hear any more at present i suppose the whole school is in the same state those of you who can see had better go back to school and prepare your demosthenes those who cannot had best go back to their boardinghouses or up college and let the doctor be sent for to see if anything can be done for you  the doctor had indeed already been sent for for some seven or eight of the younger boys had been so seriously knocked about and kicked that they were unable to leave their beds for the rest a doctor could do nothing fights were not uncommon at westminster in those days but the number of orders for beefsteaks which the nearest butcher had received on the previous evening had fairly astonished him indeed had it not been for the prompt application of these to their faces very few of the party from the fields would have been able to find their way up school unless they had been led by their comrades  at westminster there was an hours school before breakfast and when nine oclock struck and the boys poured out dr litter and his undermasters held council together  this is a disgraceful business dr litter said looking as was his wont at some distant object far over the heads of the others  there was a general murmur of assent  the boys do not seem to have been much to blame mr richards suggested in the cheerful tone habitual to him from what i can hear it seems to have been a planned thing the people gathered round the gates before they left the fields and attacked them without any provocation  there must have been some provocation somewhere mr richards if not yesterday then the day before or the day before that dr litter said twirling his eyeglass by the ribbon a whole host of people do not gather to assault forty or fifty boys without provocation this sort of thing must not occur again i do not see that i can punish one boy without punishing the whole school but at any rate for the next week fields must be stopped i shall write to the commissioner of police asking that when they again go to vincent square some policemen may be put on duty not of course to accompany them but to interfere at once if they see any signs of a repetition of this business i shall request that should there be any fighting those not belonging to the school who commit an assault may be taken before a magistrate my own boys i can punish myself are any of the boys seriously injured do you think  i hope not sir mr richards said there are three or four in my house and there are ten at mr sargents and two at carrs who have gone on the sick list i sent for the doctor and he may have seen them by this time they all seemed to have been knocked down and kicked  there are four of the juniors at college in the infirmary mr wire who was in special charge of the queens scholars put in i had not heard about it last night and was in ignorance of what had taken place until the list of those who had gone into the infirmary was put into my hands and then i heard from williams what had taken place  it is very unpleasant dr litter said in a weary tone of voiceas if boys were a problem far more difficult to be mastered than any that the greek authors afforded himthat one cannot trust boys to keep out of mischief for an hour of course with small boys this sort of thing is to be expected but that young fellows like williams and the other seniors and the sixth town boys who are on the eve of going up to the universities should so far forget themselves is very surprising  but even at the university doctor litter mr richards said with a passing thought of his own experience town and gown rows take place  all the worse dr litter replied all the worse of course there are wild young men at the universities dr litter himself it is scarcely necessary to say had never been wild the study of the greek particles had absorbed all his thoughts why he continued young men should condescend to take part in disgraceful affrays of this kind passes my understanding mr wire you will inform williams that for the rest of the week no boy is to go to fields  so saying he strode off in the direction of his own door next to the archway for the conversation had taken place at the foot of the steps leading into school from little deans yard there was some grumbling when the headmasters decision was known but it was nevertheless felt that it was a wise one and that it was better to allow the feelings to calm down before again going through westminster between deans yard and the field for not even the most daring would have cared for a repetition of the struggle  several inquiries were made as to the lad who had brought the news of the fight and so enabled the reinforcements to arrive in time and had he been discovered a handsome subscription would have been got up to reward his timely service but no one knew anything about him  the following week when cricket was resumed no molestation was offered the better part of the workingclasses who inhabited the neighbourhood were indeed strongly in favour of the boys and liked to see their bright young faces as they passed home from their cricket the pluck too with which they had fought was highly appreciated and so strong a feeling was expressed against the attack made upon them that the rough element deemed it better to abstain from further interruption especially as there were three or four extra police put upon the beat at the hours when the boys went to and from vincent square  it was however some time before the great fight ceased to be a subject of conversation among the boys at five minutes to ten on the morning when dr litter had put a stop to fields two of the younger boyswho were as usual just before schooltime standing in the archway leading into little deans yard to warn the school of the issuing out of the headmasterwere talking of the fight of the evening before both had been present having been fagging out at cricket for their masters  i wonder which would lick norris or barkley what a splendid fight it would be  you will never see that fairlie for they are cousins and great friends it would be a big fight and i expect it would be a draw i know who i should shout for  oh of course we should all be for norris he is such a jolly fellow there is no one in the school i would so readily fag for instead of saying here you fellow come and pick up balls or take my bat up to fields he says i say young fairlie i wish you would come and pick up balls for a bit and in a quarter of an hour you can call some other under school boy to take your place just as if it were a favour instead of his having the right to put one on if he pleased i should like to be his fag and he never allows any bullying up at richards i wish we had him at sargents  yes and barkley is quite a different sort of fellow i dont know that he is a bully but somehow he seems to have a disagreeable way with him a cold nasty hard sort of way he walks along as if he never noticed the existence of an under school boy while norris always has a pleasant nod for a fellow  heres litter  at this moment a door in the wall under the archway opened and the headmaster appeared as he came out the five or six small boys standing round raised a tremendous shout of litters coming a shout so loud that it was heard not only in college and the boardinghouses in little deans yard but at carrs across by the archway and even at sutcliffes shop outside the yard where some of the boys were purchasing sweets for consumption in school a fag at the door of each of the boardinghouses took up the cry and the boys at once came pouring out  the doctor as if unconscious of the din raised round him walked slowly along halfway to the door of the school here he was joined by the other masters and they stood chatting in a group for about two minutes giving ample time for the boys to go up school though those from carrs having much further to go had to run for it and not unfrequently had to rush past the masters as the latter mounted the wide stone steps leading up to the school  the school was a great hall which gave one the idea that it was almost coeval with the abbey to which it was attached although it was not built until some hundreds of years later the walls were massive and of great height and were covered from top to bottom with the painted names of old boys some of which had been there as was shown by the dates under them close upon a hundred years the roof was supported on great beams and both in its proportions and style the school was a copy in small of the great hall of westminster  at the furthermost end from the door was a semicircular alcove known as the shell which gave its name to the form sitting there on both sides ran rows of benches and narrow desks three deep raised one above the other on the left hand on entering was the under school and standing on the floor in front of it was the armchair of mr wire next came the monitors desk at which the captain and two monitors sat in an open drawer in front of the table were laid the rods which were not unfrequently called into requisition extending up to the end were the seats of the sixth the upper shell occupied the alcove the under shell were next to them on the further benches on the righthand side mr richards presided over the shell mr sargent took the upper and under fifth who came next to them and johnny as mr johns was called looked after the two fourths who occupied benches on the right hand of the door  by the time the masters entered the school all the boys were in their places the doors were at once shut then the masters knelt on one knee in a line one behind the other in order of seniority and the junior queens scholar whose turn it was knelt in front of them and in a loud tone read the lords prayer in latin then the masters proceeded to their places and school began the names of all who came in late being taken down to be punished with impositions  so large and lofty was the hall that the voices were lost in its space and the forms were able to work without disturbing each other any more than if they had been in separate rooms the sixth only were heard apart retiring into the library with the doctor his seat when in school was at a table in the centre of the hall near the upper end  thus westminster differed widely from the great modern schools with their separate classrooms and lecturerooms discipline was not very strict when a master was hearing one of the forms under him the other was supposed to be preparing its next lessons but a buzz of quiet talk went on steadily occasionally once or twice a week perhaps a boy would be seen to go up from one of the lower forms with a note in his hand to the headmaster then there was an instant pause in the talking  dr litter would rise from his seat and a monitor at once brought him a rod these instruments of punishment were about three feet six inches long they were formed of birch twigs very tightly bound together and about the thickness of the handle of a bat beyond this handle some ten or twelve twigs extended for about eighteen inches the doctor seldom made any remark beyond giving the order hold out your hand  the unfortunate to be punished held out his arm at a level with his shoulder back uppermost raising his arm so that the rod fell almost straight behind his back dr litter would bring it down stroke after stroke with a passionless and mechanical air but with a sweeping force which did its work thoroughly four cuts was the normal number but if it was the third time a boy had been sent up during the term he would get six but four sufficed to swell the back of the hand and cover it with narrow weals and bruises it was of course a point of honour that no sound should be uttered during punishment when it was over the doctor would throw the broken rod scornfully upon the ground and return to his seat the junior then carried it away and placed a fresh one upon the desk  the rods were treated with a sort of reverence for no junior queens scholar ever went up or down school for any purpose without first going over to the monitors table and lightly touching the rod as he passed  such was school at westminster forty years since and it has but little changed to the present day     illustration  chapter ii  a cold swim   it is winter christmas is close at hand and promises to be a bitterly cold one the ice has formed smooth and black across the serpentine and a number of people are walking along by its banks looking forward to some grand skating if the frost does but hold two days longer the sky is blue and the sun shining brightly the wind is fresh and keen it is just the day when people wellclad wellfed and in strong health feel their blood dancing more freely than usual through their veins and experience an unusual exhilaration of spirits merry laughter often rises from the groups on the bank and the air rings with the sharp sound made by pieces of ice sent skimming by mischievous boys over the glassy surface to the disgust of skaters who foresee future falls as the result of these fragments should a slight thaw freeze them to the surface  among those walking by the edge of the ice were frank norris and fred barkley with them was a brightfaced girl of some fourteen years old alice hardy was cousin to both the young fellows and was a ward of their uncle captain bayley an old and very wealthy retired officer of the east india companys service his fortune had not been acquired in india but had descended to him from his father of whom he had been the youngest son his elder brothers had died off one by one all unmarried or childless and soon after he obtained his commission he was recalled home to take his place as the next heir to his fathers estates then he had married  soon after he succeeded to the property his wife died leaving him a little girl who was called ella after her captain bayley was hot and passionate his daughter grew up fiery and proud her father was passionately fond of her but just when she reached the age of twenty and had taken her place as one of the leading belles of worcestershire she disappeared suddenly from the circle of her acquaintances what had happened no one ever knew that there had been some terrible quarrel was certain it was understood that captain bayley wished no questions to be asked her disappearance was a nine days wonder in worcestershire some said she had turned roman catholic and gone into a convent others that she must have eloped although with whom no one could guess but at last the subject died out until two years later captain bayley and his household appeared in mourning and it was briefly announced that his daughter was dead  captain bayley went about as before peppery kindhearted perhaps a little harder and more cynical than before but a very popular personage in worcestershire those who knew him best thought him the most altered and said that although he appeared to bear the blow lightly he felt deeply at heart the death of his daughter his nearest heirs now were his two nephews frank norris and barkley sons of his married sisters alice hardy bore no relation to him for some years speculation had been rife as to which of his two nephews he would select as his heir  two years before this story begins alice hardys father and mother had both died of typhoid fever leaving captain bayley as guardian to their daughter somewhat to the surprise of his friends the old officer not only accepted the trust but had alice installed at his house there to be educated by a governess instead of being sent to school but although in a short time she came to be regarded as the daughter of the house no one thought that captain bayley would make her his heiress as she had inherited a considerable fortune from her father and the two lads at westminster were still regarded as rivals for the heirship  captain bayley had never been on good terms with either of his brothersinlaw both had been merchants in the city and the old officer considered that his sisters had made mesalliances in marrying them franks father and mother had died within a few months of each other when he was about twelve years old captain bayleys house had since been his home fred was often invited to stay with his uncle down in worcestershire and his london house in eaton square was always open to him frank had never counted on the probability of his uncle leaving him any money certainly he never for a moment built castles in the air founded upon the chance of the inheritance his father had been an easygoing and somewhat careless man and would sometimes laugh with the boy in speaking of his future and predicting what he would do if he were come into old bayleys estates none of the captains intimates couldhad they been askedhave declared a preference for the chances of either lad fred was certainly the cleverest he had gone into college head of his year and would have been captain had not one of those of the year before him who had got into college under age elected to stay a year longer at school and therefore by right became captain while fred had to be content with the honours of head monitor frank on the other hand had failed to get into college at all and had remained a town boy  although it could not be said of fred that in any open way he laid himself out to gain his uncles favour he was yet decidedly more attentive than was frank and would give up any other engagement he might have if captain bayley invited him to stay the saturday and sunday in eaton square while frank went carelessly his own way and while there was nothing in the smallest degree servile in freds mannerfor this indeed captain bayley would have instantly noticed and resentedthere was just that slight deference which a young fellow should exhibit in conversation with an elder while frank on the other hand carelessly expressed his own opinion and ideas which often differed very widely from those of the old officer  captain bayleys own manner evinced no shade of partiality for one nephew over the other and although alice had a sort of faint suspicion that frank who was certainly her own favourite was also that of her uncle she could have given no reason for her belief  in person the cousins were remarkably dissimilar frank was two inches the tallest and had a still greater advantage in width it was clear that he would grow into a big man but his figure was at present loose and unformed he had dark brown hair with a slight wave and would hardly have been called goodlooking were it not for his open fearless expression and merry smile  freds figure although less strongly built was far more formed and it was probable that years would effect but little change in it there was a sinew and wire in his frame which would have told an athlete of great latent strength in the slight figure his hair was light his features clear and sharply cut and the face a decidedly intellectual one his manner was somewhat cold and restrained but pleasant and courteous to men older than himself both young fellows carried themselves well with a certain ease of bearing and that nameless air of command which distinguish most young men who have passed through the upper forms of a great public school  both lads had their circle of friends and admirers at school but franks was by far the largest he was indeed universally popular which was far from being the case with his cousin upon the other hand while frank seemed to be a sort of common property of the school it was somehow esteemed by those in barkleys set a special distinction to be admitted to his friendship  but the party of three young people have been left long enough walking by the edge of the serpentine presently they saw a knot of people gathered ahead the number increased as others ran up  whats up i wonder frank said look out there on the ice alice you see that hole there is something movingtheres a dogs head i declare poor brute it has run out after a stick i suppose and the ice has given under it  poor little thing alice exclaimed pitifully cant it get out do you think it will be drowned frank can nothing be done for it  the best thing you can do alice fred replied as frank stood looking at the dog who tried several times but in vain to scramble out the ice each time breaking with its weight will be to turn and walk away there is no use standing here harrowing your feelings by watching that poor little brute drown  can nothing be done frank alice again asked paying no heed to freds suggestion  that is just what i am thinking frank replied you stop here alice with fred i will go on and see what they are doing  cant i go with you frank  you had better stop here frank replied the crowd is getting thick there and they are a roughish lot besides you will not be able to see over their heads and can do no good so just do as i bid you  the girl remained obediently with her cousin fred while frank went off at a run towards the group  frank orders you about just as if you were his fag fred said with a smile which had in it something of a sneer  i dont mind the girl said staunchly its franks way and i like itat any rate one always knows what frank means and he always means well  that is as much as to say alice that you dont always understand what i mean and that i dont always mean well fred barkley said in a quiet tone but with a little flush of anger in his usually somewhat pale cheeks  no i dont know that i mean that alice said carelessly but i do not always understand what you mean though i always understand what you say  i should have thought that was the same thing fred replied  should you alice rejoined well i shouldnt thats all  as frank norris approached the group he began to unbutton his collar and waistcoat  it will be a beastly cold swim he grumbled to himself but i cant see the poor little brute drowned and drowned he certainly will be if no one goes in for him its no distance to swim and i should think one could wade to within twenty yards of him but it certainly will be horribly cold and he gave a shiver of anticipation as he looked at the smooth frozen surface  with some little difficulty frank pushed his way through to the centre of the group by the waters side a little girl poorly dressed was standing crying bitterly a cripple boy in a box upon wheels was trying to pacify her while another who had taken off his coat and waistcoat and laid them in the lap of the cripple was unlacing his boots  are you going in young un frank said as he joined them  yes sir i am going in for flossy she belongs to this little girl who is one of our neighbours  can you swim well frank asked for the water will be bitterly cold  yes the boy answered confidently i goes regularly for a swim above vauxhall bridge in the summer and keeps on until the water gets too cold i can do that fast enough i suppose the ice will break right enough and he looked up inquiringly at frank  yes it will break with your weight easily enough you will have to raise yourself a little so as to break it before you you will have to put some weight on for it is nearly half an inch thick i expect there is a thin place where the dog has fallen ina spring underneath most likely so a mere skin has formed  look here young un i was going in if you hadnt i shall get my boots ready to kick off now so dont you be frightened if you get numbed with the cold or a touch of cramp just sing out and i will be with you in a minute  the cripple looked with pleasure up into franks face  it is very good of you sir for you dont know the dog as evan does ah i know your face sir he broke off i saw you in the fight down by our place at westminster when evan ran up and fetched some more of your chapsand just in time they were too  oh was it your brother who brought that news frank said quickly then i owe him one and if i go in to fetch him out we shall be only quits  evan had by this time entered the water breaking the ice before him as he went  my eye aint it cold he said halfturning round seems to nip ones legs up regular all right flossy he shouted to the dog as he continued his way out in answer to a pitiful whine of the struggling animal  illustration the rescue from the serpentine  for the first few paces evans progress was easy enough but when he got so deep that he could no longer break the ice with his foot his difficulties began and it was only by flinging himself down upon it that he was able to break it a few yards further on the water was up to his chin he was now breaking the ice by trying to climb upon it frank was watching him closely and noticed that he no longer proceeded about his work deliberately but with a hurried and jerky action as if he felt his strength failing him frank pulled off his coat and waistcoat and handed them to the cripple kicked off his boots and stood in readiness to plunge in  the crowd had at first cheered the lad as he made his way from the shore some still uttered shouts of encouragement others saw that he was getting exhausted and called to him to return suddenly the boy seemed to lose his power altogether held on to the edge of the ice and cast a despairing look towards the shore then gradually his head disappeared under the water but frank was already halfway towards him a few strides had taken him through the shallow water and he swam with vigorous strokes through the floating fragments to the end of the line of broken water then he too disappeared for a moment a dead silence reigned through the crowd but when two heads appeared above the water together a ringing cheer broke out carrying his senseless companion frank swam back to shore  take off his wet clothes he said as he handed his burden to some of the men wrap him up in my coat and his own and then run with him up to the humane societys house they will bring him round in no time it is cold not drowning  then he looked again across the water the little dog was swimming feebly now its nose scarcely above the surface it had given a plaintive cry of despair as it saw those who had approached so near turn back for there were but some five yards between the spot where the boys strength had failed and the circle which it had broken in its efforts to climb out  i cant be colder than i am frank said to himself so here goes  accordingly he again dashed into the water and swam to the end of the narrow passage a few vigorous strokes broke the intervening barrier of ice he seized the little dog put it on the ice and with a push sent it sliding towards the shore and then turned and swam back again  it was only just where the dog had fallen in that the ice was too weak to bear its weight and after lying for two or three minutes utterly exhausted it scrambled to its feet and made its way to the bank where it was soon wrapped in the apron of its delighted mistress  frank on reaching the shore was scarcely able to stand so benumbed were his legs by the cold his cousins had made their way through the crowd to the spot  o frank alice exclaimed what a mad thing for you to do oh i am so pleased you did itbut oh you do look cold what will you do  i am all right alice frank said as cheerfully as his chattering teeth would allow him to speak you go home with fred i shall get a hot bath and have my clothes dried at the receivinghouse and shall be as right as a trivet in half an hour there goodbye  frank walked stiffly at first but was presently able to break into a run which he kept up until he reached the establishment of the royal humane society his first question as he entered was for the boy  he will do sir the attendant answered we popped him at once into a hot bath we had ready and he has opened his eyes and is able to speak we have just got him into bed between warm blankets and now its your turn  in another minute frank was in the bath from which the boy had just been taken for there was no time to prepare another for the first minute or two he felt an intense pain as the blood flowed back into his chilled limbs then a delightful sensation of warmth and comfort stole over him a glass of hot brandy and water completed his cure and a few minutes later he felt that he was fast going off to sleep in the warm blankets between which he was laid  before the crowd whom the incident on the serpentine had gathered broke up one or two of those present went among the rest and collected a subscription for the lad who had gone in after the dog nearly two pounds were collected in silver and coppers and handed over to the cripple to give to his brother fred barkley dropped in five shillings and alice hardy the same sum then after walking to the receivinghouse and hearing that frank and the lad had both recovered from the effects of the cold and would probably be all right after a few hours sleep they returned home alice in a high state of excitement over the adventure which she had witnessed fred silent and gloomy  he accompanied alice to eaton square and was present when she related to her uncle the story of the lad going in to rescue the dog and of frank going in to rescue the boy and of his afterwards returning to set free the dog upon the way home he had appeared to alice to take the matter exceedingly quietly but he now somewhat to her surprise appeared almost as enthusiastic as herself and spoke in terms of high admiration of franks conduct captain bayley as was usually the case with him took a view of the matter entirely opposed to that of the speakers  stuff and nonsense he said you call that a gallant action i call it a foolish boys trick what right has frank to risk getting rheumatic fever and being laid up as a cripple for life merely to save a dog  but he went in to save a boy uncle alice said indignantly  pooh pooh the old officer exclaimed the boy would never have gone in if he hadnt encouraged him that makes the case all the worse frank not only risking catching rheumatism himself but he risked the life of that boy by encouraging him to do such a foolish action it was a hairbrained business altogether sir and i am glad you had the wisdom fred to keep out of it the idea of two lives being risked to save that of a wretched cur is too absurd if you had offered the girl who owned it five shillings to buy another it would have been more sensible  i dont believe you mean what you say a bit uncle harry alice exclaimed indignantly i believe if you had been there and had heard that poor little dogs cries as we did you would have gone in yourself i am sure i would if i had been a man  i always observe my dear captain bayley said sarcastically that women would do wonderful things if they had only been born men nature appears to be always making mistakes by putting the dauntless and heroic spirits into female bodies and vice versa  i dont like you when you talk like that uncle harrythat is i shouldnt like you if i thought you meant it but you only talk so out of contradiction if i had said i thought frank was very foolish for having gone into the water you would have taken the opposite side directly  you are an impudent puss miss alice her uncle retorted and i shall have to tell miss lancaster that unless she can keep you in better order i shall have to send you to school you appear to have been born without the bump of veneration  i would venerate you ever so much uncle harry the girl replied laughing if you would always be good and reasonable but i cannot venerate you when you are contrary and disagreeable and say things you dont mean  as fred barkley walked home he wondered again and again to himself whether captain bayley had meant what he said and whether this act of franks would raise him in his opinion or the contrary but he flattered himself that at any rate no harm had been done for his own advocacy of his cousin could not but have placed him in the most favourable light  fred barkley was shrewd but his power of reading character was as yet by no means perfect and his uncles changing moods baffled the power of analysis he would not have been pleased had he known that at that very moment the old officer was walking up and down his library muttering to himself i would give a good deal if there were a glass window at that boy freds heart that i could see what it is really made of his head is strong enough nature has given him a fair share of brains but unless i am greatly mistaken there is a very grievous deficiency in his allowance of heart  i dont believe the boy ever spoke spontaneously from the time he learned to talk but that every word he says is weighed before it passes through his lips and its effect calculated whereas frank never thinks at all but just blurts out the words which come to hand it is curious how much more alice takes to him than to fred for he bullies her and orders her about as if she were one of his fags while fred is as courteous and polite to her as if she were a young countess i suppose it is instinct for childrens opinions about people are seldom far wrong i thought when i brought alice here that she would help me to settle the problem  frank and evan holl woke at about the same time after sleeping for some hours their clothes had been dried for them and they at once began to dress  how do you feel now young un was franks first inquiry as they sat up in their beds  i dunno how i feels evan replied i hardly knows where i am or how i got here though i do seem to remember something about this ere place too oh yes he exclaimed suddenly i was trying to fetch out poor little flossy and the ice would not break and i got colder and colder and then i dont seem to remember any more except somehow that i was here with people standing round me and i swallowed something hot and went off to sleep ah yes you were the gentleman as said you would come in after me if i sang out  and i did come in frank said smilingly and only just in time i was for you did not sing out but went right down without a word it was lucky you did not get under the ice  and flossy the boy said suddenly did she go down too  no frank answered i went in again and got her out after i had brought you back to shore  well you are a brick the boy said a regular downright un and no mistake i wonder how harry got back it would be a job for him to wheel hisself all the way back to westminster  oh i expect he got some one to help him frank said and the little girl would be able to help shove him along  yes she would evan replied she can shove him by herself along a pavement and i expect that he and she atween them would be able to get along lor how them things of yours have shrunk to be sure  they have a bit frank said looking down at his trousers which were halfway up to his knees but it dont matter much its getting dark now and i can take a cab when i get out of the park your clothes dont seem to have suffered so much they seem plenty large enough for you now  yes evan said with a satisfied air and a good job too mother always will have my clothes so big cos of my growing she always seems to think one will grow sudden into a man afore ones things wear out  frank and the lad walked together as far as albert gate here they separated frank taking a cab home while evan whistling a popular air in a high key took his way to westminster on arriving home he was greeted with enthusiasm by harry but mrs holl was not inclined to view his adventure favourably  its all very well to care for dogs evan and i aint asaying as carrie hills dog aint a nice little critter but when it comes to getting into the freezing water arter it i dont hold to it no way then you might have gone and got drownedand you would have got drowned too harry tells me if that young gent hadnt been and gone after you and then this blessed minute i should have been breaking my heart about you and you down underneath the ice in the bottom of the serpentine there aint no reason in it my boy harry here thinks different about it and will have it that i ought to be proud of yer but he aint a mother and so cant understand a mothers feelingsand your clothes pretty nigh spoilt too ill be bound  well mother if they are harry said cheerfully evan can buy some more here evan here are thirtyeight shillings and ninepence halfpenny and its all your own  crikey evan gasped looking in astonishment at the pile of money in harrys lap why where did all that ere money come from  that was collected in the crowd evan after you were carried away and they gave it to me to give to you i did not quite like your taking money for doing such a thing but of course as it was given for you i had nothing to say to it  evan burst into a wild dance expressive of delight he had none of his brothers scruples in respect to the money  my eye he exclaimed at last thirtyeight bob and some coppers to do just as i likes with i am a rich man i am i shall have to get some igh collars and come the swell i suppose it wont run to a carriage and pair mother or to a welvet gownd for youthat would be splendatious just fancy mother a gownd all over welvet and just the same colour as the sodgers coats my eye wont that be grand  and a nice sight i should look in it mrs holl said laughing at the thought of herself in scarlet robes when dad comes home we will talk over with him whats the best way of laying out this money its yours to do as you likes with but i aint agoing to have it fooled away so dont you make any mistake about that     illustration  chapter iii  a cripple boy   john holl returned from work a few minutes after evan came in john holl was a dustman a short broadlybuilt man with his shoulders bowed somewhat from carrying heavy baskets up area steps his looks were homely and his attire far from clean but john was a good husband and father and the great proportion of the many twopences he daily received as douceurs for discharging his duties were brought home to his wife as was all the weekly money instead of being exchanged for liquor at the publichouse  sarah holl added to the family income by going out charring she was a big woman with a rough voice and slipshod in walk her hands were red and hard from much scrubbing and polishing and she was considered generally by the servants in the establishments at which she worked to be a low person but sarahs heart was in the right place her children loved her and her husband regarded her as a treasure  it was not until john holl had changed his dirtstained clothes and had freshened himself up with a copious wash had put on a pair of list slippers of sarahs manufacture in place of his heavy boots and had seated himself by the fire with his long pipe alight while sarah bustled about getting the tea that he was informed of the important events which had taken place for john like many more distinguished men had his idiosyncrasies and one of these was that he hated to be as he called it hustled before he had tidied up john was not quick of comprehension and could not give due weight to what was said to him while engaged in the important work of changing therefore all pieces of family news were reserved until he had taken his seat and his pipe was fully alight then mrs holl began  what do you think john evan as been adoing today  john gave a grunt to signify that he would prefer hearing the facts to wasting his brainpower in random guesses  why he has been in the serpentine and was nigh drowned and had to be taken to the mane society and put into a hot bath and all his clothes shrunk that much as you never seed  i thought the ice werent strong enough to bear john said taking his pipe from his mouth one of my mates tells me as he heard a chap going along with skates say as it werent strong enough on the serpentine to hold a cat  no more it aint john but carrie hills little dog run on and fell through and nothing would do but that evan must go out and risk his life to fetch it out and a nice business he made of it when he got close out to the dog down he went hisself and would have been drowned as sure as fate if a young gent as was astanding there hadnt swam out and brought him in and i think you ought to speak to him john for such venturesome ways he dont mind my speaking no more than the wind ablowing  john holl smoked his pipe in silence for some time looking solemnly into the fire the number of facts and ideas presented suddenly to him were too great to be instantly taken in and grappled with  and how do you feel now evan he said at last cold right through the bones  no father i am as warm as need be and what do you think i have got thirtyeight bob and some coppers which they scribed for me  did they now john holl said then after taking in this new fact and turning it over in different lights he said to his wife well sarah it seems to me that if the people who saw our evan go into the water subscribed wellnigh upon two pounds for the boy they must have thought that what he did warnt a thing for him to be jawed for but a brave goodhearted sort of action and i aint no manner of doubt sarah that thats just what you think it yerself only you are a bit scared over the thought that he might have been drowned which is natural and womanlike it seems to me as evan has done a wery honourable kind o action i know as i should have liked to have done it myself though i holds that a man cant have too much of hot water and plenty of soap in it cold water allus giving me the shivers and being no good for getting out dirtnot where its ground in pretty thick i suppose its cos of this that i didnt larn to swim evan my boy your father feels proud of yer and so does your motheras proud as a peacockthough she dont think its right to say so  whereupon mrs holl finding to her great inward satisfaction that the paternal sanction and approval had been given to evans adventure felt no longer constrained to keep up a semblance of disapproval but embraced him with great heartiness and then wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron then came the great point of the disposal of evans fortune his first proposal was to hand it over to his father as a contribution towards the general expenses but this john holl peremptorily refused  its your money boy to do as you like with its earned in a honourable way and a way to be proud of you are to do with it just what you likes it were best not to spend it foolish but if you are disposed to spend it foolish you do so  there are such lots of things i should like to buy evan said i should like to buy mother a new sunday bonnet and i should like to get you a pound of bacca and winnie wants a new pair of boots and stockings and theres lots of things i should like to get for harry and some warm gloves for sue andand no end of things  two pounds john holl said is a nice little lump of money evan but when you gets as old as i am you will know as two pounds dont go wery far my advice to you is this whatever you get yer sure a while afterwards to want something else and to wish as you had bought that instead thats human nature and its the same with men women and boysat least thats my sperience and mother will tell you the same my advice is give that money to mother to keep for you say for a month well then every day you can settle fresh what you mean to buy and that will be most as good as buying it perhaps towards the end of the month you will have settled yer mind on to something which really seems to you better than all the others thats my advice  and capital good advice too father harry said  and thus the approval of the two authorities of the family having been obtained the matter was considered as settled  and who was the young gent as went in and fetched you out evan john holl asked when the important business of tea was concluded and he again settled himself to his pipe he must have been a good sort i should like to shake hands with that chap  he told me as his name were frank norris evan replied he is one of the scholars we see going along to vincent square i knew him again directly he was one of those chaps as fought so well the day they got attacked going back to the school a finelooking chap he is too with a pleasant face and a nice sort of way about him no nonsense you know he talked just pleasant and nice as harry might talk to me just as if he was a sort of pal and not a swell nohow  i should like to shake hands with him john holl repeated he saved your life thats sure enoughfor by this time harry had related the full details of the affair i think sarah as it would be only right and proper come sunday for you and i to go round to that young fellows house and tell him how we feels about it if it had been a chap of our own station in life i suppose there aint nothing we wouldnt do for him if we saw our way to it and though i dont see as its likely as we can do nothing for this young fellow the least as we can do is to go and tell him what we thinks about it did he tell you where he lived evan  no father he didnt say where he lived but he writ down in a pocketbook my name and where we lived and said as how he would look in one of these days and see that i was none the worse for my ducking  well i hopes as how he will john said but if he dont come soon we must find him out i expect his name or his fathers name would be down in a rectory and the name aint so common a one as there would be likely to be a great many on them living about here but if there was fifty i would call on them all till i found the right one i shant be easy in my mind not till i have shaken that young chaps hand and told him what i thinks on it and i am sure your mother feels the same as i do and now harry take out that fiddle of yours and lets have a tune my pipe allus seems to draw better and sweeter while you are playing  one of the childrenthere were eight in all in the roomfetched harrys fiddle from the wall it was a cheap common instrument but even far better judges of music than the holls would have been able to discern in spite of its cracked and harsh tone that the lad who was playing it had a genius for music it is true that the airs which he was playing those which the street boys of the day whistled as they walked by were not of a nature to display his powers harry could play other and very different kinds of music for whenever evan earned a sixpence by holding a horse or doing any other odd job a penny or twopence were sure to go in the purchase of a sheet of music for harry at the cheap bookstalls harry had learned the notes from a secondhand book of instructions which john holl had bought for him one saturday night when the weather had been particularly hot and people in their desire to get their dustbins emptied were more liberal than usual but of an evening when john was at home harry always played popular airs as his father and family were unable to appreciate the deeper and better music this he reserved for the time when the children were at school and mother was either charring or was at the washtub  sarah used to wonder silently at the sounds which seemed to her to have no particular air such as she could beat time to with her foot as she worked but in her heart she appreciated them they made her feel as if she was in church and sometimes she would draw her apron across her eyes wondering all the time what there was in the tones of the fiddle which should make her cry  three or four days later when harry as usual was playing on his violin and mrs holl was washing there was a knock at the door  drat it mrs holl muttered whos acoming bothering now just when i am busy  if no one is to come except when you are not busy harry laughed as mrs holl moved towards the door wiping the lather from her arms and hands we shant have many visitors for as far as i can see you are always busy  ah he exclaimed as mrs holl opened the door and he saw who was standing without its the gentleman who got evan out of the water  mrs holl frank asked interrogatively and then catching sight of harry he at once walked across to him and shook him by the hand  i hope i am not intruding mrs holl but i promised your son to look in and see how he was and as i had to come down to the school today for a book i wanted for my holiday task i thought it would be a good opportunity to fulfil my promise  it is no intrusion sir and i am sure i am heartily glad to see yer and thank ye for coming mrs holl said as she dusted an already spotless chair and placed it for her visitor my john does nothing every evening but talk of how he wishes he could see you to tell you how beholden he and me feels to you for having brought our evan to land just as he was being drowned  no thanks are required indeed mrs holl frank said cheerfully it was a sort of partnership affair you see i was going in after the dog only evan who was a sort of friend of the family had first claim so we agreed that he should try first and do all the hard work of breaking the ice and then if the cold was too much for him i was to go out and fetch him in and finish the job myself so you see it was a mutual arrangement and no particular thanks due to any one but your son is a plucky young fellow mrs holl and he behaved most gallantly i find too from what your son here tells me that i owe him one for having fetched help up from the school when we were getting the worst of it just opposite your house here well in the first place how is he none the worse i hope for the cold  not at all sir he is out today with a friend of ours as as got a barrow and lives in the next street but who is that hoarse with the cold that he cant speak out of a whisper so he offered evan sixpence to go along with him to do the shouting and a nice shouting he will make his voice goes through and through my head when he is only atalking with his brothers and sisters here and if anything can bring them to the windows it will be his voice he offered to come round here with the barrow afore they started off this morning but says i no evan i have a good name in the street i hope and dont wish to be dighted as a nuisance to the neighbourhood nor to have my neighbours accusing me of abeing the cause of fits in their children  i dont suppose that it would be as bad as that mrs holl frank said laughing however if his voice is as loud and clear as that it is evident that he is not much the worse for his cold bath i came round partly to see him partly to know if i could do anything for him he seems a sharp lad and i am sure he is as honest as he is plucky as a beginning my uncle says he could come into the house as a sort of errandboy and to help the footman until he can hear of some better position for him among his friends  i am sure you are very good sir mrs holl said gratefully i will mention it to his father and he but i doubt whether evans steady enough for a place yet he is allus getting into mischief there never was such a boy for scrapes if all my eight were like him i should go clean mad afore the week was out when he is in the house as long as he is talking or singing i can go on with my work but the moment that he is quiet i have to drop what i am adoing on and look arter him for he is sure to be up to some mischief or other  no no mother harry put in laughing you are giving evan a worse character than he deserves he is up to fun as is only natural with one who has got the free use of his limbs but he never does any real harm  no i dont say that he does real harm arry mrs holl replied but i do say as at present he is too full of boyish tricks to be of any good in a place and we should be ahaving him back here a week arter he went and that would be a nice show of gratitude to this gentleman for his kindness  i dont suppose he is as bad as you make out mrs holl and no doubt he would tame down after a time just as other boys do perhaps a place in a warehouse would be more suitable for him at first  and it was you who were playing as i came in he went on noticing the violin i was wondering who was playing so well how jolly it must be to play i wish i could but i should never have patience to learn who taught you  i picked it up myself sir harry replied from a book father bought me you see i have plenty of time on my hands i dont get out much except just along the street for i cant very well get across crossings by myself the wheels go well enough on a level but i cannot push them up a curbstone but what with reading and fiddling the days pass quickly enough especially when mother is at home she is out two or three days a week and then the time seems rather long  i should think so frank said i should go mad if i were laid up entirely i am awfully sorry for you if you are fond of books i shall be glad to let you have some i have got no end of them and there they stand on my shelf unopened from years end to years end what sort of books do you like best sea stories or indians or what  i should like any storybooks sir harry replied his eyes brightening up with pleasure i have read a few which father has picked up for me at the bookstalls and i have gone through and through them until i could almost say them by heart and then tales of travel and historyoh i love history to read what people did hundreds of years ago and how nations grew up step by step just like children it is splendid  i am afraid frank said with a laugh that i dont care so much for history as you do names are hard enough to remember but dates are awful i would rather do the toughest bit of construing than have a page of greek history to get up well i will certainly look you up some books on history and some travels and will send you some of marryats stories i suppose you do not care for schoolbooks i have got a barrowload that i shall never want again  oh yes sir harry said eagerly i think i should like those best of all have you a virgil sir i do like virgil and all that story about the siege of troy i only had it for a fortnight father bought it for me and then one of the little ones managed somehow to take it out and lose it she ran out with it for a bit of fun and we suppose sat down on a doorstep and forgot it  but bless me frank exclaimed you dont mean to say that you read virgil in latin you are a rum fellow how on earth did you learn it  i have taught myself sir harry said father is awfully good and often picks up books for me at old bookstalls of course sometimes he gets things i cant make out but he got twelve once for a shilling and there was a latin grammar and dictionary among them and when i had learned the grammar it was very easy with the dictionary to make out the sense of some of the latin books but of course i often come across things that i dont understand i think sometimes if some one would explain them to me once or twice so that i could really understand how the rules in the grammar are applied i could get on faster  well you are a rum fellow frank exclaimed again i wish i liked learning as you do for though i am in the sixth at westminster i own that i look upon the classics as a nuisance well now look here i have got an hour at present with nothing special to do so if you like we will have a go at it together what have you got here and he walked across to a shelf on which were a number of books oh here is a cæsar suppose we take that its easy enough generally but there are some stiffish bits now and then lets start off from the beginning and perhaps i may be able to make things clear for you a bit  in spite of mrs holls protestations that harry ought not to trouble the gentleman the two lads were soon deep in their cæsar frank found to his surprise that the cripple boy had a wonderful knack of grasping the sense of passages but that never having been regularly taught to construe he was unable to apply the rules of grammar which he had learned frank taught him how to do this how to take a sentence to pieces how to parse it word by word and to see how each word depended upon the others so that even if absolutely in ignorance of the meaning of any one word in a sentence he could nevertheless parse them unerringly in the order in which they would be rendered in englishcould determine the value of each and their bearing upon one another  this was quite a revelation to harry his face flushed with eagerness and excitement and so interested were both lads in their work that the hour was far exceeded before the lesson came to an end by mrs holl interfering bodily in the matter by carrying off the dictionary and declaring that it was a shame that harry should give so much trouble  it is no trouble at all mrs holl frank said laughing you see one is accustomed a little to teaching as one often gives ones fag or any other little chap who asks a construe or explains his lesson to him but i can tell you that there are precious few of them who take it all in as quickly as your son does now that i have made myself at home i will come in sometimes when school begins again if you will let me for half an hour and read with harry but i dont think he will want any help long still it may help to show him the regular way of getting at things and now i must hurry off you will ask evan to think over what i have said here is my address i wrote it down in case i should find no one in if he makes up his mind about it before i come again he had better call on me there the best time would be between nine and eleven in the morning i have always finished breakfast by nine and i have put off my holiday task so long that i must stick at it regularly two hours a day till school begins again so he will be pretty sure to find me between nine and eleven will you tell your husband not to worry himself about seeing me i dont want to be thanked for it was as i told you a sort of partnership business between your boy and me  now i call that a downright nice sort of young chap mrs holl said as their visitor departed goodhearted and goodnatured without no sort of nonsense he just sits himself down and makes himself at home as if he was one of the family and i was able to go on with my washing just as if he hadnt been here  for a time harry did not answer  so thats a gentleman he said at last in a low voice as if thinking aloud i have never spoken to a gentleman before  well lad sarah holl said there aint much difference between the gentry and other sorts i dont see very much of them myself in the houses i goes to but i hears plenty about them from the servants talk and judging from that a great many of them as just as nasty and unpleasant ways as other people  i suppose harry said thoughtfully there cant be much difference in real nature between them and us there must of course be good and bad among them but there is more difference in their way of talking than i expected  well of course harry they have had education that accounts for it just the same as you who have educated yourself wonderful talks different to john and me and the rest of us  yes harry said but i am not talking about mistakes in grammar its the tone of voice and the way of speaking thats so different now why should that be mother  i suppose a good deal of it mrs holl answered is because they are brought up in nusseries and they cant run about the house or holloa or shout to each other in the streets d ye see they are taught to speak quiet and they hear their fathers and mothers and people round them speaking quiet you dunt know harry how still it is in some of them big houses you seem half afraid to speak above a whisper  yes but i dont think he spoke lower than i do mother or than the rest of us o mother he went on after a while isnt he good just to think of his spending an hour and a half sitting here showing me how to construe why i see the whole thing in a different way now he has made clear all sorts of things that i could not understand and he said he would come again too and i am quite sure that when he says a thing he means to do it i dont believe he could tell a lie if he tried and is he not goodlooking too  he is a pleasantlooking young chap mrs holl replied but i should not call him anything out of the way now i should call you a betterlooking chap than he is harry  o mother what an idea harry exclaimed quite shocked at what seemed to him a most disrespectful comparison to his hero  it aint no idea at all mrs holl rejoined stoutly any one with eyes in his head could see that if you was dressed the same as he is you would be a sight the bestlooking chap of the two  ah mother harry said laughing you remind me of an old saying i saw in a book the other day a mothers geese are all swans  i am sure mrs holl said in an aggrieved voice you aint no goose harry and if any one else said so i should give them a bit of my mind sharp enough  harry did not attempt to argue with her but with a little laugh turned to his books again and was soon deep in the mysteries of cæsar  the next day a carriers cart stopped before mrs holls house to the great amazement of the neighbourhoodfor such an occurrence had not been known in the memory of the oldest inhabitant in the street and quite a crowd of children collected to witness the delivery of a square heavy box of considerable weight at the door  harry was almost beside himself with delight as he took out the treasures it contained and as fully half were storybooks his delight was shared by the rest of the young holls it was evening when the cart arrived and john was just enjoying his first pipe and he once more uttered the sentiment he had expressed so often during the last four days i should like to shake that young chap by the hand     illustration  chapter iv  an adopted child   a few days after school had commenced frank norris called in again at the holls it was a bright day and harry had gone out in his box and mrs holl was alone  harry will be sorry he is out sir was her first greeting to frank he has been looking forward to your coming again you dont know sir how much good you have done him the boy has generally wonderful good spirits considering his condition still though he dont say nought i can see sometimes that he isnt never quite happy except when he is working away with his books or playing on that fiddle of his  evan has been and spent all the money as was given him that day at the serpentine in buying a new fiddle for him i dont see much in the thing myself and it seems to me they must have cheated evan altogether for it aint a new un but an old brown dirtylooking thing as looks as if it had been made nigh fifty years and they goes and charges him thirtyeight shillings for it and pretended to make a favour of it while john only paid seven and sixpence for the one he had before which was a beautiful new shiny one  however harry seems delighted with it and says its beautiful soft and mellow but what he means i dont know though i do allow it aint so squeaky as the other and sometimes when harry is playing soft on it it does sound beautiful still thirtyeight shillings is a big price for an old thing like that  old fiddles are always worth more than new ones mrs holl do you know there are some fiddles two or three hundred years old which could not be bought for less than three or four hundred pounds  my gracious mrs holl exclaimed three or four hundred pounds for such a thing as a fiddle i calls it downright wicked  he is a wonderful boy that son of yours mrs holl frank said changing the subject a regular genius i should call him what a pity it is that he is a cripple  ay that it is mrs holl agreed and he is a wonderful chap is harry but he aint no son of mine mr norris though he dont know it himself and i shouldnt like him to be told  then what relation is he mrs holl if it is not an impertinent question  he aint no sort of relation at all sir the woman answered  then how came you to bring him up mrs holl frank asked in surprise  well sir it was a very simple matter but if so be as you care to hear it i will tell you just how it happened and leaning against the mantelpiece with the red light of the fire thrown up into her face mrs holl went on very slowly and speaking as though she almost saw what she was relating  well sir it were an evening in aprila cold bitter day i was sitting here between light and dark drinking my tea with john who was just come home from workjohn is my husband you see sirwhen we heard a noise outside in the street we went out to see what was the matter and we found a poor young creature with a baby in her arms had fallen down in a faint like  she was a pretty young thing sir and though her dress was poor and torn she looked as if she had not been always so some one says take them to the workhouse no says ifor my heart yearned towards the poor young thingbring her in here maynt we john says i well sir john did not say nothing but he took the baby out of her arms and gave it to me and then he upped and took the poor young creatureshe were no great weight sirand carried her into the house and laid her on the bed as it might be by the window there  well sir that bed she never left she came round a little and lived some days but her mind were never rightly itself again she would lay there with her baby beside her and sing songs to herself i dont know what about for it were some foreign language she were very gentle and quiet like but i dont think she ever knew where she was or anything about it she were very fond of baby and would take it in her arms and hush it and talk to it she faded and faded away and the doctor said nothing could be done for her it made my heart ache sir and if you will believe me i would go upstairs and cry by the hour  the thought of the little baby troubled me too i had lost my first little one sir and i could not abear the thought of the little thing going to the workhouse so one day i says to john john when that poor mother dies for gods sake dont ee send the little baby to the workhouse he has taken away our own little one and may be he has sent this one for us to love in his place let us take him as our own john he did not say nothing but he up and gived me a great kiss and said sairey youre a good woman which of course sir mrs holl put in apologetically is neither here nor there for any mother would have done the same but its johns way when hes pleased that very same night the babys mother died  standing with her rough honest face lit up by the bright fireglow she related it simply and as a matter of course all unconscious of the good part she had taken in it assuming no credit to herself or seeing that she deserved any  when she had finished there was a little silence frank passed his hand furtively across his eyes and then shook mrs holl warmly by the hand saying your husband was right mrs holl you are a good woman  mrs holl looked completely amazed and stammered out lor bless you sir there wasnt anything out of the way in what i did and theres scores and scores would do the like having just lost my own little one my heart went out to the poor little thing and it seemed sent natural like to fill up the place of the little angel who was gone from us bless your heart sir there werent nothing out of the way in that nothing at all and we have never had cause to regret it the boys a good boy and a clever boy and he is a comfort and a help to us a better boy never lived but we have always grieved sorely over the accident  then he was not originally lame mrs holl frank asked  dear me no sir not till he were six years old it happened this way i was laid up at the timei was just confined of mary she is my eldest girland somehow harry he went out in the street playing i dont rightly know how it happened but never shall i forget when they brought him in and said that a cart had run over him john he was inwhich was lucky for i think i lost my head like and went clean out of my mind for a bit for i loved him just like my own they did not think he would have lived at first for the cart had gone over the lower part of his body and broke one of his thighbones and the other leg up high it was a light cart i have heard tell or it must have killed him  he were in bed for months and if you will believe me if ever there was a patient little angel on earth it was surely harry he never complained and his chief trouble was for my sake at last he got well but the doctors said he would never walk again for they thought there was some damage done to his spine and sure enough he never has walked he is always cheerful and keeps up wonderful considering  he has always been given to reading john made a shift to teach him his letters and then the children of the neighbours they lent him their schoolbooks and taught him what they knew and in a short time bless you sir he knew more than them all he would sit and read for hours together he is wonderful clever harry is  well mrs holl frank said rising i am very much obliged to you for your story but i must be going now or else i shall be late for school tell harry i am sorry i missed him and will look in again soon have you thought anything further of what i said about evan  yes sir and thank you most kindly but father thinks he had better wait another year or so till he gets a bit older and steadier as for them books as you was kind enough to send harry the boy must thank you hisself except when he is playing on his fiddle he is always reading at them and it is as much as i can do to get him outside the doors he was never very fond of it for he thinks people look at him but since those books has come i have regular to take them away from him put his cap on his head and push him outside the door he will be in a taking that he has missed you today  well goodbye mrs holl i havent a moment to lose and frank putting on his hat made off at a sharp run to school only arriving just in time to say prayers  frank norris although a sixth town boy was not head of richards as johnstone had been longer in that form and was consequently senior to him johnstone was however small and slightly built and cared little for rowing cricket or football he had gained his place in the sixth by sheer hard work rather than by talent he was fussy and irritable with a strong sense of the importance of his position as a sixth town boy and head of richards between him and frank there was no cordiality for it irritated him that the latter was upon all occasions appealed to and his advice asked in everything relating to games and all matters of dispute referred to him frank on the other hand although he at all times gave way to johnstone in house matters was constantly annoyed by his continual selfassertion and his irritation at trifles they were the only two sixth town boys at richards but there were three upper shells harris travers and james and these ranked almost with the sixth for the great demarcation of the school was between the upper and under shells the former having the right to fag  frank and johnston had each a small room of their own the three upper shells had a room together but they used franks study almost as much as their own one or other would generally come in to work with him in the evening and it was here that councils were held as to house matters or knotty points connected with field or water  i wish trafalgar square wasnt out of bounds harris said one evening  they had finished the work for the next day and had gathered for a chat in franks room before turning into bed frank was sitting in a rickety armchair by the fire harris on the table and the other two on the bed  why do you wish so harris frank said  why i should like to go up to see those rows they have pretty nearly every day thompson the home boarder told me he saw a regular fight there yesterday evening between the police and the chartists  well its no use wishing because bounds begin at the gate in deans yard i never could understand myself why we should be allowed to go the other way down the slums as far as we please where there is every chance of getting into a row while we are not allowed to walk quietly up parliament street then we may go along the other way by the new houses of parliament to westminster bridge and across the bridge to baths but we may not go out from deans yard and walk across in front of the abbey to the bridge i expect when the rules were made there were no houses built beyond us and there were fields extending back from the river while the other way led up to the court but i should certainly like to go up and see one of those chartist riots however i dont think it can be done it would be setting a bad example to the young uns and the chances are ten to one we should run against one of the masters  hardly likely i should think travers said it would be shocking bad luck to run against one of them in a crowd like that  well you see travers we are so preciously conspicuous in these tailcoats of course its the custom and i stick up for old customs still i do think its a ridiculous thing that we should be obliged to wear tailcoats of course the jackets for the fellows under the upper shell are all right but one cannot go on wearing jackets higher than that still i do think they might let us wear cutaways tailcoats were all right when every one else wore tailcoats but in our days it is absurd to wear a coat which nobody else wears except for an evening dress you can tell a fellow a mile off as a westminster boy by his coat  it has its advantages james said look how johnstone would lose his importance without his tails he would look like a plucked jay  there was a general laugh  he is not a bad fellow frank replied though he does think a good deal of himself still as no one else thinks anything of him it is just as well he should fancy himself but never mind that now no i dont think there is any chance of our getting to see the fun in trafalgar square i should like to go to one of the halls where those fellows spout and to get up and say something the other way of course one would have to go in a strong body else there would not be much of us left when we got into the street again i must have a chat with perkins about it he is sure to be up to all that kind of thing  yes but there would be the trouble of getting in after lockup  oh i dare say we might get over that harris replied the fags would never peach  we wont tell them if we can help it frank said if we go in for any lark of that sort only one of our fags must know it i can trust young phillpot to hold his tongue well i will chat it over with perkins and see what can be done  perkins was a retired prizefighter who kept a publichouse on bank side in a large room attached to the house he gave sparring exhibitions twice a week with the aid of other fellowpugilists and also gave private lessons in the art of selfdefence bank side was not out of bounds but it was strictly against the rules for any boy to enter a publichouse nevertheless a good many of the westminster boys had learned boxing from this worthy there was a private entrance behind the house into what perkins called his saloon and the boys strove to consider that by using this they avoided an infringement of the rule the fact of their taking lessons was unknown to the master for indeed at westminster the boys were at perfect liberty to do as they pleased out of schooltime providing that they did not go out of bounds  the rules enforcing attendance at fields or water of abstaining from entering publichouses and generally of conducting themselves as gentlemen were left to what may be called their own police the senior queens scholars and the sixth form town boys and these kept a far more rigorous hand over the younger boys than the masters could possibly have done a vigorous thrashing was the punishment for shirking fields or for any action regarded as caddish and it was therefore only the upper shells and sixth who being free from the operation of the law as to fields and water were able to frequent perkinss establishment  of those who went there most of them did so for the genuine purpose of learning boxing but a few used the place for the purpose of smoking and drinking but these did so at hours when there was no chance of finding perkins at work with his pupils for public feeling would not have tolerated even in an upper form boy anything that would have been looked upon as such bad form  the next morning after breakfast frank walked down to the black dog he was one of perkinss best pupils and the latter had more than once been heard to express his regret that frank had not been born in a lower class of life  hes got the making of a champion in him the expugilist would say regretfully in another five years when he has got his full height and filled out i warrant he will fight twelve stone look how quick he is on his pins and i tell you i have all my work to do now to guard my head he hits like lightning and once or twice has fairly knocked me off my pins id back him now for fifty pounds against any novice in england and as for pluck i have never seen him wince hit him as hard as you will he always comes up smiling barkley he is a good boxer too but he aint got temper sir he gets nasty if he has a sharp counter and though he keeps cool enough there is an ugly look about his face which tells its tale he would never keep his temper and i doubt if hes real game at bottom i knows my customers and have never hit him as i hit norris i dont want to lose a pupil as pays fair and square and i know i should mighty soon lose him if i were to let out at him sharp no there is bad blood in that chap somewhere  well master norris and what do you want at this time of the morning he said as frank after entering the saloon rang a bell which sounded in the bar and summoned him to the saloon not a lesson at this time of the day surely  not exactly perkins considering i am due at ten oclock and therefore have only five minutes to stay i just dropped in to ask you about something on which you can perhaps advise us  fire away master norris anything i can do for you you knows as i will  i was thinking perkins that it would be a great lark to go up to one of those halls where those chartist fellows meet and to hear their speeches  i dont see that there would be any lark in it perkins replied unless you meant getting up a row  i dont know that i exactly meant to get up a row but if there was a row so much the more lark  well sir if i might give my advice i dont think if i was you i would do it in schooltime your hands can guard your face pretty tidy i grant you but the chances is as you would not get out of such a row as that would be without being marked i knows of a place over the other side of the water not far from the new cut where they meet bill lowe him as comes here to spar twice a week yer know he goes there he takes up with them chartist notions which i dont hold with no ways i dont see nothing in them seven pints as would do anything for the ring and that being so let it alone says i however master norris since you have a fancy that way i will talk the matter over with him and then if you really makes up your mind you would like to go i will get four or five of my lads as can use their mawleys and we will go in a body  then if there should be a row i reckon we can fight our way out there aint much in them chaps tailors and shoemakers and the like they are always great hands for jaw them tailors and shoemakers but i never seed one as i would put five pound on in a twelvefoot ring poor undersized creatures for the most part but beggars for jaw but there are some rough uns with em and yer might get badly marked before yer got out  but franks mind was now bent upon it  it will be a lark perkins anyhow things have been rather slow at school lately and three or four of us have set our minds on it so if you let me know what evening will suit you we will be here  four evenings later frank norris with the other three boys slipped out after prayers were over and started on their expedition franks fag closed the door noiselessly behind them and rebolted it he had strict orders to take his place at an upper window at eleven oclock and watch for their return if when they made their appearance the house was quiet and the lights out he was to slip down and let them in if not they were to go away again and return an hour later all four boys were in thick peajackets and wore rough caps which they had bought for the purpose  when they reached perkinss publichouse the prizefighter surveyed them closely  ye will pass in a crowd he said but keep your caps well down over yer faces now mind young gents if theres a row comes over this ere business i aint to blame in the matter  all right perkins but there will be no row  being joined by bill lowe and three other boxers they set out together for the new cut past the new houses of parliamentstill in the hands of the buildersover westminster bridge past the flaring lights in front of astleys and into the new cut  here as usual business was brisk the publichouses were doing a roaring trade rows of costermongers carts lined the road on either side and the hoarse shouts of the vendors of fruit vegetables and shellfish mingled with the babel of voices from the throng of people who loitered about the street which was regarded as the promenade of the neighbourhood sounds of musical instruments and a loud chorus came from the upper windows of many of the publichouses and from the low musichalls known by the name of penny gaffs  it was in front of one of these that the party stopped unlike the others no row of flaring lights burned over the entrance no posters with huge letters and sensational headings invited the public to enter one solitary lamp hung over the door which was kept closed men were passing in however after exchanging a word with one of those stationed at the door  its a private sort of affair perkins said none aint supposed to go but those as is in the swim they pretend to be mighty afraid of the peelers but lor bless you the police dont trouble about them when these chaps gets to making rows in the street and to kicking up a rumpus then they will have something to say about it sharp enough but as long as they merely spout and argue among themselves the peelers lets them go on well young gents here we goes  bill lowe advanced first he was known to the doorkeeper and the words all right mate friends of mine were sufficient he stood aside and the party entered passing through a passage they were in a hall some fifty feet long by half as wide the walls had originally been painted blue with wreaths of flowers along the top but these and the roof were so discoloured by smoke and dirt that the whole were reduced to a dingy brown at the end at which they entered was a gallery extending some fifteen feet into the room at the other end was a raised platform with a drop curtain the latter was now raised and displayed a table with half a dozen chairs the chairman for the evening was seated in the centre of the table he was a young man with a pale face eyes bloodshot from many nights spent in the reeking atmosphere of the room and tumbled hair which looked as if weeks had passed since it had made the acquaintance of a brush he had just risen as the party entered the room which was fairly filled with men rang with the applause which had greeted the speaker who had sat down  fellowworkmen said the chairmani wonder what you work at frank muttered below his breath nothing that requires washing anyhowfellowworkmen your cheers are evidence how deeply you have been moved by the noble words of my friend mr duggins and how your blood boils at the hideous slavery to which we are condemned by a tyrannical aristocracy you will now be addressed by my eloquent friend mr simpkins bootcloser  illustration the breakup of the chartist meeting  mr simpkins rose he was a short roundshouldered man made still shorter by the bend which he had acquired by the operation of bootclosing his eyes were small and sunken in his head his nose wide and flat as if in his early youth he had fallen on the edge of a pewter pot and he too had the appearance of regarding water with as deep an aversion as he viewed the aristocracy  fellowworkmen he began or rather i should say fellowslavesthis sentiment was received with a roar of applausethe time is approaching when our chains will be broken when the bloodstained power known as the british constitution will be rent and trampled under foot when the myrmidons of power will flee before an uprisen people they know it these oppressors of ours they tremble in their palaces and mansions where they feast upon the wealth drained from the blood of the people they know that the day is at hand and that the millions whose labour has created the wealth of this country are about to reclaim their own  a roar of applause went up as the speaker paused and mopped his forehead with a red handkerchief but the applause was suddenly stilled by the sound of the emphatic bosh which frank shouted at the top of his voice every one turned round and shouts arose of who is that down with him turn him out knock him down the orator seized the occasion  a spy of the tottering government has intruded upon the deliberations of this assembly but i tell him i fear him not  never mind out he goes one of the men shouted and all began to press upon the little group standing at the back of the room and from one of whom the objectionable word had evidently come  we are in for a row mr norris and no mistake perkins said the sooner we gets out of this the better  but this was not so easily done the crowd had already interposed between them and the door  now stand back perkins said and let us out we aint no spies and we dont want to hurt any one some of you may know me i am perkins of the black dog over at westminster so you had best leave us alone  the greater part of those present however had imbibed sufficient to render them valorous and a rush was made upon the party  their reception was a warm one the five prizefighters struck out right and left while frank and his schoolfellows ably seconded them a tall redhaired fellow who had singled out frank was met by a blow which knocked him off his feet and he fell backward as if shot their vigorous blows drove the leading assailants back and in spite of their numbers the crowd of angry men recoiled before their handful of opponents  come on perkins said make for the door they are breaking up the chairs and we shall have it hot in a few minutes  keeping together they fought their way in spite of all opposition to the door perkins leading while bill lowe brought up the rear they were soon in the open air  now perkins exclaimed you hook it gents as fast as you can me and bill will keep the door for a minute the boys dashed off and after making at full speed into the westminster bridge road slackened their pace and walked quietly back to deans yard they were in high glee over their adventure which all agreed had been a splendid lark and was the more satisfactory as all had escaped without any mark which would testify against them it was still early and they had for two hours to walk the streets until the whistle of the fag at the window told them that all were in bed and quiet and they might safely make their entry this was effected without noise the bolts were slipped into their places again and with their shoes in their hands the party went noiselessly up to their rooms     illustration  chapter v  a terrible accusation   two days later as frank was about to start for the cricketfield a small boy whom he recognised as a son of perkins stopped him  father wants to speak to you perticular mr norris  all right young un i will go round there at once  wondering what perkins could have to say to him frank took his way to the publichouse  what is it perkins he asked the prizefighter as the latter let him into his private parlour  well sir theres a rumpus over this business as we had the other night  how a rumpus perkins  well sir there was a tall redhaired chapleastways i hear as hes tall and redheaded and is a tailor by trade his name is suggs it seems as how he got knocked down in the scrummage and was so bad that the police who came up after you left took him to hospital they brought him round all right but it seems as how the bridge of his nose was broke and it will be flat to his face for the rest of his life now i fancy thats a piece of your handiwork mr norris i saw jist such a chap as that go down when you hit him and i thought to myself at the time what a onener it was  yes i did knock down just such a fellow frank said and i am sorry i hit him so hard i was afraid at the time that i hurt him  you should not let out from the shoulder in that sort of way mr norris the pugilist said shaking his head you hit like the kick of a horse and you never know what maynt come of them sort of blows no sir halfarmed hitting is the thing for a general row it hurts just as much and is just as good for closing up an eye but it dont do no general damage so to speak now sir theres a row over the business in course i holds my tongue but they says as four of the party was young uns and they guessed as they was gents now they puts things together and have found out as i gives lessons to some of you westminster gents and they guesses as some of you was with me now as i tells them what can they do they was the first to begin it and we was only standing on selfdefence thats the way i puts it no magistrate would look at the charge for a minute it stands to reason that nine men did not attack four or five hundred they must have been attacking us thats clear to any one and if it was me i should not care the snap of a finger about itthats what i tells the redhaired tailor when he came here with two of his pals this morning we has as much right to our opinions as you have you attacks us says i and we gives you pepper thats all about it his beautys spoilt for life says one of his mates he never had no beauty to spoil says i by the look of im so we got to words they was westminster boys says he thats all you knows about it says i i will go to their masters says he and report the case and show him my nose says he you have got no case to report says i and no nose to show we will see about that says he i aint going to be made an object for the rest of my life for nothing  so we goes on arguing but at last he lets out that if i bring him a tenner in the course of the week he will shut up i aint allowed of course mr norris that any of you young gents had a hand in the fray quite the contrary but he has got it into his head that it is so and he has made up his mind that he will go to the master i dont think it likely that they could spot you for they could hardly have got a fair look at your faces  no frank said i dont suppose they would recognise any of us but the first thing litter would do would be to ask us if any of us were concerned in the affair its a beastly nuisance for just now i happen to be completely cleaned out and i am sure i do not know where i could get ten pounds from  if it had been any other time i could have helped you mr norris but i paid my brewers only last night and i aint got two quid in the house but i might manage to get it for you by the end of the week if there aint no other way but my advice to you would be let the redhaired man go to the master if you keep your own counsel no one can swear it out against you  no i wont do that perkins frank said its known in the house besides if i am asked i must say its me thank you for your offer i will see you again in a day or two  frank walked back to his boardinghouse moody and dejected harris was in his room working frank told him what had happened  this is a bad business indeed harris said by jove if it comes out litter would expel the four of us what is to be done i am sure i dont know  i dont see where i am to get ten pounds i have only got fifteen shillings now  i have only seven and sixpence harris said i have paid shottens bill for last term this week and i know that travers and james have not much more than i have we might get something on our watches but they are all silver and i dont suppose we could get more than a pound apiece for them but still thats something and with our united silver would make up six pounds  i could get a pound or two from my cousin frank said fred always seems to be well supplied with money  because he never spends any harris said i am mistaken if barkley will lend you anything  oh he will lend it if hes got it but harris turned out to be right after the next school frank laid the case before his cousin who listened in silence to the story  i am very sorry frank he said when he had finished but i am entirely out of money at present  i thought you always had money frank said shortly  not always fred replied quietly as you know i am fond of books and last week i paid my bill for that edition of shakespeare that you were admiring  fred barkley had indeed a library of books of which he was very proud and which was worth more than all those belonging to the rest of the boys up college together frank was too proud to suggest that his cousin could if he chose easily raise the amount required on a few of his favourites and left the room without saying a word  fred barkley did not continue the work upon which he was engaged after his cousin had left the room but sat looking fixedly at the papers before him  this is a grand opportunity he muttered to himself and i should be a fool if i let it slip the question is how is it best to be managed i should be an idiot indeed if i cannot put a spoke into master franks wheel somehow  the next day the sixth form as usual went into the library to do their construing dr litter according to his usual custom walked up and down hearing them and asking questions the form sitting at their desks which ran round the room the doctor was a fidgety man and was always either twirling his watchchain or eyeglass or rattling the keys knife and other articles in his trousers pockets being perfectly conscious of the habit he often emptied the contents of his pocket on to the table before starting to walk about the room and this he did on the present occasion  as often happened he was called from the room in the course of the lesson and ordering the boys to get up twenty additional lines of their greek play in his absence he left the room and did not return for half an hour while he was away the boys moved freely about some to consult each others lexicons others to chat when dr litter returned the lesson was finished and the boys went back to the great schoolroom  on the following morning frank norris received a letter on his opening it he found to his astonishment that it contained only a banknote for ten pounds with the words from a friend frank was simply astounded  who on earth could have sent him the exact sum of which he stood in need he at once told his three friends what had occurred and they were as much astonished as himself all agreed that it was a perfect godsend though how any one could have got to know of his necessity for ten pounds at this special time none could imagine as this was as far as they were aware known only to themselves and fred barkley frank at once concluded that his cousin must have sent him the money and immediately sent up college and asked him to come to his room fred soon came up and frank at once proceeded to thank him for his gift fred however appeared as surprised as himself and disclaimed any knowledge whatever of the note  i told you frank he said reproachfully that i had no money do you think that if i had it i would not have given it to you at once instead of sending it in that roundabout manner do you know the handwriting that may afford you some clue  no frank said the name and address as well as the words within are done in printing characters so that it is impossible to say who wrote them well it is an extraordinary business and i can only say that i am extremely thankful to the good fairy who has got me out of the scrape  frank felt indeed relieved he felt sure that the headmaster would consider such an escapade by boys of the sixth form an unforgivable crime and that expulsion would follow discovery and knowing the hot temper of his uncle he feared that the latter would view the matter in the most serious light it was therefore with a light heart that he went across to the black dog and placed the note in the hands of perkins merely saying that he was glad to say that he had been able to get the money to satisfy the redhaired tailor for his loss of beauty  it goes agin my heart to give it to him mr norris but in course if you decide not to face it out theres nothing for it i am glad you have got the money together  a week later one of the monitors informed frank that the headmaster wished to see him in the library wondering at this unusual order frank at once repaired there dr litter was sitting at his table and he raised his eyes gravely as frank entered  norris he said i have been shocked at what has happened more than at anything which has occurred to me during my headmastership of westminster i may tell you that everything is discovered now i leave it to you to make a full and frank confession  frank was thunderstruck so in some way his breaking out of bounds had become known to the headmaster the tailor must have turned traitor and peached after having received his money  for a minute he stood silent and confounded while dr litter looked at him gravely  i acknowledge sir frank began that i broke out of bounds to go to a chartist meeting and that i got into a row there i am very sorry now but i really meant no harm by it it was a foolish lark  and is that all you have to confess dr litter said quietly  yes sir frank said in surprise i dont know that theres anything else for me to say  you have not come to the most serious part of it yet the doctor said  i dont know what you mean sir frank said more and more astonished  you hurt him and very seriously  yes sir i broke a mans nose in the fight but i did it in selfdefence  and you paid him ten pounds to prevent his coming to me the doctor said  i acknowledge that i did so but i dont see there was any harm in that  and where did you get the ten pounds from the doctor asked slowly  it was sent to me in an envelope frank replied  and who sent it to you  i dont know sir  norris the doctor said sternly you stole that note from my table  frank stepped back as if struck the blood left his face and he stood deadly pale  stole it he repeated in a low wondering tone  yes the doctor repeated stole it from my table when i left the room  it is a lie frank exclaimed in a burst of passion it is a lie sir whoever said it  without replying to the outburst the doctor touched a bell which stood on the table and a junior waiting outside entered  tell mr wire and mr richards i wish to speak to them  not a word was spoken in the library until the undermasters entered a thousand thoughts passed rapidly through franks brain he was bewildered and almost stupefied by this sudden charge and yet he felt how difficult it would be to clear himself from it the undermaster and franks housemaster entered  i have sent for you gentlemen on a most painful business dr litter said i mentioned to you mr wire a week since that i had lost a tenpound note i placed it on the table here during the morning lesson with my keys and pencil i was called out of the room for half an hour when school was over i put the things back in my pocket but it was not until the afternoon that i missed the note thinking it over i could not recall taking it up with the other things from the table but of this i could not be positively certain as i told you i could not for a moment believe that any of the boys of my form could have taken it and i could only suppose that i had dropped it between the school and my house  as it happened i had only got the note the day before from my bankers and had therefore no difficulty in obtaining the number i gave notice at the bank of england at once that the note had been lost and requested them to obtain the name and address of the presenter should it be brought in it was presented yesterday by a man who after being questioned said he was a tailor living in bermondsey as i was determined to follow the matter up i saw the superintendent of police and a policeman was sent across to him the man said that he had been seriously injured by one of my boys at a low meeting held at some place in the new cut and that the ten pounds had been given him as compensation he having threatened to come and complain to me  he was ignorant of the name of the boy but he had received the note from a prizefighter named perkins who keeps a low publichouse down at millbank i sent a note to the man requesting him to be good enough to call upon me this morning early he did so i told him that i had heard that he had paid to that man ten pounds as compensation for an injury which he had received from one of my boys and i asked him from whom he had received it  he told me that nothing whatever would have induced him to tell but as he knew the young gent would himself confess the instant the question was put for he had told him he should do so did it come to my ears there was no motive in his keeping silence and it was mr norris who had given it to him on inquiry i find that the meeting in question was held between halfpast nine and eleven therefore to have been present norris must have broken out of bounds and got into the boardinghouse at night  this in itself would be a very grave offence but it is as nothing by the side of the other i am most reluctantly obliged to admit that i can come to but one conclusion norris having broken bounds and got into a disgraceful fray was afraid that the matter would come to my ears it was absolutely necessary for him to procure ten pounds to buy the silence of this man my own very culpable carelessness which i most deeply regret left the note on the table and the temptation was too much for him  i have questioned him how he got it if he had said that he had picked it up in the yard and not knowing to whom it belonged had very improperly without making inquiry devoted it to the purpose of silencing this man i should have gladly believed himfor hitherto he has stood high in my estimation and i should certainly have considered him incapable of an act of theft but he tells me that it was sent to him in an envelope by whom he does not know and this absurd story is to my mind a clear proof that he must have stolen it from the table  the two masters had at first looked at frank with incredulous surprise but as the narrative continued and the proofs appeared to accumulate the expression changed and they regarded him with horror not unmixed with pity for a minute there was silence then mr richards said  strong as the proofs seem to be sir i can hardly believe in the possibility of norris having behaved in this way he has always been a particularly straightforward honest and honourable lad there is not a boy in the house of whom i would so absolutely have disbelieved this tale that he did send this note to the man there can by his own confession be no doubt but i still cannot believe that he stole it come now norris you have got into a terrible scrape but dont make matters worse tell us frankly the truth about it  i have told the truth frank said in a low and unnatural voice i received the note in an envelope here it is sir with as you see only the words from a friend i showed it when i had got it to harris travers james and barkley and had not the remotest idea who it came from  to whom had you mentioned the need you had of ten pounds mr wire asked  no one knew it except those four and perkins not a soul  the three masters looked even more grave the four boys were sent for one by one and were asked if they had mentioned to any one the need which frank had of ten pounds but all declared they had spoken to no one on the subject  he showed you the envelope containing the note he received what did you think about it  it seemed a curious thing sir harris said but none of us could account for it  i am accused frank said in a harsh voice of having stolen that note from dr litters table  for the moment the four boys stood in silent astonishment  nonsense frank harris burst out impetuously we know you better than that old fellow if an angel from heaven came down and told me you were a thief i would not believe him and harris seized his friends hand and wrung it warmly an example followed by his three companions  hitherto franks face had been hard and set but he broke down now and the tears streamed down his cheeks  you can go now dr litter said and when the door closed upon them he continued i would give much very much norris to be able to believe in your innocence but i cannot see a possibility of it the evidence to my mind is overwhelming i acquit you of any idea of deliberate theft you were pressed and afraid of exposure and the temptation offered by the note was too strong for you you thought you saw a way of escape and to account to your comrades for the possession of the money you put it in an envelope and posted it directed to yourself even now if you will confess the truth i will send you home privately and avoid public expulsion and disgrace in consideration of the good character you have always hitherto borne if not i must at once lay the whole facts before your uncle and guardian and tomorrow you will be publicly expelled  i have nothing to say sir frank said quietly overwhelming as the proof appears against me i have spoken the simple truth and i swear that i never saw that note until i took it from the envelope  go to your room sir dr litter said with indignation this continued denial is almost worse than the offence  without a word frank rose and left the library  this is indeed a shocking business mr wire said as he followed dr litter to the schoolroom  i cannot credit it mr richards put in i know him so well that absolutely conclusive as i allow the evidence to be i still hesitate to believe him to be guilty  after school was over fred barkley ran up to his cousins room  my dear frank he exclaimed we are ordered not to communicate with you but i could not help running in to tell you that every one believes you to be innocent  i hardly know whether i believe it myself frank said bitterly but you can do something for me fred i have written a line to my uncle will you post it for me at once  certainly fred replied but there is some one coming upstairs so i must be off he took the letter and was gone it contained only a few words  my dear uncleif you believe me innocent of this hideous charge which i swear to you i am not guilty of send me one line by hand when you get this as long as i know that you have faith in me i can face it out  the afternoon passed slowly to the prisoner his uncle would get the letter between three and four and he might have an answer half an hour afterwards hour after hour passed and except the servant who brought up his tea no one came near him he reasoned to himself that his uncle might be out at eight oclock he heard a noise on the stairs a number of feet approached his room and then the door opened and the whole of the boys in the boardinghouse poured in  norris old fellow harris said we could stop away no longer and in spite of orders we have come to see you i beg to tell you in the name of the whole house and i may say the whole school that not a boy here believes you to be guilty how the note came into your hands we dont know and we dont care but we are certain you did not take it  no no was shouted in a chorus  so keep up your spirits old fellow harris said it will come right sooner or later  for some time frank was unable to speak  thank you all he said at last in a choking voice it is a consolation to me indeed to know that my old friends still believe in me but till my innocence is proved i shall never be able to look the world in the face again  come boys this will not do a voice at the door said harris you elder boys ought to set a better example to the younger ones i told you that the doctors orders were positive that no one was to communicate with norris  i cant help it sir harris said we all felt we couldnt go to bed tonight without telling norris that we knew he was innocent  well well you must go downstairs nownot unkindly you must not stay a minute longer there was a chorus of good night norris good night old fellow keep up your pluck and various other encouraging expressions and the party filed out of the door mr richards waited to see the last out and then left frank to his thoughts  not till ten oclock did frank give up all hope of hearing from his uncle then he felt he had been condemned  all my schoolfellows acquit me and my uncle who should know me better than any of them condemns me i wonder what alice said i dont believe she would believe me guilty if all the world told her  at this moment the door opened quietly again and fred barkley entered frank leapt to his feet to see if he was the bearer of a letter  fred shook his head in answer to the unasked question i have slipped out of college to see you frank and richards has given me leave to come up i have no news i only came to see what you were going to do  you posted the letter to my uncle fred he asked  yes at once he replied  frank was silent  what do you mean to do fred went on  do frank asked what do you mean  why i suppose you dont mean to stop here until tomorrow  i dont know frank replied i had not thought about it  i shouldnt if i were in your place it would be a fearful business there hasnt been a boy expelled from westminster for the last thirty years i shouldnt stop for it if i were you  but what am i to do where am i to go said frank listlessly  do said fred why go abroad to be sure i should go out to california or australia or somewhere and in time this will be all forgotten perhaps it will turn out who sent that money it is not as if facing it out would do any good for you can prove nothing every one who knows you believes you innocent  uncle harry doesnt frank said bitterly or he would have sent an answer to my letter  ah well you know what he is fred said how passionate and hasty he is but after a time he will think as we all do never fear look here i thought that you would want some money so have been round to gingers and have sold all my books the old beggar would not give me more than twenty pounds for them though i have paid him more than double that besides what i have bought from others however here are the twenty pounds at your service if you like to take them  frank remained irresolute for a moment then the thought of the terrible scene in the schoolroom and of the tones in which the doctor would pronounce his expulsion overcame him  i may as well go before as after for i could not go home after that thank you fred with all my heart i will take your money and advice and if i get a rich man i will pay you again are the fellows in bed  yes fred replied and richards is in his study so you can go down with me and slip out easy enough  tell the others frank said that i went because i could not face the scene tomorrow and that i hope some day to return and prove my innocence  without another word he opened his drawers packed some clothes in a small portmanteau put on his peajacket and the low cap he had worn in his unfortunate expedition to the new cut then he stole softly downstairs with fred and sallied out into the night air     illustration  chapter vi  at new orleans   frank norris took his way eastward after leaving westminster he slept at a small hotel in the city and at daybreak walked on to the docks he was careless where he went so that it was out of england but he was determined if possible to work his passage so as to leave the sum of money in his pocket untouched until he got to his destination he went on board a number of ships and asked the captains if they wanted hands but on his acknowledgment that he had never been at sea none of them would ship him for the outward voyage only at last he paused before a fine ship the mississippi a printed placard on the wharf beside her mentioned that the wellknown and favourite clipper would sail for new orleans on that day he walked on board and went up to the captain who was talking to the first mate while the latter was superintending the getting of cargo on board  do you want a hand sir  well that depends the captain said i am still two or three hands short but they have promised to send me them this morning are you a sailor  no sir but i can row and sail an open boat and am ready to make myself useful i want to work my passage out  you look an active young fellow the captain said but i dont care about taking a landsman only for the voyage out i should have to ship another hand in your place at new orleans and probably have to pay more wages there than i could get one for here still likely enough they may send me down at the last moment two or three hands who know no more about it than you do and may not be half so willing to learn as i should judge you to be what do you say ephraim shall we take him  he looks a likely sort the mate said  very well then its agreed you can take off your coat and fall to work at once i will send down word to the office that i have shipped you frank stripped off his coat and waistcoat and stowed them with his portmanteau out of the way and then set to work with a will the whiteness of his shirt and his general appearance exciting some jeering comments among the other men at work but the activity and strength which he showed soon astonished and silenced them  by one oclock the last bale of cargo was stowed and the hatches put on the landsmen who had been employed went on shore and frank went forward to the forecastle with the men to dinner  not the sort of grub you have been accustomed to lad one of the men said  i have eaten worse frank said carelessly and dont care if i never eat better how long do you suppose we shall be before we get to new orleans  it all depends upon the wind the sailor answered may be a month may be three are you going to leave us there  yes frank said i am only working my passage out  its a roughish place is new orleans the sailor said the sort of place where you want to have a knife or pistol ready at hand lor i have seen some rum doings there its a word and a blow i can tell ye  ah well frank laughed i suppose i shall do as well as the rest  the voice of the mate was now heard calling to all hands to prepare to cast off the men had hurried through their dinner for they knew that the time allowed them would be short and began casting off hawsers coiling down ropes and preparing for a start the bell was ringing and the friends of the passengers were saying goodbye the capstan was manned and the vessel moved slowly away from the quay  five minutes later she was at the dock gates these swung open and the vessel slowly made her way through them and was soon in the river  as the men ran aloft to loosen the sails frank placed himself next to the sailor who had spoken to him at dinner and followed him up the shrouds and imitating his actions he was soon out on the yard hauling away with the others when the sails were all set he returned below  wall done youngster the mate said i reckon you are about as spry for a green hand as any i have come across i had my eye on you and youll do you go on like that and you will make a firstrate hand afore long  there was plenty of work to do as they went down the river the sails had to be braced round as the wind took them on different sides in the winding reaches the decks were sluiced down to get rid of the first coat of dirt which they had acquired in the docks ropes had to be coiled and tidied up and the many articles lying loosely about the deck to be put in their places and lashed in readiness for sea work the tide met them just as it was getting dark and as the wind dropped and was not sufficiently strong to carry the ship against it the anchor was dropped a few miles below gravesend  the men were divided into two watches but all were told that with the exception of two stationed as an anchor watch they could turn in till tide turned frank threw himself at once into the bunk which had been allotted to him he had not closed an eye the night before and was worn out by emotion and fatigue and scarcely had he lain down than he was sound asleep he had been placed in the starboard watch and slept till he was roughly shaken at four oclock in the morning  get up mate your watch is called  frank leapt out and made his way on deck the vessel had been now three hours under weigh she had passed the nore whose light shone brightly over the stern  the wind is freshening a bit one of the men said we shall be out round the foreland by dinnertime  the voyage was an uneventful one frank escaped the first fight in which newcomers generally have to take part before they settle down in their new sphere he was thoroughly goodtempered and fully a match for any of his messmates in chaff and he soon became a favourite in the focastle he was always ready to take his share of the work and was soon as much at home on the yards as the rest the change and the newness of the life were very good for him he was never alone and had no time to think or brood over his troubles and he was almost sorry when the end of the voyage approached  not a livelylooking shore the mate said to him as he leaned against the bulwark looking at the low banks of the river a few miles below new orleans no even an american may confess that there aint much beauty about this river its a great river and a mighty useful one but it aint beautiful now what are you thinking of doing when you get ashore  i was thinking to begin by getting employment on board a boat of some sort what i shall do afterwards of course i do not know but if i can earn my living on the water for a few months till i have time to look round and see what is best to be done i shall be well satisfied i have got a few pounds but i dont want to touch them they will come in useful if i want to move or to buy a horse or anything of that sort  you will do the mate said you have shown yourself a rightdown sharp fellow on board this ship and i expect you will make your way whatever you try a hand at i have taken a fancy to you and should be glad to do you a good turn if i can i have been in and out of this port for some years and know orleans pretty tidy and i can tell you that there aint a port on this side of the water or the other where a fellow can be put out of the way more promptly than here there are parts of new orleans which i tell you are a sort of hell on earth  there are places you couldnt go into without some one picking a quarrel with you afore you have been in there two minutes and a quarrel here means knives out afore you have time to think on the other hand orleans is a place where a steady industrious fellow with his head screwed on right has a good chance of getting on the trade up the river is immense and will be far greater than it is now and theres pretty well a continent to the west with openings of all sorts land and cattle houses and mining and trade with mexico but i dont see as you can do better than to follow out your own idea  i know a score of men here who own boats trading up the river and the first time i go ashore i will take you with me and put you in good hands the rate of pay aint high for its looked on as easy work still a few months at it will open your eyes and put you into the ways of the country and once at home i tell you theres money to be made on the river heaps of it and when its seen that you are steady and willing and cute you will find plenty who will give you a helping hand theres no greater place for loafers than new orleans and a chap who will really work will soon make his mark  frank warmly thanked the mate for his offer the moment the ship cast anchor off the town a crowd of negroes came on board and unloaded her and the crew had comparatively little to do the three or four passengers who had come out in her went on shore at once but it was not until the third afternoon after her arrival that the mate was able to leave the ship  now lad he said to frank jump into the boat along with me and i will see if i cant put you into the groove  keeping along the wharves for some distance the mate presently entered a small wooden office telling frank to wait outside  on entering he accosted the only occupant of the place a man of some forty years of age who was dressed entirely in white and was sitting smoking a huge cigar with his chair tilted back and his feet on the table  how are you ephraim he said as the mate entered i saw your ship had arrived had a good voyage  firstclass the mate replied not very fast but quiet and comfortable and he took a cigar from an open box on the table and lighted it i havent come round for a talk with you now i have only just come ashore for the first time but i wanted to speak to you about a young chap as came out with us he has worked his passage out and is about the smartest young fellow i ever shipped and has the makings of a firstclass seaman in him but he doesnt care about stopping at sea hes of good family in the old country as one can easily see i expect he has got into some scrape and has had to make a bolt of it however thats no business of mine hes as strong as a horse and as active as a squirrel he can handle an oar and sail a boat i didnt like the thought of his landing here and getting into bad hands so i thought i would come straight to you he said what he wanted to do was to work on the river for a few months at any rate until he got to know the place now i know you have a dozen tugs and a score of barges and i thought you might set him on at once he would make a good second hand on one of your large boats if its but to oblige me i wish you would put him on board one with a sober steady chap of a decent kind as soon as he gets to know the work and the river i will guarantee that he will be fit to take charge himself  thats easy enough done ephraim the trader replied all except finding the sober and steady decent man to put him under however i will do my best have you got him here  yes he is outside ephraim said and rising he went to the door and called frank in this is the hand i was speaking to you about mr willcox  well young man the trader said i hear you want a berth on board a tug or flat which would you rather have  i would prefer to be on a flatat any rate for a time sir frank said i am a pretty good hand at sailing or rowing but i dont know anything about steamboats  theres not much to learn in that the trader said the work is simply to keep the decks clean to help to load and unload at each landingplace and to pole off in shallows however i will put you on board a flat the wages to begin with will be twenty dollars a month and your keep if that will suit you  that will do sir very well frank said when shall i come to work  if you come here this time tomorrow you can go aboard at once one of the flats will go up the first thing in the morning  thank you sir i will be here i am greatly obliged to you mr alderson for your kind recommendation of me  i am glad to have put you into a berth the mate said now i should recommend you to get on board again soon  frank strolled about the wharves for an hour or two and then went on board before going on shore the following day the captain gave him a certificate saying that he had sailed in the mississippi and was a good willing and reliable hand  illustration franks visit to mr hiram littles office  you may not intend to go to sea again but if you should this will get you a better berth than if you had applied as a landsman i am very pleased with your conduct on board the ship and i am only sorry you are leaving us i think its a pity you dont stick to it for it is clear that you are well educated and would be able to pass as a mate as soon as you had been the requisite time at sea however you can fall back on that if you dont get on as well as you expect on shore  the mate said goodbye to him warmly  your employer is one of the very best in the place said he you must not suppose he is in a small way because you see him in that little office he is one of the largest tug and flat owners in new orleans he keeps his eye on his men and will push you forward if he sees you deserve it he has the name of having the best of captains on the river and of being one of the best and most liberal of employers but you must not expect much in flat life you will find the men rough as well as the work  i shant mind that frank said cheerfully our own bargemen on the thames are not the most polished of men  and lad the mate added i should advise you to hand over any money you may have with you to mr willcox the less money you have in your pockets the better you have no occasion for it on the river and there are loafers hanging about at every landing who would think nothing of knocking a man on the head if they thought he had got fifty dollars in his pocket  frank promised to take his advice and with a hearty farewell to the mate and a cordial one to his late shipmates he put his portmanteau in the boat and was rowed ashore  oh here you are mr willcox said as he entered just give a call to that man you see outside  before doing so frank handed over his twenty sovereigns to the trader asking him to keep them for him and then went to the door on a log close by a tall gaunt man was sitting smoking a short pipe frank asked him to step in  hiram the trader said this is the young britisher who is going as your second hand i have good accounts of him as a sailor so you wont have to teach him that part of the business of course he is new to the river and its ways  i will put him through the man said and will teach him as much as i knows myself if he cares to learn  there is no one knows the river better hiram and as you know i would have given you the command of a steamer long ago if you would have taken it  no sir the man said emphatically not for hiram little i have been on board a flat all my days and am not going to be hurried along in one of them puffing things they have their uses i am ready enough to allow when the current is swift and the wind light i am glad enough of a cast now and then but to be always in a bustle and flurry is more than i could stand come along youngster with your sack the boat is a quarter of a mile down  taking up his portmanteau frank followed his conductor who with long strides led the way along the wharf not a word was spoken till they reached the side of the boat this was not a flat such as now are in general use but a large boat some forty feet in length by fourteen wide almost flatbottomed and capable of carrying a cargo of eight or ten tons of goods in the stern was a little cabin some eight feet long for the captain and his mate in front was a similar structure for the four negroes who formed the crew  she carried one mast with a large lugsail she had four sweeps but these were seldom used when the wind was fair she ran before it when it was foul the mast was lowered if it fell calm when they were coming down the stream they drifted with it if when going up they either anchored or poled her along in the back waters close inshore or made their way up the numerous channels where the stream flowed sluggishly or tied on behind a tug if one happened to come along  their principal work was to carry up supplies to the various plantations along the banks to trade with the villages and to bring down produce to new orleans for the stoppingplaces of the steamers were at wide distances apart and the number of steamers themselves very small in comparison with those now afloat on the great river at times they made longer journeys going up as far as st louis but in that case they were generally as frank afterwards learned towed up the whole distance  hi pete shove that plank ashore hiram shouted and a negro at once showed his head above a scuttle in the bow of the boat and then emerging pushed a plank across the fifteen feet of water which intervened between the flat and the wharf  thats your first lesson young man hiram said never on no account lay your craft close alongside thars river thieves at these landings as would empty half the cargo if you left the boat for ten minutes if they could step aboard and these niggers are always asleep the minute after you take your eyes off them so whether you have got anything aboard or not stick to the rule and moor her a bit off the wharf its only the trouble of dropping the grapnel over on the outside in addition to the hawser ashore and then theres never no trouble when you get back and have to report as how you have lost some of the bales it aint as how we carry up many things as would pay for taking soft goods for the stores up the river mostly goes by steamer but them as aint hurried and likes to keep their dollars in their pockets has their goods up by flats i have got ten hogsheads of sugar twentyfour crates of hardware some barrels of molasses and forty casks of spirits on board eighty kegs of nails and a ton or two of rice and flour we reckon to go up light and i dont care to have the flat more nor halffull for when the rivers low and the wind light the less we have on board the better now pete lets have tea as soon as may be  by this time they had entered the cabin at the stern of the boat it was only about five feet high but was large and roomy and frank saw with pleasure that it was neat and clean and was an abode infinitely preferable to the forecastle of the mississippi  now lad thats your side and this is mine thats your bunk i am given to tidy ways having all my life lived in small places and i hope as you will fall into my ways i keeps the cabin tidy myself and pete never comes aft here except to bring the food and take it away again i cant abear niggers messing about a place victuals of all sorts is provided you can do as you like about liquor i keeps a keg of rum on board and i likes my glass at night if you likes to join me at that you can pay for half the keg it has not been broached yet if you want to drink more nor two glasses a night ye had best get in yer own stock if ye dont want to touch it at all just leave it  frank said he liked a glass of grog at night and should be glad to join in the cask and that he would do his best to keep his side of the cabin as tidy as the other in a few minutes the negro brought in the meal which consisted of a steak fried with onions followed by a large bowl of oatmeal with a jug of molasses and the whole was washed down with tea  the stream does not seem to run very rapidly frank said as he and his companion having lit their pipes sat down on the deck above  it varies hiram replied sometimes its sluggish as you see it here sometimes it runs like a millstream the art of sailing here is to know the river for what with its back currents and its eddies its channels behind islands and its sandbanks one who knows it can manage to make his way up while one who didnt know would be drifting backward instead of getting forward thats what you have got to learn fortunately the wind generally blows up the stream when it dont its a case of down anchor there are places where one can hardly get along unless the wind happens to be unusually strong and there i generally get a tow the boss has got about twenty steamers on the river so we dont generally have to wait many hours before one comes along the tugs is gradually doing away with sailing boats and in time there wont be many of our kind of craft left but they are useful you see for small places where the steamers dont stop and for the rivers which run into the mississippi  the next morning at daybreak the sail was hoisted the hawsers thrown off from the shore and the flat made her way up the river frank was surprised to see how fast she sailed although the wind was but light the work was easy for the wind was steady and they seldom sailed at night the wind generally dropping at sundown they touched at numerous little settlements and gradually got rid of the cargo with which they had started  sometimes they left the main river and sailed for many miles by narrow channels where the current for the most part was almost imperceptible they were more than a month from the time they started before they reached the spot at which they were to take in the cargo for their return voyage the flat was then loaded up with grain which was put in in bulk and covered with tarpaulin the boat was now laden down nearly to the waters edge  the downward voyage differed widely from that up the river the sail was now seldom used and instead of skirting the shores they kept in midchannel from time to time directing the boats course by the use of the sweeps the moon was nearly full when they started and they continued their voyage by night as well as day hiram and frank took it by turns to be on watch but the former was seldom down below except on the rare occasions when the river was free from shoals  frank had by this time learned by the ripples on the water to detect the shallows and could direct the course without assistance but as soon as the splash of oars was heard on the water hiram was sure to appear on deck however short the time since he had retired to rest  you are seeing the river at its best he was saying one day it is about halffull now when the waters low the channel where we can pass loaded is often only fifty yards wide with the water running through it like a sluice when the water is in flood there is no fear of shoals but you have got to look about for it is full of floating trees and logs when these get stuck we call them snags and if you were to run on one of them the chances are it would knock a hole as big as a cask in her bottom and down you would go in two or three minutes     illustration  chapter vii  on the mississippi   we are going to have a change of weather i reckon hiram said one afternoon as they were drifting down the stream during their second voyage you have been lucky since we started but we are going to have a change at last and i can tell you when it blows here its a caution they have been having a lot of rain up the country for the river has been rising regular for the last ten days we had best make fast for the night and the sooner we does it the better for the wind is getting up fast and the rain is just agoing to begin  in a quarter of an hour the boat was moored to a great tree at the lower end of an island  we shall be snug here he said and out of the way of the drift that will be coming down presently you can turn in and take a long spell of sleep tonight for sometimes those storms last for days when they come on this time of year and you will see there will be a sea on that the boat could hardly live in i wish we had stopped two hours ago there was a creek where we could have run her in and been snug all through it but i didnt think it was coming up so quick and its too far on to the next place to risk it however i expect we shall do very well here  in another halfhour the gale burst upon them furiously and frank congratulated himself that the boat was snugly moored the thick muddy water of the river was speedily lashed into angry waves the rain came down in torrents and although the lefthand bank was but a quarter of a mile distant it was soon lost to view frank was glad to leave the deck and crawl into the little cabin and sit down to a hot meal which the negro cook had prepared  better here than outside my lad hiram said i can go as wet as any man if need be but i like to keep a dry jacket when i can the wind is just howling outside i reckon this is going to be a bigger storm nor ordinary and i have seen some biggish storms on the mississippi too i have had some narrer escapes of it i can tell you special in the days before there was nary a tug on the river and we had to row or pole all the way up besides there aint so many trees brought down as there used to be in a flood seeing as the country is getting more and more cleared every day  i reckon the time will come when you will be able to go up either the mississippi or missouri to the upper waters without seeing a tree drifting down and when there wont be a snag in their beds i mind the time when the snags were ten times worse than they is now i mind once we ran on one of the darned things in pretty nigh as wild a night as this is going to be i had six hands along with me and we wanted to get down cause we knew the old man would have a cargo ready for us and we wanted a run of a day or two on shore at orleans before we started up again so we held on the wind was higher than we reckoned on and we was just saying we should have done better to tie up when there was a crash i thought at first that she would have gone over with the shock but she didntnot that it would have made much odds for there was a snag through her bottom and the water pouring in like a sluice it was darkish but we could make out there was some trees a boatslength or two ahead which had been caught as they rolled down by another snag and hung there the boat didnt float more than a minute after she struck and then we were all in the river those who couldnt swim gripping hold of the oars and poles half a minute and we were all clinging to the boughs and hoisting ourselves as well as might be clear of the water  i tell you lad that was a night it wasnt that we was drenched to the skin with the rain pouring down and the wind cutting through usthat kind of thing comes natural to a boatmanbut it was the oncertainty of the thing the trees moved and swayed with the waves and current the flood we knew was rising still and any moment they might break away from the snag and go whirling along over and over down the river even if they didnt break away of theirselves another tree might drive down on us and if it did the chances was strong as the hull affair would break loose  all that night and all next day we hung on and then the wind went down a bit and a nigger who had made us out from the shore came off in a dugout and took us ashore in two trips that war a close shave the wind was northerly and bitter cold and i dont believe as we could have hung on another night more nor that next morning when we turned out from the niggers hut to have a look round there wasnt no sign of them thar trees they had just gone down the river in the night yes i have had a good many narrow shaves of it but i do think as that war the narrowest  well i am heartily glad frank said that we are tied safely up out of the way of floating trees snags or anything of the kind i always like hearing the wind when i am snug and i shall sleep sound knowing that i am not going to hear your shout of watch on deck in my ear  in spite of the howling of the gale frank slept soundly but he could scarcely believe that it was broad daylight when he awoke the light was dim and leaden and when he went out from the cabin he was startled at the aspect of the river the waves had risen until it resembled an angry sea the yellow masses of water being tipped with foam the clouds hung so low that they almost touched the top of the trees the rain was still falling and the drops almost hurt from the violence with which they were driven by the wind the river had risen considerably during the night and the lower end of the island was already submerged boughs of trees and driftwood were hurrying along with the stream and more than one great tree passed now lifting an arm high in the air now almost hidden in the waves as it turned over and over in its rapid course frank felt glad indeed that the boat lay in comparatively sheltered waters though even here the swell caused her at times to roll violently  what do you think of it lad hiram who had risen some time before frank asked  it is a wonderfully wild scene frank said enthusiastically a grand scene i should not have had an idea that such a sea could have got up on any river look at that great tree rolling down it looks as if it was wrestling for life  the wrestle is over lad there aint no more life for that tree it will just drift along till it either catches on a sandbank and settles down as a snag or it will drift down to the mouth of the mississippi and may be help to choke up some of the shallow channels or it may chance to strike the deep channel and go away right out into the gulf of florida and then the barnacles will get hold of it and it will drift and drift till at last it will get heavier than the water and then down it will go to the bottom and lie there till there aint no more left of it no lad there aint no more life for that tree  may be it will wash ashore near the city or some plantation frank said and be hauled up and cut into timber or perhaps into firewood after all the useful life of a tree begins with its fall  right you are lad yes that might happen and i am glad you put it in my mind for somehow i have always had a sorter pity for a tree when i see it sweeping down in a flood like this somehow its like looking at a drowned man but as you say theres a chance of its getting through it and coming to be of use after all and what can a tree wish better than that but we had best be hauling the boat up to the tree and shifting the rope up the trunk a bit its just level with the water now and was nigh eight feet above when we tied it yesterday i tell you if this goes on there will be some big floods for it will try the levees and if they go there aint no saying what damage may be done in the plantations  all day the wind blew with unabated fury and when evening came on frank thought that it was increasing rather than diminishing in force  lets have a glass of grog and tumble in my lad hiram said it gives one the dismals to listen to the wind they had scarcely wrapped themselves in their blankets when the boat swayed as if struck by an even stronger blast than usual then there was a sudden crash which rose even above the howling of the gale  whats that frank exclaimed sitting up  its the tree hiram began but while the words were in his mouth there was a shock and a crash the roof of the little cabin was stove in and the boat heeled over until they thought it was going to capsize frank was thrown on to the floor with the violence of the shock but speedily gained his feet  what has happened he exclaimed  the tree has gone hiram said i have been looking at it all the afternoon but i didnt want to scare you by telling you as i thought it might go its lucky it didnt fall directly on us or it would have knocked the boat into pieces the door is jammed get hold of that hatchet lad and make a shift to get your head out to look round and see what we are doing do you hear them niggers holloaing like so many tomcats what good do they suppose that will do  i cant see anything frank said when he looked out its pitch dark i will make this hole a bit bigger and then i will take the lantern and crawl forward and see what has become of the blacks i am afraid the tree has stove the boat in look at the water coming up through the floatboards  ay i expect she is smashed somewhere it could hardly be otherwise i reckon this is going to be about as bad a job as the one i was telling you about here lad put this bottle of rum into your jacket and this loaf of bread i will take this here chunk of cold beef like enough we may want em afore we are done  when frank had enlarged the hole sufficiently to allow his body to pass through he put the lantern through and then crawled out he was in a tangle of branches and leaves the headrope was a long one the tree had fallen directly towards them and the boat was as far as frank could see wedged in between the branches which forked some forty feet above the roots a cross branch had stove in the cabin top and another rested across the scuttle of the cabin used by the negroes  hand me the axe sharp hiram he said the niggers cant get out and our bow isnt a foot out of water  hiram handed up the axe seized another and with a great effort squeezed himself through the hole and joined frank in the forepart of the boat which was waistdeep in water  never mind the branch lad that will take too long to cut through and another two or three minutes will do their business here rip off two or three of those planks that will be the quickest way  although impeded in their work by the network of boughs they speedily got off two or three planks and hauled up the frightened negroes it was but just in time for there were but a few inches between the water and the top of the low cabin  shut your mouths and drop that howling hiram said and grip hold of the tree the boat will sink under our feet in another minute stick to your lantern lad a light is a comfort anyhow ill fetch another from the cabin and some candles i know just where they are and can feel them in the water  in a minute he rejoined frank who was sitting astride of one of the branches  thats a bit of luck he said the candles are dry there aint more than two feet of water in her aft  three or four minutes passed and the boat still lay beneath their feet sinking apparently no lower i will look round again hiram said it seems to me as she has got jammed and wont go any lower  examining the boat he found that it was so she was so completely wedged among the branches that she could sink no lower  its all right he said joyously jump down all of you and lend a hand and unreeve the halliards from the mast and bind her as tight as you can to the branches pass the ropes under the thwarts make haste before she shakes herself free for the tree now well clear of the shelter of the land was swaying heavily  the work was soon done and the boat securely fastened to the tree  how is it the tree lies steady without rolling over and over hiram frank asked after they paused on the completion of the work  i reckon its the boat as keeps it steady lad as long as she lies here she is no weight but she would be a big weight to lift out of water and i reckon she keeps the whole affair steady it couldnt be better if we had planned it all these boughs break the force of the waves and keep off a good bit of the wind too we aint going to do badly after all  pete get me that halfbottle of rum from my locker and a tin mug that is right now here is a good strong tot each for you to make your faces black again you were white with fear when we got you out of that cabin and i dont blame you i should have been in just as bad a fright myself if i had been there though i shouldnt have made such a noise over it still one cant expect men of one colour to have the same ways as those of another and i am bound to say that if the boat had gone down your boss would have lost four good pieces of property feel more comfortableeh  the negroes grinned assent easily cast down their spirits were as easily raised and seeing that the white men appeared to consider that there was no urgent danger they soon plucked up their courage  i think frank said the best thing will be to manage to get the cabin door open we can put a tarpaulin over the hole in the roof and we shall then have a shelter we can go into the water is not over the lockers but i shouldnt like to go in until we get the door open if this tree did take it into its head to turn round it would be awkward if there were two or three of us in there with only that hole to scramble through  you are about right lad it will be a sight more comfortable than sitting here for what with the rain and the splashing up of this broken water one might as well be under a pump  the axes were called into requisition again for the door was jammed too firmly to be moved  chop it up and shove the pieces under the tarpaulin sam they will get a bit drier there and we may want them for a fire presently there is no saying how long we may be in this here floating forest thats right now hang one of them lanterns up in the cabin thats not so bad now lad our clothesbags are all right on these hooks i am just going to rig myself up in a dry shirt and jacket and advise you to do the same we may as well have the upper half dry if we must be wet below  frank was glad to follow hirams example and a dry flannel shirt made him feel thoroughly warm and comfortable he handed a shirt to each of the negroes and the whole party clustered in the little cabin were soon comparatively warm and cheerful in spite of the water which came up to their knees and when the boat rose on a wave swashed up over the locker on which they were sitting a supply of dry tobacco and some pipes were produced by hiram and the little cabin was soon thick with smoke  taking it altogether hiram said i regard this as about the queerest sarcumstance that ever happened to me it was just a thousand to one that tree would have smashed us up and sunk us then and thar it was another thousand to one that when we were staved in we shouldnt have got fixed so that the boat couldnt sink if any one had told it me as a yarn i should not have believed it  it has indeed been a wonderful escape frank said and i think now that we should be ungrateful indeed if every one of us did not fervently thank god for having preserved us  right you are lad praying aint much in my waynot regular praying but we men as lives a life like this and knows that at any moment a snag may go through the boats bottom thinks of these things at times and knows that our lives are in gods hands it aint in nature to go up and down this broad river special at night when the stars are shining overhead and the dark woods are as quiet as death and there aint no sound to be heard but the lap of the water against the bow for a man not to have serious thoughts it aint our way to talk about it i think we try to do our duty by our employers and if a mate is laid up he need never fear getting on a shoal for want of a helping hand and when our time comes i fancy as there aint many of us as is afeared of death or feels very bad about the account they say we have got to render arterwards its different with the niggers its their way to be singing hymns and having prayermeetings and such like there is some as is agin this and says it gives em notions and sets them agin their masters but i dont see it it pleases em and it hurts no one its just the difference of ways i expect it comes to the same in the end leastways i have seen many a wreck in this here river when whites and blacks have been alooking death in the face together and sartin the white man even if he has been a hard man aint no more afraid to die than the black generally just the contrary thats my notion of things  frank nodded and for a time there was silence in the cabin  how long are we likely to be in this fix frank asked presently  thar aint no saying supposing we dont bring up agin a snagwhich the lord forbid for like enough the tree would shift its position and we should find ourselves bottom upwards if we didwe may drift on for days and days still we shall be safe to make ourselves seen as soon as the weather clears and there are boats out again we have only got to light a fire of wet wood to call their attention i dont expect this here gale will last much longer after another day it ought to begin to blow itself out as long as nothing happens to this tree and the boat keeps fast where it is there aint nothing to make ourselves uncomfortable about wed best have a look at them lashings i tell you there is a tidy strain on them  examining the ropes carefully they found some of them were already chafed and dragging out a piece of wet canvas from the lockers they cut it into strips and lashed it round the ropes at the points where they were chafing the strain was indeed very heavy for the tree and the waterlogged boat rose but little with the waves and the bow was submerged deeply every time a wave passed them the gunwale being at no time more than a few inches out of water additional lashings were put on and then hiram and frank returned to the cabin and the latter dozed away the hours till morning as did the negroes hiram remaining wide awake and watchful and going out from time to time to look at the lashings as soon as day broke frank roused himself and went out hiram was just descending from one of the boughs  i have had a look round he said i dont think its blowing quite so hard but thar aint much change yet it aint not to say a cheerful kind of lookout  frank climbed up to take a view for himself but he was glad to return very quickly to the shelter of the cabin overhead was a canopy of low grey cloud around a curtain of driving rain below a chaos of whiteheaded waves the day passed slowly and with little change sam found in the forepart of the boat the iron plate on which he built his fire they fixed this on the roof of the cabin fastened a tarpaulin across the boughs so as to shelter it from the rain and drift and then with some difficulty managed to make a fire some hot coffee was first prepared and a fryingpan was then put on and filled with slices of pork the flour was wet but sam made some flat cakes of the wet dough and placed them in the fat to fry when the pork was done  not a bad meal that hiram said when he had finished for a floating forest  the negroes had now completely recovered from the effects of their fright and wetting and their spirits as usual found vent in merry choruses  just like children aint they hiram said as he and frank reentered the cabin while the negroes continued to feast overhead crying one moment and laughing the next but i have known some good uns among them too as good mates to work with as a man could want and as good grit as a white man another meal later in the afternoon alone broke the monotony of the day the aspect of the weather was unchanged at nightfall but hiram asserted that the wind had certainly gone down and that in the morning there would probably be a break in the weather they smoked for some time and then the negroes dozed off with their chins on their chests and frank was about to make an effort to do the same when hiram who had been going in and out several times said suddenly i reckon we are out of the main stream dont you feel the difference  now that his attention was called to it frank wondered that he had not noticed it before the waves were no longer washing over the forepart of the boat and the sluggish efforts of the tree and boat to rise and fall with the water had ceased he was still more struck when he went outside by the comparative silence the wind still whistled overhead and swayed the branches but the hiss and rustle of the water had ceased  we are out of the main stream thats sartin hiram said though where we are is more nor i can tell till we get daylight  frank took the lantern and climbed up the bough which served as a lookout it was pitch dark outside and the surface of the water was no longer broken by white heads  yes we are certainly out of the main river hiram and in behind some big islands where do you think it could be  i reckon lad we are somewhere down near the mouth of the arkansas the stream has been running mighty strong for the last two days and the wind catching all these branches must have helped us along a good bit i reekon we cant be far away from the arkansas its a bad stroke of luck drifting in here we may expect to get hung up somewhere and we shall be in a nice fix then out of sight of boats going up and down and with miles and miles of swamp stretching back from the shore however it will be time to think of that tomorrow there aint nothing for us to do just lend us a hand and we will get this iron plate off the roof the tarpaulin keeps off the rain and i will fetch a couple of blankets and we can stretch ourselves out here i despise going to sleep sitting up  frank was sound asleep in a few minutes he had a confused notion of feeling a slight jerking motion and of hearing hiram say there she is anchored but he did not suffer this to rouse him and dropping off slept soundly till morning at the first stir hiram made he was awake  we have had a goodish spell of sleep i reckon lad and i feel all the better for having had my legs stretched out straight  so do i ever so much the wind seems to have gone quite down and it has stopped raining  we shall have the sun up soon  frank was soon up in the lookout  i can see trees on both sides of us but i can make out nothing more than that theres a mist hanging over them though its clear enough on the water we are not moving  i could have told you that hiram said didnt we get fast on something before we went to sleep last night  oh i forgot about that i was just off when you spoke and didnt quite take it in we are quite out of the current the water is moving very sluggishly past us  so much the worse lad thats just what i fancied we have got blown out of the stream and got in behind some of the islands and are perhaps at the mouth of one of the loops where there aint no stream to speak of useful enough they are when you are making your way upstream but noaccount places to get stuck in now you darkeys below there wake up and lets have some food you will soon have the sun up to warm you and dry your clothes a bit by the time we have had our breakfast he went on to frank the mist will have lifted and we shall have some chance of seeing where we have been cast away and can talk over whats the best thing to be done in this here business  the iron plate was replaced on the cabin the fire was lit and coffee and fried bacon were soon ready the first sparkle of the sun through the leaves brought a shout of delight from the negroes and directly the meal was over they cut away some of the small branches and let the sun stream in on to the roof of the cabin  thats enough boys hiram said by midday we shall be glad of the shade now let you and i light our pipes lad and take a survey and then talk this job over  on looking round they found that the passage or creek in which they were was some eighty yards wide ahead it seemed to narrow behind them a bend shut out the view a quarter of a mile away  thats just what i expected you see we have drove in here and theres been just current enough to drift us on till the lower branches touched the bottom or caught in a snag the water aint flowing half a mile an hour now and i reckon when the water begins to drop which will be in a few days if it holds fine there wont be no current to speak of  but we are not going to stay here a few days are we hiram  well lad i aint no particular wish to stay here no time at all if you will just pint out the way for us to be moving on  well we could all swim ashore frank said the distance is nothing and all the blacks swim  and how fur do you reckon the shore to be lad  about forty yards frank said  i reckon it to be miles ladtwenty perhaps or forty for aught i know  frank looked at his companion in surprise  yes that is about it lad dont you see them trees are all growing out by the water and what looks to you like low bush is just the top of the underwood the river i reckon must have riz twenty feet and all this low land is under water as i told you we are near the mouth of the arkansas and for miles and miles the country aint much better than a swamp at the best of times you can swim to them trees and roost up in the branches if the fancy takes yer and may be we may decide thats the best thing to do when we have talked it over but as to getting to land you may put that notion out of your head altogether i told you lad last night i didnt like the lookout and i dont like it a bit better this morning except that i look to be dry and comfortable in another hour whats to come after that i dont quite see  frank was silent the prospect now that he understood it was unpleasant indeed there they were with a disabled and waterlogged boat in the middle of a district submerged for many miles and surrounded beyond that by feverstricken swamps while the prospect of any craft happening to come along was remote indeed for some minutes he smoked his pipe in silence  you consider it impossible for us to make our escape through the wood  just unpossible lad we might make our way from tree to tree like a party of monkeys but we should get to creeks where we couldnt cross we should be half our time swimming we could take no food to speak of with us we should get lost in the swamps if ever we got through the forest no lad my present idea is it is unpossible though if we detarmines at last there aint nothing else for us to do but to try for it hiram little aint the man to die without making a hard fight for his life but i tell you lad i looks on it as unpossible you have been on these banks with me and you know how thick the trees and bushes grow so that a snake could hardly make his way through them when the river is at her level the ground aint about a foot or two out of water and when the river fallsand it maynt fall to its level for weeksit will just be a swamp of mud  illustration a flood on the mississippi  well in that case frank said it seems to me that our only chance is to repair the boat  thats just my idee young fellow there is a biggish hole on each side the ribs are smashed in and a lot of damage is done but we could make a shift to mend it if we could get her ashore but there aint no shore to get her to thats the mischief of it besides here we are stuck and if we were to cut away the tree to loose her she would go straight to the bottom  yes we mustnt cut her loose before we are alongside something my idea is that if we first of all cut off all the boughs that are above us close to the trunk that will make a good deal of difference in the weight and we should float higher then with hatchet and saw we must get rid of those below taking a rope first to the trees and hauling her closer and closer alongside them as we get rid of the weight till at last there is only the trunk and these two great arms that have nipped her i think that way we might get alongside the trees  i reckon we might lad yes i dont see much difficulty about that and what shall we do when we get there  i should get under a big tree like that one over there with that great arm stretching over the stream weve got plenty of ropes and i should fasten them from her bow and stern and from her thwarts tight to that arm overhead when i got her fixed i would chop away one of these arms that grip her and let her float free we have no tackle that would be of any use in hoisting her but if we take the plug out of her bottom she will empty as the river sinks and hang there once she is in the air there will be no difficulty in patching her up  thats a capital idee young fellow hiram exclaimed giving frank a mighty pat on the shoulder i do believe it is to be done that way i tell you i did not see my way out of this fix nohow but you have hit upon it by gosh here you darkies get them axes and saws out of the cabin and clear away this forest  an hours work cleared away all the wood above water the sun was by this time well above the trees the negroes woke up to life and cheerfulness in its warmth and worked vigorously  before we do anything more frank said i will swim with a light line to that tree and then haul the towrope after me and make it fast to it it is possible that when we cut away some of the other boughs the whole affair may turn over and sink but if the towrope is fast we may be able to drag it alongside  when the rope was attached to the tree they proceeded with their work the two great arms were chopped through just beyond the point at which the boat was wedged thus getting rid of the whole of the upper part of the tree  shes free now hiram said stand in the middle of the boat you boys i can feel that a very little would sway her over now  the bow sank some inches and fully half the boat was submerged  now you and i will get out at this end of the trunk lad and tow her in stern foremost  they got within ten yards of the tree before she again stuck and it took them some hours work to cut away the branch which projected under water but at last this was done and the boat was placed in position under the arm of the great tree they had pitched upon and a number of ropes fastened firmly to the arm  now we will have some dinner hiram said and while pete is cooking it we will get ashore with the saw and cut the heads off some of these small trees and fasten them to this trunk so as to make a sort of raft that we can put all these tubs on the ropes would never hold her with her cargo on board i reckon some of the sugar is spoilt but the boss always has good casks and may be there aint much damage done the rum is right enough and i reckon there wont be much spoilt except them bales of calico  they worked hard but it was late in the evening before the raft was formed and the cargo all shifted into it  now we will just chop off this arm and free her hiram said and then we can stretch ourselves out for the night we have done a tidy days work i reckon and have arned our sleep  the arm was chopped through and the boat was freed from the tree which had in the first place so nearly destroyed it but which in the end had proved their means of safety the raft was fastened alongside by a rope and the negroes betook themselves to it for the night while the two white men as before lay down to sleep on the cabintop     illustration  chapter viii  starting for the west   the next morning they found to their satisfaction that the river had sunk nearly a foot the boat had risen considerably when the cargo had been removed the evening before and the ropes overhead had been proportionately tightened so that she now hung so high that the rents were well out of water and they were able at once to set about the work of repair there were tools on board for during their prolonged trips it was often necessary to execute repairs of one kind or other the flooringboards were utilised for the repairs and by evening the holes were closed effectually  the next day the work was strengthened by additional ribs and stringers a coat of pitch was put on outside and in and hiram pronounced the work complete from time to time the ropes had been loosened as the river continued to fall although less rapidly and it was thought well not to put too great a strain upon them the next morning the plug was again driven into the bottom of the boat and they set to work to pump and bale her out and then shifted the cargo back again from the raft this was not a long job and at night after a great washingup of the cabins to get rid of the mud that had been left there they had the satisfaction of taking possession of their old quarters  well lad hiram said when they lighted their pipes after supper i never thought we were coming so well out of that job with plenty of rice and sugar not to speak of rum on board i didnt expect we war going to starve but i thought we might have been weeks and weeksay months may bebefore any one came along and the thought as came into my mind was as we should have to make a raft and pole along till we got out into the river again however here we are with the boat not much the worse and everything on board ready for a start in the morning and its thanks to you as we have done it for i am free to say as i dont think as i should have hit on this plan as we have carried out you are a good mate to work with lad and no mistake i dont wish never to get a better its a pity ye dont mean to stick to it for good for i can swar that you would make one of the best hands on the mississippi in time  the journey down the river was continued next morning at the first place they stopped at they heard reports of widespread damage of great tracts submerged and of danger to life the river was still at full flood although it had fallen two feet from its highest level and the next ten days were spent in rescuing the unfortunate people from the tops of the houses trees and patches of rising ground on which they had taken refuge then having done all they were able and the river having now fallen nearly to its average level they continued their voyage down to new orleans  hiram in his report of the voyage to his employer spoke in high terms of franks conduct and ascribed to his quickness of invention their escape from what seemed likely to be an almost endless detention  but i am afraid he has made his last vyage with me he said he is talking of striking out across the plains to californy there was a good talk of gold thar before we started and last night after we came in and went in for a drink and to hear the news there didnt seem nothing else to talk about the young chap was asking all sorts of questions and i expect hes off and i dont know as i blames him hes the sort of fellow to get on he has plenty of grit hes strong and active now and in a couple of years he will widen out and make a very big man hes had a firstrate edicationhe dont talk about it but one would be blind not to see thathe will make his way wherever he goes and i dont blame him for striking out from the river he likes the river too but it aint the place for making a fortin unless youve got money at your back as you have boss but i dont know if he had money and could go into steamers and suchlike that he would stick to it  i dont know nowt of his history but i think things must have gone hard with him somehow and he came out here for excitement more than for making money but theres nothing reckless about him he dont drink and he dont gamble and it says a lot for a young fellow in new orleans that he dont do one or the other and he can fight he can there aint no doubt about that why i saw him give the biggest kind of a thrashing to the bully of a lumber camp where we moored up alongside one night as ever you seed the chap was big enough to eat him but he didnt have no kind of show the young un just hit him where he liked and in five minutes that chaps face was a thing to see and the lad never got so much as a scratch i wouldnt have thought as a man could have used his hands like that if i hadnt been thar i shall be rightdown sorry to lose him  i knew wellnigh when i took him on that he was not likely to stay hiram he said as much he wanted to get to know something about the ways of the country before he decided upon anything if all young fellows would do as he did go to work for a few months instead of loafing about spending their money and getting into bad ways and among bad fellows it would be better for them he has only drawn a few dollars for his expenseswhen he was down the last timesince he came to work so he has got a good sum due to him i will have a talk with him myself there are a good many parties starting from here and taking the santa fé route but taking them all in all i dont think i should recommend him to hang on to one of them  no i should guess they would be a pretty hard lot who would go out from heregamblers and horsethieves and runaway sailors and mexican fightersneither good to travel with or good to work with he had better go up and strike from st louis  he had better go higher still hiram theres a northern route and i hear a lot of the western men are making across that however i will talk to him  that afternoon frank went into mr willcoxs little office  hiram has been speaking in very high terms of you and i find that i am indebted to you for the saving of the boat with what cargo she had on board which hiram said he had altogether given up as lost you seem to have been in a position of very great danger and to have had an extraordinarily narrow escape of your lives however i can understand that you are not content to settle down for life on the mississippi but i can tell you that with enterprise judgment and steadiness there is fortune to be made here still i am not surprised that the goldseeking mania has got hold of you  it is not so much sir the goldseeking mania as the excitement attending it i dont think i particularly care about making money but i do want the excitement of such a life i have come out for that and not as it is generally called to make my fortune the course of my life at home has been upset by circumstances into which i need not enter and at any rate for a time i want action and excitement after that perhaps i may think of settling down and what is called making my way  i can understand your feeling lad and will not try to persuade you to stop at this business and now what route are you thinking of taking across the continent  i was thinking of joining a party going direct from here across to santa fé  i dont think that will be a good plan lad the caravans from here are composed for the most part of very hard characters the sort of men who would shoot you for your horse if they took a fancy to it i would by no means advise you to ally yourself with such men i can i think put you in the way of a better plan than that i find that a great number of caravans from the west are going by a northern route which crosses the missouri at a point called omaha i have been thinking that this will become an important place and have made up my mind to freight four or five flats with flour bacon and other goods of all sorts and a frame store and to go up there and open a business i shall want a handy man with me at first i shall take up a storekeeper to leave there in charge but at first he will want help if you like to go up in charge of one of the scows and to stay to help put up the store and set things running i will give you a hundred dollars and you can have your passage up for your horse which i should advise you to buy here you will get one that will carry you though of course not much to look at for about fifty dollars i know several horsedealers here and will get one for you if you like you had also better get a stout pony to carry your traps and provisions that will cost about forty dollars then you must have a rifle and a colt these are absolutely necessary for such a journey for i hear that the indians are very troublesome on the plains these however i myself shall have much pleasure in presenting you with in testimony of the obligation i feel i owe you for saving my boat and goods the hundred dollars that are due to you and the hundred that you will further earn at omaha will be sufficient for your horses and outfit which will leave this money which you placed in my hands untouched you will find that very useful for you will want to buy a tent and provisions and tools out there and money to keep you till you hit upon gold well what do you think of my offer  i am extremely obliged to you sir nothing could suit me better and i am indeed greatly obliged for your kind offer of a rifle and revolver they will certainly be most necessary by what one hears of the journey  you have some other clothes i suppose  yes sir i have another suit in my portmanteau  very well put them on and come back here in an hours time it will be a week before my steamer starts and you had better come and stop with me till then it will keep you out of mischief and i should be glad of your company  at the appointed time frank returned to the office dressed in the suit of clothes he had brought with him a light carriage with a pair of horses was standing at the door  ah mr willcox laughed as he came out i fancy you look more like yourself now  frank took his place in the carriage mr willcox took the reins the negro servant sprang up behind and they were soon rattling through the streets of the town  mr willcoxs house was situated two miles out of the city it was a large building with a verandah running round it and standing in wellkept and handsome grounds three or four negroes ran out as the carriage drove up  sam take this gentlemans portmanteau upstairs and get a bath ready for him at once and lay out a suit of white clothes for him  we always have a bath before dinner in this country he said to frank one wants to get rid of the dust of the day dinner will be ready in half an hour  after enjoying a luxurious bath and attiring himself in a suit of snowywhite gear frank descended to the diningroom  mr willcox was a widower without children and they therefore dined alone as they were sitting over their wine after dinner in the verandah franks host said i do not wish to be inquisitive but if you dont mind telling me i should like to know why a young fellow like yourself should embark upon a life of adventure  frank had met with such kindness from his employer that he frankly told him the whole history of the events which had driven him from england  it is a singular story the trader said and i own that appearances were against you of course i dont know him and may be misjudge him altogether but the only person who appears to me to have had any interest whatever in getting you into disgrace and causing you to leave the country is your cousin  fred barkley frank exclaimed in surprise i can assure you such an idea never entered my mind he is not at all a bad fellow though certainly he is not popular at school  i should prefer taking the general verdict of the school to yours the trader said boys are seldom far out in their estimate of persons they have more instinct than men and a boy is seldom far wrong in his estimate of character  the fact that he is generally unpopular is in my mind a proof that there is something wrong about this cousin of yours then what you tell me that he refused to lend you the money which would have got you out of your scrape while he afterwards came forward with twenty pounds to enable you to get away is another strong point the advice which he gave you was distinctly bad for you had much better have remained and to the last have protested your innocence then there is another point did i gather from your words that you and he are the nearest relations to the wealthy uncle with whom you lived  yes that is so frank replied  then in case of your disgrace it is by no means improbable that your uncle will leave him the whole of the money is that so  i have no doubt of it frank assented  then you see he has a very strong interest in bringing you into discredit besides there were only you say five people who had any knowledge of this affair and of your need for the money none of the other four had the slightest possible interest in bringing you into disgrace he had a very strong interest and take my word for it your cousin is at the bottom of the whole affair  i cannot believe it frank said rising from his chair and pacing up and down the verandah if i thought so i would return to england by the next ship and have it out with him  but you have no shadow of proof mr willcox said it is a matter of suspicion only even had the idea occurred to you at first you would only have injured yourself by stating it for it would have been regarded as a hideous aggravation of your crime to bring such a charge against your cousin unsupported by a shadow of proof no now you have taken your line you must go through with it and trust to time to right you it is a suspicion only but you mark my words if the mystery is ever solved it will be found that your cousin was at the bottom of it  frank spent a very pleasant week at the charming residence of mr willcox the latter entertained a good deal and frank met at his house several of the leading merchants of new orleans and acquired a good deal of knowledge of the state of the country most of them were incredulous as to the stories of the abundance of gold in california that gold had been discovered they did not deny but they were of opinion that the find would be an isolated one and that ruin would fall upon the crowds who were hastening either across the continent or by ship via panama to the new eldorado several of them tried to dissuade frank from his intention of going thither and more than one offered to place him in their countinghouses or to procure him employment of other kind  frank however was firm for he was going not for the sake of making money but of finding adventure and excitement he went down every day to the wharf and superintended the loading of the scows and at the end of ten days he resumed his boatmans clothes and took his place on one of the scows hiram accompanied him with eight negroes two for each flat a tug took them in tow and they started up the river mr willcox was to follow by a steamer next day and would arrive at omaha some time before them and have time to choose and buy a lot of land for his store and to have all in readiness for their arrival frank had purchased a strong serviceable horse for his own riding and a pony for his baggage together with blankets and other necessaries for the journey his mining outfit he decided to get at sacramento as although the cost would be considerable he did not wish to encumber himself with it on his journey across the plains the rifle and revolver had been presented him by mr willcox and he determined to practise steadily with both on his voyage up the river as his life might depend on his proficiency with his weapons  the voyage up the mississippi and missouri was performed without any notable adventure although in the littleknown waters of the upper river the tug ran several times aground those on board the flats had but little to do their duties being confined to pumping out the water when there was any leakage and the negroes had been taken up more for the purpose of unloading the cargo carrying it to its destination and putting up the store than for any service they could render on the voyage frank who had laid in a large store of ammunition for the purpose amused himself by practising with his pistol at a bottle towed behind the scow or with his rifle at floating objects in the stream in feeding and taking care of his horses and in listening to many yarns from hiram  i can tell you lad the latter said one day when after passing st louis they had entered the waters of the missouri thar have been changes on this river since i was a youngster i was raised at st louis which was not much more than a frontier town in those days and most of the work lay below here and there there was a farm on the missouri but they got thinner as they got higher up and long before we got to where we are going it was all indian country i used to go up sometimes with traders but i never liked the job first i didnt like selling firewater as they called it to the indians for it made them mad and brought on quarrels and wars in the next place it was a dangerous business the indians used to meet the traders at some place they had appointed beforehand and there would be big feastings sometimes the traders would come back with the boat loaded up with buffalo robes and skins and indian blankets and such like once or twice they didnt come back at all and it was just a mercy that i didnt stay behind with them on one of the trips  i went up with a trading party to a place somewhere near this omaha we had three boats with six voyageurs in each i was about fiveandtwenty then and was steersman of one of them there were four traders they were in my boat and they played cards and drank all the way up one of the boats was a flatnot a flat like this but just a big flatbottomed boatfor they were going as i understood to get some good horses from the indians and take them down to st louis we had pretty hard work getting her along and a weak crew would never have got her against the stream though of course we chose a time when the river was low and there wasnt much stream on sometimes we rowed sometimes we poled keeping along the shallows and back waters and though the pay was good i wasnt sorry when we got to the place appointed not only because the work was hard but because i didnt like the ways of them traders with their gambling and drinking and quarrelling however they gave up drink the last day and were sober enough when they landed  i dont know why but i didnt think things were going to turn out well i had heard the traders say as they didnt mean to come up that part of the country agin and i knew their goods warnt of no account and that they were going to trade off bad stuff on the indians the first two days things went on all right every evening large lots of goods were brought down to the boats but except when i went up with the others to the traders tent to bring the things down i didnt go about much it was a large camp with two or three hundred braves as they calls em i told the men in my boat what i thought of it but they didnt think much of what i said and traded a little on their own account for it was part of the agreement that each man should be allowed to take up fifty dollarsworth of goods and have room for what he could get for them i traded mine away the first day for some buffalo robes and so hadnt anything to take me away from the boat  the third day the trading was done there was to be a grand feast that night and the boats were to start the next morning most of the men went up to see the fun but i persuaded two of my mates in my boat to stop quiet with me presently i heard a yell from the camp which was about three hundred yards away thats mischief says i i had scarce spoken when there was a yelling fit to make your har stand on end and i heard pistolshots quick lads says i catch up a hatchet and stave a hole in the other boats and push ours a little way out from the bank we warnt long in doing that and then we stopped and listened  there was a sharp fight going on that we could hear and guessed how it must be going when they war twenty to one presently the shouting and firing ceased and then against the skylinefor they had lots of fires blazing in campwe saw a crowd of injuns come rushing down to the river we shoved the boat off and took to our oars they shouted to us and then fired at us and shot their arrows and swarmed down into the other two boats to come after us and there was a fresh burst of yells when they found that they wouldnt swim we didnt stop to talk you may be sure but rowed as hard as we could  the night was pretty dark and though several bullets hit the boat and a dozen of their arrows fell into it only one of us had a scratch and that wasnt serious as soon as we war fairly away we set to work to roll up the buffalo robes and skins into big bales and lay them along on each side of the boat so as to form a protection for us from their bullets and arrows for we guessed they would follow us down and in many places the river was so shallow they could ride pretty well out to us they did follow us on horseback for the next two days and shot at us pretty hot at times once they rode so far out in the shallows that we dared not pass them so we dropped anchor above and took to our rifles and gave them a pretty sharp lesson for they lost seven men after that they didnt try that game any more but just followed down in hopes we might stick on a sandbank i tell you i never looked out so sharp for shallows as i did on that there voyage  fortunately at the end of the first day a breeze sprang up from the north and we got up a sail for we war pretty nigh done having rowed by turns from the time we pushed off we war afraid you see as they might patch up the other boats and set out after us though we hoped they mightnt think of it for these horse indians dont know nothing of river work they gave it up at last and we got safely down to st louis what the trouble was about i never heard for not one of those who had landed ever got away to tell us i expect it was some trouble about the quality of the goods and that the indians got a notion they were being cheatedwhich sure enough they war  was anything done to punish the indians hiram  lor bless you who was to punish them why there was scarce a settler then west of the mississippi no if traders went among em they went among em at thar own risk and i am bound to say that if the indians were treated fair and the men understood thar ways thar was no great danger the indians knew if they killed traders that others wouldnt come among them and they wanted goodsguns and powder most of all but other things too such as blankets and cloth as they calls cotton and hatchets beads and other things and they wanted to trade off thar hosses and buffalo robes and skins of all kinds that was the protection the traders had and it warnt very often the indians fell foul of them except it might be a muss got up over the firewater  when the news came down to st louis there was a good deal of talk about it but it got about that these fellows had been taking up trash and the general verdict was that it sarved em right all the traders on the frontier set their faces agin men who cheated the indians not because they cared for the indians mark you but because anything that made bad blood did harm to the trade all over however it gave me a bad scare and it was a good many years before i came up the upper missouri again theres some men as seems to me to be downright fond of fighting but i dont feel like that anyway if i get into a hard corner and have got to fight then i fights but i had rather go round the other way if i could thar are dangers enough on this river for me what with snags and shoals and storms they are enough for any reasonable man then there are the river pirates they are worse than all though its some years since we had much trouble with em  river pirates hiram i have not heard you say anything about them before i did not know there were any pirates on these rivers  thar used to be lad years back lots of them and a pretty lively time we used to have on the river  but what sort of pirates hiram  well thar war two sorts you see at that time fiveandtwenty years ago the settlements on the river war a long way apart you might go fifty miles without seeing a village when you once got past the plantations on the lower river you may say as this region then was like what kansas is now chaps who had made it too hot for them in the east came out here and just had to wrestle round for a living new orleans is pretty bad now but it was a sight worse then and st louis was a pretty hard place then too thar war runaway slaves so you see one way or the other a fellow who wanted to get together a band up to any mischief had not to look far for men  well as i said thar war two sorts thar war the men who lived away from the river say in the low country between the arkansas and the main stream which was then pretty nigh all swamp and forest perhaps they had hosses perhaps not but mostly they had well one fine morning a dozen of them would ride into one of the villages on the river thar wasnt much to take thar you know onless it war fever and they had enough of that in thar own swamps they would wait may be for a day or two till a boat came in and as soon as it had made fast they would cover the men with thar rifles and just empty it of all it had gotpowder blankets groceries and dry goods and what notand make off again i got my cargo lifted i should say a dozen times that way it war onpleasant but thar was nothing for it and it warnt no use making a fuss when you saw half a dozen rifles pinted at you why in the early days of steamers more than once they got held up and the fellows went through the passengers and cargo and took what they fancied  well that was one sort of pirate the other was what you may call the regular water pirate they lived on the islands in among the backwaters or whereever thar might be a patch of raised ground among the swamps and had boats and they would attack you at night as you war dropping down the stream or poling up the backs they war wuss nor the others a sight more nor half of em war blacks and good reason why for the fevers carried off the whites as joined them before they had been thar long they was a powerful bad lot and those who fell into thar hands hadnt much chance of thar lives the runaway slaves war down on a white man and he had no marcy to expect at thar hands besides they didnt want no tales told which might scare boats from going near the places where they war hiding so in general they fust emptied the boats and then scuttled and sunk them and cut the throats of all on board hundreds of boats war missed in those days and none ever knew for sartin what had become of them  i tell you one had to keep ones eyes open in those days we had strong crews and every man was armed and a pretty sharp lookout was kept but for all that thar was places backwaters and cuts and such like whar i wouldnt have been stuck in after dark not for all the money in orleans even in the open river no one was safe from em for they got so bold they would go out four or five boatloads and attack in broad daylight things got so bad that no one dared go up or down unless it was ten or twelve boats together for protection it war the steamers as broke em up thar aint no stopping a steamer and every one took to being towed up or down then the population increased and regular expeditions war got up to hunt em down altogether it got made too hot for em and the game didnt pay but for some years i can tell you they war a terror to the river  and were you never attacked hiram  i was chased several times hiram said but i had a fast boat and a good crew and we generally had four white men on board then and plenty of arms yes we had some skirmishes but it was only once i had a regular setto with em and that war a pretty bad job  how was it hiram  well you see the river was pretty full and the wind had been light for some time and there warnt no way of making against the main stream i had waited for three weeks and me and my mates got sick of it we had a cargo which was due up the river and we made up our minds at last that we would push on and take our chance we had eight negroes all strong active fellows armed with cutlasses and old ship muskets and we four whites had rifles and pistols we allowed we could make a good fight of it so we agreed as we would go up the backwaters so managing as to be able to get out into the stream every night and anchor thar we shifted the cargo a bit so as to pile it up round the sides stowing the ricebags so as to make a sort of breastwork then off we started  for some days we got along well the blacks poled thar best and every evening we just hit a pint where we could go out into the stream agin two or three times we fancied we war watched for we heard the snapping of twigs and sounds in the thick swamp jungle ahead but i reckon they thowt better of it when they saw two riflebarrels peeping out from the sacks on each side and saw we war ready for a tussle but one dayit wasnt very far from the pint where we mended up that boat the other daywe war later than usual the stream war stronger than we reckoned on we had run aground two or three times on the mud and it war getting dark and we had two miles yet before we got to a place where we could get out into the river the blacks war working thar hardest it didnt need no words from us to keep em at it for they knew as well as we did what was the danger and the boat just flew along that narrow channel  we war on the watch with our eyes fixed on the bank and our ears pretty wide open to catch any sound ahead all of a sudden a gun was fired close alongside the blacks gave a yell and would have jumped down into shelter only i shouted stick to your poles men if you lose them we are done for theres no danger its only one man so on we went again for luckily no one was hit thats a signal bill says i to one of my mates i reckon we shall have trouble afore we are out of this on we went flying between the bushes which warnt fifteen yards apart not a sound was heard but the panting of the blacks the splash of their poles in the water and a sort of sighing noise behind as the ripples the boat made as she glided along rustled among the boughs which dipped down into the stream  we had got a mile further when we heard a noise it was much as a pole might make knocked against the side of the boat i knew thar was mischief now get in your poles lads i said four of you get out oars through the holes we have left for them atween the bags and put your muskets close at hand the other four get your muskets and station yourselves two on each side we went on slowly now we knew they war ahead of us and that hurrying wouldnt do no good and that we had got to fight anyhow it might have been five minutes when thar was a flash from the bushes on either sidewhich we could scarce see in the darknessand fully a dozen muskets poured a volley into us buckshot and ball as we found on looking over the boat the next morning it was a good job as we put them ricebags in place for i reckon thar wouldnt have been many of us up to fighting if they hadnt been thar we had agreed not to fire back if we war fired at from the wood for they couldnt do us much harm thar and it was best to keep our fire for the boats which they war sure to have as well  the moment the volley was fired two boats shot out one from each side now give it em says i up we jumped four on each side and poured our fire into the boats which warnt twelve feet away the darkies who war rowing had been told what to do and to do em justice they did it well thar was a yell from the boats as we fired for i reckon every shot told but the way they had got brought em on and their bows struck us just at the same moment then at it we went with our pistols as they crowded forward and tried to get on board it was over in half a minute for the four blacks had seized their poles and shoving them into the boats two on each side pushed em off  i have heard pretty tall language on the mississippi but i never heard such volleys of cussing as came up from them boats some of the men blazed away with thar guns some shouted to others to row alongside some who war hit yelled and cussed like fiends and all this time we war lying behind the bags ramming down fresh charges for the bare life we gave em eight more shots before they could cast off the poles and come at us again this time they came along more on the broadside and five or six of em sprang on board but we war ready with the butts of our rifles and the blacks with thar cutlasses and we cleared them off again the four darkies had stuck to thar poles one boat was shoved off and one of the blacks run his pole right through the bottom of the other and in a minute she went down  the other boat didnt know what had happened and came up agin but leaving two of the blacks to chop down any of the fellows in the water who might try to climb aboard the other ten of us stood up and fought em fair our blood was up now and our darkies fought like demons the pirates soon found they had the worst of it and would have got apart from us if they could but we jumped into thar boat and fought them thar and they soon jumped over and made for the bank directly it was over they began to fire agin from the shore and we jumped back into shelter agin in our own boat and manned the four oars agin we fastened the painter of the boat on to our stern and towed her behind us and in another half an hour were out in the stream it was a toughish fight i can tell you while it lasted two of the blacks and one of my mates had been hit by thar musketballs and the rest of us war either gashed by thar knives or had got ugly cracks however six of them war lying in the boat when we hauled it alongside two war stonedead the other four had been stunned with the butt ends of the muskets or cut down by the darkies sabres we took em down to the next place and handed em over to the sheriff and as thar happened to be a lot of boats waiting thar for the wind you may guess it warnt many hours afore they tried and hung em  when the chaps heard the particulars and that we had sunk one boat besides bringing off another they guessed as likely enough the pirates war trapped thar and so they got up a regular expedition six boats each with a dozen men i went back to show em the place they brought dogs with them and hunted through the woods and swamps till they came to the patch of higher ground whar the pirates had got thar huts thar were about twenty of em mostly negroes and they fought hard for thar was no escape the boat having drifted away after it had sunk behind thar war some widish channels and some of the boats had gone round thar to cut em off if they took to swimming they war killed every man jack and that put an end to one of the very worst lots of pirates we ever had on the river  you were lucky to have got out of it so well hiram i suppose that sort of thing is quite over now  yes in course thar are water thieves still chaps who steal things from the boats if thar is no one with em or if you are all asleep below but thar havent been no real pirates for years nowleastways not above new orleans down in the great swamps by the mouth of the river thars always gangs of runaway slaves and desperate characters of all sorts who have got to live somehow thar are still boats sometimes missing up the river which may have been snagged and gone down with all hands and which may be have comed to thar end some other way anyhow no one thinks much about pirates now and the rivers quite as safe as the streets of new orleans that maynt be saying much perhaps but its good enough of course a party might any day take to the swamps and stop uppassing boats just as they might take to the roads and stop waggons going west but one doesnt trouble about things onless they get so as to be what you might call a general danger  you cant go into a barroom without a risk of getting into a fight with a drunken rowdy you cant stop at one of these landingplaces but what thars a chance of getting into a mess with fellows who come in from the backs for a spree and one doesnt look to have these rivers which one and the other are tens of thousands of miles long just kept as free from hard characters as a street in boston its as good as we can look for at present settlement is going on wonderful fast and like enough in another forty years there wont be any more pirates on the great rivers here than thar are on the seas steam and settlements is bound to wipe em out at last  during the last two or three hundred miles of the journey up the missouri a few settlements only were passed little villages nestling closely together on the edge of the river surrounded often by a stockade for although the indians were gradually falling back before the advance of the whites indian wars were of frequent occurrence and then the bands of wild horsemen swept down to the missouri carrying fire and destruction in their course in front of every settlement lay a scow or two used partly for the transportation of the crops but valuable also as an ark of refuge in case of attack the shores were low and shallows and banks abounded in the stream and sometimes the tug ran aground four or five times in the course of the day in spite of his practice with his firearms and hirams talk and stories frank began to find the days pass very slowly and was not a little glad when hiram pointed out a cluster of huts on the left bank and said there is omaha  half an hour later the tug was alongside and mr willcox was on board  i am glad to see you up he said as the flats were moored to the bank and frank stepped ashore and joined him the time has gone slowly here for though i stayed four days at st louis i have been here nearly a week there is lots to do and i am greatly pleased that i went in for it i wish you could have made up your mind to settle here you would have made a precious deal better thing of it than you ever will do by digging for gold however i know its no use talking about that i have got a capital location on the main street i bought it off a fool who came up in the steamboat with me and had made up his mind to sell out and cross the plains i had an offer for it yesterday at five times the price i gave for it but bless you i wouldnt have taken twenty times this is going to be a big place i am glad you have come for another reason i am putting up at one of the shanties they call an hotel but one might as well try to live in the tower of babel there is an uproar day and night every inch of the floor is taken up for sleeping on and i have been nearly driven out of my mind now i can live on board the tug till she goes down with the empty flats i am glad i brought up those eight negroes for there would be the greatest difficulty in hiring hands here every one seems to have gone stark mad and to consider every hours delay in pushing west as so much loss of a chance of making a fortune  for the next fortnight the labour was incessant hiram frank and the eight negroes toiled in landing the stores and the framework of the house and in transporting them to the lot which mr willcox had purchased even the engineers of the tug were induced by the high payment mr willcox offered to aid in the work several stretchers or handbarrows had been brought up with them and on these such bales and boxes as were too heavy for one man to carry were transported the framework of the house was first carried to the site and four of the negroes who were good carpenters at once began to put it together so that by the time the last of the goods were brought up the store was ready to receive them it was a building some sixty feet long by twenty wide and was divided into two by a partition the one end twenty feet in length was the saleroom in the other forty feet long the bulk of the heavy goods flour rice bacon hogsheads of sugar and chests of tea were stored there was in addition a leanto nine feet square at one end which was to serve as the habitation of the storekeeper the assortment of goods was very large in addition to the stock of provisions which filled the storeroom nearly up to the roof were a great quantity of clothing fitted for the rough work of the plains a large assortment of rifles and pistols kegs of ammunition casks of axlegrease ironwork for waggons and all the miscellaneous stores down to needles and thread which would be likely to be required by the emigrants as soon as the stores were all safely on shore and housed the tug started down the river again with the flats hiram and six of the negroes accompanied them two of the latter being retained as assistants to the storekeeper between hiram and frank there was a very cordial adieu  i likes yer young fellow the boatman said you will make your way never fear some day if you get a chance send a line to me to the charge of the boss and let me know how things go with you i shall be gladder than i can tell you to hear as youre making your way and i shall be anxious like till i hear as you have got safely over this journey for they do say as the indians are playing all sorts of devilry with the caravans well theres one thing you are a good shot now but be careful lad and dont get into no fights if you can keep out of em  frank remained for another fortnight assisting in the store by the end of that time things had settled down they were already doing a very large business and mr willcox had sent down orders both to st louis and new orleans for fresh consignments of stores very greatly exceeding those which he had brought up with him  three months previously omaha had been a tiny settlement of a dozen houses but was rapidly growing into a considerable place  many stores were rising but the distance from the inhabited settlements and the difficulties of carriage were enormous the population was for the most part a floating one scores of waggons and vehicles of all sorts arriving every day while as many departed this was the last point of civilisation and here the emigrants generally halted for a few days to rest their weary cattle and to fill up their stores of provisions for the journey across the wilderness  all believed that a vast fortune awaited them on the other side of the continent and the most fabulous tales of the abundance of gold were circulated and believed in some cases the parties consisted only of men who had clubbed together and purchased a waggon and started leaving their wives and families behind them in others they were composed of whole families who had sold off farms or businesses in the east in the assurance of acquiring a fortune at the golddiggings around the little settlement the plain was dotted with the white tilts of the waggons mingled with the tents which had been extemporised of sailcloth tarpaulins and blankets     illustration  chapter ix  on the plains   i think now that you can spare me mr willcox frank said just a month after the day of landing the store has got into swing now the two negroes know their work well and everything is going on smoothly therefore if you have no objection i shall see about making a start  i shall be sorry to lose you mr willcox said but as you say the place will run itself now i shall go down by the next steamer and send up two more storekeepers and a clerk from my office there this is going to be a big thing well lad heres the money you gave me to take care of and the two hundred dollars due to you i will give orders to simpson that you are to take everything you can require for your journey from the store and mind dont stint yourself you have done rightdown good service here and i feel very much indebted to you for the way you have stuck to me at this pinch i wish you every luck lad and i hope some day that rascally affair at home will be cleared up and that you can go back again cleared of that ugly charge anyhow it is well for you to make your way out here it will be a satisfaction for you if you do go back to have shown that you were dependent on no one but that you could fight your own way and make your living by the aid of your own hands and your own brain and now look here if at any time you get sick of golddigging as you very well may and want to turn your hand to anything elseand in a country like that mind you with a population pouring in from all parts there will be big opportunitiesif you want capital to start you just you send a letter to david willcox new orleans and tell me you have drawn on me for five thousand dollars i am a rich man lad and have no children of my own i have some nephews and nieces who will get my money some day but i can do what i like with it and you will be heartily welcome to the sum i mention i have taken a fancy to you and it will be a real pleasure to me to help you if you do well you can some day send the money back if you like if you dont do well theres an end of it dont let it trouble you for a moment for it certainly wont trouble me and be sure you dont hesitate to draw it when you want it remember i shant regard it as an obligation but it will be a real genuine pleasure to me to cash that order  frank thanked mr willcox very heartily for his kind offer of which he promised to avail himself should an opportunity arise and in any case to write to him occasionally to tell him how he was getting on then he strolled out to examine the great gathering round the settlement which hitherto he had had no time to do having been at work from daybreak until late at night as he wandered among the motley throng of emigrants he was struck with the hopefulness which everywhere prevailed and could not but feel that many of them were doomed to disappointment many of them were storekeepers men who had never done a days work in their life some were aged men encumbered with wives and large families and frank wondered how these would ever survive the terrible journey across the plains even if they escaped all molestation from the marauding indians he paused for a moment near four men who were seated round a fire cooking their meals  all were sturdy sunburnt men who looked inured to hardship and work the fact that all were animated by a common impulse rendered every one friendly and communicative and frank was at once invited to sit down  of course you are going through young fellow  yes frank said i am going to try  got a horse i suppose  yes frank said a riding horse and a pony for my baggage  we calls it swag out on the plains one said we dont talk of baggage here are you with any one  no frank replied i am alone but i am open to join some party i suppose there will be no difficulty about that  none on airth the other answered the stronger the better in course you have a rifle besides that colt in your belt  yes frank replied but i suppose all this indian talk is exaggeration and there is not much danger from them  dont you go to think it young man the injins is thar you bet and no mistake and a big grist of scalps they will take the news of this here percession across the plains will bring them down as thick as bees on the track and i tell you there will be some tough fights afore we get across  have you had much experience of the plains frank asked  we are hunters the other said briefly and have been out there more or less since we were boys we knows what injins is and have fought them agin and agin but none of us have ever made this journeyindeed there warnt five men who had ever crossed the rockies by the northern track afore the gold scare began but i know enough of the country to know as it will be a fearful journey and full half of these people as you see fooling about here as if they were out for a summer excursion will leave their bones by the way  you dont really think things are as bad as that frank said  i does the other replied emphatically what with injins and want of food and water and fatigue and the journey across the plains it will want all a man to make the journey we four means to get through and are bound to do it but as for this crowd you see here god help them  do you mean to go with one of the caravans or start alone  there is a lot going on tomorrow and we shall join them we may be of some use for the best part of them are no better than a flock of sheep and four good hands may keep them out of some mischief but i expect we shall have to push on by ourselves before the journey is over  i am intending to go on tomorrow also frank said and i hope you wont mind giving me some instructions in the ways of the wilderness which are i own altogether new to me  all right young fellow we shall see you on the road and if you likes to chum up with us you may for i likes yer looks and you seems to be one of the right sort  frank said that he would gladly chum with them if they would allow him and the next morning at daybreak having said adieu to mr willcox he saddled his horse and loaded up his pony and moved across to the spot where his new acquaintances were encamped they were preparing for a start all had good riding horses while two baggage animals carried the provisions for the party the caravan which they intended to accompany was already far out on the plain  they are off in good time frank said i did not think they would manage to move till midday  no more they would one of the hunters said but the chap as is bossing the team moved them off yesterday evening and got them a mile out of camp so they were able to start right off the first thing this morning  in a few minutes they were on horseback and riding at easy pace for the sake of the baggagehorses they overtook the caravan in two hours it consisted of fourteen waggons and four or five light carts with tilts over them the waggons were all drawn by oxen having six eight or ten according to their size or weight the men walked by the side of their cattle the greater part of the women and children trudged along behind the waggons while a few with babies were seated within them from time to time one of the men or boys would set up a song and all would join in the chorus one of these was ringing out in the air when the hunters joined them  poor critturs the eldest of the hunters who was called abe by the others said they are as lighthearted as if they war agoing to a camp meeting they dont know whats afore them  the party rode on to the head of the waggons where the oxen were led by the man who was regarded as the head of the party he had at one time been a hunter but had married and settled down on a farm two sons nearly grownup walked by his side he had been chosen as leader by the rest as being the only one of the party who had any previous knowledge of the plains and their dangers and difficulties  well mate abe said i told you two days ago that i thought that we should go on with your lot and here we are i dont say as how we shall go all the way with you that will depend upon circumstances at any rate we will stay with ye for a bit now my proposal is this you shall hitch our three baggagehorses on behind your waggons and tell off one of the boys to look after them we shall hunt as we go along and what meat there is will be for the service of the camp but if we supply you with meat it will only be fair that you supply us with flour and tea  thats a bargain the man said you bring us in meat and we will supply you with everything else and i neednt tell you how glad i am to have you with me five extra rifles may make all the difference if we are attacked we have got about twenty rifles in camp but that aint much as with women and children we count up to nigh sixty souls and none of us here except myself have had any experience of indian ways  thats fixed then abe said at any rate you need not be afraid of a surprise so long as we are with you  the addition to their party gave great satisfaction to the whole caravan of flour and bacon they had ample stores to last them upon their long journey and the prospect of a supply of fresh meat was exceedingly welcome still more was the thought that the hunters would be able to warn them against any surprise by the indians and would in case of the worst aid them in their defence  the hunters were equally satisfied their supplies were quite insufficient for the journey and they were now free from the necessity of accommodating their pace to that of the baggagehorses their progress would indeed be slower than it would have been had they journeyed alone but time was a matter of no importance to them even in the matter of indian surprises they were better off than they would have been had they been alone in case of meeting these marauders they must have abandoned their baggageanimals and their prospects either of flight or defence would have been poor had they met with a large body when alone whereas the force with the caravan could defend the waggons against even a resolute attack of the redskins there was no occasion for the hunters to set out in the pursuit of game for the first day or two as a supply of fresh meat had been brought from omaha they therefore rode with the caravan making the acquaintance of its various members  one of the women had volunteered to cook for them and thus when they encamped on the banks of a small stream they had only to attend to the watering of their animals while the meal was preparing they walked about in the camp and gave many hints to the women as to the best way of preparing fires these were gratefully received for the emigrants were wholly unaccustomed to cooking without the usual appliances and their efforts in many cases had been very clumsy and unsuccessful they were surprised to find that by digging a trench in the direction from which the wind was blowing and covering it over with sods they could get a draught to their fire equal to that which they could obtain in a grate while by building a low wall of sod close to leeward of the fire they prevented the flames from being driven away and concentrated them upon their pots and kettles  it does not matter for tonight abe said to the leader nor for a good many nights to come but if i was you i should begin tomorrow to make em arrange the waggons in proper form the same as if we was in the injin country it aint no more trouble and theres nothing like beginning the right way  you are right the man said tomorrow night we will pitch them in good form but for a time there will be no occasion for the cattle to be driven in every night the longer they have to graze the better  thats so abe said they will want all their condition for the bad country further on  the following day the hunters left the camp early there was little chance of finding game anywhere near the line which they were following for the wild animals would have been scared away by the constantly passing caravans after riding for ten miles they began to keep a watchful eye over the country which although flat to the eye was really slightly undulating proceeding at an easy pace they rode on for upwards of an hour then dick one of the hunters suddenly drew rein  what is it dick abe asked  illustration a deerhunt on the prairie  i saw a horn over there to the left or i am mistaken the hunter said  we will see anyhow abe said fortunately we are down wind now you had better stop behind this time young fellow and watch us  in a moment the four men dismounted and threw their reins on the horses necksa signal which all horses on the plains know to be an order that they are not to move awayand the animals at once began cropping the grass for a short distance the men walked forward and then as they neared the brow over which dick declared he had seen the horn they went down on all fours and finally when close to the brow on their stomachs  very slowly they drew themselves along frank looked on with the greatest attention and interest and presently saw them halt while abe proceeded alone he lifted up his head slightly and immediately laid it down again while the other three crawled up close to him there was a moments pause then the guns were thrust forward and each slightly raised himself  a moment later the four rifles flashed and the men sprang to their feet and disappeared over the brow frank rode forward at full speed to the spot and arrived there just in time to see a number of deer dashing at full speed far across the plain while the four hunters were gathered round three dead stags in the hollow the hunters shots had all told but two had fired at the same animal the bulletholes being close to each other behind the shoulder  dick was right you see abe said it was lucky he caught sight of that horn for we might not have come upon another herd today now we will make our way on to the campingground we can go easy for we shall be there long before the teams  their horses were brought up and the deer placed upon them the hunters then mounted and took their way in the direction of the spot where the caravans would encamp for the night  i understand how you find your way now because the sun is up frank said but i cannot understand how you would do it on a cloudy day across a flat country like this without landmarks  its easier to do than it is to explain it abe said in the first place theres the wind it most always blows here and one only has to keep that in a certain quarter if there aint no wind theres the grass and the bushes if you look at these bushes you will see that they most all turn a little from the direction in which the wind generally blows and this grass which is in seed droops over the same way then in course there is the general direction of the valleys and of any little streams all of these are things one goes by at first but it gets to come natural what they call by instinct one knows somehow which is the way to go without looking for signs you will get to it in time if you are long enough on the plains but at present you watch the forms of all the bushes and the lay of the grass cause you see in hunting we might get separated and you might miss your way if you should do so and aint sure of your direction fire your gun three times as quick as you can load it and if we are in hearing we will fire a gun in reply and come to you but you will soon get to know the signs of the country if you will pay attention and keep your eyes skinned  they arrived at the stream fixed upon for the campingground early in the afternoon the point at which the caravans would cross it was plain enough for the waggons all travelled by the same line and the trail was strongly marked by the ruts of wheels where the ground was soft by broken bushes and trampled herbage the saddles were taken off the horses and these were allowed to graze at will those of the hunters were too welltrained to wander far and franks horse was certain to keep with the others  late in the afternoon the waggons arrived it had been a long march of more than twenty miles and men and beasts were alike tired the women and children had during the latter part of the journey ridden in the waggons there was a general feeling of satisfaction at the sight of the hunters and their spoil and at the blazing fire over which a portion of the meat was already roasting the oxen were unharnessed and watered the waggons were ranged six on each side and two across one end the other end being left open for convenience across this the light carts were to be drawn at night the deer were skinned cut up and divided among the various families in proportion to their numbers  for two months the caravan moved forward without adventure the hunters kept it well provided with game which was now very plentiful very disquieting rumours were afloat along the road these were brought down by the express riders who carried the mails across the plains and for whose accommodation small stations were provided twenty or thirty miles apart and as these were placed where water was procurable they were generally selected as campinggrounds by the emigrants  the tales of indian forays which had at first been little more than rumours were now confirmed the express riders reported that the indians were out in large numbers and that many attacks had been made upon parties of emigrants sometimes successfully and involving the massacre of every soul in them the caravan was still some distance from the scene of these attacks but as the indians ranged over the whole plains it could not be said that they were beyond the risk of assault acting under the hunters advice the caravan now moved in much closer order the waggons advancing two abreast so that they could be formed in position for defence at the shortest notice and the rifles were always kept loaded and strapped on the outsides of the waggons in readiness for instant use  frank had by this time become an adept in hunting and though still very far behind his companions in skill with the rifle was able to make a fair contribution towards the provisioning of the camp the hunters now divided into two parties three going out in search of game on one side of the line of march two on the other they thus acted as scouts on either side and would be able to bring in word should any suspicious signs be observed several small herds of buffalo had been met with and a sufficient number killed to provide the party with meat for some time to come  frank had never passed a more enjoyable time than those two months of travel the air was clear bright and exhilarating the long days spent in the saddle and the excitement of the chase seemed to quicken his pulse and to fill him with a new feeling of strength and life his appetite was prodigious and he enjoyed the roughly cooked meals round the blazing fire of an evening as he had never enjoyed food before the country was it is true for the most part monotonous with its long low undulations and the bare sweeps unbroken by tree or bush but there was always something new and interesting to be seenfor frank was fond of natural history and the habits and ways of the wild creatures of the prairie were full of interest for him his companions although taciturn when on horseback and engaged in scouting the country or in hunting were full of anecdote as they sat round the fire of an evening and frank heard many a story of wild adventure with the indians or in the chase  when they returned early to the camp there was plenty of amusement in wandering about among the waggons watching the various groups engaged at their work as unconcernedly as if they had been still in their little farms among the settlements instead of on the plains with months of toilsome and dangerous journey before them some of the women cooked while others mended their clothes and those of their husbands and children while the men attended to the oxen or made such repairs as were needed to the waggons and harness  as for the children the life suited them admirably to them it was a continual picnic without school or lessons and yet they too had their share of the work for as soon as the waggons halted all save the very little ones started at once over the plain to search for the dried buffalo dung or as it was called chips which formed the staple of the fires for wood was very scarce and that in the neighbourhood of the campinggrounds which were always at a stream or waterhole had long since been cleared off by the travellers who had preceded them the chips afforded excellent fuel burning with a fierce steady glow and making a fire something like that afforded by welldried peat another source of fuel were the bones which lay in many places scattered pretty thickly sometimes these marked the spot where long before a party of indians had come upon a herd of buffalo sometimes they were remains of the cattle of caravans which had preceded them these were often quite fresh the herds of coyotes stripping off the flesh of any animals that fell by the way and leaving nothing in the course of a day or two after their death but the bare bones whenever the caravan came upon such a skeleton upon the line of march the men broke it up and flung the bones into one of the waggons for the nights fire  sometimes as they got well on in their journey they came to patches of soapweed a vegetable of soft pulpy nature which grows to a considerable height and dies from the bottom retaining its greenness of appearance long after the stem has become brown and withered it burns freely with a brilliant flame the women of the party rejoiced when a clump of soapweed was discovered and it was always the occasion of a general wash as by immersing some of it in water it had all the properties of soap except that it did not make the lather which distinguishes the real article but in places where the soapweed was not to be found and chips were scarce the hunters did their best to supply fuel and would generally bring home large bundles of wood upon such of the horses as were not carrying game  the childrens greatest delight was when the camp happened to be pitched near a prairiedog town and they were never weary of watching the antics of these funny little creatures some of these towns were of considerable extent the ground within their circle being quite bare of herbage from their scratching and the constant scampering of their little feet and covered thickly with the mounds which marked the entrances to the innumerable holes the prairiedogs themselves were about the size of rabbits but seemed to frank from their quick jerking motions and their habit of sitting up on their hindlegs to resemble squirrels more than any other animal they were as much interested in the travellers as the latter were with them almost every mound having its occupant sitting up watching them inquisitively there were four or five dogs with the caravan and until the novelty had passed off and they became convinced of the utter futility of the chase the dogs exhausted themselves in their endeavours to capture the prairiedogs these seemed to feel an absolute enjoyment in exasperating the dogs sitting immovable until the latter were within a few yards of them and then suddenly disappearing like a flash of lightning down their holes popping their heads out again and resuming their position on the tops as soon as the dogs had dashed off in another direction  but the prairiedogs were not the only occupants of the towns with them apparently on terms of great friendship lived a colony of little owls sharing their abodes and sitting with them on their hillocks there were also a third species of inhabitant and the presence of these caused strict orders to be given to the children not to wander over the ground these were rattlesnakes of which on a sunny afternoon many could be seen basking on the sandheaps  yes you always find the three together abe said in answer to franks question and how such contrary things get to be friends is more nor i can tell sartin they must eat each other there aint anything else for em to eat the prairiedogs air a puzzle you never see em any distance beyond thar towns and yet they must live on grass and roots the owls no doubt live on little prairiedogs and the rattlesnakes may sometimes eat an old one still there it is they never seem afraid of each other and no one as far as i knows has ever seen a prairie dog fifty yards away from his town the rummest thing about them is as every town has got its well the prairiedogs have all got their holes and though you may see em going about popping in and out of each others houses i fancy as they always keep to their own but theres one hole which they all use and that goes down to the water no matter how deep it is they takes it down i fancy the whole lot digs at it by turns till they get there you will see thar towns are always on lowish ground so that they can get down to water all the sooner thats why they build up those mounds round each hole  i thought it was just the earth they had thrown out abe  so it is partly but it serves to keep the water out in the wet season too if you watch em you can see em building the earth up and patting it down hard if it gets broken down sometimes in very wet weather thar will be a flood and then the whole lot dogs and owls and snakes get drowned all together mighty nasty places they are i tell yer when they are desarted at other times you can see em plain enough and can ride through em at a gallop for the horses are accustomed to pick thar way but after a year or two when the grass grows again and is breast high in summer and you come across one of them the first you know about it is the horse puts his foot in a hole and you are flying through the air many a fall have i had from them darned little things  are they good eating abe  yes they aint bad eating and if you lie down quiet and shoot straight you aint long in making a bag but you have got to kill em to get em if you dont put your bullet through thar head they just chucks themselves straight down the hole and it would take an hours digging and it may be more to get at em  there seems to be a tremendous lot of rattlesnakes in some places abe  thar are that lad i have seen places where you might kill a hundred in an hour with your colt thar are two sorts them as you finds on the plains and them as you finds among rocks one are twice as big as the other but thar aint much difference in thar bite  is it always fatal abe  not often lad either to man or horse though i have known horses die when they have been bit in the head when they have been grazing the best thing is to tie a bandage tightly above the place and to clap on a poultice of fresh dungthat draws out the poison and then if you have got it drink half a bottle of spirits it aint often we get bit because of these high boots but the injins get bit sometimes and i never heard of thar dying the only thing as we are regular feered of out in these plains is a little beast they call the hydrophobia cat  i never heard of that what is it like abe  it is a pretty little beast marked black and white and about the size of a big weasel it has got a way of coming and biting you when you are asleep and when it does it is sartin death thar aint no cure for it the best plan is to put your colt to your head and finish it at once  what horrible little beasts frank said i hope they are not common  no they aint common and theres more danger from them down south if you sleeps in an old mexican hut thats been deserted or places of that sort its best to look sharp round afore you goes to sleep  the game most commonly met with were the blacktailed and whitetailed deer these were generally met with in parties of from six to twelve and were usually stalked although sometimes by dividing and taking a wide circle they could manage to ride them down and get within shot this could seldom be done with the antelope which ran in much larger herds but were so suspicious and watchful that there was no getting within shot while once in motion they could leave the horses behind with ease the only way in which they could get them would be by acting upon their curiosity one or two of the hunters would dismount and crawl through the grass until within three or four hundred yards of the herd then they would lie on their backs and wave their legs in the air or wave a coloured blanket as they lay concealed in the grass the herd would stop grazing and look on curiously and gradually approach nearer and nearer to investigate this strange phenomenon until they came well within shot when the hunters would leap to their feet and send their unerring bullets among them  you would hardly believe now peter said one day when he and frank had brought down two fine antelopes by this manoeuvre that the coyotes are just as much up to that trick as we are they havent got a chance with the deer when they are once moving although sometimes they may pick up a fawn a few days old or a stag that has got injured but when they want deermeat they just act the same game as we have been doing over and over again have i seen them at their tricks two of them will play them together they will creep up through the grass till they can get to a spot where the antelope can see them and then they will just act as if they were mad rolling over on their backs waving their legs about twisting and rolling like balls and playing the fool till the antelope comes up to see what is the matter they let them come on till they are only a few yards away and then they are on one like a flash before he has time to turn and get up his speed one will catch him by a leg and the other will get at his throat and between them they soon pull him down they will sham dead too wonderful cute beasts is them coyotes they are just about the sharpest beasts as live  do they live entirely upon deer  bless you no they will eat anything they hang about behind the great buffalo herds and eat them as drops where there are such tens of thousands there is always some as is old or injured and cant keep up besides sometimes they get scared and then they will run over a bluff and get piled up there dead by hundreds the coyotes pick the bones of every beast as dies in the plains the badgers helps them a bit there are lots of those about in some places     illustration  chapter x  a buffalo story   sometimes instead of taking his rifle and accompanying the other hunters frank would borrow a shotgun and go out on foot and return with a good bag of prairiefowl birds resembling grouse occasionally in the canyons or wooded valleys far away from the track the hunters came across the trail of wild turkeys then two of them would camp out for the night and search under the trees until they saw the birds perched on the boughs above them and would bring into camp in the morning half a dozen dangling from each of their saddles frequently in their rides they came across skunks pretty black and white little animals frank was about to shoot the first he saw but peter who was with him shouted to him not to fire  its a skunk he said it aint no use wasting your powder on that varmin why if you were to kill him and went to take it up you wouldnt be fit to go into camp for a week you would stink that bad no one couldnt come near you they are wuss than pizen skunks why i have seen dogs sit up and howl with disgust after interfering with one of them i dont say as they cant be eaten cos the indians eat them and for the matter of that i have ate them myself but they have to be killed plump dead and then the stinkbag has to be cut out from them directly but if you aint hard pressed for food i advise you to let skunks alone  the first time that they came across a large herd of buffalo was a day frank long remembered he was out with the four hunters they had just scampered to the top of one of the swells when they simultaneously reined in their horses for the valleyhalf a mile widein front of them was filled with a dark mass of moving animals extending back for two or three miles  there frank abe said there is meat for youenough for an army for months  frank was too surprised to speak for a time the number seemed countless  what a wonderful sight he exclaimed at last  ay that it is lad to one who has never seen it afore and to think that thar are scores of herds like that out on these plains its one of the mightiest sights of natur but its nothing to see em now going along quiet to what it is to see em when they are on the stampede when the ground shakes with thar tread and the air seems in a quiver with thar bellowing thar dont seem nothing as could stop em and thar aint if its a river they pours into it if its a bluff they goes over it and tens of thousands of them gets killed the injins is mighty wasteful of thar flesh but i doubt whether all the injins in the continent kills as many as kills themselves in them wild stampedes we will just wait where we are until they are past and then we will drop down on em and cut three or four of em off we will take one apiece that will give us as much flesh as the waggons can load up and i dont hold to taking life unless the meats wanted now lad all that you have got to do is when you ride down just single out your beast ride alongside of him and empty your colt behind his shoulder keep rather behind him and have your horse well in hand to wheel if he twists round and charges you  a few minutes later the signal was given and the five horsemen dashed down the slope a deep bellow proclaimed that the herd had become aware of the presence of their enemies the leisurely pace at which they were proceeding changed instantly into a gallop on the part of those conscious of danger the impulse was communicated to those in front and in a few seconds the whole herd was tearing along like a mighty torrent  but they were too late to escape the hunters who came down upon their rear and each proceeded to single out an animal following abes instructions frank ranged up alongside a fine bull and opened fire with his revolver at a point just behind the shoulder at the third shot the great beast swerved sharply round and had not frank been on the alert he would have lost his seat so sharply did the horse wheel to avoid the animals horns the buffalo at once resumed its course behind the herd but frank was soon alongside again and as he fired the last shot of his revolver had the satisfaction of seeing the great beast stagger and then fall prostrate he at once reined in his horse and looked round his companions were all some distance in the rear having brought down their game with less expenditure of lead knowing exactly the right spot where a wound would be fatal  thats a fair lot of meat abe said as they gathered into a group that will last em a long time now if we had been injins we should have gone on shooting and shooting till we had killed a score or more and then taken just the best bits and left the rest for the coyotes but i call it downright wicked to waste meat kill what you wantthats natural and right but i am agin drawing a bead on an animal whether he be buffalo or deer or whatnot onless you want his meat or onless his hide be of value to you if men acted on that thar rule there would be game on these plains for any time its wilful destruction as is clearing em out not fair hunting  now we will ride off and stop the teams as they come along and bring em round here it wont be so very far out of thar way we can stop a couple of days to cut up and dry the meat the rest will do the cattle good and theres nothing like having a supply of dried meat i dont say its as toothsome as fresh but it aint ter be despised and the time may come in fact its pretty sure to come when we shant be able to do much hunting round the waggons we are getting nigh the country where we may expect to meet with injin troubles its just as well we met with this herd afore we got thar for we should have been pretty sure to find a party of them hanging on the rear of the buffalo  three hours later the waggons arrived at the spot the emigrants in high spirits at the news that such an abundant supply of meat had been procured the hunters skinned and cut up the five buffaloes the waggons were placed some fifteen yards apart and several cords stretched tightly between them upon these was hung the flesh which was cut in strips some four inches wide and half an inch thick by the end of the third day the whole of the meat was dried by the united action of the sun and wind the skins had been pegged out in the sun and some of the boys under abes instructions roughly cured them first scraping them inside and then rubbing them with fat mixed with salt  its a rough way abe said and the injin women would laugh to see it they just rub and rub at them till they get them as soft and pliable as the leather they make gloves of east still they will keep as they are and will do to chuck in the bottom of the waggons for the women and children to sit upon besides we shall find it cold at night as we get on and a buffalorobe aint to be despisedeven if it aint dressed to perfection when they dry and get stiff the boys can take another rub at em when we halts it will give them something to do and keep them out of mischief  talking of buffalo abe began as the hunters were sitting round the fire on the evening of the hunt that reminds me that it wasnt so very far from this har spot that me and rube was nearly wiped out by the utes some ten years ago rube he was a young chap then and had not been long out on the plains we war hunting with a party of cheyennes and had been with them wellnigh all the summer one day we war in pursuit of buffalothey were plentiful then you think they are plentiful now but you would see ten herds then for every one you see now but they are going and i expect in another twenty years that a man might ride across the plains and never catch sight of a hump if the gold turns out to be as rich as they say there will be hundreds of thousands of people cross these plains and like enough settlements be formed right across the continent however there war plenty of herds ten years ago  we had come upon a big herd and was chasing them i had singled out an old bull and had pushed right into the herd after him rube he was pretty close to me well i came up to the bull and put a rifleball between his ribs the herd had rather separated as we got amongst them making way for us right and left as we rode after the bull as he fell we reined in our horses and looked round not a cheyenne was to be seen five minutes afore they had been hanging on the herd sending their arrows in up to the feather among the buffalo now not a soul was to be seen you may guess this staggered me and i says to rube look out rube theres something up as sure as fate  well i had scarcely spoken afore i saw a big party of injins come charging down across our rear utes says i by thunder they are after the cheyennes fling yourself flat on your horse rube and get into the herd  the buffalo war only fifty yards away yet and yer may be sure we spurred up pretty sharp till we got up to them i seed at once it was our only chance our horses war blowed for we had had a sharp chase afore we caught the herd and there was no chance of our getting away from the utes in the open plains we soon caught up the herd and charged in among them the brutes were packed so close together that they could hardly make room for us but we managed to wedge ourselves in those next to us snuffed and roared but they war too pressed by those behind to do much but by shouting and waving our hats we managed to keep a clear space three or four yards on either side of us all this time we war lying down on our horses necks and there war no fear that any one would see us in the midst of that sea of tossing cattle but i war afraid they would have caught sight of us afore we got among em i cussed myself for having fired that last shot they must have heard it and would have known that some of us hadnt seen them coming and must be somewhere among the herd  i raised my head a little at last and took a look round sure enough there was a dozen utes coming up behind the herd i puts spurs again into my horse and catching up an old bull in front of me progged him with my bowieknife and rube did the same to the beast next to him they gave a roar and plunged on ahead through the mass and we followed close to their heels it was tight work i can tell you for the buffaloes on both sides war touching one another we kept going about half a length behind the beasts next to us so that the horses shoulders war just behind the shoulders of the buffaloes as you know the buffaloes have got no necks to speak of and so although they gave savage thrusts with their horns they couldnt get at the horses our beasts were frightened near out of their lives but they war well broken and we managed to keep em in hand  the thing i was most afraid of was that they would be knocked off their legs and in that case we should be trampled to death in a minute as i leaned forward i kept one hand fixed on the neck of the buffalo next me and i shouted to rube to do the same so as we could make a shift to jump on to the buffalos back if our horses fell but i tell you i was beginning to fear that we shouldnt see any way out of it what with us in the middle and the utes yelling behind them the herd war fairly mad with fright and there war no saying where they would go to for you know a herd of buffaloes when fairly stampeded will go clean over a precipice a hundred yards high and pile themselves up dead at the foot till there is not one left it war a bad fix you bet for i war sure that the utes war after us and not after the buffaloes for they kept on though they could soon have killed as many of the herd as they wanted it was may be four in the afternoon when the chase commenced and so it went on till it was dark the buffaloes war going nigh as fast as when we started but the horses could scarce keep their legs i was sure they couldnt run much longer so i says to rube we must get out of this or else we shall be done for  so we sets to work aprobing the buffalo with our knives again they started on ahead as hard as they could bursting a way through the crowd we followed close behind them keeping up the scare until we finds ourselves in front of the herd then we spurred our horses on and dashed out in front done as the horses were they knew they had got to go for with the herd coming like thunder upon their heels it was death to stop we swerved away to the right but it took us half an hour afore we war clear of the front of the herd we went a few hundred yards further and then drew rein  rubes horse fell dead as he stopped and mine wasnt worth much more for half an hour we could hear the herd rushing along and then it had passed we had got out of our biggest fix but it warnt a pleasant position  there we war out on the plains with only one horse between us and he so done up that he couldnt put one foot afore the other  where the cheyennes war there was no saying the band might have been wiped out by the utes or they might have got away at any rate there was no counting on them the utes who had followed the herd would be sure to be on our trail in the morning they would follow all night or as long as the herd ran when the buffalo war fairly tired out they would lay down and the utes would see then as we warnt there then they would set out upon the backtrail skirting along each side of the line trampled by the herd until they came upon our trail the dead horse was a sign as they could see a mile away so it was clear that we must foot it as soon as we could we gave the horse an hours rest and it did us as much good as him for i can tell you we war pretty well used up we drove him afore us until after six hours walking we came to a stream we went up this for an hour then we both filled our huntingshirts with stones and fastened them on the horse and then drove him off  what did you put the stones on his back for frank asked  to make the utes think as he was carrying double each of the loads was about the weight of a man and the horse was so tired that he staggered as he walked so as they would see his tracks and wouldnt see ours they would naturally come to the conclusion as we war both on his back it warnt likely as the critter would go far before he laid down perhaps not more than half a mile but that would do for us we went back a few hundred yards in the stream and then struck off across the prairie the same side as we had come from taking care to make as little sign as possible  the utes would be riding along by the side of the stream and looking for a horses print and the chances war that they wouldnt see ours when they came up to the horse and found out the trick they would gallop back again at least half of them would go up the stream and half would take the backtrack but you see as they went up they would have trampled across our track and they would find it mighty hard work to pick it up again  we footed it all day and the prospect warnt a pleasant one the nearest settlement was nigh a thousand miles away we had no horses and we darent fire a gun for fear of bringing utes down upon us we had made up our minds to strike for the cheyennes country that being the nearest where we could expect to find friends for two days we tramped on the third day we war sitting by the side of a stream eating a prairiedog as we had trapped when rube stopped eating suddenly and said listen  i threw myself down and put my ear to the ground and sure enough could hear the gallop of horses injins says i and chucks a lot of wet sand and gravel over the fire which was fortunately a small one i knew in course if they came close that way as they would see it but if they passed at some distance they would not notice us then rube and i bounded into the water and laid down close under a high bank where the grass grew long and drooped over to the water so as to cover our heads  we heard the redskins coming nearer and nearer and they stopped at the stream a quarter of a mile or so above us we listened i can tell you for the sound of their going on again but no such luck and after a quarter of an hour we knew as they were going to camp there i felt pretty thankful as it was late in the afternoon for i guessed in the first place as they would light their fire and cook their food so none of them war likely to be coming down our way until it was after dark  we waited and waited till it got quite dark then we followed the stream down for another four or five miles and then took to the plains again it was another three days afore we fell in with a party of cheyennes it seemed as how most of those we had been with had been killed by the utes the others had taken the news home and the whole tribe had been turned out we war pretty well done up but the chief dismounted two of his men and put us on their horses and we set off at once we knew pretty well the line that the party as was following us had taken and the next night we saw the fires of their camp and you bet not one of them went home to tell the tale  that was a narrow escape indeed abe frank said  it war all that it war lucky that it war late afore the hunt began if it had been early in the day nothing could have saved usonless of course our horses had been fresh and faster than those of the utes and then we should have made straight away instead of getting into the herd  they dont seem to go as fast as a horse abe i seemed to keep up quite easily with that bull i shot  yes for a burst a horse is faster than a buffalo but when they once gets going on a downright stampede they will tire out any horse and go wellnigh as fast too i tell you you have to be pretty spry even if you are wellmounted when a downright big herd well on the stampede comes on you its a terrible sight and it makes one tingle i can tell you especially as the horse is pretty nigh mad with fear  it must be as bad as a prairie fire  worse my lad ever so much worse you can see a prairie fire fifty miles awaymore nor that at night ever so muchand you have plenty of time to set the grass afire ahead of you and clear the ground afore it comes up though it does travel when the wind is blowing much faster than a horse can gallop i have seen it go thirty miles an hour the flames just leaping out ahead of it and setting grass alight a hundred yards before the main body of the fire came up i tell you it is a terrible sight when the grass has just dried and is breasthigh but as i say there aint no cause to be afraid if you do but keep your head you just pulls up a band of grass a couple of feet wide and lights it ahead of you the wind naturally takes it away from you and you look sharp with blanket or leggings to beat it down and prevent it working back agin the wind across the bit of ground you have stripped as it goes it widens out right and left and you have soon got a wide strip cleared in front of you in course you dont go on to it as long as you can help it not till you are drove by the other fire coming up that gives it time to cool a bit if you must go on soon owing to being pressed or from the fire you have lit working round agin the windas it will do if the grass is very drythe best plan is to cut up your leggings or any bit of hide you have got with you the rawer the better and wrap them round your horses feet and legs but it aint often necessary to do that as it dont take long for the ashes to cool enough so as to stand on  fortunately a bottom with good grass had been found close at hand to the place where they encamped and when the caravan proceeded the draft oxen were all the better for their two days rest  we shall have to begin to look out pretty sharp for injin signs abe said as they started early next morning fresh meat is good but we can do without it theres enough pork and jerked meat in the waggons to last pretty nigh across the plains but we are getting where we may expect injins in earnest we might in course have met em anywhere but as they know the caravans have all got to come across their ground it dont stand to reason as they would take the trouble to travel very far east to meet em i dont say as we wont knock down a stag now and agin if we comes across em but the less firing the better we have been hunting up till now but we must calculate that for the rest of the journey we are going to be hunted and if we dont want our scalps taken not to talk of all these women and children we have got to look out pretty spry i reckon we can beat them off in anything like a fair fightthat is provided we have got time to get ready before they are on us and it depends on us whether we do have time or not     illustration  chapter xi  how dick lost his scalp   two or three days after they had moved from their last haltingplace when they were sitting at the fire one evening and abe had been telling a yarn of adventure he said when he had finished  about the closest thing as i know was that adventure that dick thar had dick take off that thar wig of yourn  the hunter put his hand to his head and lifted at once his cap made of skin and the hair beneath it showing to franks astonishment a head without a vestige of hair and presenting the appearance of a strange scar mottled with a deep purple as if it was the result of a terrible burn  you see i have been scalped the hunter said i dont suppose you noticed itfew people do you see i never takes off my fur cap night or day so that no one can see as i wears a wig  theres nought to be ashamed of in it abe said for it is as honourable a scalp as ever a man got do you tell the story dick  you know it as well as i do the hunter replied and i aint good at talking  well i will tell you it then abe said seeing that i knows almost as much about it as dick does the affair occurred the very year after what i have been telling you about dick was attached as hunter and scout to fort charles which was at that time one of the furthest west of all our stations there was fifty infantry and thirty cavalry there and little enough too for it war just on the edge of the dacota country the dacotas are a powerful tribe and are one of the most restless troublesome lots i knows several strong parties of our troops have been surprised and cut to pieces by them and as to settlements no one but a born fool would dream of settling within reach of them  i never could quite make out why we wanted to put a fort down so close to them seeing as there warnt a settlement to protect within a hundred and fifty miles but i suppose the wiseacres at washington had some sort of an idea that the redskins would be afraid to make excursions to the settlements with this fort in their rear just as if they couldnt make a sweep of five hundred miles if they took it into their heads and come back into their country on the other side  just at that time there was no trouble with them the hatchet was buried and they used to come into the fort and sell skins and furs to the traders there for tobacco and beads after that affair i was telling ye of rube and me we went back for a spell to the settlement and then took a fancy to hunt on another line and after knocking about for a time found ourselves at fort charles that was where we met dick for the first time  the commander of the fort was a chap named white a captain he had with him his wife and daughter a worse kind of man for the commander of a frontier station you could hardly find he was not a bad soldier and was well liked by his men and i have no doubt if he had been fighting agin other white men he would have done well enough but he never seemed to have an idee what injin nature was like and werent never likely to learn  first place he despised them now you know the redskins aint to be despised you may hate them you may say they are a cussed lot of rascals and thieves but there aint no despising them and any one as does that is sure to have cause to repent it sooner or later there was the less reason with the dacotas for they had cut up stronger bodies of troops than there was at fort charles without letting a soul escape then partly because the captain despised them i suppose he was always hurting their feelings  now a chief is a chief and a man who can bring three hundred horsemen into the field whether he is redskin or white is a man to whom a certain respect should be paid but captain white never seemed to see that but just treated one redskin like another just as if they war dirt beneath his feet well as i told you he had with him his wife and daughter his wife was too fine a lady for a frontier fort still she was not badly liked but as to the daughter there warnt a man in the fort but would have died for her she war about fifteen year old and as pretty as a flower she war always bright and merry with a kind word to the soldiers as she rode past them on her pretty white mustang  dick here he worshipped her like the rest of us if he got a particular good skin or anything else if he thought she would like it he would put it by for her and she used in her merry way to call him her scout well one day black dog one of the most powerful chiefs of the dacotas rode into the fort with twenty of his braves just as he came in queen may as we all called her came galloping up on her mustang and leapt like a bird from her saddle at the door of the commanders house where her father was standing i war standing next to him and so i saw black dogs eye fall on her and as long as she stood talking there to her father he never took it off then he said something to the brave as was sitting on his horse next to him  cuss him dick said to me and i could see his hold on his rifle tighten what does he look at queen may like that for you mark my words abe trouble will come of this  it was not long before trouble did come for half an hour later the dacota rode out of the fort with his men in great wrath complaining that captain white had not received him as a chief and that his dignity was insulted it war like enough that captain white was not as ceremonious as he should have been to a great chieffor as i told you he war short in his ways with the redskinsbut i question if harm would have come of it if it hadnt been that black dogs eye fell on that gal  i believe that there and then he made up his mind to carry her off we didnt see any redskins in camp for some time and then rumours were brought in by the scouts that there war going to be trouble with them that a council had been held and that it war decided the hatchet should be dug up again captain white he made light of the affair but he was a good soldier and warnt to be caught napping so extra sentries were put on  as rube and me didnt belong to the fort of course we war independent and went away hunting and would sometimes be away for weeks together one day when we war some forty miles from the fort we came upon the trail of a large number of redskins going east we guessed as there must be nigh two hundred of them they might in course have been going hunting but we didnt think as it were so sartainly they had no women with them and they had been travelling fast we guessed the trail was three days old and we thought we had best push on straight to the fort to let them know about it  when we got thar we found we were too late on the morning of the day after we had started a scout had arrived with the news that a strong warparty of dacotas were on their way to the settlements captain white at once mounted half his infantry on horses and with them and the cavalry set out in pursuit leaving the fort in charge of a young officer with twentyfour men just after nightfall there was a sound of horsemen approaching and the officer thinking it was the captain returning ordered the gate of the stockade to be left open in a moment the place was full of redskins the soldiers tried to fight but it were no use all war cut down only one man making his escape in the darkness  at daybreak the captain with his troops rode into the fort dick who had been with him had when the party was returning gone out scouting on his own account and had come across the backtrack of the redskins the moment he had brought in the news the horses were resaddled again and the party started back but they had gone nearly sixty miles the day before and it was not until morning that utterly exhausted and weary they got within sight of the fort then they saw as it war too late  not a roof was to be seen above the stockade and a light smoke rising everywhere showed as fire had done it they rode into camp like madmen there lay all their comrades killed and scalped there were the bodies of mrs white and her servants and the nigger labourers and the trader and his clerks and of all who had been left behind in the camp except the captains little daughter of her there werent no signs rube and me arrived half an hour later just as the soldier who had escaped had come in and was telling how it all came about  it war a terrible scene i can tell you the captain he were nigh mad with grief and the men were boiling over with rage if they could have got at the dacotas then they would have fought if there had been twenty to one against them dick war nowhere to be seen the man said that he had caught a fresh horse which had broken its rope and stampeded through the gate while the massacre was going on and that he had ridden away on it on the indian trail  if the horses had been fresh the captain would have started in pursuit at once and every man was burning to go but it was lucky as they couldnt for if they had i have no doubt the whole lot would have been wiped out by the dacotas however there was no possibility of moving for at least a couple of days for the horses war altogether used up after the march so they had time to get cool on it  that afternoon the captain who was in council with the two officers who remained sent for rube and me and asked us our opinion as to what was best to be done we says at once that there werent nothing you have lost nigh a third of your force says i and have got little over forty left if we were to go up into the dacota country we should get ambushed to a certainty and should have a thousand of them perhaps two thousand down on us and the odds would be too great captain it couldnt be done besides even if you licked themand i tell you as your chance of doing so would be mighty smallthey would disperse in all directions and then meet and fight you agin and ye wouldnt be no nearer getting your daughter than you war before  if you ask my advice it would be that you should send back to the nearest fort for more men and that you should at once get up the stockade where it has been burnt down for there is no saying when you will be attacked again i tell you captain that to lead this party here into the dacota country would mean sartin death for them  mad as the captain was to go in search of his daughter he saw that i was right and indeed i concluded he had made up his mind he could do nothing before he sent for us only he hoped i suppose as we might give some sort of hope i am afraid what you say is true says he at any rate we must wait till dick the scout returns he will tell us which way they have gone and what is their strength  by nightfall the soldiers had buried all the dead just outside the stockade and had built a temporary wallfor there wasnt a stick of timber within milesacross the gaps in the fence  at nightfall rube and me whose horses war fresh started for the nearest fort and four days afterwards got back with forty more horsesoldiers we found that dick had not come back and we made up our minds as he had gone under when we were away we had heard that the redskins had attacked the settlements in a dozen different places and that there was no doubt a general injin war had broken out the officer at the fort where i went to was a major it was a bigger place than fort charles which was a sort of outlying post i had in course told him about the captains daughter being carried off  he sent up a letter with the soldiers to the captain saying how sorry he was to hear of his loss and he sent up forty men but he ordered that unless captain white had received some intelligence which would in his opinion justify his undertaking an expedition into the indian country with so small a force as he could command he was at once to evacuate the place and fall back with his force on the settlement as the position was quite untenable and every man was needed for the defence of the settlers  when the captain got the order he walked up and down by hisself for four or five minutes yer see it war a hard choice for him as a father he was longing to go in search of his child as a soldier he saw that he should be risking the whole force under his command if he did so and that at a time when every man was needed at the settlements at last the order was given that the troops should take the backtrack to the settlements on the following evening  illustration the escape of the captains daughter  the captain told the officers that he should wait till then to give the horses of the men who had arrived with us time to rest but i know in his heart he wanted to wait in the hope of dick arriving with news  the next day at four in the afternoon the men war beginning to saddle their horses when the sentry suddenly gave the cry of injins injins  in a moment every man seized his carbine and sword and shoved his bridle on his horses head buckled up and jumped into the saddle there was no occasion for any orders i climbed up on to the stockade for the country was pretty nigh a dead flat and the lookout had been burnt with the huts  sure enough there in the distance war some horsemen coming across the plain but they war straggling and not many of them i could not make head nor tail of it they war injins sure enough for even at that distance i could tell that by their figures then i saw as there was more of them coming behind them the idea suddenly struck me ride captain i shouted ride with your men for your life they are chasing some one  there warnt any necessity for captain white to give any orders there was a rush to the gate and as fast as they could get through they started out at full gallop me and rube dropped over the stockade for our critters war picketed outside we didnt wait to saddle them you may guess but pulled up the ropes jumped on to their backs and galloped on and we war soon by the side of captain white who was riding as if he was mad we could see them a little plainer now and says i suddenly captain there is a white horse in front by gum  a sort of hoarse cry came from the captain and he spurred his horse agin although the critter was going at its best speed they war two miles from us yet but i could soon make out as the white horse and another was a bit ahead then came eight or ten injins in a clump and a hundred or more straggling out behind it seemed to me as they war all going slow as if the horses war deadbeat but what scared me most was to see as the clump of injins war gaining on the two ahead of them one of whom i felt sure now was the captains daughter and the other i guessed was dick  the captain saw it too for he gave a strange sort of cry my god he said they will overtake her we war still a mile from them when we saw suddenly the man in frontthis chap dick herepart sudden from the white horse wheel straight round and go right back at the injins they separated as he came to them we saw two fall from their horses and the wind presently brought the sound of the cracks of pistols there war no colts in those days but i knew that dick carried a brace of doublebarrelled pistols in his holsters then the others closed round him  there was a sort of confusion we could see tomahawks waving and blows given and when it was over there war but four injins out of the eight to be seen on their horses but the white horse had gained a hundred yards while the fight was going on and the injins saw that we war acoming on like a hurricane so they turned their horses and galloped back again  three minutes later the captains daughter rode up she war as white as death and the captain had just time to leap off and catch her as she fainted dead away the rest of us didnt stop you bet we just gave a cheer and on we went and the dacotas got a lesson that day as they will remember as long as they are a tribe their horses were so deadbeat they had scarcely a gallop in them while ours were fresh and i dont think ten of the varmints got away  we didnt draw rein till it was dark and next morning we counted two hundred and fifteen dead redskins on the plains the first thing in the morning rube and me rode back to where the fight began to give dick a burial we looked about but couldnt find him there was black dog with one of his bullets through his forehead two others shot through the body and one with his skull stove in with a blow from dicks rifle which was lying there with the stock broken so we supposed the captain had had him carried to the fort and we rode on there  when we got there we found as he was alive it seems at the moment the captains daughter recovered from her faint she insisted on going back with the captain to see if dick was alive they found him wellnigh dead he had got an arrow through the body and two desperate clips with tomahawks and had been scalped but he was still breathing there war no one else nigh for every man had ridden on in pursuit but they managed somehow between them to get him upon the captains horse the captain he rode in the saddle and held him in his arms while his daughter led her horse back to the fort there they dressed his wounds and put wet cloths to his head and watched him all night  in the morning he was quite delirious fortunately the captain considered that after the way they had licked the redskins the day before there was no absolute necessity for evacuating the fort so the troops cut turf and made huts and parties were sent off to the nearest timber to bring in boughs for roofs and there we stopped and in six weeks dick was about again with his wig on his head  you will wonder whar he got his wig from seeing as that sort of thing aint a product of the plains but he is wearing his own hair among the fust of the injins we overtook and killed was a chap with dicks scalp hanging at his girdle and when it was known as he was alive they searched and found it and one of the soldiers who was fond of collecting birdskins and such like just preserved it in the same way and when dick was able to go out again he presented him with his own scalp so if any one says to dick as he aint wearing his own hair dick can tell him he is a liar  lor how grateful that gal was to dick he never was a particular goodlooking young fellow and he wasnt improved by the scrimmage but i believe if he had axed her she would have given up everything and settled down as a hunters wife  dick growled an angry denial  well mate it may be not quite that but it war very nigh it it was downright pretty to see the way she hung about him and looked after him just for all the world as if she had been his mother and he a sick child the captain too didnt know how to make enough of dick and as for the men they would have done anything for him for having saved the life of queen may i heard three or four years afterwards as she married the young officer who was in command of the horsesoldiers at the next fort  but tell me frank said how did dick manage to get her away from the indians  that abe said hed better tell you himself seeing as concerning that part of the business he knows more nor i do now dick speak out  there aint much to tell dick said gruffly taking the pipe from his mouth directly as we got back to camp and i found she had gone it seemed to me as i had got to follow her and my eye lighting on the loose horse i soon managed to catch the critter and shifting my saddle to it i started as you may guess there war no difficulty in following the trail they had ridden all night though they knew there was no chance of their being pursued but about fifty miles from the fort i came upon their first haltingplace they had lit fires and cooked food there and had waited some hours  the ashes were still warm and i guess they had left about four hours afore i arrived so i went on more carefully knowing that if i threw away my life there was no chance of recovering the gal i guessed by the direction which they were taking they were going to black dogs village and after going a bit further on the trail to make sure i turned off and went round some miles in case they should have left any one to see if they war followed i knew where the village was for i had been hunting near it  i camped out on the plains for the night and next day rode to within five miles of the village which was among the hills i left my horse in a wood where there was water and taking my rifle and pistols went forward on foot to the village and arrived there after dark as i expected i found the hull place astir a big fire was blazing in the centre on a pole near it hung the scalps they had taken and they were adancing round it and howling and yelling i didnt see any signs of the gal but as there were two redskins with their rifles hanging about the door of a wigwam next to that of the chief i had no doubt she was there  this wigwam was in the centre of the village and there were lots of old squaws and gals about so that i could not for the life of me see any way of stealing her out next night i went back to the camp and watched but the more i thought on it the more difficult it seemed the second night i catched an injin boy who was wandering outside the camp i choked him so that he couldnt hollo and carried him off and when i got far enough away i questioned him and found that in two days there was to be a grand feast and black dog was then going to take the white gal as his squaw so i saw as there was no time to be lost i strapped up the indian boy and tied him to a tree and then went back to the village  this time the gal was sitting at the door of the tent i crept up behind cut a slit in the skins and got inside as i expected there was no one in there the squaws as was watching her was outside so i crept up close to the entrance and i says to her hush dont move your scout dick is here she gave a little tremble when i began and then sat as still as a mouse  says i i dont see no plan for getting you away secret you are watched altogether too close the only plan is to make a race for it there aint many horses on the plain as can beat that mustang of yours and i know you can ride him barebacked do you take a head of maize now and walk across to where he is picketed and feed and pat him then tomorrow morning early do the same they wont be watching very closely for they will think you are only going to do the same as tonight i have put an open knife down behind you you cut his rope jump on his back and ride straight i will join you at the bottom of the valley they may overtake us but they wont hurt you if they do catch you they will just bring you back here again and you will be no worse off than you are now will you try the gal nodded and i crept away out of sight  a few minutes afterwards i saw her going along with some ears of maize to where the horses were tied up two indians followed her at a little distance but she walked across so natural that i dont think they had any suspicion she fed the horse and talked to it and petted it and then went back to the village next morning before daylight i mounted my horse and rode to the mouth of the valley a quarter of a mile from the village  half an hour after daylight i heard a yell and almost directly afterwards the sounds of a horses hoofs in full gallop i rode out and along she came as hard as the horse could go three or four mounted indians war just coming into the other end of the valley four hundred yards away  all right queen may we have got a fine start says i and then we galloped along together not too fast i told her it aint speed as will win the race there is a long hundred miles between us and the fort we must keep ahead of them varmint for a mile or two and then they will settle down  for the first five or six miles we had to ride fast for the redskins tried the speed of their horses to the utmost but none of them gained anything on us indeed we widened the gap by a good bit you see at first they only thought it was a wild scheme on the part of the gal and the first as started jumped on the first horses that came to hand it wasnt till they saw me that they found it was a gotup thing one of the first lot galloped back with the news but by the time the alarm was spread and the chase really taken up in earnest we was a good mile away and a mile is a long start  black dog and some of his bestmounted braves rode too hard at first ef we had only had a short start they would have catched us perhaps but a miles start was too much to be made up by a rush and so black dog should have known but i reckon he was too mad at first to calculate by hard riding he and his bestmounted braves got within half a mile of us when we war about ten miles from the village but by that time as you may guess the steam was out of their horses while we had been riding at a steady gallop  the first party that had started had now tailed away and was as far back as the chief it was safe to be a long chase now and i felt pretty sure as the gal would escape for her mustang was a beautiful critter and the captain had given a long price for it besides it was carrying no weight to speak of i didnt feel so sure about myself for though my horse was a firstclass one and had over and over again when out hunting showed herself as fast as any out there might be as good ones or better among the redskins for anything i knew when we were fairly out on the plains i could see that pretty nigh the whole tribe of redskins had joined in the chase  at first i couldnt make out why for although they are all wonderful for bottom some of the redskins horses aint much for speed and many of them could never have hoped to have come up with us but when i thought it over i reckoned that seeing i had joined the gal they might have thought that i had brought her news that the captain with all the soldiers from the fort was coming up behind and i expect thats why the chief and his braves rode so fast at first  i dont know as i ever passed a longer day than that we went at a steady gallop always keeping just about half a mile ahead of the redskins sometimes i jumped off my horse and ran alongside of him with my hand on the saddle for half a mile to ease him a bit the gal rode splendidly the mustang had a beautiful easy pace and she set him as if she was in a chair for the first fifty miles i dont think the redskins gained a yard on us they warnt pressing their horses more than we were for it was a question only of last now then little by little i could see that a small party was leaving the rest and gaining slowly upon us i darnt press my horse further but i began to give the gal instructions as to the course she should keep  what does it matter dick she asked when you are here to guide me but i maynt be with you all the time says i it air quite possible that them redskins will overtake me twenty miles afore i get to the fort but your critter can keep ahead of them easy he is going nigh as light now as when he started when they get a bit closer to us you must go on alone i shant leave you she says dick you got into this scrape to save me and i am not going to run away and leave you to be killed if you are taken i will be taken too  that would be a foolish thing says i and a cruel one ef you like to put it so i have risked my life to save you just as i have risked it a score of times before on the plains ef my time has come it will be a comfort to me to know as i have saved you but ef you were taken too i should feel that i had just chucked my life away besides you have got to think of the captain now that your mother has gone you have got to be a comfort to him so you see miss ef you was to get taken wilful you would be doing a bad turn to yerself and to me and to yer father  it was a long time before she spoke again and then she didnt say anything about what we had been talking of but began to ask whether i thought we were sure to find the soldiers still at the fort in course i couldnt say for sartin but to cheer her up i talked hopeful about it though i thought it was likely enough they had fallen back on the settlements i did some long spells of running now and got more hopeful for the injins didnt gain anything to speak of  we war all going very slow now for the horses were pretty nigh beat we had crossed two or three streams by the way and at each they had had a few mouthfuls of water it wasnt till we were within ten miles of the fort that the injins really began to gain they must have felt that there was a good chance of our slipping through their fingers and they determined to catch us if they killed every horse in the tribe  i tried to urge my critter forward but he hadnt got it in him and what frightened me more was that the mustang didnt seem much faster he had trod in a doghole when we war about halfway across the plains and must have twisted his foot i could see now he was going a little lame with it the redskins gained on us bit by bit and were pressing us hard when first we caught sight of the fort about four miles away  i had begun to despair for they warnt more than two hundred yards behind now the gal had held on bravely but she was nigh done good rider as she was it was a terrible ride for a young gal and it was only the excitement which kept her going but she was nigh reeling on the horse now sudden i says to her thank god miss there are the soldiers keep up your heart your fathers coming to save you  the injins saw him too for i heard the warwhoop behind and the sound of the horses came nearer and nearer i spurred my horse and it was the first time i had touched him since we started but it wasnt no good ride queen may ride for your life i cried out but i dont think she heard me she was looking straight forward now at the sojers her face was like death and with a hard set look on it and i expected every moment to see her drop from her horse  i saw as it was all up the redskins war but fifty yards behind and were gainin fast upon us so i says thars your father miss ride on for his sake then i turns my horse and with a pistol in each hand i rides back at the redskins the gal told me afterwards that she did not hear me speak that she didnt know i had turned and that all that time after she had first caught sight of the sojers seemed a dream to her  i dont remember much of the scrimmage black dog was the first redskin i met and i hit him fair between the eyes arter that it was all confusion i threw away my pistols and went at them with my rifle i felt as if a hot iron went through my body then there was a crash on my head and i remember nothing more until i found myself lying as weak as a baby in the hut in the fort with queen may asitting working beside the bed so as you see it aint much of a story  i call it a great deal of a story frank said i would give a great deal to have done such a thing  well shut up and dont say no more about it dick growled ef you want us to keep friends abes always alugging that old story out and he knows as i hates it like pizen we have had more than one quarrel about it and this is the last time by gosh as ever i opens my lips about it pass over the liquor i am dry     illustration  chapter xii  the attack on the caravan   although great uneasiness had been caused by the reports as to the indians the members of the caravan were in good spirits so far the journey had been a success the difficulties met with in crossing streams and bad bits of ground had been considerable but were no greater than they had looked for the animals had preserved their health and condition the supply of fresh meat had been regular and all were in excellent health the rise of ground had been so gradual that it had scarcely been felt but they were now at a considerable height above the sea and the brisk clear air braced their nerves and enabled even the feeblest to stand the fatigue without inconvenience  one day when frank was out alone with dick on the north of the line of march they came within sight of some buffalo grazing and frank was about to set spurs to his horse when his companion suddenly checked him  what is it frank said in surprise they dont see us and if we follow that hollow we shall be able to get close to them before they can catch sight of us  thats so dick said but just at present it air a question of something more serious than bufflars it air a question of injins  indians frank exclaimed gazing round in every direction where dick i see no signs of them  no and if you were to look round all day you wouldnt see em they are at your feet  frank looked down in surprise  i can see nothing he said after a minute examination of the ground  its thar though dick said throwing himself off his horse look at this soft piece of ground that is a hoofprint and there is another and another  frank also dismounted and examined the ground  yes he said i can see a number of hoofprints now you point them out but how do you know that they are indian prints  because they are unshod besides you see instead of coming along in a crowd as a drove of turned loose horses would do the marks are all together one after the other as they came along in single file there is no doubt they are a party of indians  they are ahead of us frank said  they were dick said but thar aint no saying where they are now may be watching us  the thought was not a comfortable one and frank grasped his rifle tightly as he looked round  just stay where you are dick said we are in a hollow and i will have a look round  dick made his way upon his hands and knees to the top of the brow choosing a spot where the shrubs grew thickest and making his way with such caution that frank could scarcely keep him in sight when he reached the brow he raised his head and looked round in all directions and then went on it was nearly half an hour before he rejoined his companion  they have gone straight ahead he said i went over the brow and down the next hollow and found their trail strong there for the ground is swampy they had certainly passed within an hour of the time i got there  how did you know that frank asked  because the water was still muddy where they had passed it would have settled again in an hour after being disturbed so they could not have been more than that time ahead they were keeping just parallel with the line of march of the caravan  how many of them do you think there were  between fifty and sixty dick said confidently  perhaps they were merely journeying quietly along frank suggested  not likely dick replied they must have seen these bufflars and would have been after them almost to a sartinty had they not had other business on hand no i expect they were watching the caravan and had made up their minds to wait till nightfall or perhaps till it came to some place where they can get up close without being seen and fall upon it by surprise we will ride back at once with the news and put them on their guard  an hours riding brought them to the caravan where their news created a great sensation hitherto the danger from indians had appeared a remote trouble which might not after all befall them the news that fifty or sixty of these dreaded foes were marching along almost within sight and might at any moment attack them brought the danger close indeed the waggons were driven in even closer order the women and children were told to keep between the lines the men distributed themselves among the teams ready to unyoke the oxen at the shortest notice and to form the waggons in order of defence abe and his companions had not yet returned but a quarter of an hour later they were seen galloping towards the camp  you must keep close together and look spry abe shouted as he approached we have come upon signs of a large body of indians a hundred and fifty or two hundred strong i reckon out there on the plains they have passed along this morning and aint up to no good i expect  we have found signs of a smaller party abe some fifty or sixty on our left these were marching straight along pretty well in the line we are going  then abe said ye had best look to yer guns for they mean mischief they must have been watching us this morning when we started but concluded that the ground was too level and that we should have time to get into position before they could get up to us besides we had all the advantage in the stockades at the station there aint no station this evening  do you think they will attack us on the road frank asked  that will depend on whether they think they can take us unawares get on yer horses again dick do you ride half a mile ahead of the caravan dont keep in the hollows but follow the line of the brow on the right young frank and i will scout half a mile out on the right of the caravan rube and jim you go the same distance on the left that way we can see them coming and the teamsters will have plenty of time to form up the waggons but i dont reckon as they will attack when they sees as we are on the lookout they will guess we have come across their tracks and will see that their chances of a surprise are gone for the day  do you think they will attack us tonight frank asked his companions  they may and they may not as a general thing these plain injins are not fond of night attacks its part superstition no doubt and part because they are much more at home on horseback than on foot still theres never no saying with an injin but i should say lad that they aint likely to do that yet they will try other ways fust they knows as how they have got plenty of time and can choose their opportunity if its a month hence they are wonderful patient are the redskins and time air of no account to them but at present i think the most dangerous times will be after we have camped and before night comes on and at daybreak before we makes our start  two more days passed quietly and a feeling of hope pervaded the caravan that the indians had ridden on and sought for other prey but abe assured them that they must not relax their precautions and that the failure of the indians to attack was no proof whatever that they had abandoned their intention to do so  an injin is always most dangerous just when you aint thinking of him you may be sure we have been watched although we havent seen no one and that seeing as we are on guard they are waiting for us to become careless again or it may be they have fixed upon their place of attack and if so you may bet yer life it is a good one above all things you men impress upon the women and children that in case of a sudden attack they shall each take refuge at once in the waggons in the places allotted to them and that they shall do it with out any squealing or yelling theres nothing bothers men and flurries them just as they have got need to be cool and steady as the yelping of a pack of women just impress on them as it does no good and adds to the chances of their getting their throats cut and their har raised  the hunters orders were very strongly impressed upon the women and children and even the latter were made to feel thoroughly the importance of silence in case of an attack  upon the following day they came upon a spot where the trail crossed a deep hollow the sides were extremely steep the bottom flat and swampy rough attempts had been made by preceding travellers to reduce the steepness of the bank but it was in no way improved thereby the upper edge was indeed more gradual but the soil cut away there and shovelled down had been softened by subsequent rains while the torn surface of the bottom and the deep tracks left by the wheels showed how the teams had struggled through it they explored for some little distance up and down to see if an easier point for crossing could be discovered but came to the conclusion that the spot at which the tracks crossed it was the easiest as in most places the bank had been eaten away by winter rains and was almost perpendicular they had reached this spot late in the evening and prepared to cross soon after daybreak you will have to fix up three teams to each waggon abe had said and take one over at a time we will be out early scoutingfor mind you this is a likely place to be attacked by the redskins they will know there is a bad spot here and will guess as you will be in confusion and divided some on one side of the gulch some on the other give particular charge to the men to have their rifles handy and to prepare to defend the waggons to the last and pass round word among the women and children not to be scared in case of an attack as we shall drive the injins off handsomely if they come  at daybreak abe dick and frank crossed the gulch the other two hunters remaining behind  we must not go far from the crossing abe said we dont know which way the tarnal critters may come and in case of attack all our guns will be wanted they will guess as we shall begin to cross the first thing in the morning and that it will take three or four hours to get over so if they are coming it will be in a couple of hours so as to catch us divided  they took their station on a rise a few hundred yards from the crossing one of them riding back from time to time to see how the operation of crossing was going on it was one of immense difficulty the oxen were mired almost up to their chests and the waggons sunk axledeep the waggons stuck fast in spite of the efforts of all the men in the party frank looked on for some time and then a thought struck him  look here you will never get the waggons on in that way the oxen cannot pull an ounce the best way will be to unyoke them take them across and get them up on the level ground on the top then fasten your ropes together and hitch them to the waggon the bullocks on firm ground can easily pull it across  the suggestion was at once acted upon the bottom was some fifty yards wide and there were plenty of ropes in the waggons which had been brought for lowering them down difficult places and for replacing any of the long rope traces which might be broken and worn out two of these were attached to the waggon and the oxen were taken over and up the further side a team was attached to each rope and as the whip cracked the ponderous waggon was at once set in motion and was soon dragged through the mud and up the incline  thats a capital plan of yourn young fellow john little said i dont know how we ever should have got across the other way and i had just made up my mind to give it up and move down this hollow till we came to firmer ground  five more waggons were got across in the same manner suddenly abe discharged his rifle  whats the matter frank exclaimed  injins abe said briefly thems the heads of the tarnal cusses just coming over the line of that rise  the spot to where he pointed was about half a mile distant and soon frank perceived a number of dark objects rising above it almost at the same instant the sound of a gun was heard on the other side of the gulch  they are going to attack both sides at once abe said as they galloped back towards the crossing that shows they are strong if they had any doubts about licking us they would have thrown thar whole strength on one party or the other  on reaching the waggons they found the men there working with all their might to get the six waggons in position side by side across the top of the ascent the oxen had already been taken down into the hollow  thats right abe shouted as they leapt from their horses and aided in the movement it couldnt be better well and steady you have three or four minutes yet  the waggons were drawn up in two lines with their wheels touching the inner line being on the very edge of the descent the women and children were placed in the inner waggons while the eight men who had come across with them and the three hunters took their places in the outside waggons  almost all the men had been across with the teams when the guns were fired but the remainder had run back to aid in the defence of the waggons on the other side these were already in a position of defence having been so arranged before the crossing began so well had abes orders been carried out that no confusion whatever had occurred at the sound of the guns the women had climbed and helped the children into the waggons allotted to them and the men on arriving quietly took up their positions  the indians were not visible until they reached a spot about three hundred yards from the waggons as they dashed up the rise they checked their horses instead of seeing as they had expected everything in confusion and dismay not a soul was visible and the clumps of waggons stood one on either side ranged as for defence however after waiting for three days for their prey they were not to be balked their wild warcry rose in the air and the two bodies of horsemen charged down on the travellers  in an instant a deadly fire broke out the men kneeling in the bottom of the waggons and resting their rifles on the rail the tilt being raised a few inches to enable them to see under it every shot told among the mass of horsemen the emigrants were all new to indian warfare but most of them were farmers accustomed from boyhood to the use of the rifle and the coolness of the hunters and their preparation for attack steadied them and gave them confidence several of the indians fell at the first discharge but the advance was not checked and at full speed they came on  steady lads dont throw away a shot abe shouted as the men loaded and discharged their rifles as quickly as possible see that every bullet tells  already the indians were checking the speed of their horses for the position was a most difficult one to attack it could not be surrounded and indeed could only be attacked on the face of the outside waggons from which a stream of fire was pouring as the leaders came on frank and the two hunters who both like himself carried revolvers laid aside their rifles and brought these deadly weapons into action resting them on the rail to secure an accurate fire the quick sharp cracks of these followed in almost every case by the fall of one of the horsemen in front completed the dismay of the indians quick as thought those who had fallen were lifted across the horses of their comrades and the whole band turning galloped away at full speed pursued as long as they were in sight by the rifleballs of the defenders of the waggons  so much for them abe said as he leapt to the ground now let us give a hand to our comrades  the fight was still raging on the other side the number of waggons was larger and the facilities for defence less the waggons were surrounded by a throng of indians who were cutting at them with their tomahawks discharging their rifles into the tilts and some having thrown themselves from their horses were endeavouring to climb up the defenders were still fighting desperately they had no longer time to load but with hatchets and clubbed rifles beat down the indians who tried to climb the waggons a few minutes however would have ended the resistance had not help been at hand  from the opposite side of the gulch eleven men poured the contents of their rifles among the indians one of the leading chiefs and four of his followers fell dead and almost before the indians had recovered from their surprise a dropping fire was opened almost every shot taking effect a cheer broke from the defenders of the waggons and they fought with renewed hope while the indians startled by this unlookedfor attack and by the repulse of their comrades began to lose heart  only for a few minutes longer did they continue the attack the deadly flank fire proved too much for their courage and soon they too were in full flight carrying off with them their killed and wounded a shout of triumph rose from the two parties of whites and a scene of wild delight took place the women now that the excitement was over cried and laughed alternately in hysterical joy the children shouted while the men grasped each others hands in fervent congratulation  we all owe our lives to you and your comrades john little said to abe if it had not been for you we should all have gone under and i tell you if ever we get across these plains we will find some way to show our gratitude as long as john little has a crust in the world he will share it with you  when the excitement had somewhat abated the work of crossing was recommenced and in two hours all were over and the journey was continued  do you think the indians will attack us again john little asked abe when the caravan was set in motion  they will if they see a chance abe replied they have lost a lot of men and will get vengeance if they can it depends partly whether thar big chief was killed or not if he war they may give it up now they sees as we are strong and wellarmed if not thar chief will do all he can to wipe us out for he will be held responsible for the affair and such a defeat would lower his influence in the tribe  five days later they saw some waggons in the distance since the attack the hunters had not left the caravan as the emigrants all declared that they would far rather go without fresh meat than have the hunters absent from the camp a few deer only which had been seen from the line of march had been stalked and shot  there is a caravan halting ahead frank said we heard at the last station that one passed ten days back i wonder what they are halting for the next water according to the distances the stationkeeper gave us must be ten miles away  i dont like the look of it abe replied travelling at about the same rate as we do they should still be about ten days ahead i am very much afraid that something has happened those varmint we thrashed or some other may have attacked them  for another mile not a word was spoken then they reached a spot from which the waggons and the ground around them was clearly visible  i see no sign of movement abe said to john little and thar seems to be a lot of dark objects lying about i will ride forward with my mates if as i calculate there has been a massacre you had better take the waggons a detour a mile round so that the women and children may be spared the sight of it it would be enough to make them skeery for the rest of the journey  abe and his comrades galloped forward  have your rifles ready the former said there may be some of the varmint hiding about still though i dont think it likely i expect the attack took place some days back  on nearing the waggons their apprehensions were verified around lay the carcasses of the oxen with bales and boxes broken open and rifled of their contents in and near the waggons were the bodies of their defenders mingled with those of the women and children all had been scalped and the bodies were mutilated with gashes of the tomahawks no attempt had been made to put the waggons into any position of defence they still stood in a long line as they had been travelling when the indians fell upon them there were twelve waggons and they counted eighty bodies lying around them  it has been a regular surprise abe said and i expect there war very little fighting the injins burst out on them there war a wild panic a few shots war fired and it war all over thats how i read it hillo whats that  a deep growl was heard and turning they saw under a bush a mastiff standing over the body of a child the animal could with difficulty keep its legs it had been pierced by a lance and had received a blow with a tomahawk on the head which had nearly cut off one of its ears it had doubtless been left for dead but had recovered itself and crawled to the side of one of the children of the family to which it belonged its head was covered with matted blood and its tongue hung out black and parched with thirst but it growled savagely its hair bristled on its back and it prepared to defend to the last the body of its young master  poor fellow frank said dismounting poor old boy we are friends  at the kind tones of the voice the dog relaxed the fierceness of its aspect it gave a faint whine and lay down by the childs body frank took off his thick felt hat filled it with water from the skin hanging from his saddle and carried it to the dog the animal raised itself again with an effort and drank eagerly when it had finished it thrust its great nose into franks hand and wagged its tail then it returned to the body and gave a piteous howl the tears stood in franks eyes  lend a hand with your knives he said to his comrades who were looking on let us dig a grave for the child then the dog will perhaps follow us it is a grand dog and i should like to have it  the others dismounted and with their knives and hands they soon scraped a hole in the earth capable of containing the body the mastiff stood by watching their operations frank doubted whether it would allow him to touch the body of the child but the animal seemed to comprehend his intentions and suffered him to raise the child and lay it in the ground no sooner was the grave filled up than the mastiff laid himself down beside it frank now offered the animal some meat from his wallet and after this was eaten bathed its head with water and brought the edges of the wound together and bandaged it with a strip torn from his huntingshirt  come along old fellow come along with us you can do no good here  he mounted his horse and the mastiff rose to its feet and stood irresolute and gave another piteous howl  will you ride back to the caravan abe and tell them there is no danger i will move slowly with the dog and join them when they get abreast of us  the four men started at a gallop frank dismounted again and patted the mastiff then tying his handkerchief to its collar he walked slowly away leading his horse the mastiff followed at once walking with difficulty for its hindlegs were almost paralysed from the spearwound which had passed through its body just under the spine behind the ribs it seemed however to feel that frank was its master now and laid its great head in his hand as he walked beside it  as frank saw the line on which the caravan was now moving he walked slowly across to it and halted until the waggons came up the mastiff was lifted into one of them and laid on some empty floursacks some more water was given it and the caravan proceeded on its way  the terrible fate which had befallen their predecessors cast a deep gloom over the party who shuddered to think how narrowly they had escaped such a fate there was no need now to impress upon any the necessity of avoiding straggling and redoubled vigilance was observed during the march  frank attended assiduously to the mastiff to whom he gave the name of turk the spearwound was kept poulticed and that in the head was plastered had the dog received such wounds at any other time they would have probably proved fatal but on the plains wounds heal rapidly and the brisk air and the life of activity and exercise render man and beast alike able to sustain serious injuries without succumbing  in a week turk was able to walk with the caravan a fortnight later it could gallop by franks side they were now entering the alkali plains a wide and desolate region where water is extremely scarce and when found brackish and bitter to the taste and where the very shrubs are impregnated with salt and uneatable by most animals in anticipation of the hardships to be endured in crossing this region the bullocks had been allowed for some time a daily ration of grain in addition to the grass they could pick up during the halt and were therefore in good condition  a halt was made for three days before entering this district and the teams were fresh and full of work when they started the marches across the salt plain were long and painful to man and beast the dust which rose in clouds was so impregnated with salt that it caused an intense irritation to the lips and nostrils  everything was done as far as possible to alleviate the sufferings of the animals casks were filled with water at each haltingplace and each time the oxen halted for rest their mouths and nostrils were sponged and a small allowance given them to drink as they progressed they had reason to congratulate themselves on the precautions they had taken for scarce a mile was passed without their coming across signs of the misfortunes which had befallen those who had gone before in the shape of abandoned waggons stores cast out to lighten the loads and skeletons of oxen and horses but on the other hand there was now comparatively slight danger of an indian attack for even the horses of the redskins hardy as they are could not support the hardships of a prolonged stay on the alkali plains     illustration  chapter xiii  at the goldfields   it was with intense delight that all in the caravan noticed the gradual change of herbage which showed that they were approaching the confines of this terrible region and when at their first halt after leaving it they came upon flowing streams a general bath was indulged in by man and beast the oxen lying down in the water and being with great difficulty induced to emerge from it the hunters now recommenced their excursions in search of game for all were suffering from the want of fresh meat the children especially feeling the privation  turk accompanied the party the dog was now completely restored and nothing could induce it to leave franks side it was quite young and frank soon taught it to remain by his horse while he dismounted to stalk game while in pursuit on horseback turk often pursued and pulled down deer who would otherwise have escaped  one day dick and frank had gone out alone and had been led a long distance from the line of march in pursuit of a herd of deer these had finally gone up a narrow cañon in the mountains the hunters pursued them for some distance and then despairing of overtaking them turned their horses and began to retrace their steps suddenly turk who was in advance stopped uttered a deep growl and its hair bristled from its head to its tail  what is it turk frank asked  the animal replied with another low deep growl  it must be some savage beast frank said  that aint likely dick said any beast in this cañon would have moved away when we passed before i think the dog must scent injins a party may have seen us entering the gap and may be in pursuit  he threw himself off his horse and listened with his ear to the ground  its injins sure enough he exclaimed i can hear the clattering of horses hoofs on the hard rock theres nothing for it but for us to make our way up the cañon  they turned their horses and galloped forward turk after one more growl in the direction of the indians following presently the defile divided  shall we take the main branch or the one to the right frank asked  better keep straight on dick said the other may lead into some valley from which there could be no getting out and we should be caught in a trap see he said as he halted the deer have gone that way do you see some of the pebbles have been thrown out of that little stream  jump off your horse and cut some bits off your blankets and tie them round your horses feet if the indians see no marks going forward they will naturally suppose we have turned off here in pursuit of the deer  frank did what his comrade suggested but quickly as the work was performed they heard the sound of the horsemen in pursuit loud and distinct before they again set forward then springing on their horses they rode up the cañon after a while they halted the sounds of pursuit had ceased and they had no doubt the indians had turned off into the other ravine  it all depends how far that runs dick said how soon they will be in pursuit again if it comes soon to an end it will not be long before we have them after us if it goes on for some miles we are safe  winding between perpendicular cliffs of great height they rode forward mounting steadily it was impossible to make rapid progress for although in some places the bottom of the ravine was bare smooth rock at others it was piled with boulders  it was three hours before they emerged from it and upon doing so found they were upon an elevated plateau before they moved forward frank said turk do you hear them the dog stood with ears erect and quivering nostrils looking down the ravine which they had just left presently he gave a low deep growl  they are coming frank said but they must be a good way off for turk did not hear them at first which way shall we go dick  we had better turn to the left dick said for our natural line leads to the right however it does not make much difference for they will be able to track us still it may puzzle them it will be dark in a couple of hours and if we can keep ahead till then we are safe  they started at a gallop and for an hour rode at full speed in the direction which would take them down to the plain at or near the spot where they had halted the night before  illustration dick and frank elude the indians  look out frank rein up dick suddenly shouted frank pulled his horse back on its haunches and but just in time for at the brow of the swell up which they had been galloping the ground fell suddenly away in a precipice two hundred feet deep and the horse was barely a length from it when he brought it to a standstill  we are in a mess dick said the injins behind us will know of this and instead of following will scatter to the right and left as they will know that we must turn one way or the other  in that case frank said our best plan will be to go straight back  you are right dick exclaimed that is the best thing we can do we wont follow the exact track as a few of them may have kept our line but will bear a little distance off it and hope they may pass us unseen the sun is setting already half an hour and it will be dark  taking every precaution to conceal their trail they rode back keeping a hundred yards or so to the right of the line by which they had come a quarter of an hour passed and then turk gave his growl of warning  could not have been better dick exclaimed this brushwood is just the place for us  they threw themselves from their horses and made the animals lie down at full length in the low bushes and laid themselves down beside them  hush turk frank said to the dog as he laid his hand upon its head you must lie quiet sir and not make the least noise  the dog who was quivering with excitement lay down quietly as if it comprehended the need for silence  one two three four five six dick counted peering through the bushes six of them we could fight that lot easy but the sound of our rifles would bring the whole gang down upon us  the indians were not riding at full speed for their horses were tired having already made a long march before they saw the hunters following the deer to the cañon and they did not expect to overtake those of whom they were in pursuit believing that when they reached the precipice they would make along it to the right or left and so fall into the hands of one or other of the parties who had gone to intercept them  no sooner were they fairly out of sight than the hunters rose and remounting their horses continued their way  its wellnigh dark dick said and i doubt if they will be able to make out our backtrack when they get to the edge at any rate they cannot follow it  they rode on until they found that their horses could no longer carry them then dismounting led them by the bridle they had been steering by the stars and presently found themselves at the upper end of the ravine  we wont enter this now dick said for some of them may take it into their heads to gallop back although that aint very likely anyhow the horses cant go any further and if they could we couldnt make our way over these stones itll be as dark as pitch down there so we will move away two hundred yards and let the horses feed while we get a few hours sleep that dog of yourn will give us notice if any of the varmint are coming this way  the night passed without alarm and at the first dawn of light they were upon their feet again the horses were given a mouthful of water from the skins and then the hunters mounted and rode down the cañon there would be pursuit they knew well but the indians would not be able to take up the trail until daylight and would be an hour and a half following it to the top of the cañon so that they had fully two hours start this being the case they did not hurry their horses but kept up a steady pace until they emerged at the lower end of the ravine then they urged them forward and two hours later arrived at the haltingplace of the caravan no move had been made but the instant they were seen approaching abe and his two comrades rode up to meet them  what has happened he asked as he reached them we have been terrible uneasy about you and i was just going to start to try and pick up your track and follow you  dick related the adventure  it war well it war no worse abe said that critters sense has saved your lives for ef he hadnt given you warning you would have ridden slap into the hands of the injins you may consider you are quits with him now frank but it war a nasty fix and i congratulate you both on having brought your har safely back to camp that coming straight back on your trail when you was stopped by the fall of the ground was a judgmatical business  it was franks idee dick said  wall he just hit the right thing if it hadnt been for that you would have been rubbed out sure  at the next haltingplace they found that three or four of the caravans which had preceded them had halted being afraid to move forward in small parties as the indians had made several attacks with the accession of force given by the arrival of john littles party they considered themselves able to encounter any body of redskins they might meet as there were now upwards of fifty waggons collected with a fighting force of seventy or eighty men  they therefore moved forward confidently several times parties of indian horsemen were seen in the distance but they never showed in force the strength of the caravan being too great for any hope of a successful attack being made upon it  it was nearly five months from the time of their leaving omaha before the caravan approached the point where the great plateau of nevada falls abruptly down to the low lands of california many thousand feet below here the hunters bade farewell to the emigrants whom they had so long escorted all danger of indians had been long since passed and they were now within a short distance of the gold regions  very deep and sincere were the thanks which were poured upon them by the emigrants who felt that they owed their lives entirely to the vigilance and bravery of abe and his companions they expected to meet again ere long at the goldfields and many were the assurances that should by any chance better luck attend their search than was met with by the hunters the latter should share in their good fortune  the change in the character of the scenery was sudden and surprising hitherto the country had been bare and treeless but the great slopes of the nevada mountains were covered from top to bottom with a luxuriant growth of timber nowhere in the world are finer views to be obtained than on the slopes of the nevada mountains the slopes are extremely precipitous and sometimes standing on a crag one can look down into a valley five or six thousand feet below clothed from top to bottom with luxuriant foliage while far away in front at the mouth of the valley can be seen the low rich flats of california  on the lower slopes of these mountains lay the gold deposits these were found in great beds of gravel and clay which in countless generations had become so hardened that they almost approached the state of conglomerate the gold from these beds had been carried either by streams which ran through them or by the action of rain and time into the ravines and valleys where it was found by the early explorers these great beds of gravel have been since worked by hydraulic machinery water being brought by small canals or flumes many miles along the face of the hills to reservoirs situated one or two hundred feet above the gravel to be operated upon  from the reservoirs extremely strong iron pipes lead down to the gravel and to the end of these pipes are fitted movable nozzles like those of fireengines but far larger the water pours out through these nozzles with tremendous force breaking up the gravel and washing it away down a long series of wooden troughs in which the gold settles and is caught by a variety of contrivances  but in the early days of gold discovery the very existence of these beds of gravel was unknown and gold was obtained only in the ravines and valleys by washing the soil in the bottom it had already been discovered that the soil was richer the further the searchers went down by far the greater finds being made when the diggers reached the solid rock at the bottom in the irregularities of which worn by water thousands of years before large quantities of rough gold were often discovered  there was no difficulty in following the track through the forest and after two days travelling the party arrived at the first mining village they chose a piece of ground for their camp fastened their horses to stumps erected a tent of blankets and placed in it the stores brought on their baggagehorses which had remained untouched since they started then leaving one of their number in charge they started off to visit the diggings  the whole of the bottom of the narrow valley was a scene of life and bustle the existence of gold in the valley had been discovered but three weeks before but a rush had taken place from other diggings the ground had been allotted out and a number of tents pitched and rough huts erected men were working as if for bare life the lots were small and the ground was already perfectly honeycombed with holes generally the diggers worked in batches of four or five each member of which took up a claim so that the space for operations was enlarged  two men laboured with pick and shovel and the baskets as they were filled with earth and sand were first screened in a sieve to remove the larger portion of stones and rock and were then poured into what was known as a cradle which was a long trough on rockers one man brought water in buckets from the stream and poured it into this while another kept the cradle in constant motion the mud and lighter portions of stone flowed away over the edge or were swept off by the hand of the men employed in working it the particles of gold sinking to the bottom of the machine where they were found at the cleanup at the end of the days work  the newcomers looked on with great interest at the work asking questions as to the luck which attended the operators the majority gave but a poor account of their luck the value of the finds at the end of the day being barely sufficient to pay the enormous rate charged for provisions which had to be carried up from the coast some hundreds of miles away the stores were brought in waggons as far as sacramento and from that town were carried to the diggings on the backs of mules and horses consequently it was impossible for a man to live on the poorest necessities of life for less than three or four dollars a day and in the outoftheway valleys the cost was often considerably more  some of the diggers owned that they were doing well but there was a general disinclination to state even the approximate amount of their daily winnings the hunters found however that the general belief was that some of those who had claims in the centre of the valley where of course the gold would settle the thickest were making from ten to twenty ounces per day  thats something like dick said just fancy making from forty to eighty pounds per day i vote we set to work at once as well here as anywhere else  yes i suppose we may as well begin here frank agreed at any rate until we hear what is being done in the other places but you see we must be ready to move off as soon as a report comes of some fresh discovery so as to get good places here of course we must be content to settle down outside the rest we will mark out five claims at once turn up the ground and put our tools there they say thats sufficient to take possession then we will go up into the forests and cut down a pine or two and slit it up into planks for making one of those cradles that will take us all day tomorrow i reckon  as they sat round the fire that evening talking over their prospects abe said  i tell you what it is mates i have been thinking this here matter over and when i sees what tremendous prices are being charged for grub here i concluded there must be a big thing to be made in the way of carrying now we have got our five ridinghorses and the three baggagehorses that makes eight now what i proposes is this three of us shall work the claims and the other two shall work the horses we can sell the ridingsaddles down at sacramento and get packsaddles instead we can begin by carrying for one of the traders here  i hear that a horse can earn from five to ten dollars a day so our eight horses will earn forty to eighty dollars a day now thats a good sartin living for us all especially as we shall bring up the provisions for ourselves instead of paying big rates here arterards we will see how things go and if we like we can open a store here and one of us mind it anyhow the horses will keep us well if the claim turns out well so much the better if it dont we can do very well without it i proposes as we take it by turns to drive the horses and dig  the counsel was good and prudent but it was only adopted after some discussion for the sums which the more fortunate diggers were earning were so large that all looked forward to making a rapid fortune and were inclined to despise the small but steady gains offered by the plan abe suggested however frank sided with abe and offered to go with him on the first trip to sacramento and the others thereupon fell in with the plan  the next day the cradle was made by abe and frank the others setting to to dig and wash out in a bucket at the end of a day of hard work they had got about a quarter of an ounce of glittering yellow dust this was not paying work but they were not disappointed they had not expected to strike upon good ground at the first attempt and were quite satisfied by the fact that they really had met with the gold which they had come so far to seek  that evening abe made a bargain to bring up goods from sacramento for one of the storekeepers having previously found the rate which was current at daybreak next morning he and frank started off on horseback each with three horses tied head and tail behind the one he was riding turk marching gravely by their side  the distance to sacramento was upwards of seventy miles on their road they met numerous parties making their way up the mountains all carried a pick and shovel a bucket and blanket and a small sack with flour and bacon many of them were sailors who had deserted from their ships at san francisco where scores of vessels were lying unable to leave for want of hands  all as they passed asked the last news from the diggings where the last rush was and what was the average take at the camp and then hurried on eager to reach the spot where as every man believed fortune awaited him  two days of travel down the mountains took them to sacramento here their saddles were disposed of and packsaddles bought the horses were laden with sacks of sugar and flour sides of bacon and mining tools and after a days stay in town they started back for the camp  sacramento but a few months before a sleepy quiet city mostly inhabited by spaniards or rather people of spanish descent was now a scene of animation and bustle long teams of waggons laden with stores rolled in almost hourly across the plains from san francisco while the wharves at the riverside were surrounded by laden barges bands of newlyarrived emigrants wandered through the streets asking eager questions of any one who had time enough to talk as to the best way of getting to the diggings and as to the camp which they had better select for their first attempt darklooking men half spaniard and half indian went along on their little ponies or rode at the head of a string of laden animals with an air of perfect indifference to the bustle around them  sounds of shouting and singing came through the doors of some saloons in which many of the fortunate diggers were busily engaged in dissipating their hardearned gains men sunburnt almost to blackness in red shirts and canvas trousers walked along the streets as if the town and all in it belonged to them in virtue of the store of golddust tied up in their waistbelts in these revolvers and bowieknives were stuck conspicuously and the newlyarrived emigrants looked with awe and envy at these men who had already reaped a harvest at the mines  shooting affrays were of frequent occurrence in the drinking saloons where at night gambling was invariably carried on the diggers being as reckless of their lives as of their money  about ten days of that place would be enough to ruin any man abe said as they walked at the head of their cavalcade from the town i reckon as sacramento is a sort of hell on arth and guess theres more wickedness goes on in that ere little town than in any other place its own size on the face of creation they tells me as san francisco is worse but at any rate sacramento is bad enough for me  on the evening of the third day after leaving sacramento they arrived at the mining camp and having delivered the stores they had brought up to the trader and received the amount agreed upon they took their way to the spot where they had pitched their camp  well lads what luck abe asked as at the sound of their feet their comrades came out to greet them  we have got about four ounces of dust dick said and our backs are pretty nigh broken and our hands that blistered we can hardly hold the shovel however we have been better the last two days i expect there have been two or three hundred people arrived here since you left and they are all at work now  well thats pretty well for a beginning abe said though you wouldnt have much of your four ounces left if you had had to pay for grub however weve brought up another halfsack of flour twenty pounds of sugar and five pounds of tea and a halfside of bacon so we have got quite enough to go on for a long time yet i have brought up too a good stout tent which will hold us comfortable and after paying for all that heres thirty pounds in money i got five pounds a horseload so with your earnings and ours we havent made a bad weeks work thats pretty nigh ten pounds a man i dont say thats anything wonderful as times goes here but when we hit on a good spot for our digging we shall pick it up quick now lets pitch the new tent and then we will have supper for i can tell you walking twentyfive miles in this mountain air gives one something like an appetite     illustration  chapter xiv  captain bayley   during the time which had elapsed between the departure of frank norris from england and his arrival at the golddiggings in california much had happened at home which he would have been interested to learn had he maintained any communication with his relatives there on the morning when frank had been accused by dr litter of abstracting the note from his table the latter had as he had informed frank he intended to do sent a note to captain bayley informing him that a most painful circumstance had taken place with reference to his nephew and begging him to call upon him between twelve and one  captain bayley had done so and had as fred barkley stated been furious at the news which the doctor conveyed to him his fury however being in no degree directed towards his nephew but entirely against the headmaster for venturing to bring so abominable an accusation against frank  the evidence which dr litter adduced had no effect whatever in staying his wrath and so vehement and angry was the old officer that dr litter was obliged to ring the bell and order the servant to show him out from deans yard he took a cab and drove direct to his solicitor and requested him instantly to take proceedings against the headmaster for defamation of character  but captain bayley the lawyer urged we must first see whether this gentleman had any reasonable cause for his belief if the evidence is what may be considered as strong we must accept his action as taken bonâ fide  dont tell me sir captain bayley exclaimed angrily what do i care for evidence of course he told me a long rigmarole story but he could not have believed it himself no one but a fool could believe my nephew frank guilty of theft the idea is preposterous it was as much as i could do to restrain myself from caning him when he was speaking  the lawyer smiled inwardly for dr litter was a tall stately man six feet two in height while captain bayley was a small slight figure by no means powerful when in his prime and now fully twenty years the senior of the headmaster  well captain bayley he said in the first place it is necessary that i should know the precise accusation which this gentleman has brought against your nephew will you be good enough to repeat to me as nearly as you can the statement which he made as of course if we proceed to legal measures we must be exact in the matter  well this is about the story he told me captain bayley said more calmly in the first place it seems that the lad broke bounds one night and went with a man named perkinswho is a prizefighter and who i know gave him lessons in boxing for i gave frank five pounds last half to pay for themto a meeting of these chartist blackguards somewhere in the new cut  well there was a row there as there naturally would be at such a place and it seems frank knocked down some radical fellowa tailor i believeand broke his nose well you know i am not saying this was right still you know lads will be lads and i used to be fond of getting into a row myself when i was young for i could spar in those days pretty well i can tell you griffith i would have given a fivepound note to have seen frank set to with that radical tailor still i dare say if the lad had told me about it i should have got into a passion and blown him up  i shouldnt be surprised at all the lawyer said drily  no well that would do him no harm he knows me and he knows that i am peppery well it seems this fellow found out who he was and threatened to report the thing to the headmaster in which case this dr litter said he should have expelled him for being out of bounds a thing which in itself i call monstrous now here is where frank was wrong he ought to have come straight to me and told me the whole affair and got his blowingup and his money instead of that he asked three or four of the other boysamong them my nephew fredto lend him the money but they were all out of funds well somebody it seems sent frank a tenpound note in an envelope with the words from a friend and no more frank showed the envelope to the others and they all agreed that it was a sort of godsend and frank sent the note to the tailor now it seems that the day before frank got the note the headmaster when he was hearing his form had put a tenpound note with some other things on the table and being called out he like a careless old fool left them lying there  some time afterwards he missed the note and does not remember taking it up from the table still he says he did not suspect any of the boys of his form of taking it and thinking that he had dropt it on the way to his house he stopped the note at the bank happening to have its number a few days afterwards the note was presented it was traced to the tailor who admitted having received it from frank and would you believe it sir this man now pretends to believe that my nephew stole it from the table and sent it to himself in an envelope its the most preposterous thing i ever heard  mr griffith looked grave  of course captain bayley having met your nephew at your house several times i cannot for a moment believe him guilty of taking the note still i must admit that the evidence is strongly circumstantial and were it a stranger who was accused i should say at once the thing looked nasty  pooh nonsense griffith the old officer said angrily theres nothing in it sirnothing whatever somebody found the note kicking about i dare say and didnt know who it belonged to he knew frank was in a corner and sent it to him the thing is perfectly natural  yes the lawyer assented doubtfully but the question is who did know it was the fact of your nephew requiring the money generally known in the school  no captain bayley admitted the doctor examined the four boys before frank they all declared that they knew nothing of the note and that they had not mentioned the circumstance to a soul but my opinion is that one of them is a liar  it is certainly necessary to believe mr griffith said slowly that one of them is either a liar or a thief of course there may be some other solution of the matter but the only one that i can see just at the present moment is this your nephew is the sort of lad to be extremely popular among his schoolmates either one of these four boys took the note from the masters table with the goodnatured but most mistaken idea of getting him out of a scrape or they must have mentioned his need of money to some of their schoolfellows one of whom finding the note perhaps in the yard where the headmaster may have dropped it sent it to frank to relieve him of the difficulty  these are possible solutions of the mystery at any rate but if you will take my advice captain bayley you will not in the present state of affairs take the steps which you propose to me against dr litter it will be time enough to do that when your nephews innocence is finally and incontestably proved of course he said seeing that his listener was about to break out again you and i knowing him know that he is innocent but others who do not know him might entertain some doubt upon the subject and a jury might consider that the doctor was justified with the evidence before him in acting as he did in which case an immense deal of damage might be done by making the matter a subject of general talk  with some difficulty captain bayley was persuaded to allow his intention to rest for a while  it is late now he said but i shall go and see frank tomorrow i wish i had seen him this afternoon before i came to you however i have no doubt when i get home i shall find a letter from himnot defending himself of course as he would know that to be unnecessary but telling me the story in his own way  but no letter came that evening to captain bayleys great irritation he told alice hardy the whole circumstances and she was as indignant as himself and warmly agreed that the headmaster should be punished for his unjust suspicions  and do you say he is really going to be expelled tomorrow she asked in a tone of horror  so the fellow said my dear but he shall smart for it and the laws of the land shall do frank justice  at halfpast nine the next morning fred barkley arrived at captain bayleys  well his uncle exclaimed as he entered i suppose you have been sent to tell me they have got to the bottom of this rigmarole affair  no uncle fred said i have i am sorry to say been sent to tell you that frank last night left his boardinghouse and is not to be found  captain bayley leapt from his seat in great wrath  the fool the idiot to run away like a coward instead of facing it out and not a line or a message has he sent to me did you know sir that your cousin was going to run away  fred hesitated  yes uncle i knew that he was going and did my best to dissuade him but it was useless  captain bayley walked up and down the room with quick steps uttering exclamations testifying his anger and annoyance  has he got any money he said suddenly halting before fred did he get any money from you  fred hesitated again and then said  well uncle since you insist upon knowing i did let him have twenty pounds which i got for the sale of my books  i believe sir the old officer said furiously that you encouraged him in this step a step which i consider fatal to him  fred hesitated again and then said  well uncle i am sorry that you should be so angry about it but i own that i did not throw any obstacle in the way  you did not sir captain bayley roared and why did you not are you a fool too dont you see that this running away instead of facing matters out cannot but be considered by people who do not know frank as a proof of his guilt a confession that he did not dare to stay to face his accusers  fred was silent  answer me sir captain bayley said dont stand there without a word to explain your conduct do you or do you not see that this cowardly flight will look like a confession of guilt  i did see that uncle fred said but i thought that better than a public expulsion  oh you did did you his uncle said sarcastically when you knew that if he had stopped quietly at home we should have proved his innocence in less than no time  fred made no reply  do you think we shouldnt have proved his innocence roared his uncle  i am sorry to say anything which is displeasing to you uncle but i fear that you would never have proved franks innocence  the words seemed to have a sobering effect on captain bayley the blood seemed to die out of his face he put one hand on a chair as if to steady himself while he looked fixedly in his nephews face  do you mean fred he said in a low voice do you mean that you have a doubt of franks innocence  i should rather not say anything about it fred replied i hope with all my heart that frank is not guilty but  what do you think captain bayley repeated have you any grounds whatever for believing him guilty  no sir and i do not wish you to be in the slightest degree influenced by what i said he paused but captain bayleys eyes were still fixed upon him as if commanding a complete answer  well sir he went on hesitatingly i must own that sad as it is to say so i fear frank did it  did he confess it to you captain bayley asked in a strained strange voice  no uncle not in so many words but he said things which seemed to me to mean that when i tried to dissuade him from running away and urged him to remain till his innocence could be proved he said angrily whats the use of talking like that when you know as well as i do that it cant be proved afterwards he said it is a bad job and i have been an awful fool but who could have thought that note would ever be traced back to litter and other remarks of the same kind he may be innocent uncleyou know how deeply i wish we could prove him sobut i fear i greatly fear that we shall be doing frank more service by letting the matter drop you know the fellows in the school all believe him innocent and though his going away has staggered some of them the general feeling is still all in his favour therefore they are sure to speak of him as a sort of victim and when he returns which of course he will do in a few years time the matter will have died away and have been altogether forgotten  the old officer sat down at the table and hid his face in his hands  all this time alice pale and silent had sat and listened with her eyes fixed upon the speaker but she now leapt up to her feet  uncle she said dont believe him he is not speaking the truth i am sure he is not he hates frank and i have known it all along because frank is bigger and better than he because frank was generous and kindhearted because every one liked frank and no one liked him he is telling a lie now and i believe every word he has said since he came into the room is false  hush child the old officer said you must not speak so my dear if it was only the word of one lad against another it would be different but it is not so the proof is very strong against frank i would give all i am worth if i could still believe him innocent and had he come to me and put his hand in mine and said uncle i am innocent i would have believed him against all the evidence in the world it is not i who condemn him he has condemned himself he sends me no word he cannot look me in the face and declare himself innocent he runs away at night knowing well that there could be but one construction as to this and that all would judge him guilty no alice it breaks my heart to say so but i can struggle no longer against these facts the lad whom i have loved as a son has turned out a thief  no uncle no the girl cried passionately i will never believe it not to the end of my life i cannot prove him innocent but i know he is so and some day it will be proved but till then i shall still think of him as my dear brother as my truehearted brother who has been wrongfully accused and who is the victim of some wicked plot of which perhaps fred barkley knows more than any one else and bursting into a passion of tears she ran from the room fred looked after her with an expression of pity and sorrow  poor child he said it is a terrible blow for her and she scarce knows what she is saying  it is a terrible blow captain bayley said in a dreary voice a most terrible blow to me and to her no wonder she feels it and i have been planning and hoping that some day a few years hence those two would get to like each other in a different way i had by my will divided my fortune equally between you and him but i have liked him best of course i brought him up and he has been always with me it was natural that i should do so still i wanted to be fair and i divided it equally but i was pleased at the thought that her fortune which is as you know a very large one would be his and enable him to make a great figure in the world if he had chosen and now it is all over  go away now my boy the blow has been too much for me i am getting an old man and this is the second great blow i have had do not take to heart the wild words of poor little alice you see she scarcely knows what she is saying  without another word fred took his departure when once out of sight of the house his steps quickened and he walked briskly along  splendid he said to himself a grand stroke indeed and perfectly safe frank is not likely to return for twenty years if ever and i dont think the old man is good for another five i expect i shall have some trouble with that little cat alice but she is only a child and will come round in time and her fortune will be quite as useful to me as it would have been to him i always knew he was little better than a fool but i could hardly have hoped that he would have walked into the trap as he has done i suppose that other blow old bayley spoke of was that affair of his daughter that was a lucky business for me too  fred barkley was not mistaken it was of his daughter captain bayley had been thinking when he spoke he had married young when he first went out to india and had lost his wife two years later leaving him with a daughter six months old he had sent her home to england and after a twenty years absence he had returned and found her grown up  she had inherited something of her fathers passionate disposition and possessed in addition an amount of sullen obstinacy which was wholly alien to his nature but her father saw none of these defects in her character she was very beautiful with an air of pride and hauteur which he liked she had a right to be proud he thought for she was a very wealthy heiress for his two elder brothers having died childless while he was in india the fine property of their father had all descended to him  though the girl had many suitors she would listen to none of them having formed a strong attachment to a man in station altogether beneath her he had given lessons in drawing at the school which had been her home as well as her place of education during her fathers absence for captain bayley had quarrelled with his sisters both of whom he considered had married beneath them  the fact that ella bayley was an only child and that her father was a wealthy man was known in the school and had in some way come to the ears of the drawingmaster who was young and by no means illlooking he had played his cards well ella was romantic and impetuous and before long returned the devotion which her teacher expressed for her  when her father returned home and ella left school to take her place at the head of his establishment she had hoped that she should be able to win from him a consent to her engagement but she found his prejudices on the subject of birth were strong and she waited two years before she broached the subject  the wrath of captain bayley was prodigious he heaped abusive epithets upon the man of her choice till ellas temper rose also there was a passionate quarrel between father and daughter the next morning ella was missing a week afterwards captain bayley received a copy of the certificate of her marriage with a short note from ella saying that when he could make his mind up to forgive her and her husband and to acknowledge that the latter did not deserve the abusive language that he had applied to him she should be glad to return and resume her place as his affectionate and loving daughter she gave an address at which he could communicate to her  three years passed before captain bayleys anger had sufficiently calmed down for him to write to his daughter saying that he forgave her the letter was returned by the people at the house with a note saying that many months had elapsed since any inquiries had been made for letters for mrs smedley and that they had altogether lost sight of her now that the captain had once made up his mind to forgive his daughter he was burning with impatience to see her again and he at once employed a detective to find out what had become of her  from the person to whose house the letter had been directed the detective learned the address where she and her husband had resided while in london  for a time it seemed they had lived expensively the sale of ellas jewels keeping them in luxury for some months then hard times had come upon them the man had altogether lost his connection as a teacher and could or would do nothing to support his wife and himself they had moved from the place they had first lived at and taken much smaller lodgings  here the people of the house reported their life had been very unhappy the husband had taken to drink and there had been fierce and frequent quarrels between them arisingthe landlady had gleaned from the loud and angry utterance of the husbandfrom the wifes refusal to appeal to her father for assistance they had left this place suddenly and in debt thence they had moved from lodging to lodging at short intervals their position getting worse until they were last lodged in a wretched garret from this point they were traced with great trouble down to nottingham where the husband obtained a precarious living by producing designs for embroidery and curtains  had he been steady he might have soon done fairly but a great part of his time was spent in publichouses and he was seldom sober when returning home one night in a state of drunkenness he was run over by a heavy van and killed as his wife possessed but a few shillings in the world he was buried at the expense of the parish and his widow at once left the town  the people where she lodged believed that she had gone to london taking with her her six months old child and had started to tramp the way on foot the woman said that she doubted whether she could ever have got there she was an utterly broken woman with a constant racking cough which was like to tear her to pieces and before she set out her landlady had urged upon her that the idea of her starting to carry a heavy child to london was nothing short of madness  after this all trace of ella had been lost advertisements offering large rewards appeared in the papers the books of every workhouse between nottingham and london and indeed of almost every workhouse in england were carefully searched to see if there was any record of the death of a woman with a child about the time of her disappearance a similar search was made at all the london hospitals and at every institution where she might have crawled to die but no trace had ever been found of her  that she was dead was not doubted for it was found that at nottingham she had once gone to the parish doctor for some medicine for her child the physician had taken particular notice of her had asked her some questions and had made a note in his casebook that the mother of the child he had prescribed for was in an advanced stage of consumption and had probably but a few weeks certainly not more than a few months to live  it was long before the search was given up as hopeless and many hundreds of pounds were spent by captain bayley before he abandoned all hope of discovering if not his daughter at least her child during the year which elapsed before he was forced to acknowledge that it was hopeless captain bayley had suffered terribly his selfreproaches were unceasing and he aged many years in appearance  it was three years after this on the death of his sister mrs norris whose husband had died some years before that he took frank into his house and adopted him as his son stating however to all whom it might concern that he did not regard him as standing nearer to him as his heir than his other nephew fred barkley but that his property would be divided between them as they might show themselves worthy of it it was three years later still that at the death of her father an old fellowofficer his household was increased by the addition of alice who had been left to his guardianship but who had soon learned like frank to address him as uncle     illustration  chapter xv  the missing heir   it was a long time before the house in eaton square in any way recovered its former appearance captain bayley had lost much of his life and vivacity and as the servants remarked to each other nothing seemed to put him out he went for his morning ride in the park or his afternoon visit to the club as usual but his thoughts seemed far away he passed old friends without seeing them and if stopped he greeted them no longer with a cheery ring in his voice or a quick smile of welcome every one who knew him remarked that bayley was going down hill terribly fast and was becoming a perfect wreck  franks name was never now mentioned in the house its utterance had not been forbidden but it had been dropped as a matter concerning which a hopeless disagreement existed alice had changed almost as much as her uncle her spirits were gone her voice was no longer heard singing about the house she no longer ran up and down the stairs with quick springing footsteps and indeed seemed all at once to have changed from a young girl into a young woman sometimes as she sat the tears filled her eyes and rolled fast down her cheeks at other times she would walk about with her eyebrows knitted and hands clenched and lips pursed together a little volcano of suppressed anger  although no discussion on the subject had taken place between her and her guardian it was an understood thing that she maintained her opinion and that she regarded fred barkley as an enemy if she happened to be in the room when he was announced she would rise and leave it without a word if he remained to a meal she would not make her appearance in the dining or drawing rooms  alice still regards me as the incarnation of evil fred said with a forced laugh upon one of those occasions  the child is a trump captain bayley said warmly a warm lover and a good hater what a thing it is he said with a sigh to be at an age when trust and confidence are unshakable and when nothing will persuade you that what you wish to believe is not right what would i not give for that childs power of trust  the household in eaton square were almost unanimous in franks favour his genial hearty manners rendered him a universal favourite with the servants and although none knew the causes of franks sudden disappearance the general opinion was that whatever had happened he could not have been to blame in the matter  his warmest adherent was evan holl who had months before been introduced to the house as assistant knife and boot cleaner by frank he did not sleep there going home at nine oclock in the evening when his work was done  do you know harry he said one day what a rum crest as they calls iti asked the butler what it meant and he says as how it was the crest of the familycaptain bayley has hes got it on his silver and i noticed it when i was in the pantry today helping the butler to clean some silver dishes which had been lying by unused for some time all families of distinction the butler saidhe is mighty fond of using hard long wordsall families of distinction says he as got their own crest which belongs to them and no one else now this ere crest of the guvnors is a hand holding a dagger and the hand has only got three fingers i said as how there was two missing and that the chap as did it couldnt have known much of his business to go and leave out two fingers but the butler says thats your hignorance says he the hand as got only three fingers because a hancestor of the captains in the time of the crusaders and whats the crusaders says i the crusaders was a war between the english and the americans hundreds of years ago says he  harry burst into a shout of laughter mr butler does not know anything about it for the crusades were wars between people who went out to the holy land to recover the holy sepulchre from the turks who held it  ah well evan said it dont make no odds whether they was turks or americans however the butler says as how the captain bayley what lived in those days he saw a red injun acrawling to stab the king who was alying asleep in his tent and just as his hand was up to stick in the knife captain bayley he gives a cut with his sword which whips off two of the fingers and before the injun could turn round and go at him he gives another cut and takes off his hand at the wrist and the next cut he takes off his head so the hand with three fingers holding a dagger was given him to carry as a crest i suppose after a time the hand got wore out or got bad so as he couldnt have carried it about no longer and instead of that as a kind of remembrance of the affair he as them put on his forks and spoons  mrs holl had been listening with grave interest to the narrative  does i understand you to say evan that no other family but that of the masters put this threefingered hand with a knife on to their things  thats so mother leastways its what the butler says about it  then if thats the case mrs holl said thoughtfully any one who has got this crest as you calls it on his things must be a relation of the captain  i suppose so mother he might be a long distance off you know because this ere affair took place hundreds of years ago and there may be a lot of the same family about in different parts  so there might mrs holl said in a disappointed voice  why mother harry said one would think it made some difference to you you speak so mournfully about it  it dont make no difference to me harry mrs holl said but it makes a lot of difference to you you know i told you two or three months ago how you come to be here i dont know as i told you that round the neck of your mother when she died in that room was a bit of silk ribbon and on it was a little seal of gold with a red stone in it which i put by very careful for you though what good such a thing would do to you or anybody else i didnt see well on that red stone there was something cut and father he took it to a chap as understands about those things who got some red wax and hotted it and dropped some of it on a paper and then squeezed this ere stone down on it and looks at the mark through a eyeglass and he tells father that it was a hand with three lingers holding a dagger  that was curious mother harry said very curious can you fetch me the seal and let me have a look at it i dont remember ever having seen it  the seal was fetched by mrs holl from a pillbox in which it was carefully stored away in the corner of a drawer harry examined it closely  it looks like a hand holding a dagger he said but its too small for me to see whether it has three fingers or four evan will you run round with it to the little watchmakers in the next street and ask him to look at it with one of the glasses he sticks in his eye when he is at work and to tell you whether it has three fingers or four  evan returned in a few minutes with the news that the watchmaker at once said that the hand had but three fingers  well from that harry mrs holl said if what this man have been and told evan is right you must be some relation to captain bayley  a cousin fifty times removed perhaps harry laughed but at any rate it is pleasant to be able to think that i come of a good family  you knew that before harry mrs holl said severely for i told you over and over again that your mother was a lady though she was in bad circumstances and i think after charring in respectable houses for the last twenty years i ought to know a lady when i sees one well theres nothing as you think i could do about it  i should think not harry laughed how the old gent would stare if evan was to walk up to him and say captain bayley i have got a fosterbrother at home who i think is a relation of yours that would be a nice piece of cheek wouldnt it  evan laughed  however mother i votes as in future we calls harry harry bayley instead of harry holl  you wont do anything of the sort evan the cripple lad answered hotly holls my name and you dont suppose i am going to drop the name of the father and mother who brought me up and have tended me all these years for bayley or any other name besides even if it should turn out that i am remotely connected with the family there is no reason why my name should be bayley for of course if my mother had been a bayley she would have changed her name when she married  harry thought but little more of the matter but mrs holl turned it over frequently in her mind and discussed it with john john said he didnt think much would come of it still he didnt see as how there could be any harm in asking seeing that she had set her mind on it  so mrs holl resolved to move in the matter evan on being appealed to said that he did not see how she was to get to speak with captain bayley the footman wouldnt be likely to show her in to his master unless she stated her business but after much pressing and declaring over and over again he wished he had never said a word about the hand with three fingers evan consented if he found an opportunity to ask captain bayley to see his mother this opportunity however did not arrive evans duties never bringing him in contact with his employer at last mrs holl became desperate and one morning after breakfast she went to captain bayleys house the ring at the areabell brought out the cook  what is it she said sharply  i am the mother maam of evan as works here  well come down if you want to see him  i dont want to see him i want to see captain bayley  i will tell the footman the cook said but i dont think it likely as you can see the captain  the footman soon made his appearance fortunately he was very young and had not yet acquired that haughtiness of manner which characterises his class evan had before told him that his mother wanted to see captain bayley and had begged him to do his best should she come to facilitate her doing so  good morning he said your boy told me you would be likely enough coming so you want to see the captain he has just finished his breakfast and gone into the study now what shall i say you wants to see him for i cant show you in you know without asking him first  the young footman was indeed curious to know what mrs holls object could be in wishing to see his master evan had resisted all his attempts to find out simply saying that it was a private affair of his mothers  will you say to him mrs holl said that the mother of the boy as works here under you is most anxious for to see him just for two or three minutes that it aint nothing to do with the boy but she wishes particular to ask captain bayley a questionif he will be so good as to see herthat no one else but hisself could answer  its a rum sort of message the young footman said but anyhow i will give it the captain aint as hottempered as he used to be and he can but say he wont see you  captain bayley looked mystified when the footman delivered mrs holls message to him then he remembered that it was frank who had introduced her son to help in the house and he wondered whether her errand could have any connection with him  well show her up james he said but just tell her that my time is precious and that i dont want to listen to long rambling stories so whatever she has got to say let her say it straight out  its all right james said as descending to the kitchen he beckoned mrs holl to follow him but the captain says you are to cut it short so if you wants an answer you had best put your question whatever it is short and to the point or he will snap you up in a minute i can tell you  mrs holl followed into the library she was at no time a very clearheaded thinker and the difficulty of putting her question into a few words pressed heavily upon her  now my good woman what is it captain bayley said as she entered i am going out in a few minutes so come straight to the point if you please  i will come as straight as i can sir mrs holl said breathlessly but indeed sir i am a bad hand at explaining things and if you snaps me up i shall never get on with it  captain bayley smiled a little well i will try and not snap you up if you will come to the point now what is the point  the point sir mrs holl said despairingly is a hand with three fingers aholding of a dagger  captain bayley looked astonished you mean my crest he said why what on earth are you driving at  evan saw it on the forks mrs holl explained  yes no doubt he did captain bayley said but what of that thats my crest  yes sir so evan said and when he told me it just knocked me silly like and says i to him says i  never mind what you said to him captain bayley broke in what is it you want to say to me what is there curious in my crest being on my spoons now just wait one minute and tell me as plainly as you can  mrs holl waited a minute  well sir it struck me all in a heap because ive got in the house a thing with just such another hand aholding of a knife in it  oh captain bayley said you have got some article with my crest on it in your house how did you come by it it must have been stolen  no sir i will take my davey as the young person as was my son harrys mother never stole nothing in her life  the young person who was your son harrys mother captain bayley repeated in a somewhat puzzled tone are you talking of yourself  lor no sir the young person  but what young person do you mean how can any young person have been your son harrys mother except yourself  he aint really my son you see sir he is the son of a young person who we took in john and i and who died at our house harry is her son  a great change passed over captain bayleys face the expression of impatience died out and was succeeded by one almost of awe he dropped the paper which he had hitherto held in his hand and leaning forward he asked in low tones  do you mean that a woman who had in her possession some article with my crest on it and who had a child with her died in your house  yes sir thats what i mean the article is a little gold seal with a red stone to it  how long ago was this came slowly from captain bayleys lips  about seventeen years ago mrs holl said the mother died a few days afterwards the child is our harry and i came to ask youbut good lawks  an ashen greyness had been stealing across the old officers face and mrs holl was terrified at seeing him suddenly fall forward across the table  she rushed to the door to ask for help james was in the hall having waited there expecting momentarily to hear his master tell him to show his visitor out he began to utter exclamations of dismay at seeing his masters senseless figure  i will lift him up she said run and fetch the butler and the cook and then go for the doctor as quick as you can run he has got a stroke  the butler was first upon the scene mrs holl had already lifted captain bayley into a sitting position i have taken off his necktie and opened his collar she said the butler who was unaware of mrs holls presence there was astonished at the scene  who are you he gasped and what have you been doing to the captain if you have killed him it will be a hanging matter you know  dont you be a fool retorted mrs holl sharply but run for some water he has got a stroke though what it came from is more nor i can tell  to be called a fool by this unknown woman of coarse appearance roused the butlers faculties he was sincerely attached to his master and without reply he at once hurried away for water  in five minutes the doctor who lived close by entered mrs holl was still holding up the insensible man alice stood crying beside her the servants were looking on  open the windows he said  then he felt the captains pulse for some time he stood silent then he said  lay him down at full length on the couch mrs holl without the least effort lifted the slight figure and laid it on the sofa  now the doctor said will you all leave the room except miss hardy and you he nodded to mrs holl as the servants retired reluctantly the butler said  please sir i dont know whether you know it but that woman was with him alone when he got insensible i dont know what she did to him but i should recommend that we should have a policeman in readiness  nonsense the surgeon said however it will be better that she should retire but let her wait outside close at hand in case he wishes to speak to her  sarah holl followed the servants into the hall the doctor poured a few drops of cordial between captain bayleys lips and placed some strong salts beneath his nostrils  you think he will come round alice asked  he will come round the doctor said confidently his pulse is gaining power rapidly it is not paralysis but a sort of faintingfit brought on i should imagine by some sudden shock his heart is weak and there was a sudden failure of its powers i have warned him over and over again not to excite himself however i think there is no great harm done this time but he must be careful in future another such attack and it might go hard with him see he is coming round in a few minutes captain bayley opened his eyes and looked round vaguely  lie quiet for a little while my dear sir the doctor said cheerfully you have been ill a sort of faintingfit but you will be all right in a short time drink this glass of cordial he lifted his patients head and held the glass to his lips as captain bayley drank it alice placed a pillow under his head  how was it captain bayley asked in a low tone  we dont know the doctor said but dont think about it at present what you have to do now is to get quite strong again it will be time afterwards for you to think what upset you you have given miss hardy here quite a fright  captain bayley nodded to alice i never did such a thing before he said i was reading here in the library then he stopped a sudden flush came to his face  dont agitate yourself my dear sir the doctor said soothingly agitation now would be a very serious thing drink a little more of this  captain bayley did as he was told and then asked  where is the woman who was speaking to me  she is outside the doctor said i told her to wait but you really must not see her for a time  i am all right now captain bayley said rising to his elbow and it will agitate me less to see her than to wait she brought me very strange news news which i never thought to hear it is not bad news my dear he said to alice it is the best news i ever heard you need not go away doctor he said seeing the physician was preparing to leave you are an old friend and know all about it besides it is no secret you know how i searched for very many years for my daughter and her child and came at last to the conclusion that both must be dead for she was in a dying state when last heard of well i have found that the boy is alive he has been brought up by the woman who is the mother of a boy who works here  oh i know alice exclaimed frank told me the story she had told him about a woman who had fallen down at her door years ago and how she had brought up the child but o uncle she said pitifully i have a sad thing to tell you frank said that he was such a nice boy so clever and good frank used to go and help him with his books and he can read latin and all sorts of things but uncle he met with an accident when he was little and he is a cripple  for a minute captain bayley was silent  it is part of my punishment dear he said at last gods will be done however cripple or not i am thankful to find that from what you say he is a boy whom i can own without shame for the thought has troubled me always that should ellas son be alive he might have grown up a companion of thieves a wandering vagabond thank god indeed it is not so i am glad you told me alice now let me see this good woman who has been a mother to him  mrs holl was again called in and was asked to sit down  the question you wished to ask me captain bayley said was i suppose whether i could give you any clue as to who was the woman you took in and whose child you adopted she was my daughter  lor sir mrs holl exclaimed who would have thought such a thing  who indeed captain bayley repeated but so it was for years i sought for her in vain and had long since given up all hope of ever hearing of her have you got the seal with you  after some search mrs holl produced from the corner of her capacious pocket the seal carefully wrapped up in paper  that is it captain bayley said with a sigh alice go to my desk open the inner compartment and there you will see the fellow to it alice did as he requested  there you see doctor they are exactly alike they were both made at the same time soon after i returned from india and now mrs holl please tell us the whole story as i understand you told it to my nephew  mrs holl repeated the story in nearly the same words that she had used to frank  god bless you captain bayley said when she finished no words can tell how grateful i am to you or how deeply i am moved at the thought of the kindness which you and your husband strangers as you were to her showed to my poor girl i hope you will not mind sparing him to me now your claims are far greater than mine but you have other children while i with the exception of my ward here am alone in the world  lor sir mrs holl said wiping her eyes with her apron of course we will spare him we shall miss him sorely for he has indeed been a comfort and a blessing to us but it is for his good and you wont mind his coming to see us sometimes  mind captain bayley exclaimed he would be an ungrateful rascal if he did not want to come and see you constantly well if you will go home and prepare him a little i will come round this afternoon and see him its no use shaking your head doctor i feel myself again now but i will lie down till lunchtime and will promise not to excite myself     illustration  chapter xvi  john holl dust contractor   it was a pathetic meeting between captain bayley and his newlyfound grandson the latter had been astounded at the wonderful news that mrs holl had brought home his first thought was that of indignation that his mother should have been a penniless wanderer in the streets of london while her father was rolling in wealth but mrs holls description of the old officers agitation and pleasure and the long efforts which he had made to find his daughter convinced him that there must at least have been some fault on both sides  my poor boy captain bayley said as he entered the room if you knew how long and earnestly i have sought for you and how many years i have grieved and repented my harshness to your mother you would not find it in your heart to think hardly of me we were both to blame my boy and we were both punished heavily punished but you shall have all the story some day i know that it must be a bitter thought for you that she died homeless save for the shelter which this good woman afforded her but i hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive an old man who has been terribly punished and that you will let me do my best to atone by making your life as happy as i can  harry took the hand which the old officer held out to him  for myself i have nothing to forgive sir my life has been a happy one thanks to the kindness and love of my father and mother here as to my real mother of course i do not remember her nor is it for me to judge between her and you at any rate i can well believe that you must have suffered greatly i have been thinking it over and it seems to me that the mere fact that your wishes have at last been carried out and that you have so strangely found your daughters son would seem as if any wrongs you did her are considered by god as atoned for i am sorry that i am a cripple i have been sorry before sometimes but never so sorry as now for it must be a great disappointment to you  i am so pleased at finding you as you are my boy captain bayley said for i had feared that if you were alive it must be as a vagrant or perhaps even a criminal that your bodily misfortune is as nothing in my eyes this is my ward miss hardy she is something like a granddaughter to me and is prepared to be a sister to you  i have heard of her from evan sir harry said with a bright look at the girl he has told me how every one in the house loves her and how fond my kind friend but here he stopped abruptly the tale of franks sudden departure was a subject of frequent discussion at the holls as well as in the servants hall in eaton square and although harrys indignation on behalf of his friend had been extreme he paused now before uttering the name for at this first meeting with his relation he felt that no unpleasant topic should be introduced  there was a moments silence as he paused but alice advanced fearlessly and gave the boy her hand  thank you harry for what you say and we shall be all the better friends because you love as i do my dear good cousin frank  well harry captain bayley said hastily when will you come home to me i dont want to press you to leave your kind friends here too suddenly but i am longing to have you home i have the carriage at the end of the street if you will come now  no grandfather not today i will come tomorrow father took his dinner away with him and he will not be back till this evening and i am not going to let him come and find me gone  quite right my boy quite right captain bayley said then tomorrow at eleven oclock i will come round in the carriage and fetch you mrs holl remember that harry bayley owes you a deep debt of gratitude which he will do his best some day to repay as far as it is in his power goodbye harry for the present i am glad your mother gave you my name it seems to show she thought kindly of me at the last perhaps she found poor girl that i had not been altogether wrong in my opposition to her unhappy fancy  the following day harry was installed in eaton square captain bayley was delighted to find how easily and naturally he fell into the new position how well he expressed himself and how wide was his range of knowledge  he is a gentleman every inch he exclaimed delightedly to alice if you knew how i have thought of him you would understand how happy it makes me to see him what he is  captain bayley lost no time in obtaining the best possible surgical advice for his grandson their opinion was not as favourable as he had hoped had he been properly treated at the time of his accident he might they said have made a complete recovery but now it was too late however they thought that by means of surgical appliances and a course of medicinal baths he might recover the use of his legs to some extent and be able to walk with crutches this was something and the captain determined at once to carry their advice into effect  between alice hardy and the lad a strong friendship speedily sprang up the girls bright talk which was so different from anything he had hitherto experienced was very delightful to the lad but the strong bond between them was their mutual feeling about frank from her harry learned the charge under which frank laboured and his indignant repudiation of the possibility of such a thing delighted alices heart hitherto she had been alone in her belief and it was delightful to her to talk with one who was of her own way of thinking she infected harry with her own dislike and suspicions of fred barkley and amused the lad greatly by telling him how when she had heard of the discovery of his existence she had when mrs holl left gone straight up to her room and indulged in a wild dance of delight at the destruction of freds hope of being captain bayleys sole heir  it was glorious she said i knew fred hated frank though frank silly old boy was always taking his part with me and scolding me because i didnt like his cousin and i am quite quite sure that he has had something to do with getting frank into this dreadful scrape and it was glorious to think that just when he thought that he had got the field clear and uncle harry all to himself you should suddenly appear and put his nose out of joint thats a very unladylike expression harry and i know i oughtnt to use it but theres nothing else does so well its freds holidays now and he is away i expect uncle will write and tell him all about it i wish he wouldnt for i would give anything to see his face when he walks in and sees you sitting here and hears who you are  oh but i hope harry said that grandfather wont make any difference to any one because of me what would be the use of much money to me of course i should like to have a little house with a man to wheel me about but what could i want beyond that  oh nonsense harry in the first place you are going to get better and even if you were not you could enjoy life in lots of ways of course you would have nice carriages and horses you might keep a yachtfrank was always saying that he would like to have a yachtand i dont see why you shouldnt go into parliament i am sure you are clever enough and i have heard uncle say that threefourths of the members are fools he says something naughty before fools but you know he swears dreadfully he does not mean it not in the least i suppose he learned it in india i tell him it is very wrong sometimes but he says he is too old to get rid of bad habits i wish he wouldnt do it and the worst of it is harry she said plaintively that instead of being very much shocked as i ought to be very often i can hardly help laughing he does put in that dreadful word so funnily  no i should not care about being in parliament the boy said if i were ever so rich i think i might like a yacht still a yacht if it were only a small one would cost a great deal of money and i do hope that grandfather wont disappoint any one for my sake  captain bayley had however a few days after the discovery of his grandson and after having satisfied himself how lovable the lad was and how worthy in all respects to be his heir written to fred barkley telling him that his grandson had been found and that he was all that he could wish to find him  naturally fred he wrote this will make a considerable difference in your prospects at the same time as you have been led to believe that you would come into a considerable property at my death and as you have done nothing to forfeit my confidence and affection having proved yourself in all ways a steady and industrious and honourable young fellow i do not consider it right that you should be altogether disinherited by a discovery which has occasioned me such vast pleasure i have therefore instructed my solicitor to prepare a new will by this he will settle my property in warwickshire and my town house upon my grandson but my other house property and a portion of my money in stocks and shares which has been accumulating for many years will be left to you the value of the legacy being i calculate about onehalf of that of the property left to my grandson thus you will be in nearly the same position you would have occupied had not your cousin frank forfeited by his disgraceful conduct his place in my affections  whatever may have been the feelings of fred barkley when he received this communication he wrote a graceful letter of congratulation to his uncle expressing his pleasure at the discovery of his longlost grandson and with many thanks for his kind intention on his own behalf his anger and disappointment were so great that he did not return to town until the day before he was going up to cambridgehaving left westminster at the end of the preceding termfor he did not feel himself equal before that time to continue to play his part and to express personally the sentiments which he had written what rendered his disappointment even more bitter was the thought that indirectly it was frank who had dealt him the blow for captain bayley had mentioned in his letter that it was through the boy whom his cousin had recommended as an assistant to the footman that the discovery had been made  the visit that he paid at eaton square was a short one to his relief alice was not present for he was certain that she would have watched him with malicious pleasure but there had been a passage of arms between her and her guardian of a more serious nature than any which had occurred since she had been under his care owing to her having expressed herself with her usual frankness respecting freds visit  her guardian had resented this warmly and had rated her so severely as to what he called her wicked prejudice against fred that she had retired to her room in tears this defeat of his favourite had not predisposed harry to any more favourable opinion of his unknown cousin but fred relieved from the presence of alice acted his part so well and infused so genuine a ring into the tone of his congratulations that he did much to dissipate the prejudice with which harry was prepared to regard him alice was quick to observe the impression which fred had made and quarrelled hotly with harry concerning it  i am disappointed in you altogether harry i have looked upon you as being a real friend of frank and now you desert him directly his enemy says a few soft words to you i despise such friendship and i dont want to have anything more to say to you  in vain harry protested the girl flung herself out of the room in deep anger and thenceforth for a long time harry was made to feel that although she wished to be civil to him as her guardians grandson yet that the bond of union between them was entirely broken harry himself had lost no time in speaking to his grandfather on behalf of frank  my dear harry the old man said my faith in his innocence was as strong as yours and crushing as the proofs seemed to be i would never have doubted him had he defended himself but he did not he never sent me a line to ask me to suspend my judgment or to declare his innocence he ran away like a thief at night and although fred generously tried to soften the fact to me there is no doubt he admitted his guilt to him still after the lesson i had in your mothers case i would forgive him did i know where he was  i do not say harry that i would restore him to his place in my affection and confidence that of course would be impossible but i would willingly send him a cheque for a handsome amount say for five thousand pounds to establish him in business or set him up in a farm in one of the colonies  that is no use grandfather harry said if he is innocentas i most firmly believe him to be in spite of everything against him and shall believe him to be to my dying day unless he himself tells me that he was guiltyhe will not accept either your forgiveness or your money what i wish is that he could be found i wish that i could see him or that you could see him face to face and that we could hear from his own lips what he has to say he might at least account for his foolish running away instead of facing it out  we do not know how desperate he might have been at being unable to clear himself from the charge brought against him remember he could not have known how hotly you were working on his behalf and may have believed himself altogether deserted he may account for not having written to you and we must remember grandfathermind i do not share all alices prejudice and have no inclination in any way to doubt the honesty of my cousin fredbut at the same time in bare justice to frank we must not forget that fred was really a rival of his in your affections and that he would possibly benefit greatly by franks disgrace and we must also remember that the only evidence against frank with the exception of the circumstantial proof comes from him  it was he who furnished frank with funds to enable him to run away and we cannot tell whether or not he did not even urge him to fly you must remember grandfather that alice asserts fred always hated frank i know she is prejudiced and that you never noticed the feeling nor did frank but childrens perceptions are very quick and even allowing that she liked frank much the best fred was always as she admits very kind and attentive to hermore so in some ways than frank and there was no reason therefore for her taking up such a prejudice had she not been convinced that it was true  now grandfather i will tell you what has occurred to me i know it will appear a hideously unjust suspicion to you but i will tell you once for all and we will not recur to the subject again god knows i may be wronging him cruelly but the wrong would be no greater than that which has been done to frank if he is really innocent  ever since you told me the whole story i have lain awake at night thinking it over it may be that what alice has said may have turned my thoughts that way but i can see only two explanations of the affair  frank is really guilty or he is altogether innocent if he is innocent who was guilty some one took the note some one sent it to frank and this some one must be a person who knew that frank was in need of it whoever did so can only have done it with one of two motives either to get frank out of trouble or to bring disgrace upon him only four boys knew of the affair and they all declare that they told no one else if they spoke truly it was one of these four sent him the notealways supposing that he did not take it himself of the other three i know nothing but i will take the case of fred and view it as if he was a stranger to both of us  he was a rival of franks alice declares he hated him at any rate he would benefit greatly by franks disgrace what did he do when frank asked him to help him he refused to do so on the ground that he had no money but two days later he was able to raise double the sum frank then wanted in order to assist him to fly dreadful as the supposition is it seems to me that the only positive alternative to supposing frank to be guilty is to believe that his cousin took this note and sent it to him in order to bring him into disgrace and that he afterwards urged and assisted him to fly in order to stamp his guilt more firmly upon him  while harry had been speaking captain bayley had paced up and down the room  impossible harry he exclaimed impossible for bad as was the case of frank taking the note on the pressure of the moment to get himself out of the silly scrape into which he had got this charge which you bring against fred would be a hundred times ay a thousand times worse it would be a piece of hideous treachery a piece of villainy of which i can scarce believe a human being capable  i do not bring the charge grandfather harry said quietly i only state the alternative that one of your nephews took this note seems to me to be clear the crime would be infinitely greater infinitely more unpardonable in the one case than the other but the incentive too was enormously greater in the one case the only object for the theft would be to avoid the consequence of a foolish but after all not a serious freak in the other to obtain a large fortune and to ruin the chances of a dangerous rival  remember at that time fred did not know how you had determined to dispose of your property frank was living with you and was apparently your favourite therefore he may have deemed that it was all or nothing there grandfather i have done i need not say that i know little of the real disposition of your two nephews frank behaved to me with the greatest kindness when i was a poor cripple without the slightest claim upon him fred has behaved kindly and courteously although i have come between him and you i can only say that i believe that one of these two must be guilty which it is god alone knows  i wish you had said nothing about it captain bayley groaned it is dreadful i dont know what to do or what to think  there is nothing to be done harry said except grandfather to find frank let us find him and see him face to face let us hear his story from beginning to end and i think then we shall arrive at a just conclusion i have no doubt he has gone abroad and i should advise that you should advertise in all the colonial and american papers begging him to return to have an interview with you and offering a handsome reward to any one who will give you information of his whereabouts if we find where he is and he will not come to us we will go to him  thats what i will do harry i will not lose a moments time but will set about it at once if i spend ten thousand pounds in advertising i will find him as to fred i cannot meet him again until i get to the bottom of the affair so we will stay away from england till i get some news of frank  before starting abroad captain bayley carried out his plan for rewarding john and sarah holl for the kindness they had shown to harry after consultation with his grandson he had concluded that the best plan of doing so would be to help them in their own mode of life he accordingly called upon the dustcontractor for whom john holl worked a man who owned twenty carts an agreement was soon come to with him by which captain bayley agreed to purchase his business at his own price with the whole of the plant carts and horses a fortnight after this johns master said to him one day  john i have sold my business you are going to have a new master  i am sorry for that john said for we have got on very well together for the last fifteen years besides he added thoughtfully it may be a bad job for me i am not as young as i used to be and he may bring new hands with him  i will speak to him about you john his master said he is a good sort and i dare say i can manage it the thing is going to be done well three or four new carts are going to be put on instead of some of the old ones and there are ten firstrate horses coming in place of some of those that are getting past work the stables are all being done up and the thing is going to be done tiptop curiously enough his name is the same as yours john holl  is it now john said well that will be a rum go to see my own name on the carts john holl dust contractor it dont sound bad neither so you will speak to him gaffer  ay i will speak to him his employer answered  three days later john received a message from his master to the effect that the new gaffer would take possession next day and that he was to call at the office at eleven oclock he added that his new employer said that he wished mrs holl to go round with her husband  john and sarah were greatly mystified with the latter part of this message until the solution occurred to them that probably their late employer had mentioned that mrs holl went out charring and cleaning and that he might intend to engage her to keep the office tidy  accordingly at eleven oclock on the following day john and sarah presented themselves at the office at chelsea as they entered the yard they were greatly amused at seeing all the carts ranged along in the glory of new paint with john holl dust contractor in large letters on their sides a boy was in the office who told them that they were to go to the house the yard was situated near the river and the house which adjoined it was a large oldfashioned building standing in a pretty walled garden they went to the back door and knocked it was opened by a brightlooking servantgirl  is mr holl in sarah asked  you are to be shown in the girl said and ushered them into a large oldfashioned parlour comfortably furnished  john and sarah gave a cry of surprise for sitting by the fire in his wheeled box just as in the olden time was harry  scarce a day had passed since he had left them without his coming in for a halfhour for a chat with them but his appearance here struck them with astonishment  what on arth be you adoing here harry mrs holl asked do you know our new gaffer  yes mother i know him captain bayley has had some business with him and asked me to come down here to see him you are to sit down until he comes  but that will never do harry why what would he think of us if he comes in and finds us sitting down in his parlour just as if the place belonged to us  its all right mother i will make it right with him hes a good fellow is the new gaffera firstrate fellow  is he now john asked interested as he and sarah seeing nothing else to do sat down and his name is john holl just the same as mine  just the same john and hes not unlike you either now when i tell you what a kind action he did once you will see the sort of fellow he is once a good many years ago when he wasnt as well off as he is now when he was just a hardworking man earning his weekly pay a poor woman with a child fell down dying at his door well you know other people would have sent for a policeman and had her taken off to the workhouse but he and his wife took her into their house and tended her till she died  that was a rightdown good thing john said quite oblivious of the fact that he too had done such an action  sarah did not speak but gave a little gasping cry and threw her apron which she wore indoors and out over her head a sure sign with her that she was going to indulge in what she called a good cry john looked at her in astonishment  and more than that john harry went on they took in the child and brought it up as one of their own and though afterwards they had a large family they never made him feel that he was a burden to them though he grew up a cripple and was able to do nothing to repay them for all their goodness well at last the boys friends were found they had lots of money and the time came at last when they bought a business for john holl and when he came there the cripple boy was sitting at the fire to welcome them and say welcome father and welcome mother and harry held out his hands to them both  even now john holl did not understand he was naturally dull of comprehension and the loud sobbing of his wife so bewildered and confounded him that it divided his attention with harrys narrative  yes harry he said its all very nice but whats come to you sarah what are you making all this fuss about we shall be having the new master coming in and finding you sobbing and rocking yourself like a mad woman cheer up old woman what is it  dont you see john sarah sobbed out dont you see harry has been telling you your own story dont you see that it is you he has been talking about and that you are john holl dust contractor  me john said in utter bewilderment  yes father harry said taking his hand you are the john holl this house and the business and the carts and horses are yours captain bayley has bought them all for you he would not come here himself as i wished him but he asked me to tell you and mother how glad he was to be able to repay in a small way he said your great kindness to me and how he hoped that you would prosper here and be as happy as you deserve to be you will be better off than your last gaffer for he had to pay rent for this house and yard but as grandfather has bought the freehold of them all for you you will have no rent to pay and therefore i hope even in bad times you will be able to get along comfortably there father there mother dry your eyes and look sharp for i can hear voices in the garden evan went to your house after you had gone to bring all the children round here in a cab  you will find everything in the house mother and you must get a grand tea as soon as possible i have got a servant for youfor you know you must have a servant now  the next minute the children came bounding in wild with delight and a happier party never assembled than those who sat round the table of john holl dust contractor on the evening of his first taking possession of his new property     illustration  chapter xvii  the lonely diggers   the camp increased rapidly for although no extraordinarily rich finds were made the valley bottom widened out at this point and the gold was generally disseminated in quantities sufficient to enable the miners to live and every one hoped that as they got deeper their claims would increase in value every day added to the number of tents and huts three bars competed with each other for the favour of the diggers and two large stores drove a profitable trade in food and mining tools and materials brawls at the gamblingtables were of nightly occurrence and no small proportion of the gold obtained by the more fortunate diggers found its way into the pockets of the gamblers  i tell you what abe frank said a short time after their arrival when they heard that a young man had been shot down by one of the most notorious ruffians in the camp i think it would be a good plan if we were all to agree that we will not enter one of these saloons i know its a temptation after work is over to saunter in there but i think such a party as we are are enough for each other we have done well enough for months out on the plains and i dont see why we should not do so now we are friends and should be awfully sorry to see any one of our number losing his share of our joint earnings at the gamblingtables or brought home with a bullethole in his head  if we want a little change we can always ask one or two of the quiet men to join us round our fire if we want drink it is cheaper and better to buy it by the bottle and have a glass in company here there is no doubt that any one who takes to drink here may as well hang himself at once for he will never do any good i dont know that any of us are inclined that way but i think it would be a good plan to enter into a sort of agreement with each other that as long as we are in partnership none of us shall enter a saloon or stake a dollar in play  i agrees with you frank time has been when i have gone in for as heavy sprees as any one i dont think as i am likely to do it again but i am sure that an agreement like that would be a good thing for me as well as the others what do yer say boys  the only thing is peter suggested that we might one or other very well get into a bad quarrel by refusing to drink when we are asked you see its pretty nigh a deadly offence to refuse to drink with a man and if it got noticed that none of us ever went into a bar there are men here who would make a point of asking us to drink just for the sake of making a quarrel if we refused  i allow theres something in that abe said theres no surer way of getting into a mess among a set of men like this than in refusing to drink  well if thats the case frank said we must modify the arrangement and agree that none of us will go into a bar unless actually asked to go and take a drinkthat wouldnt be very often the invitation is generally given inside we come back from work about the same time that every one else knocks off and they are not thinking of going to the bars till they have had a meal and when we are once quietly seated round the fire here no one is very likely to ask any of us to get up and go off to one of the saloons  the suggestion was adopted and all bound themselves not to enter a saloon to drink or gamble unless invited to take a drink under circumstances in which a refusal would be taken in bad part  i am mighty glad you proposed that abe said afterwards rube is all right but peter and dick are both of em fond of going on a spree now and then and this may keep them from it i told em when we started that i was ready to go partners as long as they kept from drink but i wasnt going to tie myself up with any one as was going in for that when we dissolves partnership each one will have a right to do with his share what he likes he can gamble it away or drink it away or fool it away as he chooses but no man as drinks overnight will do his fair share of work next day besides luck may at any time go agin us and we may have to fall back on what we have laid by when times were good and if any one had been and spent his share he couldnt be looking to the others to support him besides as i pinted out we might want all the money we has got atween us to buy up a claim in a good place they agreed to it and so far they have kept to it not of course as they had much chance to do otherwise on the way still i think this fresh agreements likely to do good we are working here on shares and each man is bound to do his best for the others  after sitting by the fire for some time of an evening frank generally got up and strolled round the camp accompanied by turk there were many phases of life presented to him while the successful diggers were drinking and gambling in the saloons there were many who could barely keep life together it was true this was in most cases their own fault for men willing to work could earn their five dollars a day by labouring in the claims of wealthier or more successful diggers but many would hold on to their own claims hoping against hope and believing always that the ground would get richer as they went down  frank chatted freely with every one and he and his great dog were soon known to every one in camp he was able to do many little acts of kindness to those whose luck was bad for on arriving at the end of the journey each of the party had at abes suggestion put twenty dollars into the common fund and beyond this amount the sum he had brought with him from omaha was still untouched and many a man who would otherwise have gone to bed supperless after a hard days work was indebted to him for the means of procuring a few pounds of flour and a pound or two of pork  his attention had been particularly attracted to two men who lived in a small tent a hundred yards away from any of the others and who worked a claim by themselves they did not seem to have any communication with the rest of the diggers and kept themselves entirely apart while at work frank had heard several jeering remarks as to the absurdity of working a claim in a part of the ground which had over and over again been tried and abandoned and frank felt sure that the men were doing badly  one day he observed that only one of the men was at work the younger of the two and as he continued to wield his shovel after the others had thrown down their tools for the evening frank walked over to him  is your partner ill he asked i see he is not working with you today  the man nodded but continued his work without speaking he was evidently indisposed for conversation  why i asked frank said was not for mere curiosity but because we have brought up with us from sacramento a few bottles of fever medicine and other things likely to be wanted here and if any of them would be of use you will be heartily welcome to them we ought all to help each other for no one knows whether he himself may not want a helping hand next  thank you the man said somewhat gruffly we shall get on all right and my mate isnt fond of strangers  i need not trouble him myself frank said i can bring you round any medicines here and you can give them to him without saying how you got them  thank you medicine wouldnt do him any good the man said and resumed his work as if anxious to avoid further conversation  frank however was not to be discouraged the man looked thin and haggard and frank suspected that it might be food rather than medicine of which the mans mate was in need he therefore stood his ground  i am afraid you havent hit on a very good spot he said i dont know much about it myself for i have only been here about a month but i hear every one say that there have been several trials made here and that none of them have found anything to speak of  we must work where we can the man said the places were pretty well all taken up when we came and it didnt suit us to go further  well said frank i dont want to be inquisitive mate or to interfere in other peoples affairs but i noticed your mate looked an elderly man and that you seemed pretty much alone i am only just out here myself and i and the party i am working with are doing fairly so i thought it would be only neighbourly to come over and see if i could be of use in any way  no thank you the man repeated theres nothing we want  frank saw that at present he could do nothing but he had little doubt that the two men were really suffering severely still he understood and respected their pride and with a friendly good evening strolled off to his own hut  the next evening he again went round to the solitary workman  how is your mate he asked  the man shook his head hes pretty bad  the tone was softer and less repellent than that which he had used the evening before he was a young man of not more than three or four and twenty and frank saw that his lip quivered as he turned away from him and dug his shovel into the ground  if your mate is worse frank said you have no right to refuse my offer i cannot help feeling that you are doing badly in that case why should you not let me lend you a hand theres no disgrace in being unlucky here men are unlucky one week and make a rich strike on the week following and then they can lend a hand to others just as a hand may have been lent to them when they wanted it i think by your accent that you are an englishman and an educated one just as i am myself why on earth dont you let me be a friend to you  the man did not reply but frank could guess by the random way in which he was doing his work that a struggle was going on  he would not hear of it he said at last  then dont let him hear of it frank said promptly if he has any mistaken ideas about taking help from a stranger the sort of ideas one would naturally have at home and is ill and wants something we must help him in spite of himself if as i suspect he needs other matters as well as medicine you should provide him even if it be necessary to carry out a little harmless deception  i would not tell him a lie the man said almost fiercely  no theres no occasion for that frank went on you can tell him that you have come across that nugget in the claim and frank tossed into the hole a nugget for which he had half an hour before given a digger ten dollars from his own store  for a moment the man stood irresolute and then burst into a passion of tears frank saw that he had gained the day and saying i will come round for a chat tomorrow afternoon thats my camp up therethat tent just on the ridge i have really medicines if you think they will be of any use strolled away to his supper he glanced round when he had gone a little distance and saw the digger running at full speed towards the solitary tent  the next evening the young man dropped his shovel as he approached him and came to meet him  i did not thank you last night he began  nonsense frank said interrupting there is no occasion whatever for thanks why its the custom here whenever any one is taken ill or is unfortunate and has to move on a few friends or as it often happens a few strangers will each chip in a pinch of gold dust to help him on its the rule here that we stand by each other and being both englishmen it is natural we should lend each other a hand how is your mate  he is a good deal better thanks to the food i was able to get for him for as you guessed we have been nearly starving the last fortnight  but why did you keep on working at such a place as this frank asked why didnt you go on wages there are plenty of men here who would be glad to take on an extra hand if they could get him  the young man hesitated  i know it must seem utter folly he said at last but the fact is my partner has a fixed idea that claim will turn out well he dreamt it  pooh frank said diggers are constantly dreaming about lucky placesand no wonder when they are always thinking about them i consider it madness to keep on toiling here even if your mate is ill it is folly to give in to him in this way and for you both to be halfstarved when you can earn at any rate enough to keep you both by working for others  that is just what i knew you would say the young man replied and i feel it myself thoroughly  then why on earth do you keep on doing it  i have a reason a very particular reason though i am not at liberty to explain it  well then theres no more to be said frank replied vexed at what he regarded as obstinate folly he talked for a few minutes and then strolled away and for the next two days did not go near the digger who seemed so bent on slaving uselessly  the third day frank noticed that the man was not at work on his claim as soon as he knocked off in the evening he walked across to the spot the tools still lay in the hole showing that the claim had not been abandoned although work had temporarily ceased  next day the claim was still unworked the tent stood in its place showing that the diggers had not moved away although from their previous conversation frank thought that he might not improbably meet with a repulse after work was done he strolled over to the tent  are you in mate he asked outside seeing you were not at work for the last two days i thought i would walk over and ask you if anything was the matter  the young man came out from the tent he looked utterly wornout  my father has been too ill for me to leave him he said in a low tone i spoke of him as my mate before but he is my father  can i do anything frank asked  no thank you i dont think any one can do anything if there were a doctor in camp of course i should call him in but i dont think it would be of any use hes broken down altogether broken down we dont want for anything thanks to your kindness  you look wornout yourself frank said  i suppose i do i have not lain down for the past five days  then frank said i insist on taking your place tonight is he sensible  the young man shook his head  sometimes for a little while i think he knows where he is but most of the time he lies perfectly still or just talks to himself  very well then frank said he will not know the difference besides you can lie down in the tent and i can wake you at once if there is any occasion  the man hesitated but he was too wornout to resist and he made no opposition as frank entered the tent an elderly man lay stretched upon some blankets one of which was thrown loosely over him frank stooped and put his fingers on his wrist he could scarcely feel the pulse  what have you been giving him  i got a piece of fresh meat and boiled it down into broth  have you given him any stimulants i think he wants keeping up  he never touches them the young man said  all the better frank replied they will have all the more effect upon him as medicine if you will wait here a few minutes i will go up to my tent and fetch down a blanket and a few things i will be with you in ten minutes  frank briefly announced to his comrades that he was going to sit up for the night with a sick man he put a bottle containing a glass or two of brandy in his pocket and went into a store and purchased some lemons and a piece of fresh beef this he took back to the camp fire and asked abe to put it on and let it simmer all night in the ashes in just enough water to cover it and then to strain it in the morning and bring the broth across to what was known in the camp as the lonely tent he took a small phial of laudanum and quinine from the store of medicines to use if they might appear likely to be needed and then went back to the tent  now he said to the young man you lie down at once if you are wanted i will be sure and wake you i shall make myself comfortable never fear one of my mates will bring me down a pannikin of tea the last thing  he squeezed one of the lemons into a tin drinkingcup and added water and a few spoonfuls of brandy and with a spoon he had brought down with him poured some of it between the old mans lips  i dont know whether its right he thought to himself but its the best thing i can do for him it is evident he must be kept up when abe comes down i will ask his advice after knocking about as many years as he has been he ought to know what is the best thing to be done  in half an hour he gave the patient a few spoonfuls of the broth which had been prepared and continued every halfhour to give him the lemonade and broth alternately  when abe came down with the tea frank went outside to meet him and explained some of the circumstances of the case and then took him in to see his patient  illustration the sick friend in the mining camp  i think you are doing the right thing lad abe said when they went out into the air again he is evidently pretty nigh gone under i expect he has been working beyond his strength and starving like enough at that hes regular broke up and has got the fever besides i should just keep on at that till morning and then we shall see if he gets on raving you might give him a few drops of laudanum with his brandy but i wouldnt do it otherwise i will bring down that broth first thing in the morning it will be a sight stronger than that stuff you are giving him now  fortified by this opinion frank lit his pipe and sat down to his long watch he was the more satisfied that he was doing right by the fact that the pulse was distinctly stronger than it had been when he first felt it occasionally the patient muttered a few words but he generally lay perfectly still with his eyes staring wide open it was this fixed stare that tempted frank at last to give him a few drops of laudanum and in an hour later he had the satisfaction of seeing him close his eyes  abe was round soon after daylight with two pannikins of tea some rashers of bacon and a jug of the essence of beef  how is your patient frank  i cant tell except by his pulse but that certainly seems to me to be stronger i gave him a few drops of laudanum a couple of hours ago and it seems to me he has been dozing since at any rate his eyes have been halfclosed i think that it is extreme weakness more than anything else he has overtaxed his strength and is wornout with fatigue and starvation i shouldnt be surprised if he gets round all right with quiet and food the opening of the tent and the sound of voices outside roused the younger digger who had slept without stirring from the moment he had lain down he joined the others outside  how i have slept he said i cant tell you how much i am obliged to you i was regularly done up and now i shall be able to take a fresh start again  my partner abe here has just brought us down some tea and breakfast and some really strong soup for your mate for frank did not know whether the young man would wish the fact of the relationship between him and his companion generally known  thank you heartily the young man said as he seated himself by the side of frank on the stump of a felled tree and took the tea and food from abes hands  i feel ready to go on again now but last night i quite broke down i have no one to speak to you see and it was awful to see him lying there and to be able to do nothing your friend here and he nodded to frank had been so kind to us a week ago that i felt sure he would not mind sitting up with him though i know he thought me a fool to go on digging at that wretched hole i think he looks and he motioned to the tenta little better this morning of course theres not much change but his face does not look quite as it did yesterday i dont know what the difference is but i am sure there is a difference  his pulse is certainly a little stronger frank said and i hope we shall pull him round though i did not think so when i saw him yesterday i have been giving him broth every hour and a few spoonfuls of lemonade with brandy in it between times and i think the brandy has done him more good than the soup if i were in your place i would go on doing just the same today this soup abe has brought down is very strong and two or three spoonfuls at a time will be all he will want there is another lemon in there and i would go on giving him brandy too i think its just strength he wants  strength and hope the young man said he has all along made up his mind that claim would pay and i think its failure did more to break him down than even the fatigue and want of food that was why i kept on working as long as he was sensible he still believed in it and would not hear of my stopping to nurse him he was very bad that night i went home with the nugget almost as bad as he was last night but when i showed it him he seemed to revive and it was only when three days passed without my being able to show another spec of gold that he fell back again  oh you did find a nugget then abe said no one thought you would strike on anything thar  i found it because your friend put it there the young man said and he saved both our lives for we were starving  abe grunted  you shouldnt have kept it so dark lad we aint bad fellows we diggers though we are a rough lot and no one need starve in a mining camp but no doubt you had your reasons he added seeing the miners face blush up but what on arth made your mate stick to that thar hole any one could have seen with half an eye that it wasnt a likely place  he has a sort of belief in dreams and he dreamt three times as he told me of a stunted tree with gold underneath it we have been to half the mining camps in the country and never had any luck but directly he came here he saw a tree standing just where our claim is and he declared it was the one he dreamt of i told him then it didnt seem a likely place to work but he would have it that it was the tree and that there was gold under it he was already weak and ill and to please him i set to work there i may tell you as i have told your friend that he is my father there is no reason that there should be any mystery about it and my only reason for wishing that it should not be generally known is that he had a sort of fancy against it  i guessed as much young man abe said when i saw you working together three weeks ago a young man dont tie himself to an old partner who aint no more good than a child at work unless theres some reason for it and theres many a father and son aye and a father and four or five sons working together in every mining camp here still if the old man has a fancy agin it we will say nought on the subject so he dreamt three times of the tree did he well then i dont blame him for sticking to the claim i dont suppose there are a dozen miners in this camp who wouldnt have done the same i believes theres something in dreams myself most of us do and he recognised the tree directly you say wall its time for my mate and i to be off to work but this evening i will walk round and have a look at your claim thar may be somewhat in it arter all  you dont really believe in dreams abe frank said as they walked off together  i think thars something in em abe said i have heard many a queer story about dreams and i reckon thar aint many men as has lived out all thar lives in the plains as doubts thars something in em the injins believe in em and though they aint got no books to larn em the injins aint fools in their own way i have known a score of cases where dreams came true  yes i dare say you have frank said but then there are tens of thousands of cases in which dreams dont come true a man dreams for instance that his wife or his mother or some one he cares for is dead when he gets home he finds her all right and never thinks any more about the dream or says anything about it if in one case out of ten thousand he finds she is dead he tells every one about his dream and it is quoted all about as an instance that dreams come true  yes perhaps theres something in that abe agreed but i think theres more than that too i know a case of a chap who was out in the plains hunting for a caravan on its way down to santa fé there werent as far as he knew any injins about and what thar was had always shown themselves friendly and peaceable he laid down by the fire and went to sleep and he dreamed that a party of injins scalped him he woke in a regular sweat from fright and he was so badly scared that he scattered the ashes of his fire and took to his horse and led him into a cedar bush close by he hadnt been thar twenty minutes when he heard tramping of horses and along came a party of injins they halted not twenty yards away from where his fire had been and camped till the morning and then rode on again he could see by thar dress and paint they were up to mischief and the very next day they fell upon a small caravan and killed every soul now that mans dream saved his life thar warnt no doubt about that if he hadnt had warning and had time to scatter his fire and move quiet into the bush and get a blanket over his horses head to prevent it snorting it would have been all up with him and i could tell you a dozen tales like that  i think that could be accounted for frank said the man perhaps was sleeping with his ear on the ground and in his sleep may have heard the tramping of the indians horses as they went over a bit of stony ground long before he could hear them when he arose to his feet and the noise set his brain at work and he dreamt the dream you have told me but i know from what i have heard that goldminers are almost to a man full of fancies and superstitions and that they will often take up claims from some idea of luck rather than from their experience and knowledge of ground  after the work was over abe and frank went down to the claim  well i am free to own abe said that i dont see no chance of gold here its clear out of the course of the stream  frank was silent for two or three minutes and then said  well abe you know i put no faith whatever in a dream but if you look at that sharp curve in the opposite bank higher up you will see that it is quite possible that in the days when this was a river instead of being a mere stream it struck that curve and came over by where we are standing now as the water decreased it would naturally find its way down the middle of the valley as it does now but i think it likely enough that in the old times it flowed under where we are standing  by gosh lad i think you are about right what do you say to our taking up the claims next to this we are not doing much more than paying our way where we are and its the horses who are really earning the money  i dont know abe we are a good deal above the present bed of the stream and should probably have to sink a considerable distance before we got down to paying ground that young fellow said they have hardly found a speck of gold it would be a risky thing to do still we can think it over theres no hurry about it  that night abe insisted on taking his turn to sit up with the old man the son who had now told them that his name was james adams urged that the previous nights long sleep had quite set him up again but abe would not listen to him  its done you good lad no doubt but ye will be all the better for another it wants more than one nights sleep when you have had four or five out of bed and a nights watch is nothing one way or other to me you just do as you are told  so james adams had another long nights sleep while abe sat by his father  there was no doubt now that the old man was recovering from the exhaustion which had brought him to deaths door the set pinched look of his features was passing away and the evening following abes watch when frank went round to the tent to inquire how he was getting on the son came out and said  he is better he went off this morning in what looked like a natural sleep and when he woke an hour ago i could see that he knew me i dont suppose he knew he had been lying insensible for a week but thought i had just come back from work he whispered how does it look today jim and after what you told me about what you thought about the old course of the river i was able to say honestly i think the chances look more favourable he whispered we shall make a fortune yet jim and then drank some soup and went off to sleep again tomorrow morning i will set to work again i dont believe a bit in the dream myself but it will make him more comfortable to know that i am at work upon it and after all it may turn out some good  my partners have more faith in it than i have frank said abe told them about the dream and about what i had noticed of the probable course of the river in the olden times and i have a proposal to make to you we will take up five claims by the side of your two two on one side and three on the other then three of us will help you sink your shaft all thats found in your claims will be yours and if it turns out rich you shall pay us just as if we had been working for you by the day when we have cleared out your claims we are to have the right of using your shaft for working right and left along the bottom over our claims i think thats a fair offer  i think its more than fair it is most kind the young man said you are risking getting nothing for your labour if it turns out poor  yes we are risking that frank agreed but we are not doing ourselves much good now the two who are working the horses earn enough to keep the five of us and if by any chance your claims should turn out well we shall be paid for our work for you and will be able to work out our own claims very cheaply if we sunk a shaft on our own account we should similarly lose our labour if it turned out poor and should not get so much if it turned out rich so i think the bargain is really a fair one and if you do not agree my mates have quite resolved to sink a shaft on their own account on the strength of your fathers dream  in that case i agree most heartily james adams said and it will gladden my fathers heart to be told that the work is now to go on really in earnest  if he is better tomorrow frank said it will be as well to get your fathers consent to the agreement and then we will begin on the following day  the next morning the old man woke up a good deal better his first question after he had taken some soup was  how is it you arent at work jim its broad daylight  i have knocked off for today father i wanted to have a chat with you a party of five miners who have been very kind to me while you have been illfor you have been ill now for more than a week though you dont know ithave made me a very good offer although i could not accept it until i consulted you you see i cannot get on much with the claim by myself the ground falls in and wants timbering and i can do nothing alone well these miners have offered to help sink our shaft on the conditions that they get no pay if it turns out poor but if it turns out well they are to be paid for their daily labour and when we have worked out our claims they are to have the right of using our shaft for working out the claims they have staked out next to ours  no shares jim the old man said you are sure they are not to have any share in our claims because i wont agree to that  no father the agreement is just as i told you if it turns out well they get their wages and the right to use our shaft to get at their claims  very well i will agree to that we shall get down all the sooner to our gold but mind have it put down on paper else they will be setting up a claim to a share in our treasure  i will get it done regularly father jim said they mean very fairly as i told you they have shown me the greatest kindnessindeed you owe your life to them for if it had not been for them i had as you know no means whatever of holding on whilst you have been ill two of them have been sitting up with you at night they have showed themselves true friends  well i am glad you have found some friends jim the old man said feebly but you must be careful you know very careful and be sure the agreement is signed and witnessed properly     illustration  chapter xviii  a dream verified   on the following morning to the astonishment of the miners of cedar camp frank and his companions took their tools out of their claims and shifted to the claims of the two men of the solitary tent every one asked himself what could be the meaning of this move and the general supposition was that they must have discovered that the two men had struck upon rich ground scores of miners sauntered across during the day looked on and asked a question or two but the answers they obtained threw no light upon the mystery the ground looked most unpromising it was a flat some ten feet above the level of the riverbed and the spot where they were digging was twenty yards from the edge  fifteen yards further back the ground rose abruptly to a height of thirty or forty feet the ground around was covered with bushes through which a few goodsized trees rose the two men had dug through two feet of alluvial soil and about five feet of sand altogether it was a place which seemed to afford no promise whatever and although at the first impulse some miners who were doing badly had marked out claims next to those staked out by frank and his party no steps were taken to occupy them  the first day was spent in getting out planks and lining the proposed shaft which was made much smaller than the hole already dug which extended over the whole of the two claims the next day a windlass was put in position and the work began in earnest at the depth of twenty feet they came upon gravel a result which greatly raised their spirits as its character was precisely similar to that in the bed of the stream and showed that franks conjecture was a correct one and that the river had at one time flowed along the foot of the high ground beyond  when it was known in camp that the party were getting up gravel there was a great deal of talk some of the older hands came and examined the place and noticing the sharp curve in the opposite bank above concluded as frank had done that instead of being as was generally supposed beyond the edge of the old riverbed it was by no means improbable that the party were working over what was at one time a point which was swept by the main body of water coming down  more claims were staked out and although no one had any intention of beginning in earnest until they discovered what luck attended the party who were sinking the shaft just enough was done each day to retain possession of the claims before they had gone far into the gravel they discovered specks of gold and washing a basinful from time to time found that it was fairly rich certainly as good as any that had been found a few feet below the surface of the ground at any other spot in the camp they determined however not to wash at present but to pile the stuff near the mouth of the shaft to be washed subsequently and to continue to sink steadily  a fortnight after the work had begun the old man had gained sufficient strength to make his way across to the shaft and after that he spent his whole time watching the progress of the work his tent was brought over and pitched close at hand by this time as their prospects really looked good jim had told him the true history of the nugget he had brought home and how much they owed to frank and he so far overcame his shrinking from intercourse with his neighbours as to become really cordial with frank who when supper was over often strolled across and smoked a pipe with jim in the tent  frank often wondered what could have brought a man of some sixty years of age and evidently well educated and a gentleman but as was equally clear wholly unfitted by age habits and constitution for rough labour in such a country as that the son had not denied that he was english but as he had not admitted it in so many words frank thought that his father might object to any questions on the subject and in their many conversations the past was seldom alluded to  turk who was franks constant companion took remarkably to the old man and in the daytime when the latter was sitting watching the baskets coming up from below generally took up his position by him sometimes lying blinking lazily in the sun at other times sitting up and watching the operations gravely as if he were thoroughly aware of their importance  while the ground was still unpromising frank and his party had bought up for a few dollars the claims of several of the men who had staked out ground next to their own and now held six on either side of the claim they were sinking on beyond these as soon as the gravel was known to contain gold other miners began to workfor the most part in parties as the depth at which paying ground lay beneath the surface was so great that it could only be reached by joint labourand the flat so long neglected now became one of the busiest points in the camp  the gravel is getting richer and richer every day frank said to the elder adams five weeks after they began work i think now it would be as well to hire half a dozen men to carry it down to the stream and wash it there you could superintend them and one of us will work at the cradle the stuff will pay splendidly now i am sure and theres a big heap on the bank  if you think so by all means let us do so the old man said i should like to begin to get some gold we are in your debt more than a hundred dollars already since you have been advancing money for our living as the work has gone on  there is no hurry on that account frank said ever since we washed the first pail of gravel it has been evident that there was at least sufficient gold to pay for washing out and that my advances were perfectly safe so there is no hurry on that account but at present it has so improved that it would be rich enough to pay really well besides we shall be getting it stolen i fancy last night two or three bucketsfull were taken away at that edge of the bank and as there has been a perfect rush for staking out claims today i have no doubt that it was found to pan out very rich  the result of the first days washing more than realised their anticipations for when the cradle was cleared up over fifty ounces of gold were found at the bottom and at the end of three days the old man paid frank and his party their wages at four dollars a day each from the time they had commenced working at the shaft  another fortnight and they reached the bed rock each day the find had become heavier but the climax was reached when they touched the rock it was found that just where they reached the bottom the rock which formed the bank bordering the flat came down almost perpendicularly to the level rock which had formed the old bed of the stream this was worn perfectly smooth by the action of the water and in the bed rock was a great caldron scooped out by an eddy of the stream this was filled up with gravel among which nuggets of gold were lying thickly and when its contents were taken to the surface and separated the gold was found to weigh over three thousand ounces the lower part of the ground was then dug out to the full size of the claim and when all this was washed it was found that the total amount of gold obtained from the claim was over six thousand ounces  as the work went on from day to day frank observed a gradual change coming over the elder of the two men at first he had been excited and at times irritable but as each day showed increased returns and it became a moral certainty that the claim was going to turn out extremely rich the excitement seemed to pass away he talked less and spent less of his time in watching the work going on sometimes not even coming down to watch the clearup at the end of the days work even the discovery of the rich pocket in the rock scarcely seemed to stir him his son upon the contrary made no secret of his satisfaction at the fortune which was falling to them he shook off the reserve which had at first distinguished him a weight of care seemed to fall from his shoulders and his spirits became at times almost exuberant  at first he had looked to frank almost a middleaged man although his face and figure showed that he could not be many years his own senior now he looked almost like a schoolboy so full was he of life and spirits the old man had taken much to frank and although during the latter part of the time he had talked but little he liked him to come into the tent every evening to smoke a pipe and chat with his son he had several times endeavoured to draw from frank his reason for leaving england and coming out to california at an age when many lads are still at school but he had obtained no reply to his hints for frank did not care to enter upon the story of that incident at westminster  the evening when the claims had been worked out and the last cradle washed out the old man asked frank to bring abe and his companions to the tent after they had had their supper the tent showed little signs of the altered circumstances of its owners a few more articles of cheap crockery and a couple of folding chairs were the only additions that had been made some boxes had been brought in now to serve as seats and on one in the centre were placed half a dozen bottles of champagne which the young man proceeded to open  my friends the elder said i am going away tomorrow and i trust that your claims will turn out every bit as rich as ours has done  even if they dont turn out as rich frank said there is no fear of their not turning out well we consider we have made a capital bargain with you we have been paid by you for our work in sinking the shaft and now it will be easy for us to work our claims it was a lucky day for us when we made that contract to sink your shaft  i am glad you think so and very glad that you are likely to share my luck still i feel greatly indebted to you it was a bargain of course but it was a bargain in which you were taking all the risk there is as you say every probability of your claims turning out well but theres no certainty in goldmining and at any rate we cannot go away with a fortune without feeling that to some small extent at least you will participate in it therefore i here hand you over each a bag with a hundred ounces of gold so that come what may your time and labour here will not have been thrown away you will not i hope pain me by refusing he said seeing that the men looked doubtfully at each other we owe it all to you for when you threw in your lot with us we were desperate and starving  wall if you put it in that way i dont see that we can say no mate abe said though we are well content with our lookout i can tell you and could get a biggish sum for our claims tonight if we were disposed to sell them still what you says is true though it isnt every one who makes a good thing out of a bargain as is ready to go beyond it it was a fortunate day for you may be that you fell in with my mate here and it was a fortunate day for us when he fell in with you when i goes back east and settles down on a farm i has got my eyes on i shall always say as i owed my luck to my mate strolling over to talk to the two men as was working what seemed a hopeless claim in cedar camp  wall i suppose you are going back with your pile to the old country i can only say as we wish you good luck thar and plenty of enjoyment out of your money heres luck  the miners all emptied their glasses and then shaking hands with father and son filed out of the tent frank was about to follow them when he was stopped by a gesture from the old man he had not liked accepting the present but he did not wish to act differently from his comrades and he saw that his refusal would really hurt the donor  sit down a bit lad he said james is going to the camp to get a few things for our journey tomorrow and i shall be alone and now that its all over i feel the reaction it has been an exciting time the last month  it has indeed frank agreed and i have often thought to myself what a comfort it was that they had established a regular way of sending down gold twice a week with an escort it would have been terrible if you had had to keep all that gold by you  yes i often thought so myself and your offer to keep the gold in your tent on the days when the escort wasnt going was a great relief to me  it was safe enough with us frank said no one would venture to try a tent with a pretty strong party but with only your son and yourself there might have been a temptation to some brokendown gambler to carry it off besides we have turk as a guard and i dont fancy any one would venture to try any tricks with our tent while he is inside it  well i hope it will be your turn now the old man said and that before another two months are over you too will be setting out on your way home with what your friend called your pile  i shall not be doing that frank said whatever we find i have no thought of going back to england  no well lad i dont want your confidence if you would rather not give it but i will tell you my story and perhaps when you have heard it you may be the more inclined to tell me yours it is a painful story to tell but that is part of my punishment and you lad have a right to hear it for i know that it is to you i owe my life and that it is through you that i am tomorrow going home to do all that i can to retrieve my fault and to wipe out the stain on my name i was a solicitor with a good practice in a town of the west of englandit does not matter what its name was i lost my wife and then like a fool i took to drink no one knew it except my son for i never went out in the evening but would sit at home drinking by myself till i could scarce stagger up to bed  he did all that he could to persuade me to give it up but it had got too strong a hold upon me at last we quarrelled over it and he left the house and henceforth we only met at the office he was engaged to be married to the daughter of our vicar when the crash camefor in these cases a crash is sure to come sooner or laterthe business had fallen off and a bill was presented for payment which i had altogether forgotten i had signed then there was an investigation into my affairs i could help but little for there were but few hours in the day now when my brain was clear enough to attend to any business whatever then it was found that ten thousand pounds which had been given me to invest by one of my clients had never been invested and that it was gone with the rest  i had not intended to do anything dishonest that even now i can affirm i had intended to invest it but in my muddled state put off doing so and had gone on paying the interest as if it had been invested as ordered when i knew that i had not enough in the bank to replace it i went into foolish speculations to regain what i had lost but until the crash came i had never fairly realised that i had not only ruined myself but was a swindler i shall never forget the morning when james who had been up all night going through my papers with my headclerk came down and told me what he had discovered i was still stupid from what i had drunk overnight but that sobered me i need not tell you what passed between my son and me i swore never to touch liquor again he sold out of consols five thousand pounds which he had inherited from his mother and handed it over to the man i had defrauded giving him his personal bond that he would repay the rest of the money should he live and on those terms my client agreed to abstain from prosecuting me and to maintain an absolute silence as to the affair  then jim broke off his engagement and took passages for us in a sailing ship for panama and so on to san francisco i need not tell you the struggle it was to keep to my promise but when jim had given up everything for me the least i could do was to fight hard for his sake my thoughts were always fixed on california my only hopes that i might live to see the rest of the debt repaid and the boys money replaced so that he could buy a business and marry the woman he loved i dreamt of it over and over again and as i told you three times i dreamt of the exact spot where we are now sitting  somehow in my dreams i knew that if i dug straight down under the old tree that formed the centre of the dream i should find gold this became a fixed idea with me and when we reached the goldfields i never stopped long in camp so bent was i upon finding the tree of my dreams jim bore with me wonderfully i knew he did not believe in my dream but he was always ready to go where i wanted i think now he thought that i was going out of my mind or feared that if he thwarted me i might take to drink again however at last we found the treeat least i was positive it was the tree of my dreams james tried to dissuade me from digging in a place which looked so unpromising but nothing would deter me save death and you see the result we shall go back the debt will be cleared off jim will marry his sweetheart and i shall live with him to the end of my days he is a grand fellow is jim though i dare say it didnt strike you so when you first knew him  he is a grand fellow frank agreed heartily and i am truly glad mr adams that all has turned out so well  and now can you tell me something of yourself frank it is to you we owe it that things have turned out well and if as i rather guess you have got into some scrape at home i can only say that my son and myself will be very glad to share our fortune with you and to take onethird of it each  i thank you greatly sir for your generous offer but it would be of no use to me i have as you suspect got into a scrape at home but it is from no fault of my own i have been wrongfully suspected of committing a crime and until that charge is in some way or other cleared up and the slur on my name wiped off i would not return to england if i had a hundred thousand pounds  and can nothing be done would it be any use whatever to set to work on any line you can suggest i would make it my own business and follow up any clue you could give me  thank you very much mr adams thank you with all my heart but nothing can be done there is nothing to follow it was not a question of a crime so committed that many outside persons would be interested in it or that it could be explained in a variety of ways so far as the case went it was absolutely conclusive so conclusive that i myself knowing that i was innocent could see no flaw in the evidence against myself nor for months afterwards could i perceive any possible explanation save in my own guilt since then i have seen that there is an alternative it is one so painful to contemplate that i do not allow myself to think of it nor does it seem to me that even were i myself upon the spot with all the detective force of england to aid me i could succeed in proving that alternative to be the true one except by the confession of the person in question  if he were capable of planning and carrying out the scheme which brought about my disgrace he certainly is not one who would under any conceivable circumstances confess what he has done therefore there is nothing whatever to be done in the matter years and years hence if i make a fortune out here i may go home and say to those whose esteem and affection i have lost i have no more evidence now than i had when i left england to support my simple declaration that i was innocent but at least i have nothing to gain by lying now i have made a fortune and would not touch one penny of the inheritance which would once have been mine i simply come before you again solemnly to declare that i was innocent wholly and conclusively as appearances were against me it may be that the word of a prosperous man will be believed though that of a disgraced schoolboy was more than doubted  and is there no one to whom i could carry the assurance of your innocence mr adams asked some one may still be believing in you in spite of appearances it might gladden some ones heart were i to bear them from your lips this fresh assurance were i to tell them how you have saved me when all hope seemed lost were i to tell them how all here speak well of you and how absolutely i am convinced that some hideous mistake must have been made  frank sat for some time silent  yes he said at last i have a little cousin a girl she was like my sister i hopei think that in spite of everything she may still have believed me innocent will you see her and tell her you have seen me say no more until you see by her manner whether she believes me to be a rascal or not if she does give her no clue to the part of the world where you have come across me simply say that i wished her to know that i was alive and well if you see that she still in spite of everything believes that i am innocent then tell her that i affirm on my honour and word that i am innocent though i see no way whatever of ever proving it that i do not wish her to tell my uncle she heard from me that i do not wish her to say one word to him for that much as i value his affection i would not for the world seem to be trying to regain the place he thinks i have forfeited until i can appear before him as a rich man whom nothing could induce to touch one penny of his money and who values only his goodwill and esteem that is her name and address  and frank wrote on the leaf of his pocketbook alice hardy 354 eaton square  i do not think you will have to deliver the message it is hardly possible that she should not as my uncle has done believe me to be guilty still i do cling to the possibility of it that is why i hesitate in giving you the commission for if it fails i shall lose my last pleasant thought of home if you find she has believed in me write to me at sacramento to the care of woolfe  company of whom i always get my stores there is no saying where i may be in four or five months time for it will take that before i can hear from you it may be in that case she too will write if she does not believe in me do not write at all i shall understand your silence and above all unless you find she believes in me say no more than that i am alive and well and give no clue whatever to the part of the world where we have met  i will discharge your commission mr adams said but do not be impatient for an answer i may not find a steamer going down to panama for some time and may have to go thence to new york and thence take a steamer to europe i may find on my arrival that the young lady is absent from home perhaps travelling with her father and there may be delays  my uncle is not her father frank said she is a ward of his but i will not be impatient not for six months will i give up such hope as i have  there is one more thing before i say good night mr adams said i have been in great need and know how hard it is to struggle when luck is against one and i should like to give a small sum as a sort of thankoffering for the success which has attended me in a mining camp there must be many whom a little might enable to tide on until luck turns will you be my almoner here is a bag with a hundred ounces of gold the last we got today from our claim will you take it and from time to time give help in the way of half a sack of flour and other provisions to men who may be down in the world from a run of illluck and not from any fault of their own  i will gladly do so frank replied such a fund as this would enable me to gladden the hearts of scores of men you can rely upon it sir that i will take care to see that it is laid out in accordance with your instructions  after leaving the tent frank found james adams sitting down on a log a short distance away  i would not disturb you the latter said as i thought perhaps you were having a chat with my fatherindeed he told me he should like to have a talk with you alone but i want myself to tell you how conscious i am that i owe my happiness to you has my father told you how i am situated and that i am going home to claim the dearest girl in the world if as i hope and believe i shall find she has waited for me  your father has told me more frank said he has told me how nobly you devoted your life to his and why and i am truly glad that so much good has come of our meeting more than that first little help i must disclaim for it was abe and not i who believed in your fathers dreams which i confess i had no shadow of belief in though they have so unaccountably to me been verified  nothing you can say frank will minimise what you have done for us you saved my fathers life if it had not been for you his dream would never have been carried into effect and he would now be lying in the graveyard on the top of the hill and i should be working hopelessly as a day labourer i only want to say that if at any time you want a friend you can rely upon james adams up to the last penny he has in the world  the next morning mr adams and his son started for san francisco and frank and his party began to work their claims from the bottom of the shaft although they paid well they proved far less rich than they had expected they got good returns from the gravel but found no pockets in the bed rock which was perfectly smooth and even they found that on either side of the adams claims the wall of rock behind swept round this no doubt had caused an eddy at this spot which had worked out the hole in the bed rock and caused the deposit of so large a quantity of gold here and singularly enough mr adams dream had led him to take up the exact spot under which alone the gold had been so largely deposited the party had taken on several hands and six weeks sufficed to clear out the paying stuff in their claims and it was found that after paying all their expenses there remained eight hundred ounces of gold a handsome result but still very far below what they had reason to expect from the richness of the stuff in the claims lying in the centre of their ground  this however added to the five hundred ounces they had received from mr adams gave them a total of about a thousand pounds each they held a consultation on the night of the final cleanup two of the party were disposed to return east with their money but they finally came round to abes view  a thousand pounds is a nice sumi dont say it aintfor less than six months work still to my mind now we are here with the chance of doing just as well if we go on i think it would be a fools trick to give it up five thousand dollars will buy a good farm east but one could work it with a good deal more comfort and sartainty if one had another five thousand lying in the bank ready to draw upon in case of bad times we aint fools we dont mean to gamble or drink away what we have made it will just lie in the bank at sacramento until we want to draw it if we work another year we may double it but we cant make it less we have got our horses still and i vote we go back to our work as it was before three of us digging and two carrying we know that way we can pay our expenses however bad our luck may be so thar aint nothing to loose in sticking to it for a bit longer and thar may be a lot to gain  this view prevailed and in a short time the party moved off to another place for cedar camp was getting deserted the other claims taken up on the flat had paid their way but little more and the men were off to new discoveries of which they had heard glowing accounts  for the next two months no marked success attended the labours of frank and his comrades they paid their expenses and that was all frank enjoyed the life he was in no hurry to get rich and it gave him great pleasure to be able occasionally to give a helping hand to miners whose luck was bad from the fund with which mr adams had intrusted him the work was hard but he scarcely felt it for his muscles were now like steel and his frame had widened out until he was as broad and strong as any of his companions and few would have recognised in him the lad who had shipped on board the mississippi fifteen months before     illustration  chapter xix  striking it rich   twice the party of golddiggers shifted their location each time following a rush to some freshlydiscovered locality but no stroke of good fortune attended them at the end of each week a few ounces of gold remained to be added to the pile after the payment of expenses but so far the earnings of the carriers far exceeded those of the diggers one day as abe and frank were just starting on their way down to sacramento they met three men coming along each leading two laden horses as the two teams met there was a shout of recognition  hello abe i have been asking for you of every one since we got here six months ago but no one seemed to know your party  we have been asking for you too abe said it seems curious that we should be here so long and never run agin each other but there are such a lot of mining camps and every one works too hard to spend much time thinking about his neighbours i expected we should run across each other one of these days and how goes it with you hows every one  we are broke up a bit john little said it wasnt to be expected as we should hang together long after we once got out here one thought one place best and another another but i and my two mates here and long simpson and alick and jones we have stuck together  and where are you now abe inquired  well i will tell you abe and i wouldnt tell any one else but i said to you if we ever makes a strike you are in it we have been prospecting up in the gulches of the north yuba we found as we couldnt get places worth working in the other camps so we concluded it war best to find out a spot for ourselves so we six have been agrubbing and digging up among the mountains and i tell you we have hit it hot we three washing with pans for four hours one morning got out eightandtwenty ounces of gold  that was something like abe said in admiration  i reckon it war well we covered the place up and left our three mates to look arter it telling them not to dig or make any sign until we came back we sold the waggons and teams when we first got over for they were no good to us in the mountains and bought horses so as to keep ourselves supplied with provisions we agreed before we began work we would come down to the town and get enough to last us then we would move up quietly at night to our find stake out our claims and begin to work now if you and your four mates likes to join us you are welcome  well thats a downright friendly offer mate and you bet we accept it we had one capital stroke of luck but since that worked out we havent done much at digging though frank here and me has done very fair trucking goods up from sacramento where are your women  well the other said we had some trouble about them you see thar aint many women up at the camps they are rough places and not fit for them so we agreed that for the present it were best they should keep out of it so we bought a little place with ten or twelve acres of ground down at the foot of the hills and there our wives and the kids are stopping theres a big orchard and they are raising vegetables and when we goes down for supplies we brings up a load or two of fruit and vegetables and rare prices they fetch i can tell you more nor enough to keep them all down there but we have agreed to bring two of them up now to cook and wash and leave the others to look arter the place and the kids simpson and jones aint married you know women have a right to claims as well as men and of course we shall take up for those we bring up as well as for two big lads so that will give us ten claims besides the extra claims for discovery so with your five claims we can get hold of a tidy bit of ground we are going to take these stores up now and leave them in charge of our friends in the gulch who will keep them hid in the woods and then we can go back and bring up the women and a cargo of vegetables  well in four days we will meet you here i will take all the horses and load them up we were going to bring up flour for the storekeeper but now we will get stores for ourselves we will bring as much as we can get along with we can sell what we dont want for there is sure to be a rush in a short time frank shall go back and tell the storekeeper we aint acoming with the flour  this was arranged and four days later abe and his party arrived at the spot agreed on and an hour or two later the cavalcade with the three men two women and two boys of fifteen or sixteen years old came up and the united party started together it was some fifty miles to the spot where the gold had been discovered sometimes they wound along in deep valleys passing several camps in full operation at the last camp which was a small one a few questions were asked them as to their destination  we are just going aprospecting for the mountain of gold abe replied and as we have got six months stores aboard we mean to find it we will send you down a few nuggets when we get up there  we shall have some of them after us in a day or two john little said every one suspects every one else and they will make a pretty story of it i guess thinking as we shouldnt have brought the women up all this distance without having some place in our minds  at last they arrived at their destination the mouth of a little gorge running off the deep valley of the north yuba the gorge widened out into a narrow valley and the party made its way among the pebbles and boulders at its bottom for a quarter of a mile and then three men came out from among the trees and greeted them heartily  no one has been up here john little asked  two chaps came up and prospected about a bit but they did not seem to hit on the right place at any rate they went away again  all the better john said now let us stake out our claims at once then we are all right whoever comes  the spot selected was at the head of the little valley it ended here abruptly and the stream came down forty feet precipitously into a hollow  illustration goldwashinga good days work  this looks a likely spot indeed abe said there must have been a thundering great waterfall here in the old days i expect it wore a hole for itself in the rock and if it is as rich as you say on the surface there is no saying how rich it may be when we get down to the bed rock  they had already settled that the two parties should work in partnership and as including the women and boys they numbered fifteen and could take up the five claims which by mining law the discoverer of a new place was entitled to they had in all twenty claims which gave them the whole of the little amphitheatre at the foot of the fall for a distance of fifty yards down  the men all set to work with their axes and by nightfall much had been done franks party had their tent and the two small tents of the other party were allotted to the married couples a rough hut was got up for the rest of the men this was to act as the kitchen and general room a storehouse was erected of stout logs with earth piled thickly over it to keep out the wet and here their stores were securely housed the tents and huts were on the slope where the rocks widened out twenty yards below the bottom of their claim  it was late in the second evening before the work was done all were anxious to test the ground but it was agreed not to touch it until they had housed themselves at daybreak they were at work and soon all were washing out pans of gravel at the stream the results fully justified their expectationsthere being a residuum of glittering grains at the bottom of each pan varying in weight from a pennyweight to a quarter of an ounce  now abe said i should suggest that we makes a big cradle fifteen feet long by three feet wide and hang it on cross poles so as to be able to rock it easily then we will dam up the stream at the top of the fall and lead it down straight through a shoot into the cradle of course the shoot will have a sluice so as to let in just as much water as we want and that way two men will do the work of eight or ten washing  abes plan was agreed to and all the men set to work to construct the dam cradle and shoot  it took two days hard labour before all was in readiness and then the work began in earnest two men swayed the cradle four others shovelled the gravel and dirt into it three continually stirred the contents and swept off the large stones and pebbles from the top while the other two carried them away beyond the boundaries of their claims  at the lower end of the cradle was a sheet of iron perforated with holes large at the top but getting smaller lower down and altogether closed four inches from the bottom through these holes the sand and gravel flowed away all day they worked vigorously and without intermission and great was the excitement when at the end of the days work they proceeded to clearup by emptying the cradle and examining the bottom a shout of satisfaction arose as the particles of gold were seen lying thickly in the gravel at the bottom of the cradle very carefully this was washed out and it was found that there were over fifty ounces of gold dust  i believe abe said that we have hit upon the richest spot in californy ef its like this on the surface what is it going to be like when we get down to the bed rock  the next morning two diggers arrived on the scene they saw at once by the methodical manner in which the place was being worked that the party must have found gold in paying quantities  is it rich mates they asked eagerly  ay abe replied rich enough for anything there are the boundaries of our claims lads and ye are welcome to set to work below them  the miners threw off their coats and at once set to work and a shout of exultation greeted the result of the first bucket of stuff they washed out  another week abe said and every foot of ground in the gulch from here down to the yuba will be taken up the news will spread like wildfire  his anticipations were justified and no one who came along a fortnight later would have recognised in the scene of life and activity the quiet wooded valley which abe and his party had entered the trees on the lower slopes were all felled huts and tents stood along on the slopes from the head to the mouth of the valley and several hundred men were hard at work  for once every man was satisfied and it was agreed that it was the richest place which had been discovered in california but though all were doing well their finds did not approach those of the party at the head of the valley the spot on which these were at work was indeed a natural trap for gold at the lower end of the claim the bed rock was found at the depth of three feet only but it sloped rapidly down to the foot of the fall and here an iron rod had been driven down and showed it to be forty feet below the surface  the bed rock had indeed in the course of ages been pounded away by the fall of water and by the boulders and rocks brought down in time of flood and in the deep hole the gold had lodged a comparatively small proportion being carried away over the lower lip of the basin when the bed rock was found at the lower end of the claim they set to work to clear away and wash the whole surface to that depth as far as the foot of the rocks on either side of the little amphitheatre  frank and two of the men went down to sacramento with horses to bring up pumps for below the level of the lip of the hole it was of course full of water the stream was carried in a shoot beyond this point and when the pumps arrived they were soon set to work  every foot that they descended they found as they expected the gravel to be richer and richer and many nuggets some of them weighing upwards of a pound were found  at the end of each week four of the miners armed to the teeth carried down the gold and deposited it at the bank of sacramento an escort was needed for many attacks were made on gold convoys by parties of desperadoes four men would indeed have been an insufficient guard but at the same time other diggers in the valley sent down their find and the escort was always made up to eight men from the general body  frank from the first generally formed one of the escort he himself was perfectly ready to take his share in the more laborious work of digging but where frank went turk went and turk formed so valuable a member of the escort that the rest of the party begged his master always to go with the treasure every week had added to the weight and power of the animal and he was now a most formidablelooking beast he was extremely quiet and goodtempered at ordinary times except that he would not allow any stranger to touch him but when at all excited his hair bristled from his neck to his tail and his low formidable growl gave a warning which few men would have been inclined to despiseindeed of the many rough characters in the camp there was not one who would not rather have faced a man with a revolver in his hand than have ventured upon a conflict with turk  the dog appeared to know that the escort duty was one which demanded especial vigilance on the road a low growl always gave notice of the approach of strangers and at night when they stopped and the heavy valises were carried from the pack animals into the wayside restingplaces turk always lay down with his head upon them he seemed so thoroughly to understand that this was in his special charge that although at no other time would he leave franks side for a moment he was when thus on guard content to lie quiet even should frank take a stroll after reaching the hotel  this guardianship greatly relieved the cares of the escort as once placed under turks charge they felt no further anxiety about the treasure for it would have been as much as any strangers life was worth to have entered the room where turk lay on guard once indeed the attempt was made while the escort were taking their meals a man went round to the window of the room and opening it threw a large piece of poisoned meat to turk the dog placed one paw upon it but remained with his great head on the treasure watching the man outside holding another piece in his hand and speaking in soothing tones the man seeing that he did not move began to climb in through the window suddenly as if shot from a spring turk hurled himself from his recumbent position upon him  the movement was so rapid and unexpected that before the man could spring back from the window turk had seized him by the shoulder a shriek followed by a heavy fall brought the party rushing into the room it was empty but there was the sound of a scuffle outside they ran to the window but their interference was too late turk had shifted his hold and grasping the man by the throat was shaking him as a terrier would a rat and when in obedience to franks voice he loosened his hold life was extinct not only was there a terrible wound in the throat of the robber but his neck was broken by the shaking  this was the only attempt which was ever made upon the treasure for turk gained such a reputation by the deed that it was questionable whether had he accompanied the packmules as their sole escort to sacramento the bravest stagerobbers in the district would have ventured to interfere with them  after a time the lower valley became worked out and numbers drifted away to other diggings but it was four months before the party at the waterfall completely worked out their claims the value of the ground in the last few feet at the lower end of the hole was immense for in this for ages the gold from above had settled and for the last fortnight the clearup each day was worth a thousand pounds when the last spadeful had been cleared up and the last consignment sent down to the bank they made up their total and found that in four months they had taken from the hole upwards of sixty thousand pounds  it had been agreed before beginning that the two women and the boys were each to have a halfshare and that the two women who had looked after the families below were to have the same there were then in all six halfshares and eleven shares and each share was therefore worth over four thousand pounds there were many instances in california in which parties of two or three men had made larger sums than this in the same time but there were few in which a company had taken out so large a quantity from one hole  at the meeting that night the partnership was dissolved it being agreed that they should all go down to sacramento together and there each receive his share one or two of the party said that they would go down to san francisco for a spree and then return and try their luck again four of the western farmers said that they should buy farms in the state and settle down there abe and two other hunters said they should return east  and what are you going to do frank  i dont know frank said i dont want to return to europe and have no particular object in view i think that i shall let my money remain in the bank for a bit at any rate and go in for freighting on a large scale i shall buy a couple of dozen mules and hire some mexicans to drive them i like the life among these mountains and there is a good thing to be made out of carrying but i have had enough of digging its tremendously hard work and i couldnt expect to meet with such a slice of luck as this again if i worked for fifty years  well frank i shall not try to dissuade you abe said if i was going on hunting i should say come along with me to the plains but me and my mate is going east as each of us has got some one waiting for us thar and i expect we shall marry and settle down i will write to you at sacramento when i get fixed and i neednt tell you how glad the sight of your face will make me if you are ever travelling my way  a few days afterwards the party separated at sacramento frank only remaining two days in that town the wild scenes of dissipation and recklessness disgusted him he looked with loathing upon the saloons where gambling went on from morning till night broken only by an occasional fierce quarrel followed in most cases by the sharp crack of a revolver or by desperate encounters with bowie knives bad as things were however they were improving somewhat for a vigilance committee had just been started comprising all the prominent citizens of the town parties of armed men had seized upon some of the most notorious desperadoes of the place and had hung them on the lampposts while others had been warned that a like fate awaited them if they were found three hours later within the limits of the town  similar scenes took place in san francisco for the force of the law was wholly insufficient to restrain the reckless and desperate men who congregated in the towns and who thought no more of taking life than eating a meal to put a stop to the frightful state of things prevailing the more peaceful of the san francisco citizens had also been obliged to organise a vigilance committee to carry out what was called lynch law a rough and ready method of justice subject to grave abuses under other circumstances but admirably suited to such a condition of things as at that time prevailed in california  for some time frank worked between sacramento and the diggings he enjoyed the life riding in the pure mountain air under the shade of the forests at the head of the team sometimes he wondered vaguely how long this was to last if he was always to remain a rover or whether he would ever return to england sometimes he resolved that he would go home and make an effort to clear himself of this stain which rested upon his name but he could see no method whatever of doing so as he had nothing but his own unsupported assertion of his innocence to adduce against the circumstantial evidence against him and there was no reason why his word should be taken now more than it was before  in many of the camps life had now become more civilised in cases where the bed of goldbearing gravel was large and where consequently work would be continued for a long time wooden towns had sprung up with hotels stores drinking and gambling saloons work was here carried on methodically water was in some cases brought many miles in little canals from mountain lakes down to the diggings and operations were carried on on a large scale companies were being formed for buying up and working numbers of claims together  the valleys were honeycombed with shafts driven down sometimes through a hundred feet of gravel to the bed rock as it was found much more profitable working this way than in surfacewashing stagecoaches and teams of waggons were running regularly now along wellmade roads franks earnings were therefore smaller than they had been at first but they still paid his expenses and added a few pounds each trip to his account at the bank  he took shares in many of the companies formed for bringing down water from the lakes and these were soon found to be an exceedingly valuable property paying in many cases a return each month equal to the capital  the life of a teamster was not without danger bears in considerable numbers were found among the mountains and these when pressed by hunger did not hesitate to attack passing teams in times of rain the rivers rose rapidly and the valleys were full of fierce torrents sometimes preventing horses from crossing for many hours and being still more dangerous if the rise commenced when the track to be followed wound along in the foot of the valley several times frank narrowly escaped with his life when thus surprised but in each case he managed to reach some spot where his horses could climb the sides before the water took them off their feet  the greatest danger however of the roads arose from the lawless men that frequented them coaches were frequently stopped and plundered and even the gold escorts were attacked with success strong parties of the miners sometimes went out in pursuit of the highwaymen but it was very seldom that success attended them for the great forests extended so vast a distance over the hills that anything like a thorough search was impossible  frank however treated this danger lightly he never carried money with him save what he received on arrival at camp for the carriage of his goods while the flour bacon and other stores which he carried up offered no temptation to the robbers  illustration the attack on the gold escort  one evening however having been detained some hours before he could cross a river swollen by a thunderstorm he was travelling along the road much later than usual the moon was shining brightly and as the long team of mules descended a hill he meditated camping for the night at its foot  suddenly he heard a pistolshot ahead followed by five or six others ordering his men to follow slowly he put spurs to his horse and drawing his revolver galloped on the firing had ceased just as he caught sight of a coach standing at the bottom of a hill three bodies were lying in the road and the passengers were in the act of alighting under the pistols of four mounted men who stood beside them frank rode up at full speed turk bounding beside him  the highwaymen turned and two pistolshots were fired at the newcomer the balls whistled close to him but frank did not answer the fire until he arrived within three paces of the nearest highwayman whom he shot dead the other three fired and frank felt a sensation as of a hot iron crossing his cheek while his left arm dropped useless by his side another of the highwaymen fell under his next shot at the same instant turk with a tremendous bound leapt at the throat of one of the others who was in the act of levelling his pistol the impetus was so tremendous that man and horse rolled in the road the pistol exploding harmlessly in the air the struggle on the ground lasted but a few seconds and then turk having disposed of his adversary turned to look after a fresh foe but the field was clear for the remaining robber had on seeing turk turned his horse with a cry of alarm and ridden away at full speed the passengers crowded round frank thanking him for their rescue  i am glad to have been of use frank said and to have arrived just in time and now will one of you help me off my horse for my left arm is broken i think  the driver of the coach had been shot through the heart by the first shot fired by the robbers there were two armed guards one of whom had been killed and the other wounded while two of the passengers who had left the coach to take part in the defence had also been killed the wounded guard was helped down from the coach  you have done a good nights work he said to frank there are nigh ten thousand ounces of gold in the coach no doubt those fellows got wind of the intention of the bank people at yuba to send it down to sacramento it was kept very dark too and i dont believe that one of the passengers knew of it they would have sent more than two of us to guard it if they had thought that it had been let out there must have been some one in the secret who gave notice beforehand to these chaps  now gentlemen if one of you will take the ribbons we will be moving on i will get up beside him and i will trouble any of you who have got colts to take your places up behind there aint no chance of another attack tonight still we may as well look out now sir if you will take your place inside we will take you on until we get to some place where your arm can be looked to you will hear from the directors of the bank as to this nights work  franks team had now arrived on the spot and he directed the men to complete their journey and deliver their stores and then to go down to the stables where they put up at sacramento and there to wait his arrival  frank was left behind at the next town his fellowpassengers overwhelming him with thanks many having considerable amounts of gold concealed about them the result in some cases of months work at the diggings  one of them proposed that each man should contribute onefourth of the gold he carried to reward their rescuer a proposition which was at once accepted frank however assured them that although leading a team of mules he was well off and in no need whatever of their kind offer  seeing that he was in earnest his fellowpassengers again thanked him cordially and took their places in the coach they were not to be balked in their gratitude and three days later a very handsome horse with saddle and holsters with a brace of colts revolvers arrived up from sacramento for frank with the best wishes of the passengers in the coach on the same day a letter arrived saying that at a meeting of the directors of the bank it had been resolved that as he had saved them from a loss of fifty thousand pounds by his gallantry a sum of two thousand pounds should be placed to his credit at the bank in token of their appreciation of the great service he had rendered them     illustration  chapter xx  a message from abroad   i like this grandfather i think i like it better than anything i have seen in the sunlight the cathedral is too dazzling and white and the eye does not seem to find any rest but in the moonlight it is perfectly lovely and then the music of that austrian band is just right from here it is not too loud and yet we can hear every note somehow i always like better not to see the players but just to have the benefit of the music as we do now and to sit taking it in and looking at that glorious cathedral all silver and black in the moonlight it is glorious harry murmured i could not have believed there was anything so lovely  yes yes captain bayley said absently the ices are good  i am not talking of the ices grandfather though no doubt they are good i am talking about the cathedral  are you my boy captain bayley said rousing himself yes there are cathedrals which beat milan when seen in broad daylight but in the moonlight there is no building in the world to compare with it unless it be the taj mahal at agra of course they differ wholly and entirely in style and no comparison can be made between them the only resemblance is that both are built of white marble but of the two i own that i prefer the taj  i am afraid i shall never see that alice hardy said but i am quite content with milan i could stop here for a month  a month my dear captain bayley exclaimed in consternation three days will be ample you know we agreed to stop here till friday and then to go on to como  well perhaps we will let you go on friday but we shall have to dawdle about the lakes for some time we cant rush through them as we have been rushing through all these grand old italian towns we must have a long rest there you know  yes i suppose so the old officer said reluctantly but i like to be on the move  captain bayley had indeed somewhat tried his two young companions by his eagerness to be ever on the move they had now been nearly two years absent from england they had visited all the principal towns of germany and austria had gone down the danube and stopped at constantinople had spent a fortnight in the holy land and had then gone to egypt and ascended the nile as far as the first cataract then they had taken a steamer to naples and thence made their way up through italy to milan and now were about to cross over into switzerland and were after spending a month there to go on to paris and thence home  the highest surgical advice and the most skilful appliances aided by the benefit he had derived from the german baths had done much for harry and he had for months passed many hours a day in the hands of a skilful shampooer who travelled with him as valet he had to a great extent recovered the use of his legs and now walked with the assistance of two sticks and there was every hope that in time he would be able to dispense with these aids although he would always walk somewhat stiffly captain bayley was delighted at this improvement in his grandson and would have been perfectly happy had it not been for the continual worry caused him by the failure of his advertisements to elicit any news whatever of frank  it was this uncertainty that caused his restlessness and he was for ever pressing forward to the next town to which he had directed letters to be sent constantly suffering disappointments when he found the usual announcement from his solicitor that no news had been obtained of his missing nephew  alice and harry shared his anxiety but their pleasure in the new scenes they were visiting prevented their being so entirely engrossed in the subject as he was and although scarcely a day passed without some talk as to franks whereabouts and the probability of his discovery they were able to put the subject aside and to enter with full zest into the scenes they were visiting but in captain bayleys mind the question was always uppermost sincerely attached as he had always been to frank the thought that his favourite might have suffered a cruel and dastardly wrong and might now be slaving for his living in some unknown part of the world worried and troubled him incessantly and he felt that happy as he was at the discovery of his grandson he could never be contented and tranquil until this matter was cleared up besides in his will fred barkley was still standing as heir to onethird of his fortune and the thought that he might die before the mystery was cleared up and that possibly this property might go to the man he suspected of so foul a crime was absolutely intolerable to the old officer he had indeed been engaged in a correspondence with his lawyer mr griffith in reference to his will which he wanted worded so that fred barkley should not take the fortune left him until the question of the theft of the ten pounds should be cleared up mr griffith pointed out that it was scarcely possible to frame a will in such a way  had your nephew been publicly accused of the crime doubtless a clause might be framed by which the money would remain in the hands of trustees until he had cleared himself to their satisfaction but in this case there is no shadow of suspicion against him another person has in the eyes of those who know the circumstances of the affair been adjudged guilty no one has breathed a word against the honour of your nephew and therefore to say that he shall not touch the legacy until his honour is cleared would be to take a most extraordinary and i think unprecedented course in fact i dont see how it could be done  captain bayley had replied hotly that it must be done and owing to his frequent changes of address and the time occupied in the letters passing to and fro the correspondence had already lasted for some months what enraged captain bayley most of all was that mr griffith would not admit that any doubt whatever existed as to frank norriss guilt nor that there was a shadow of reasonable suspicion against his cousin and each time the evidence was marshalled up captain bayley had to acknowledge to himself that the lawyers arguments were unanswerable and that the only grounds that he himself had for his doubts were his affection for frank and the fixed passionate belief of alice hardy in his innocence that day captain bayley was exceptionally out of temper and irascible for he had that morning received a letter from mr griffith positively declining to draw up a clause for insertion in the will of the nature he desired and saying that if captain bayley insisted upon its insertion much as he should regret it after so long a connection had existed between them he should prefer that his client should place himself in other hands  i trust he said that this will cause no interruption in the personal friendship which has for years existed between us but i would risk even that rather than draft a clause which i consider would be in the highest degree unjust and which i tell you fairly would i believe be upset in any court of law nothing would in my opinion be more unfair i may say more monstrous than that a hand should be stretched from the grave to strike a blow at the honour of a young man of stainless reputation  captain bayley at all times disliked opposition he disliked it especially when as in the present instance he felt that he was in the wrong  when they returned to their hotel the waiter informed alice that a gentleman had called twice while they were out to see her he had not left a card saying that miss hardy would not know his name but that he had a message to give her and that he would not occupy her time more than a few minutes if she would be good enough to see him  it sounds quite mysterious alice said smiling to her uncle  was it a young gentleman or an old she asked the waiter in french  an elderly gentleman signora  some elderly millionaire alice captain bayley growled sarcastically as they ascended the stairs who has seen you in the streets and wishes to lay himself and his fortune at your feet  that must be it alice laughed but perhaps he has brought me a message from some of the many ladies we have met in our travels i suppose i had better see him if he comes again  i suppose so captain bayley said he is not likely to eat you and as my room opens off the sittingroom you have only to scream and i can come in to your rescue  very well i will scream uncle if necessary but do you think he wants to see me alone  as he has only asked for you and no one else i suppose he does at any rate i have no lively curiosity as to his visit and i dont suppose harry has either most likely its some man who wants to sell you jewellery or cameos or to ask you for a subscription for the chaplain or to beg of you on some pretext or other they are always at it he saw your name on the hotel list standing without any male protector of the same name no doubt he thinks you are an elderly spinster with money  i expect its something of that sort alice harry laughed  but alice insisted that she was convinced that the mysterious stranger had something important to communicate to her as she was taking her things off there was a knock at the door and the waiter said  the gentleman who before called is below  show him up into our sittingroom she said and at once went in to receive him hes just coming up uncle she said tapping at captain bayleys door he opened it a few inches  i have got my pistol handy alice in case you scream  alice laughed and as she turned round there was a knock at the door the waiter announced monsieur adams and an elderly gentleman entered  you must be surprised at the intrusion of a stranger at this hour of the evening miss hardy but my excuse must be that i have for nearly two months been following your footsteps and i was afraid that if i put off calling upon you until the morning i might find that you had gone  following me for two months alice repeated in great surprise i do not understand sir  naturally miss hardy the statement appears a strange one to you but the fact is i made a promise to deliver a message to you i found upon reaching england that you had left i obtained your address at cairo and went there only to find you had left a fortnight before my arrival then i followed you to naples and was a week too late at rome i missed you by a day and as i could not learn there at your hotel where you were going next beyond the fact that you had gone north i have been hunting for you ever since  but sir alice said more and more surprised what message could possibly be of sufficient importance for you to undertake so long a journey to deliver it  i did not know how long you might be before you returned to england miss hardy and as i knew how anxiously the answer to my message would be expected i preferred to follow you in order that there might be no more delay than necessary  suddenly a thought flashed across alice hardys brain she advanced a step nearer to her visitor and exclaimed  do you come from my cousin frank  you have guessed rightly i met him abroad i am not at liberty at present to say where he rendered me one of the greatest services one man can render to anotherhe saved my life and did much more but upon that it is not now necessary to enter  but the message sir alice interrupted you cannot know how we have been longing for a word from him all this time  i do not know yet miss hardy whether i have any message to deliver it depends upon what you say in answer to what i tell you i think i can give you his very words as we sat together the night before i left for england i have a little cousin a girl she was like my sister i think i hope that in spite of everything she may still have believed me innocent will you see her and tell her you have seen me say no more until you see by her manner whether she believes me to be a rascal or not  no no alice broke in with a cry not for one moment surely frank never doubted me never for a single instant did i believe one word against him  is anything the matter my dear captain bayley asked opening his door for the sound of her raised voice had reached him  no uncle she cried hurrying to him it is a message from frank go away a minute orno and she turned again to mr adams surely my uncle can hear too he is as interested as i am  my message was to you alone miss hardy mr adams said gravely i must deliver it as it was delivered to me it will be for you to decide whether after hearing it you think it right to observe the injunction it contains for your absolute silence  at least tell me sir captain bayley exclaimed as much agitated as alice whether he is alive and well  he is alive and well sirat least he was when i saw him last now nearly four months ago  thank god for that at least captain bayley said fervently do not be long alice you know what i shall be feeling he went back into his room again and closed the door and mr adams continued  if she thinks me a rascal give her no clue to the part of the world where you have come across me simply say that i wished her to know that i am alive and well there miss hardy my message would have ended had you not declared your faith in his innocence i can now go on if you see that she still in spite of everything believes that i am innocent then tell her that i affirm on my honour and word that i am soalice gave a cry of joythough i see no way of proving it tell her that i do not wish her to tell my uncle that she has heard of me that i do not wish her to say one word to him for much as i value his affection i would not for the world seem to be trying to gain the place he thinks i have forfeited until i can appear before him as a rich man whom nothing could induce to touch one penny of his money and who values only his goodwill and esteem  that is all the message miss hardy but now that i see you have never believed him guilty i am at liberty to tell you that we met in california and to give you an address to which you can write at sacramento and i can tell you the story of our acquaintance but as the story is a long one and it is now late i will with your permission call in the morning again  tears were streaming down the girls face as she lifted her head  thank you sir oh thank you so much you cannot tell how happy your message has made mehow happy it will make us all for i am sure that frank will not blame me for breaking his injunction he cannot tell the circumstances he does not know that my uncle has fretted as much as myself he evidently thinks that he believes him guilty though why he should do so i dont know for at first he was just as much convinced as i was of franks innocence and it was only franks silence and his going away without saying one word in defence of himself that made him doubt him would you mind sitting here for a minute or two while i go in to him we want to hear so much if you are not in a hurry  i am in no hurry mr adams said smiling after travelling for two months to deliver a message one would not mind sitting up for a few hours to deliver it thoroughly and let me tell you that if my message has made you happy your reception of it has given me almost equal satisfaction i should have been grieved beyond expression to have had to write to him that you doubted him for my dear friend said if your commission fails i shall lose my last pleasant thought of home  poor frank alice murmured as she turned to go to her uncles room how could he have ever doubted us  uncle she said as she entered i feel quite justified in telling you franks message to me why it was sent to me instead of to you i do not know except that it seems as if he thought that i might believe him innocent while somehow he had an idea that you thought he was guilty  does he say he is innocent alice captain bayley broke in  he does uncle he declares on his honour and word that he is innocent  thank god the old officer said dropping into a chair and covering his face with his hands for a minute he sat silent but alice could see how deeply he was affected  dont say any more my dear he said in a low shaken voice i have heard quite enough it was only franks assurance that i have been wanting all this time i am content now thank god that this burden is lifted off ones mind go in and tell harry i should like to be alone for a few minutes  yes uncle and franks friend is in the next room and will tell us all about him when you are ready to hear it  harry was greatly delighted at the news and after a few minutes alice returned with him to the sittingroom she knocked at her uncles door and called out we are here uncle when you are ready to come in in another minute captain bayley entered he went up to mr adams  illustration meeting of captain bayley and mr adams  you have brought me the best news i have ever heard sir you cannot tell what a weight you have lifted from my shoulders and how i feel indebted to you  yes uncle and do you know that mr adams has been travelling nearly two months to deliver the message knowing how anxious frank will be to hear how it was received he went to egypt after us and finding we had left has been following us ever since  god bless you sir captain bayley said seizing mr adamss hand and shaking it violently you are a friend indeed now in the first place please tell me the message you have given my niece for so far i have only heard that frank declared that he is innocent that was quite enough for me at first i want to know why i was to be kept in the dark  the message will explain that mr adams replied and he again repeated the message he had given alice  yes that explains it captain bayley said when he had finished thats just like the boy of old i like him for that but why on earth did he not say he was innocent at first  that i cannot tell you i know no more of the past than the message i have given you except he said that he had been wrongfully suspected of committing a crime and that although he was innocent the case appeared absolutely conclusive against him and that he saw no chance whatever of his being cleared save by the confession of the person who had committed the offence  but why on earth didnt he say he was innocent captain bayley repeated with something of his old irritation what possessed him to run away as if he were guilty without making one protest to us that he was innocent  i cannot tell you sir as i said i know nothing whatever of the circumstance i do not even know the nature of the accusation against him i only know from my knowledge of his character that he is a noble and generous young man and that he never could have been guilty of any dishonourable action  nobody would ever have thought he would captain bayley said sharply unless he had as much as said so himself by running away when this ridiculous accusation was brought forward i should as soon have doubted my own existence as supposed he had stolen a tenpound note had he not run away instead of facing it like a man until he bolted without sending me a word of denial or explanation i would have knocked any man down who had said he believed him guilty the evidence had no more weight in my mind than the whistling of the wind my doubts are of his own creation thank god they are at an end now that he has declared he is innocent he has behaved like a fool but there are so many fools about that there is nothing out of the way in that still it was one of the follies i should not have expected of frank that he should get into a foolish scrape from thoughtlessness or high spirits or devilry or that sort of thing i could imagine but i am astonished that he should have committed an act of folly due to cowardice  i wont hear you uncle any more alice exclaimed i know that you dont mean anything you say and that you are one of the happiest men in the world this evening but of course mr adams does not know you as we do and does not understand that all this means that you are so relieved from the anxiety that you have felt for the last two years that you are obliged to give vent to your feelings somehow please mr adams dont regard what my uncle says in the slightest but tell us all about frank as to his going away we know nothing about his motives or why he went or anything else and i am quite sure he will be able to explain it when we see him as to running away from cowardice uncle knows as well as we do that the idea is simply ridiculous so please go on and if uncle interrupts we will go down to another sittingroom and he shall hear nothing about it  mr adams then told the story of his acquaintance with frank how when all seemed dark when he was lying prostrate with fever brought on by overexertion and insufficient food frank had come to his son and had insisted on helping him how he had helped to nurse him and how finally frank and his companions had worked the claim and realised a fortune for him he told how popular frank was among his companions how ready he was to do a kindly action to any one needing it and finally repeated the conversation they had had together the last evening and franks determination not to return to england until he had gained such a fortune that he could not be suspected of desiring to gain anything but his uncles esteem when he presented himself before him and declared he was innocent  the young scamp captain bayley growled thinking all the time of his own feelings and not of mine its nothing to him that i may be fretting myself into my grave in the belief of his guilt nothing that i may be dead years and years before he comes home with this precious fortune he relies on making oh no we are all to wait another twenty years in order that this jackanapes may not be suspected of being mercenary three dozen at the triangles would do him a world of good and if he were here i would  you wouldnt do anything but shake his hand and shout frank my boy i am glad to see you back again so its no use pretending that you would alice interrupted and now mr adams its past twelve and i feel ashamed that we should have kept you so long but i know you dont mind and you have made us all very happy you will come again in the morning will you not there is so much to ask about and we have not yet even begun to tell you how deeply we are all obliged to you for your goodness in hurrying away from england directly you got home and in spending weeks and weeks wandering about after us  i shall be glad to call again in the morning miss hardy but i shall start for england in the evening i am anxious to be back now that my mission is fulfilled my son is to be married in ten days time and he would like me to be present although he said in his last letter that he quite agreed that the first thing of all was to find you and deliver the message whether i got home or not as i have several matters to arrange before his marriage presents to get or one thing or other i shall go straight through  that is right captain bayley said we will travel together my dear sir for of course we shall go straight back to england now we have been dawdling about in this wretched country long enough besides everything has to be arranged and we have got to get to the bottom of this matter so if you have no objection we will travel home together if the young people here want to dawdle about any longer they can do so i dare say they can look after themselves or if not i can make an arrangement with some old lady or other to act as alices chaperon  you silly old man alice said kissing him as if we were not just as anxious to get home and to get to the bottom of the thing as you are  so the next afternoon the party started in the diligence which was to take them over the st gothard to lucerne  alice had by this time heard somewhat to the confusion of her ideas that frank was no longer the lad she had always depicted him but a tall powerful young man rough and tanned by exposure and a fair match in strength for the wildest character in the mining camp  by the time they reached london mr adams and captain bayley had become fast friends and the first thing the next morning captain bayley drove with alice to bond street and purchased the handsomest gold watch and chain he could find as a weddingpresent for young adams and a bracelet as handsome for alice to send to the bride then he sent alice home in the carriage and proceeded to his lawyers he returned home in the worst of tempers mr griffith had refused to admit that the receipt of franks message had in any way changed the position  i understood all along captain bayley that your nephew when accused by his master had denied the theft the mere fact that he now three years later repeats the denial to you does not so far as i can see alter the situation in the slightest he says that hes not in a position to disprove any of the circumstances alleged against him of course you are at liberty to believe him now just as you believed him at first and as on mature consideration you disbelieved him afterwards but that is a matter quite of individual opinion you have announced to mr barkley that you intend to leave him a third of your fortune and it would be in the highest degree unjust to make any alteration now without a shadow of reason for doing so personally no doubt it is a satisfaction to you to have recovered your belief in franks innocence but that ought not to interfere in any way with the arrangements that you have made my own belief is as i have told you that pressed for money and afraid of expulsion were his escapade of going out at night discovered frank yielded to a momentary temptationa grievous fault but not an irreparable oneone at any rate for which he has been severely punished and for which he may well be forgiven so far i am thoroughly with you but i cannot and will not follow you in what i consider your absolutely unfounded idea that he is innocent and that his cousinagainst whom there is not a vestige of evidence while the proof the other way is overwhelmingis the real offender  whereupon captain bayley had returned home in a state of fury  but after all uncle alice said after listening for some time to his outburst against lawyers in general and mr griffith in particular it really is reasonable what mr griffith says you and i and harry who know frank so well are quite sure that he is innocent but other people who dont know him in the same way might naturally take the other view for as mr griffith says the proofs were strong against him and there was nothing whatever to connect fred barkley with the crime i have been talking it over with harry since i came back and he agrees with me that we must as you say get to the bottom of the whole affair before we go any further  well isnt that what we have been trying to do all along captain bayley exclaimed angrily how are we to get to the bottom of it if you will tell me that i will grant that you have more sense in your head than i have ever given you credit for  my idea grandfather is this harry said we have not yet heard franks side of the story i am convinced that if we heard that we should get some new light upon it and my proposal is that you and i shall at once start for california and see frank and hear all about it it seems to me that he has been silent because he has some mistaken idea that you believe in his guilt and when you assure him that you have an absolute faith in his innocence he will go into the whole matter and in that case we shall probably find some clue which we can follow up and get at the truth  the very thing harry the captain exclaimed impetuously we will start by the first ship you and i and find this troublesome young rascal and have it out with him  and i shall go too of course uncle alice hardy exclaimed i am not going to be left behind by myself  impossible alice you dont know what the country is you could not go wandering about up in the mountains looking for him through all sorts of mining camps with no decent place for a woman to sleep  no uncle but i could stay at san francisco till you came back with him there must be some sort of people there you could leave me with i am sure you would not be so unkind as to leave me in england in a state of anxiety all these months you know i enjoy the sea and you will want somebody to look after you during the voyage and to see that you dont get into scrapes with that dreadful temper of yours besides you must have some one to scold you could not get on without it and you dont scold harry half so vigorously as you do me  and so at last it was settled and a week later captain bayley his grandson and alice hardy sailed for panama     illustration  chapter xxi  happy meetings   frank was in splendid health and his bones set rapidly a fortnight after the encounter with the brigands he rode down to the camp on the yuba with his arm in a sling his attack singlehanded upon the four stagerobbers had rendered him quite a noted character and he was warmly greeted upon his arrival as soon as he had got to the wooden shanty dignified by the name of the hotel a deputation waited upon him  we have come the leader of the party said to congratulate you in the name of the hull of this mining camp on having pretty well cleared out that gang of stagerobbers the safety of the roads air a matter of great importance to this camp as well as to all the other camps in the state seeing that we air obliged to pay a heavy rate of insurance on our gold being carried down and have the risk of losing it all if we takes it down ourselves therefore it air the opinion of this community that you have done them a considerable sarvice and we are obliged to you  the four members of the deputation then shook frank solemnly by the hand  i can only say i am much obliged to you frank said and i only regret that one of the four got off safe however they had a lesson and i hope the roads will be safer in future  now the spokesman of the deputation said lets liquor  five glasses were poured out by the bartender and drunk off solemnly this was considered to bring the ceremony to a close  in the evening frank was sitting around a fire with some of his acquaintances when two persons were seen approaching  can you tell me one of them said when he got up to the group whether frank norris is in the camp and if so where i can find him  frank sprang to his feet with a cry of astonishment  uncle he exclaimed is it you or am i dreaming  my dear boy captain bayley exclaimed as he grasped franks hand thank god we have found you we have been advertising and looking for you ever since you left nearly three years ago  for a minute or two they stood grasping each others hand their feelings being too full for further speech  sit you down right here norris one of the miners said rising no doubt you will like a talk together and we will leave you to yourselves  the other miners rose and with the real courtesy and kindness which lurked under the rough nature of the diggers all left the spot captain bayley was the first to speak  but here is some one else wants to shake your hand frank an old friend too  the fire was not burning very brightly and although frank seemed to know the young fellow who stood leaning lightly on two sticks he could not recall where he had seen him before  dont you remember me frank he said the lad whom you took so much trouble with over his homer  harry holl frank said in astonishment  it was as harry holl that you knew him but we have since found out that he is my grandson the son of my daughter ella captain bayley explained  then you are my cousin frank said advancing and shaking harrys hand but how on earth have you and uncle come out here  let us sit down by the fire frank for the evening is chilly and then i will tell you all about it but first how about that enormous brute of a dog who doesnt seem to have made up his mind whether the proper thing is not to devour us at once  come turk good dog these are friends of mine  finding that the intentions of the newcomers were amicable of which at first he had entertained some doubts turk threw himself down by the side of his master  first of all uncle frank said as he sat down has that affair been cleared up  well not exactly cleared up frank but we have our suspicions harry and i never for a moment thought it was youthat is not till you ran away instead of facing it out i dont want to scold you now but that was a foolish business  then if you thought me innocent uncle why did you not answer my letter i should never have dreamt of running away if i had not been heartbroken at the thought that you believed me guilty  letter captain bayley repeated in astonishment what letter that was just the thing if you had written me only one line to say you were innocent i should never have doubted you for a moment and even your running away would have made no difference to me  but i did write uncle i wrote to you the very first thing telling you that i was innocent although appearances were all against me and saying that i could bear anything if i knew that you believed in me and i begged you to send me just one line by hand i waited all day for the answer and all the evening and when night came and no letter i felt that you believed me guilty i became desperate and when fred advised me to bolt and offered me the money to take me away i thought i might as well go at once as go after the disgrace of being publicly expelled before the whole school  but i never got the letter captain bayley said never got a line from you and it was that which shook my faith  i gave the letter to fred barkley to post half an hour after i came down from school that is before eleven oclock and he told me he posted it at once  i am afraid captain bayley said sternly that fred barkley is a vile young scoundrel we have had our suspicions of him harry and i and this seems to confirm them i believe that villain is at the bottom of the whole affair have you ever suspected him frank  such an idea has flitted across my mind uncle but i have never allowed it to rest there it was too shocking to believe  i am afraid it must be believed captain bayley said it was harry who first pointed it out to me that looking at the whole case the matter really lay between him and you and that it was just as probable that he took the note and sent it to you as that you should have taken it and sent it to yourself harry urged indeed that fred had far greater motives for doing so than you for whereas you had only to get out of a stupid scrape he would be playing for the money which i was to leave which was a heavy stake on the other hand he admitted that the crime of stealing the note for the purpose of ruining you would be infinitely greater than the taking of money in your case  i have nearly worried myself into a lunatic asylum over the matter i have been away from england for upwards of a yearpartly for the sake of harry here who has got rid of his box long ago and now gets along very fairly on sticks partly to avoid seeing fred for as long as this thing was unsettled it was impossible that i could give him my hand  my heart has all along been with you my boy for you know i loved you as a son but your silence and your running away were ugly weights in the scale against you now that i find that that villain suppressed your letterfor he must have done so else i should have got itand that it was he who urged you to fly to get you out of the way i have no longer a shadow of doubt in my mind i must tell you that harry here never doubted you from the first and as for alice she became a veritable little fury when the possibility of your guilt was suggested we have had some rare battles and rows over that and her absolute refusal to speak to fred whom from the first she insisted was at the bottom of it though how she arrived at that conclusion except by instinct is more than i can tell her joy when harry here was found and of course took the position i had intended for you and her delight in freds discomfiture were as i told her several times absolutely indecent not that she minded a farthing she is the most insubordinate young person i ever came across you will hardly know her again frank she is growing fast into a young woman and a very pretty one too  but how did you find me uncle was it from mr adams that you heard where i was  well frank we advertised for you for over two years in the american and colonial papers and at last began almost to despair  about two months ago when we were in milanfor we have been wandering about europe for the last eight or nine monthsyour friend adams found us out the good fellow had been hunting for us for two months  ah that explains why i have not heard from him frank interrupted i have been looking for a letter for the last two months and had begun to conclude that as he had nothing pleasant to tell me he had not written and that i should never hear now  then you thought like a young fool captain bayley said angrily well as soon as adams had given your message to aliceand why you should have supposed that alice should have believed in your innocence any more than me except that women never will believe what they dont want to believe i dont knowwell of course she told us about it at once and we came back to england and talked it over and settled that the best thing was for us all to come out and see you  all frank repeated in surprise  yes all the headstrong young woman would not be left behind and she is at sacramento now that is if she hasnt been shot by some of these redshirted miners or come to her end some other way we stayed two days at san francisco i have wandered about a good deal but i thought before i saw sacramento and these places that city was the residence of the roughest and most dangerous set of rascals i ever met  we travelled by coach across the plains and on going to the bank at sacramento found that you had been just shooting some highwaymen and had got your arm broken by a bullet so we put alice in charge of the landlady of the hotel and dared her to stir out of the room till we got back we came on to the place where they said you were stopping but found that you had come on here this morning so we took our places in the coach again and here we are and the sooner we get away from here the better so i hope you will be ready to start early in the morning  but my dear uncle frank began  dont give me any of your buts sir captain bayley said peremptorily you have been hiding too long now you must go back and take your place again  but i cant clear myself of this affair  dont tell me sir the old officer said angrily you have cleared yourself to me and i will take good care that the truth is known as for that rascal fred i deserve all the trouble that i have gone through for being such an old fool as to let him take me in i want to get back as quickly as possible to make my will again ever since harry put the idea into my mind i have been fretting about the one i had made leaving fred a third of my property i thought if anything happened to me before the matter was cleared up and i found out in the next worldwhere i suppose people know everythingthat i had been wrong i should have been obliged to have asked for a furlough to come back again to set it straight alice will be fidgeting her life out and we must set out at once so let us have no more nonsense about delay  frank offered no further resistance and agreed to start on the following morning  you look more like yourself now frank his uncle said for except by the tones of your voice i should hardly have known you you must have grown ten inches bigger round the shoulders than you were and have grown into a very big man you dont look so big here where there are so many burly miners about but when you get back to london people will quite stare at you your face at present is tanned almost black and that beard which i suppose is the result of exposure makes you look half a dozen years older than you really are i hope you will shave it off at once and look like a civilised english gentleman  i suppose i must do so frank said rather ruefully for one never sees a beard in london except on a foreigner i suppose some day men will be sensible and wear them  they sat talking until late in the night frank hearing all particulars of the discovery of harrys relationship to captain bayley and the news of all that had taken place since he had left england he arranged for sleeping accommodation for them for the night in the hut of the storekeeper for whom he brought up provisions judging that this was more comfortable and quiet for them than in the crowded and noisy plank edifice called the hotel the next morning they started by the coach for sacramento frank ordering the muleteers to follow with the animals at once it was a twentyfour hours drive but it did not seem a long one to any of them for frank had so much to tell about his doings and adventures from the day when he last saw them that there was scarce a pause in their talk until at night captain bayley and harry dozed in their corner of the coach while frank got outside and sat and smoked by the driver being altogether too excited by the sudden arrival of his uncle and the change in all his plans to feel inclined for sleep it was ten oclock in the morning when they drove into sacramento  i think uncle i will just go round to my house for i keep one regularly here and put on the garb of civilisation alice would not recognise me in this red shirt and high boots  stuff and nonsense captain bayley said you had a washup when we breakfasted and what do you want more there go up and see the girl at once harry and i will join you in a minute or two according to my experience these sort of meetings are always better without the presence of a third party and the old officer winked at his grandson as frank sprang up the stairs after the waiter whom captain bayley directed to show him to miss hardys sittingroom  although captain bayley had told him that alice had become a young woman frank had not realised the change that three years had produced in her he had left her a laughing girla dear little girl frank had always thoughtbut scarcely pretty and he stood for a moment in astonishment at the tall and very beautiful young woman of eighteen who stood before him alice was no less astonished and for a moment could scarcely credit that this broad muscular man was her old playfellow frank the pause was but momentary on both parties and with a cry of joy and welcome the girl ran into his arms as frankly and naturally as she had done as a child  there thats enough frank she said presently you mustnt do that any more you know because i am grown up and you know we are not really even cousins  cousins or not alice frank said laughing i have kissed you from the time you were a child and if you suppose i am going to give it up now when there is a real pleasure in kissing you you are mistaken i can tell you  we shall see about that sir the girl said we are in california now among wild people but when we get back to england we must behave like civilised beings but o frank what a monster of a dog is he savage he looks as if he were going to fly at me  for turk to whom greetings of this sort were entirely new was standing at the door his bristles halfraised doubtful whether alice was to be treated as a friend or foe  come here turk he is the best of dogs alice though it is well not to put him out for he has killed two men one in defence of our money the other of myself but he is the dearest of dogs and i will tell you some day how i found him come here turk and give your hand to this lady she is a very great friend of your master  turk gravely approached and offered his paw which alice took cautiously franks report of his doings being by no means encouraging turk satisfied now that there was no occasion for his interference threw himself down at full length upon the hearthrug and alice turned to frank  i am so glad you are coming home again  and i am glad to be coming home again frank said or rather i shall be when this matter is quite cleared up  i should not bother any more about it alice said decidedly uncle harry and i are all quite quite sure that you had nothing to do with that horrible business and that ought to be quite enough for you  it isnt quite enough alice he said although it is a very great deal but we need not talk about that now oh here is uncle  in the course of the day alice heard of the new light which had been thrown on the matter by the discovery that frank had written to protest his innocence which letter had never come to hand and that it was fred who had urged frank to fly and had supplied him with money to do so  i always knew he was at the bottom of it alice said decidedly i always said it was fred but i hope frank you or uncle dont mean to take any steps to get him into trouble i hate him you know and always have still i think he will be punished enough with the loss of the money he so wickedly tried to gain  i think so too alice he has behaved like a scoundrel of the worst kind but for my part i am quite content to leave him alone still we must if possible prove that i was innocent  but we all know you are innocent frank uncle never would have doubted it if it had not been for the stories fred told  yes alice but all the fellows at westminster were told i was guilty i shall be constantly meeting them in the world and all my life this blot will hang to me if it is not set straight when we get home i shall go back to the school and see if i cannot hit on some clue or other of course if fred would confess it would be all right but after all we have not a shadow of real proof against him we have only our suspicion and the fact that the letter did not come to hand and if he faces it out and declares he posted it all right who is to gainsay him letters have gone wrong before now i must clear myself if i can but i promise you that i will not bring public disgrace upon him if it can possibly be avoided  he ought to be publicly disgraced captain bayley roared the mean scoundrel with his quiet voice and his treacherous lies not disgrace him i would tie him up to a post in st pauls churchyard and hire a bellman to stand on a chair beside him and tell the story of what he has done every halfhour why sir he would have taken in st dunstan with his pretended hesitation to say anything to your disadvantage and the affectation of pain with which he hinted that you had confessed your guilt to him the scoundrel the rascal the hypocrite when i think what his work has done that you were disgraced at school and sent wandering for three yearsnot that that has done you any harm rather the contraryto think that alice has been wretched and i have been on thorns and out of temper with myself and every one else for the same time that for the last year we have been wandering about europe like three sentimental travellers wasting our lives spending our money and making fools of ourselves i tell you sir if i was sitting as president of a courtmartial on him i would give him five hundred lashes and then order him to be drummed out of the regiment  frank was about to speak but alice shook her head to him behind her uncles back she knew that his bark was much worse than his bite and that while contradiction would only render him obstinate he would if left alone cool down long before the time for action arrived and could then be coaxed into any course they might all agree upon  the next morning the party started for san francisco frank had already found a purchaser for his team of mules at a good price had wound up all his affairs and obtained an order from the bank on their agents in england for the amount standing to his credit which came to seven thousand five hundred and sixty pounds  his uncle was astounded when he heard how much frank had earned in less than two years work i shall look at these redshirted ruffians with more respect in future frank for for aught i know they may have tens of thousands standing to their credit at the bank  my luck has been exceptional sir frank said i might dig for another fifty years without making so much of course there are people who have made a good deal more in the same time but then there are thousands who are no richer than when they began we had done little more than keep ourselves when we went to work on adamss claim we had nearly four hundred apiece from him besides what we made for our labour for the horses pretty well kept us then from the claim six hundred apiece we had four thousand each out of the rich strike we made at the head of the gulch the bank gave me two thousand more the odd money represents the receipts of the rest of my digging and of my earnings with the mule team  they started for europe by the first steamer which left san francisco for panama and reached home without adventure the next morning captain bayley took frank to mr griffith and told him the story as he had learned it from frank  there griffith he said triumphantly when he had finished if you are not ready to admit that you are the most obstinate pigheaded fellow that ever lived i give you up altogether  i was wrong i am glad to see the lawyer said smiling but i cannot admit that i was wrong as far as the evidence that was before me went but certainly with the light our young friend has thrown upon the matter i cannot doubt that the view you took was the correct one still remember there is still no actual proof such as a court of justice would go upon morally we may be convinced but unless you obtain further evidence i do not think you are in a position openly to charge fred barkley with stealing that tenpound note nor do i see how you are to set about getting such evidence  we are going to try anyhow captain bayley said frank and i are going down to westminster tomorrow to open the investigation again and with what we know now it is hard if we dont manage to get something     illustration  chapter xxii  cleared at last   the following day after lunch captain bayley and frank drove round to westminster football was going on in deans yard and frank recognised among the players many faces that he knew it seemed strange to him to think that while he had gone through so much and had grown from a boy into a man that they had changed so little and had been working away regularly at the old round of euripides and homer terence and virgil the carriage stopped at the entrance to deans yard and alighting they walked across to mr richards  captain bayley had written a line to the master asking him if possible to remain at home as he wished particularly to see him and he and frank were ushered straight into the masters study he shook hands with captain bayley whose acquaintance he had made while frank had boarded with him and then looked at frank for a minute he did not recognise him then he exclaimed in surprise frank norris  yes its i sir frank said i dont ask you to take my hand for you believe me guilty of the crime of which i was accused here i can only say now as i said then that i am innocent i know now that i was a fool to run away instead of facing it out but i was desperate because every one thought me guilty  your schoolfellows did not norris mr richards said i dont think that i did even at first a few hours afterwards i almost knew you were innocent and had you not run away i could have gone far to prove it  frank gave an exclamation of joy and captain bayley exclaimed indignantly  then why did you not prove it sir why did you allow my nephew to remain with the foul disgrace on his name  i did not act without consideration mr richards said calmly norris had gone and i resolved if he returned again to say what i had learned but my proofs were not absolute we had made it seemed to me a terrible mistake and i did not wish to cause ruin to another boy unless it was absolutely necessary to do so to clear norris now that he has returned i can no longer hesitate but before i begin i must ask you both whether your suspicions have fallen on any one else  it is not suspicion sir it is certainty captain bayley said we have no doubt whatever that the whole thing was the work of franks rascally cousin fred barkley he was you know a sort of rival of frank for my favour and he had reason to believe that i had determined that frank should inherit the larger portion of my property thus he had a motive for bringing disgrace on him it was just as probable that he should have stolen the money and sent it to frank as that frank should have stolen it himself so far it seemed to me that it might lie between either of them  what has settled the case in my mind is that i have learned that fred was intrusted with a letter by frank to me declaring his innocence which as you know i never doubted until frank left without writing to me that letter i never received and i believe that it was suppressed in the second place it was fred who persuaded his cousin to take that ruinous step of running away and pressed upon him money to enable him to do so although he had refused to lend him a halfpenny when frank required it to pay that brokennosed tailor to hold his tongue  very well mr richards said then i can speak freely my silence was caused to some considerable extent by regard for your feelings you had lost one nephew who had gone away with a cloud of disgrace surrounding himfor aught i could tell norris in his despair might have committed suicide or he might have so cut himself off from you that you might never have heard from him againthus then i felt that it would be cruel indeed to prove that your other nephew was a villain unless by so doing i could restore norris to you so after much thought and deliberation i determined to hold my tongue until i heard that norris had either returned or had been heard of  on the morning when it was discovered that frank had fled i called up one by one the whole of the boys in the house even after his flight i could not believe that norris had done this thing it was so absolutely contrary to all that i knew of his disposition and i determined to sift the matter to the bottom from the elder boys i learned nothing although i questioned them most closely as to everything that had taken place in the house during the past week i was not disappointed for i had hardly expected to learn much from them  it was from the four boys who were the fags of the four who had been in franks secret that i hoped to learn something and i was not mistaken from the three in the house i learned nothing but when i came to pearson who was barkleys junior and fag i met with even more success than i had expected at first of course the boy did not like to say anything but i told him that unless he answered my questions freely i should have him up before doctor litter and he then told me all he knew about it  the more willingly for like most other boys in the school he was fond of norris while barkley was by no means a kind master he said that twice barkley had got into a rage with him about things which didnt seem of any importance the first occasion was a week previous he had gone into barkleys study to ask him to explain some difficulty in his cæsar the door was not fastened and as he had been working with his shoes off barkley did not hear him till he was close to the table the boy noticed that he had a sheet of writingpaper before him on which he was writing not in his usual hand but in printed characters he would have thought nothing of it had not barkley on looking up and seeing him standing there jumped up in a sudden rage and boxed his ears furiously calling him a prying little sneak the boy could not fix this to a day but it was certainly just about the time when this letter was posted to you  the other affair had happened the day previously he had gone into barkleys room with his books on coming down from school at twelve oclock and seeing on his table a letter stamped and ready for the post he supposed that as usual he was to post it and was running downstairs with it in his hand when he met barkley coming up what have you got there he asked i am taking your letter to the post he said whereupon barkley flew into another rage called him an officious little beast gave him a box in the ear and took the letter from him i asked the boy if he noticed to whom the letter was directed he said he had and that it was to you knowing nothing about the suppression of a letter of norriss and thinking that perhaps barkley had written to his uncle about the matter and had then changed his mind about posting it this second affair did not strike me as having any importance whatever the first matter however seemed important for that just at the time when a letter was sent to norris written in printing characters barkley should have been seen writing a letter of that sort struck me as most remarkable and although i did not know exactly how the two lads stood in reference to yourself it struck me at once that it was at least possible that we had been wrong and that it was barkley after all who took the note  had i suspected for an instant that he had done it to bring disgrace upon his cousin i should at once have communicated with dr litter and have probed the affair from the bottom but i thought that he had taken the note with the intention of helping his cousin out of his difficulty and that when the note was traced and the matter became public he had in a base and cowardly manner allowed frank to bear the blame this would have been bad enough in all conscience although comparatively venial to his deliberate attempt to bring disgrace upon norris  however the matter seemed bad enough to me as it stood but as i said i shrunk from causing the ruin of another young fellow unless it was necessary to clear norris i hesitated for a long time whether knowing as much as i did i ought not to take some steps in the matter but for the reasons i have told you i determined to wait hoping that you would soon have norris back again and knowing that i should hear of his return from some of the boys who were his special friends barkley must have seen from my manner that there was something wrong between him and me but he never asked me the reason for the change in my manner to him and completely ignored my coolness it was a relief to me when the time came for his going up to the university for i then felt that some of the responsibility was off my shoulders and that i was no longer shirking my duty to expose him  that is all captain bayley but i think that this with what you have told me is quite sufficient to bring the guilt home to the true party and to completely clear norris  quite sufficient captain bayley said and i am thankful indeed that you obtained the one missing link of evidence necessary to prove franks innocence i am greatly obliged to you mr richards for the kind and thoughtful manner in which you acted which was indeed in every way for the best for had i at the time been made aware that fred was the culprit i should have gone half out of my mind at the injustice we had done frank and at not knowing where to find him or how to communicate with him and now what is to be done next i do not want this unhappy lad to be punished but at the same time it is absolutely necessary that franks innocence shall be publicly proclaimed fred will no doubt brazen it out  there was silence for a minute or two and then mr richards said  if you like captain bayley i will take the matter in hand i will write to barkley and tell him that norris has now come home and that i must therefore take up the matter at the point at which i dropped it i will recapitulate to him the reasons that there are for supposing that he stole the moneyfirst his interest in franks disgrace secondly the fact that he was seen writing a letter in printed characters on the day on which the note was sent to norris thirdly his suppression of the letter to yourself fourthly the part he took in persuading norris to run away lastly the hints which you say he gave you that norris had confessed his guilt  i shall tell him i have had this interview with you that you are thoroughly convinced of his guilt and of norriss innocence and that while you are determined that norris shall be vindicated you are desirous that his act of treacherous villainy shall not be made public if then he will write a confession saying that he took it this confession shall not be made public  i shall of course show it to the doctor and explain the whole circumstances to him and ask him to make a public statement in school to the boys to the effect that it has been found out that norris was not guilty of the act of which two years ago he was charged and that the real thief has been discovered but that as he is no longer at school it is unnecessary now to mention his name and that moreover he has been heavily punished for the crimewhich indeed is the caseby his loss of your favour and of the fortune which he looked to obtain under your will  i shall tell barkley that if he refuses to confess it will be necessary in order to clear norris that the affair should be investigated in a public court and that dr litter will at once apply for a warrant for his apprehension on the charge of theft and that the whole matter will then be gone into in a police court i cannot doubt but that he will accept the first alternative for the second will be ruin to him  captain bayley cordially assented three days later frank received a letter from dr litter asking him to call upon him  i am truly sorry norris the headmaster said as he entered for the injustice i did you truly and heartily sorry the affair caused me intense pain at the time it has been on my mind ever since over and over again something has told me that you were innocent and yet thinking the case over again my reason has always convinced me for the time of your guilt for i could see no other possible solution of the mystery i am glad indeed to find that i was mistaken and that you were a victim of a piece of what i can only term villainy the affair will be a lesson to me for my life and henceforth i will never allow appearances however apparently conclusive to weigh against a uniformly excellent character i trust that you will forgive my terrible error  i dont see that you could have acted otherwise sir frank said for even at the time although i knew that i was innocent i perceived that the proofs against me were so overwhelmingly strong that my guilt must appear a certainty to every one i am happy indeed that i am cleared at last and after all it has done me no harm i have of course lost the university education which i looked forward to but i think after all that the three years i have spent in america have in many ways done me more good than the university could have done  very likely norris the doctor said they have in every sense of the word made a man of you and a very fine man too and i sincerely trust that no further cloud will ever fall upon your career and now i want you to come up school with me for i must publicly make amends for my error and set you right before the school  as frank followed dr litter into the great schoolroom he felt infinitely more nervous than he had done in any of the dangers he had passed through in his journey across the plains when the headmaster was seen to enter the school accompanied by a gentleman a silence of surprise fell upon the boys for such an event was altogether unprecedented there as in the stranger who stood nearly as tall and far broader than the doctor many of the boys in the upper forms recognised frank norris a buzz ran round the school followed again by the silence of excited expectation dr litter walked to his table at the further end of the school and then turned  you will all stand up he said boys he went on all of you in the fifth form and those above it and some of you in the under forms will recognise in the gentleman who stands beside me your former schoolfellow norris those who do will be aware of the circumstances under which he left and will be aware that i charged him with stealing a note of the value of ten pounds from my desk i am happy to say that it has been proved that charge was entirely false  a sudden burst of enthusiastic cheering broke from the upper forms norriss innocence had been a matter of faith among his schoolfellows and even his running away had not sufficed to shake their trust in him they stood upon the forms and cheered until they were hoarse at last a wave of the doctors hand restored silence and he went on  i wish now before you all boys to express my deep regret to norris and to apologise to him most heartily for the accusation which i made i have now in my hand the confession of the real culprit i shall not mention his name he has long since ceased to be among you and i may say that he has been punished severely though to my mind most insufficiently for his crime and as norris is desirous that the matter shall be dropped the least i can do is to give in to his wishes and now as i think that after this you will scarcely do any useful work this afternoon you may as well go down at once  a fresh roar of cheering broke out and then the boys who had been at school with frank jumped from their forms and crowded round him each striving to grasp his hand and all shouting words of welcome and congratulation  it was some time before frank could reply to these greetings so shaken was he by the scene on emerging from the schoolroom his old housemates urged him to go up to richards and the sixth were invited to accompany him although contrary to the usual rules an unlimited supply of shandygaff was sent for and for an hour frank sat and chatted with his old schoolfellows and to their great admiration gave them an outline of his adventures on the mississippi his journey across the plains and as a golddigger in california then with a glad heart and a feeling that he was at last cleared of the cloud which had so long hung over him frank returned to eaton square  his path in life never afterwards crossed that of his cousin the latter after passing through the university with credit entered the bar somehow he was not successful there that he was clever all allowed but a cloud seemed to hang over him the tale of franks reinstallation had gone up from westminster to the university his old schoolfellows there had talked the matter over and although nothing was known for certain somehow the belief that barkley was the culprit spread among them  he had never been popular and now his old schoolfellows gradually drew aloof from him nothing was ever openly said the thing was talked of in whispers but even whispers sometimes are heard and during his last year at the university fred barkley stood alone among his fellows the whispers found their echo in town and fred barkley found that a cloud rested on him which all his efforts were unable to dissipate after some years of useless attempts to make his way he was glad to accept the offer of a petty judgeship in india and there ten years later he died stabbed to the heart by a mahomedan dacoit whom he had sentenced to a term of imprisonment  a year after his return from america frank married alice turk for some time after his arrival in england had steadily declined all advances which she made to him perceiving clearly in his heart that she was a rival in his masters affection he had at last however the good sense to accept the situation but to the end of his life which was a long one he never accorded her more than toleration keeping all the affection of his great heart for his master although in his old years he took to his masters children and endured patiently if not cordially the affection which they bestowed upon him  frank sits in parliament at present as member for the county in which the broad estates which came to him with his wife are situated it was rather a disappointment to her that he did not distinguish himself greatly in parliament but he was fonder of the country life of an english gentleman than of the squabbles at westminster he can always be depended upon to vote with his party and he occasionally makes vigorous and indignant attacks against any policy which he believes to be lowering the prestige and position of his country but except upon occasions when subjects of national interest are being discussed he is seldom to be found in the house and his wife is now well content with his reputation as one of the best masters of foxhounds one of the best landlords and one of the most popular country gentlemen in england  captain bayley died but ten years ago at a great age and his grandson long since able to dispense with his crutches is one of the most prominent members in the house of commons he could had he chosen have long since had a place in the ministry but he declined as it would have taken too much of his time from the
