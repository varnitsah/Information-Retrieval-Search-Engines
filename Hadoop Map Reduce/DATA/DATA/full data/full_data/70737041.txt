spectacles some smoke      water pipes       the street is crowded here is an itinerant cook with his two      chests in one of which is burning charcoal he serves out bowls of      rice and condiments to the passersby who want food there is a      barber with the utensils of his trade a coolie seated on a stool      is having his head shaved chinese walk to and fro       some are coolies and wear blue cotton in various stages of      raggedness some in black gowns and caps and black shoes are      merchants and clerks there is a beggar gaunt and thin with an      untidy mop of bristly hair in tatters of indescribable filthiness      he stops at one of the shops and begins a long wail for a time no      one takes any notice of him but presently on a word from the fat      shopkeeper an assistant gives him a few cash and he wanders on      coolies half naked hurry by bearing great bales on their yokes      they utter little sharp cries for people to get out of their way      peking carts with their blue hoods rumble noisily along rickshaws      pass rapidly in both directions and the rickshaw boys shout for      the crowd to make way in the rickshaws are grave chinese some are      dressed in white ducks after the european fashion in other      rickshaws are chinese women in long smocks and wide trousers or      manchu ladies with their faces painted like masks in embroidered      silks women of various sorts stroll about the street or enter the      shops you see them chaffering for various articles       a watercarrier passes along with a creaking barrow

a onestringed fiddle      from the distance comes the muffled sound of gongs there is a      babel of sound caused by the talking of all these people by the      cries of coolies the gong the clappers and the fiddle from      burning josssticks in the shops in front of the household god      comes a savour of incense       a couple of mongols ride across on shaggy ponies they wear high      boots and astrakhan caps then a string of camels sways slowly down      the street they carry great burdens of skins from the deserts of      mongolia they are accompanied by wild looking fellows two stout      chinese gentlemen are giving their pet birds an airing the birds      are attached by the leg with a string and sit on little wooden      perches the two chinese gentlemen discuss their merits round      about them small boys play they run hither and thither pursuing      one another amid the crowd   end of scene i     scene ii   a small verandah on an upper storey of the british american

me to stay and see you dont do the wrong thing ill chuck my tennis im always ready to sacrifice myself for a friend  harry has it struck you that the distance from the verandah to the street is very considerable  knox and the pavement is hard i flatter myself i can take a hint i wonder where the devil my pin is i left it on the table  harry i expect wu put it away  knox its much more likely that old woman pinched it  harry oh nonsense she wouldnt dream of such a thing i believe mrs rathbones had her for ages  knox who is mrs rathbone  harry not wishing to be questioned a friend of mine  george conway comes in he is a tall dark man in the early thirties he is a handsome wellbuilt fellow of a somewhat rugged appearance but urbane and selfassured  george may i come in  harry eagerly shaking him warmly by the hand at last by jove its good to see you again you know knox dont you  george i think so  knox i wash bottles in the b a t i dont expect the legation bloods to be aware of my existence  george with a twinkle in his eye i dont know that an assistant chinese secretary is such a blood as all that  knox youve just been down to fuchow havent you  george yes i only got back this morning  knox did you see freddy baker by any chance  george yes poor chap  knox oh ive got no pity for him hes just a damned fool  harry why  knox havent you heard hes married a halfcaste  harry what of it i believe shes a very pretty girl  knox i daresay she is but hang it all he neednt have married her  george i dont think it was a very wise thing to do  harry i should have thought all those prejudices were out of date why shouldnt a man marry a halfcaste if he wants to  knox it cant be very nice to have a wife whom even the missionary ladies turn up their noses at  harry with a shrug of the shoulders you wait till freddys number one in hankow and can entertain i bet the white ladies will be glad enough to know his missus then  george yes but thats just it hell never get a good job with a eurasian wife  harry hes in jardines isnt he do you mean to say its going to handicap a man in a shipping firm because hes married a woman whos partly chinese  george of course it is jardines are about the most important firm in china and the manager of one of their principal branches has definite social obligations freddy baker will be sent to twopenny halfpenny outports where his wife doesnt matter  knox i think hes damned lucky if hes not asked to resign  harry its cruel his wife may be a charming and cultivated woman  knox have you ever known a halfcaste that was  harry i have  knox well ive been in this country for seven years and ive never met one male or female that didnt give me the shivers  harry ive no patience with you youre a perfect damned fool  knox a little surprised but quite goodhumoured youre getting rather excited arent you  harry hotly i hate injustice  george do you think it really is injustice the english are not an unkindly race if theyve got a down on halfcastes there are probably very good grounds for it  harry what are they  knox we dont much like their morals but we cant stick their manners  george somehow or other they seem to inherit all the bad qualities of the two races from which they spring and none of the good ones im sure there are exceptions but on the whole the eurasian is vulgar and noisy he cant tell the truth if he tries  knox to do him justice he seldom tries  george hes as vain as a peacock hell cringe when hes afraid of you and hell bully when hes not you can never rely on him hes crooked from the crown of his german hat to the toes of his american boots  knox straight from the shoulder take the count old man  harry frigidly oughtnt you to be going  knox smiling no but i will  harry im sorry if i was rude to you just now old man  knox silly ass youve broken no bones my selfesteem thank god is unimpaired he goes out  harry i say im awfully glad youre back george you cant think how i miss you when youre away  george as soon as the shooting starts well try and get two or three days together in the country  harry yes that would be jolly calling wu  wu outside ye  harry bring tea for three  george who is the third  harry when you said you could come round i asked somebody i want you very much to meet  george who is that  harry mrs rathbone  im going to be married to her and we want you to be our best man  george harry  harry boyishly i thought youd be surprised  george my dear old boy i am so glad i hope youll be awfully happy  harry im awfully happy now  george why have you kept it so dark  harry i didnt want to say anything till it was all settled besides ive only known her six weeks i met her when i was down in shanghai  george is she a widow  harry yes she was married to an american in the f m s  george is she american  harry only by marriage im afraid she didnt have a very happy married life  george poor thing i think id take a small bet that you wont beat her  harry i mean to try my best to make her happy  george you old fool ive never known a man who was likely to make a better husband  harry im most awfully in love with her george  george isnt that ripping how old is she  harry only twentytwo shes the loveliest thing you ever saw  george and is she in love with you  harry she says so  george she damned well ought to be  harry i do hope youll like her george  george of course i shall youre not the sort of chap to fall in love with a woman who isnt nice  harry walks up and down for a moment restlessly  harry will you have a whisky and soda  george no thanks  ill wait for tea  harry she ought to be here in a moment suddenly making up his mind its no good beating about the bush i may as well tell you at once herher mother was chinese  george unable to conceal his dismay oh harry a pause i wish i hadnt said all that i did just now  harry of course you didnt know  george gravely i should have had to say something very like it harry but i shouldnt have put it so bluntly  harry you said yourself there were exceptions  george i know distressed wont your people be rather upset  harry i dont see how it can matter to them theyre nine thousand miles away  george who was her father  harry oh he was a merchant hes dead and her mother is too  george thats something i dont think youd much like having a chinese motherinlaw about the place  harry george you wont let it make any difference will you weve known one another all our lives  george my dear old chap as far as im concerned i shouldnt care if you married the first cousin of the ace of spades i dont want you to make a hash of things  harry wait till you see her shes the most fascinating thing you ever met  george yes they can be charming i was awfully in love with a halfwith a eurasian girl myself years ago it was before you came out to the country i wanted to marry her  harry why didnt you  george it was up in chungking id just been appointed viceconsul i was only twentythree the minister wired from peking that id have to resign if i did i hadnt a bob except my salary and they transferred me to canton to get me away  harry its different for you youre in the service and you may be minister one of these days im only a merchant  george even for you therell be difficulties you know has it occurred to you that the white ladies wont be very nice  harry i can do without their society  george you must know some people it means youll have to hobnob with eurasian clerks and their wives im afraid youll find it pretty rotten  harry if youll stick to me i dont care  george i suppose youve absolutely made up your mind  harry absolutely  george in that case ive got nothing more to say you cant expect me not to be a little disappointed but after all the chief thing is your happiness and whatever i can do i will you can put your shirt on that  harry youre a brick george  george the little lady ought to be here oughtnt she  harry i think i hear her on the stairs  he goes to the entrance and then out wu brings in the tea and sets it on the table george walks over to the parapet and looks thoughtfully before him there is a sound of voices in the adjoining room  harry outside come in hes on the verandah  daisy outside one brief look in the glass and then im ready  harry enters  harry shes just coming  george i bet shes powdering her nose  daisy here i am  daisy enters she is an extremely pretty woman beautifully perhaps a little showily dressed she has a pale very clear slightly sallow skin and beautiful dark eyes there is only the very faintest suspicion in them of the chinese slant her hair is abundant and black  harry this is george conway daisy  george stares at her at first he is not quite sure that he recognizes her then suddenly he does but only the slightest movement of the eyes betrays him  daisy how do you do i told harry i had an idea i must have met you somewhere i dont think i have after all  harry george flatters himself hes not easily forgotten  daisy but ive heard so much about you from harry that i feel as though we were old friends  george its very kind of you to say so  harry supposing you poured out the tea daisy  george im dying for a cup  she sits down and proceeds to do so  daisy harry is very anxious that you should like me  harry george and i have known one another since we were kids his people and mine live quite close to one another at home  daisy but im not blaming you im only wondering how i shall ingratiate myself with him  harry he looks rather severe but he isnt really i think youve only got to be your natural charming self  daisy have you told him about the house  harry no to george you know the temple the harrisons used to have weve taken that  george oh its a ripping place but wont you find it rather a nuisance to have those old monks on the top of you all the time  harry oh i dont think so our part is quite separate you know and the harrisons made it very comfortable  harold knox comes in he has changed into tennis things  knox i say harry  he sees daisy oh i beg your pardon  harry mr knoxmrs rathbone  knox gives her a curt nod but she holds out her hand affably he takes it  daisy how do you do  knox im sorry to disturb you harry but old ku faung min is downstairs and wants to see you  harry tell him to go to blazes the office is closed  knox hes going to hankow tonight and he says he must see you before he goes hes got some big order to give  harry oh curse him i know what he is hell keep me talking for half an hour dyou mind if i leave you  daisy of course not itll give me a chance of making mr conways acquaintance  harry ill get rid of him as quickly as i can  he goes out accompanied by knox  knox as he goes goodbye  george looks at daisy for a moment she smiles at him there is a silence  george why didnt you warn me that it was you i was going to meet  daisy i didnt know what youd say about me to harry if you knew  george it was rather a risk wasnt it supposing id blurted out the truth  daisy i trusted to your diplomatic training besides id prepared for it i told him i thought id met you  george harry and i have been pals all our lives i brought him out to china and i got him his job when he had cholera he would have died if i hadnt pulled him through  daisy i know and in return he worships the ground you tread on ive never known one man think so much of another as he does of you  george all thats rot of course sometimes i dont know how im going to live up to the good opinion harry has of me but when youve done so much for a pal as i have for him it gives you an awful sense of responsibility towards him  daisy what do you mean by that  a short pause  george im not going to let you marry him  daisy hes so much in love with me that he doesnt know what to do with himself  george i know he is but if you were in love with him you wouldnt be so sure of it  daisy with a sudden change of tone why not i was sure of your love and god knows i was in love with you  george makes a gesture of dismay he is taken aback for a moment but he quickly recovers  george you dont know what sort of a man harry is hes not like the fellows youve been used to hes never knocked around as most of us do hes always been as straight as a die  daisy i know  george have mercy on him even if there were nothing else against you hes not the sort of chap for you to marry hes awfully english  daisy if he doesnt mind marrying a eurasian i really dont see what business it is of yours  george but you know very well that that isnt the only thing against you  daisy i havent an idea what you mean  george havent you you forget the war when we heard there was a very pretty young woman apparently with plenty of money living at the hong kong hotel on very familiar terms with a lot of naval fellows it became our business to make enquiries i think i know everything there is against you  daisy have you any right to make use of information youve acquired officially  george dont be a fool daisy  daisy passionately tell him then youll break his heart youll make him utterly wretched but hell marry me all the same when a mans as much in love as he is hell forgive everything  george i think its horrible if you loved him you couldnt marry him its heartless  daisy violently how dare you say that you you you know what i am yes its all true i dont know what you know but it cant be worse than the truth and whose fault is it yours if im rotten its you who made me rotten  george i no youve got no right to say that its cruel its infamous  daisy ive touched you at last have i because you know its true dont you remember when i first came to chungking i was seventeen my father had sent me to england to school when i was seven i never saw him for ten years and at last he wrote and said i was to come back to china you came and met me on the boat and told me my father had had a stroke and was dead you took me to the presbyterian mission  george that was my job i was awfully sorry for you  daisy and then in a day or two you came and told me that my father hadnt left anything and what there was went to his relations in england  george naturally he didnt expect to die  daisy passionately if he was going to leave me like that why didnt he let me stay with my chinese mother why did he bring me up like a lady oh it was cruel  george yes it was unpardonable  daisy i was so lonely and so frightened you seemed to be sorry for me you were the only person who was really kind to me you were practically the first man id known i loved you i thought you loved me oh say that you loved me then george  george you know i did  daisy i was very innocent in those days i thought that when two people loved one another they married i wasnt a eurasian then george i was like any other english girl if youd married me i shouldnt be what i am now but they took you away from me you never even said goodbye to me you wrote and told me youd been transferred to canton  george i couldnt say goodbye to you daisy they said that if i married you id have to leave the service i was absolutely penniless they dinned it into my ears that if a white man marries a eurasian hes done for i wouldnt listen to them but in my heart i knew it was true  daisy i dont blame you you wanted to get on and you have havent you youre assistant chinese secretary already and harry says youll be minister before youve done it seems rather hard that i should have had to pay the price  george daisy youll never know what anguish i suffered i cant expect you to care its very natural if you hate me i was ambitious i didnt want to be a failure i knew that it was madness to marry you i had to kill my love i couldnt it was stronger than i was at last i couldnt help myself i made up my mind to chuck everything and take the consequences i was just starting for chungking when i heard you were living in shanghai with a rich chinaman  daisy gives a little moan there is a silence  daisy they hated me at the mission they found fault with me from morning till night they blamed me because you wanted to marry me and they treated me as if i was a designing cat when you went away they heaved a sigh of relief then they started to convert me they thought id better become a school teacher they hated me because i was seventeen they hated me because i was pretty oh the brutes they killed all the religion id got there was only one person who seemed to care if i was alive or dead that was my mother oh i was so ashamed the first time i saw her at school in england id told them so often that she was a chinese princess that i almost believed it myself my mother was a dirty little ugly chinawoman id forgotten all my chinese and i had to talk to her in english she asked me if id like to go to shanghai with her i was ready to do anything in the world to get away from the mission and i thought in shanghai i shouldnt be so far away from you they didnt want me to go but they couldnt keep me against my will when we got to shanghai she sold me to lee tai cheng for two thousand dollars  george how terrible  daisy ive never had a chance oh george isnt it possible for a woman to turn over a new leaf you say that harrys good and kind dont you see what that means to me because hell think me good i shall be good after all he couldnt have fallen in love with me if id been entirely worthless i hate the life ive led i want to go straight i swear ill make him a good wife oh george if you ever loved me have pity on me if harry doesnt marry me im done  george how can a marriage be happy thats founded on a tissue of lies  daisy ive never told harry a single lie  george you told him you hadnt been happily married  daisy that wasnt a lie  george you havent been married at all  daisy with a roguish look well then i havent been happily married have i  george who was this fellow rathbone  daisy he was an american in business at singapore i met him in shanghai i hated lee rathbone asked me to go to singapore with him and i went i lived with him for four years  george then you went back to lee tai cheng  daisy rathbone died there was nothing else to do my mother was always nagging me to go back to him hes rich and she makes a good thing out of it  george i thought she was dead  daisy no i told harry she was because i thought it would make it easier for him  george she isnt with you now is she  daisy no she lives at ichang she doesnt bother me as long as i send her something every month  george why did you tell harry that you were twentytwo its ten years since you came to china and you were seventeen then  daisy with a twinkle in her eye any woman of my age will tell you that seventeen and ten are twentytwo  george does not smile with frowning brow he walks up and down  george oh i wish to god i knew nothing about you i cant bring myself to tell him and yet how can i let him marry you in absolute ignorance oh daisy for your sake as well as for his i beseech you to tell him the whole truth and let him decide for himself  daisy and break his heart theres not a missionary who believes in god as he believes in me if he loses his trust in me he loses everything tell him if you think you must if you have no pity if you have no regret for all the shame and misery you brought on me you you youbut if you do i swear i swear to god that i shall kill myself i wont go back to that hateful life  he looks at her earnestly for a moment  george i dont know if im doing right or wrong i shall tell him nothing  daisy gives a deep sigh of relief harry comes in  harry i say im awfully sorry to have been so long i couldnt get the old blighter to go  daisy with complete selfcontrol if i say youve been an age itll look as though mr conway had been boring me  harry i hope youve made friends  daisy to george have we  george i hope so but now i think i must bolt i have a long chinese document to

buddha the sanctuary can be      closed by huge doors these are now open a flight of steps leads      up to it       a service is finishing the monks are seen on each side of the      altar kneeling in two rows they are clad in grey gowns and their      heads are shaven they sing the invocation to buddha repeating the      same words over and over again in a monotonous chaunt daisy      stands outside the sanctuary door on the steps listlessly      the amah is squatting by her side now the service ends the      monks form a procession and two by two still singing come down      the steps and go out a tiny acolyte blows out the oil lamps and      with an effort shuts the temple doors       daisy comes down the steps and sits on one of the lower ones      she is dreadfully bored  amah

or three times youve asked me to dine ive been engaged  daisy her voice breaking you promised that wed be friends what have i done to turn you against me  george his armour pierced by the emotion in her voice oh daisy dont speak like that  daisy ive tried to do everything i could to please you if theres anything i do that you dont like wont you tell me i promise you i wont do it  george oh my dear child you make me feel such an awful beast  daisy is it the past that you cant forget  george good heavens no what do i care about the past  daisy i have so few friends im so awfully fond of you

of a molehill  daisy you used to be so jolly and we used to laugh together i looked forward so much to your coming here what has changed you  george nothing has changed me  daisy with a passion of despair oh i might as well batter my head against a brick wall how can you be so unkind to me  george for gods sake  he stops heaven knows i dont want to be unkind to you  daisy then why do you treat me as an outcast oh its cruel cruel  george is excessively distressed he walks up and down frowning he cannot bear to look at daisy and he speaks with hesitation  george youll think me an awful rotter daisy but you cant think me more of a rotter than i think myself i dont know how to say it it seems such an awful thing to say im so ashamed of myself i dont suppose two men have ever been greater pals than harry and i hes married to you and hes awfully in love with you and i think youre in love with him i was only twentythree when ifirst knew you its an awful long time ago isnt it there are some wounds that never quite heal you know oh my god dont you understand his embarrassment the distraction of his tone and the way the halting words fall unwillingly from his lips have betrayed the truth to daisy she does not speak she does not stir she looks at him with great shining eyes she hardly dares to breathe if ever you wanted revenge on me youve got it now you must see that its better that i shouldnt come here too often forgive megoodby  he hurries away with averted face daisy stands motionless erect she is almost transfigured she draws a long breath  daisy oh god he loves me  she takes the orchids he has brought her and crushes them to her heart the amah appears  amah you wantchee buy manchu dress daisy  daisy go away  amah velly cheap you look see no likee no buy  daisy impatiently im sick of curiodealers  amah velly pletty manchu dresses  she draws aside a little and allows a man with a large bundle wrapped up in a blue cotton cloth to come in he is a chinese he is dressed in a long black robe and a round black cap it is lee tai cheng he is big and rather stout from his smooth and yellow face his black eyes gleam craftily he lays his bundle on the ground and unties it showing a pile of gorgeous manchu dresses daisy has taken no notice of him suddenly she sees that a man with his back turned to her is there  daisy to the amah i told you i wouldnt see the man send him away at once  lee tai turning round with a sly smile you look see no likee no buy  daisy with a start of surprise and dismay lee  lee tai coming forward coolly good afternoon daisy  daisy recovering herself its lucky for you im in a good temper or id have you thrown out by the boys what have you brought this junk for  lee tai a curiodealer can come and go and no one wonders  amah lee tai velly clever man  daisy give me that chain the amah takes it out of her sleeve and gives it to her daisy flings it contemptuously at lee tais feet take it pack up your things and go if you ever dare to show your face here again ill tell my husband  lee tai with a chuckle what will you tell him dont you be a silly girl daisy  daisy what do you want  lee tai coolly you  daisy dont you know that i loathe you you disgust me  lee tai what do i care perhaps if you loved me i shouldnt want you your hatred is like a sharp and bitter sauce that tickles my appetite  daisy you beast  lee tai i like the horror that makes your body tremble when i hold you in my arms and sometimes the horror turns on a sudden into a wild tempest of passion  daisy you liar  lee tai leave this stupid white man what is he to you  daisy he is my husband  lee tai it is a year today since you were married what has marriage done for you you thought when you married a white man youd become a white woman do you think they can look at you and forget how many white women do you know how many friends have you got youre a prisoner ill take you to singapore or calcutta dont you want to amuse yourself do you want to go to europe ill take you to paris ill give you more money to spend in a week than your husband earns in a year  daisy im very comfortable in peking thank you  lee tai snapping his fingers you dont care that for your husband he loves you you despise him dont you wish with all your heart that you hadnt married him  amah he very silly white man he no likee daisys old amah perhaps one day he blong sick daisy cry velly much if he die  daisy impatiently dont be such a fool  amah perhaps one day he drink whisky soda oh velly ill velly ill whats the matter with me no sabe no can stand doctor no sabe then die hi hi  daisy you silly old woman harrys not a chinaman and he wouldnt call in a chinese doctor  lee tai with a smile china is a very old and a highly civilized country daisy when anyone is in your way its not very difficult to get rid of him  daisy scornfully and do you think id let poor harry be murdered so that i might be free to listen to your generous proposals you must think im a fool if you expect me to risk my neck for that  lee tai you dont take any risk daisy you know nothing  amah lee tai velly clever man daisy  daisy i thought so once lee tai youre a damned fool get out  lee tai freedom is a very good thing daisy  daisy what should i do with it  lee tai wouldnt you like to be free now she looks at him sharply she wonders if it can possibly be that he suspects her passion for george conway he meets her glance steadily one day sen shi ming was sitting with his wife looking at a tang bronze that he had just bought when he heard someone in the street crying for help sen shi was a very brave man and he snatched up a revolver and ran out sen shi forgot that he had cheated his brother out of a house in hatamen street or he would have been more prudent sen shi was found by the watchman an hour later with a dagger in his heart who killed cockrobin  amah hi hi sen shi velly silly man  lee tai his brother knew that they had grown up together if i heard cries for help outside my house late in the night i should ask myself who had a grudge against me and i should make sure the door was bolted but white men are very brave white men dont know the chinese customs would you be very sorry if an accident happened to your excellent husband  daisy i wonder what you take me for  lee tai why do you pretend to me daisy do you think i dont know you  daisy the door is a little on the left of you lee tai would you give yourself the trouble of walking through it  lee tai with a smile i go but i come back perhaps youll change your mind  he ties up his bundle and is about to go harry enters  daisy oh harry youre back very soon  harry yes the pony went lame fortunately i hadnt gone far before i noticed it whos this  daisy its a curiodealer he has nothing i

with a laugh i couldnt give you a greater proof of my affection than consenting to have that old woman around all the time  daisy i dont know why you dislike her shes devoted to me  harry thats the only reason i put up with her she gives me the creeps i have the impression that she watches every movement i make  daisy oh what nonsense  harry and ive caught her eavesdropping  daisy was it amah that you wanted to talk to me about  harry no ive got something to tell you how would you like to leave peking  daisy with a start suddenly off her guard not at all  harry im afraid its awfully dull for you here darling  daisy i dont find it so  harry youre so dear and sweet are you sure you dont say that on my account  daisy im very fond of peking  harry weve been married a year now i dont want to hurt your feelings darling but its no good beating about the bush and i think its better to be frank  daisy surely you can say anything you like to me without hesitation  harry things have been a little awkward in a way the women i used to know before we married left cards on you  daisy having taken the precaution to discover that i should be out  harry and you returned those cards and that was the end of it i asked george what he thought about my taking you to the club to play tennis and he said he thought wed better not risk it the result is that you dont know a soul  daisy have i complained  harry youve been most awfully decent about it but i hate to think of your spending day after day entirely by yourself it cant be good for you to be so much alone  daisy i might have known mrs chuan shes a white woman  harry oh my dear she washeaven knows what she was shes married to a chinaman its horrible shes outside the pale  daisy and theres bertha raymond shes very nice even though she is a eurasian  harry im sure shes very nice but we couldnt very well have the raymonds here and refuse to go to them her brother is one of the clerks in my office i dont want to seem an awful snob  daisy you neednt hesitate to say anything about the eurasians you cant hate and despise them more than i do  harry i dont hate and despise them i think thats odious but sometimes theyre not very tactful i dont know that i much want one of my clerks to come and slap me on the back in the office and call me old chap  daisy of course not  harry the fact is weve been trying to do an impossible thing its no good kicking against the pricks what with the legations and one thing and another pekings hopeless wed far better clear out  daisy but if i dont mind why should you  harry well its not very nice for me either its for my sake just as much as for yours that id be glad to go elsewhere of course everybody at the club knows im married some of them ignore it altogether i dont mind that so much some of them ask after you with an exaggerated cordiality which is rather offensive and every now and then some fool begins to slang the eurasians and everybody kicks him under the table then he remembers about me and goes scarlet by god its hell  daisy sulkily i dont want to leave peking im very happy here  harry well darling ive applied for a transfer  daisy with sudden indignation without saying a word to me  harry i thought youd be glad i didnt want to say anything till it was settled  daisy do you think i am a child to have everything arranged for me without a word trying to control herself after all youd never see george surely you dont want to lose sight of your only real friend  harry ive talked it over with george and he thinks its the best thing to do  daisy did he advise you to go  harry strongly  daisy violently i wont do it i wont leave peking  harry why should his advice make the difference  daisy why she is confused for a moment but quickly recovers herself i wont let george conwayor anybody elsedecide where im to go  harry dont be unreasonable darling  daisy i wont go i tell you i wont go  harry well im afraid you must now its all settled the transfer is decided  daisy bursting into tears oh harry dont take me away from here i cant bear it i want to stay here  harry oh darling how can you be so silly youll have a much better time at one of the

daisy frightened what for  amah if buddha say yes i talk with lee tai if buddha say no i do nothing then you go to chungking and you never see george any more       the amah goes up the temple steps and flings open the great      doors daisy watches her with an agony of horror expectation      and dread the amah lights some josssticks on the altar and      strikes a deeptoned gong harry comes in followed by lee tai      with his bundle  harry anxious to make his peace daisy i found this fellow hanging about in the courtyard i thought id like to buy you a manchu dress that hes got  daisy after

has an ironical glint in his eyes      meanwhile the amah has been bowing before the altar she goes      down on her knees and knocks her head on the ground  harry what in gods name is amah doing  daisy shes asking buddha a question  harry what question  daisy with a shadow of a smile how should i know  harry whats the idea  daisy havent you ever seen the chinese do it you see those pieces of wood shes holding in her hands shes holding them out to the buddha so that he may see them and shes telling him that he must answer the question meanwhile the amah muttering in a low tone is seen doing what daisy describes the buddha smells the incense of the burning josssticks and hes pleased and he listens to what she says  harry smiling dont be so absurd daisy one might almost think you believed all this nonsense why youre quite pale  daisy then she gets up the pieces of wood are flat on one side and round on the other shell lift them above her head and shell drop them in front of the buddha if they fall with the round side uppermost it means yes daisy has been growing more and more excited as the ceremony proceeds now the amah steps back a little and she raises her arms daisy gives a shriek and starts to run forward no no stop  harry instinctively seizing her arms daisy       at the same moment the amah has let the pieces of wood fall      she looks at them for an instant and then turns round  amah buddha talkee can do  daisy to harry why did you stop me  harry daisy how can you be so superstitious what is the result  daisy amah asked buddha a question and the answer is yes she puts her hand to her heart for an instant then looking at harry she smiles im sorry i was silly and unreasonable just now harry  end of scene iii     scene iv        the sittingroom in the

manchu dress take those things away to harry would you like to have a game of chess  harry very much ill get the men       daisy goes to the gramophone and turns on a chinese tune it is      strange and exotic its monotony exacerbates the nerves harry      gets the chessboard and sets up the pieces they sit down opposite      one another the amah has disappeared with the discarded dress  harry

 street daisy gives a little gasp  harry hulloa whats that  daisy oh its nothing its only some chinese quarrelling       two or three shouts are heard and then an agonised cry of help      help harry

of the monks at the evening service the amah having finished her devotions stands at the doorway looking out steadily daisy stares straight in front of her suddenly there is a loud booming of a gong daisy starts up whats that  amah be quiet daisy be careful       the door of the courtyard is flung open harry comes in      through the courtyard into the room pushing before him a coolie      whom

out a crowd of people surge through the great      open doorway of the courtyard they are monks of the temple      attracted to the street by the quick rumour of accident coolies      and the night watchman with his rattle some of them bear chinese      lanterns some hurricane lamps the crowd separates out as they      approach the room and then it is seen that three men are bearing      what seems to be the body of a man  daisy whats that  amah i think belong foreign man the men bring in the body and lay it on the sofa the head and part of the chest are covered with a piece of blue cotton daisy and the amah look at it with dismay they dare not approach the abbot drives the crowd out of the room and shuts the doors only leaving that side of one open at which the prisoner is attached the amah turns on the god in the niche you say can do what for you make mistake       she seizes a fan which is on the table under her hand and with      angry violence hits the image on the face two or three times      daisy has been staring at the body she goes up to it softly and      lifts the cloth slightly she gives a start and with a quick      gesture snatches it away she sees george conway  daisy george she opens her mouth to shriek  amah sh take care harry hear  daisy what have you done  amah i do nothing buddha he makee mistake  daisy you fiend  amah how do i know daisy i no can tell

the amah seizes her opportunity she cuts the rope      which binds the prisoner as soon as he is free he steps out into      the darkness the amah watches for a moment and then cries out  amah help

there is no mystery only i cant bear the idea that my old amah should go to prison shes been almost a mother to me for so many years       there is a pause harry looks from daisy to the amah  harry to

takes      her pipe and lights it   end of scene iv     scene v   the courtyard in the andersons part of the temple       at the back is the outer wall raised by two or three steps from      the ground from the top of the wall projects a shallow roof of      yellow tiles supported by wooden pillars painted red shabby and      rather weatherworn and this roof is raised in the middle of the      wall where there is a huge wooden gateway when this is opened the      street is seen and on the other side of it a high blank white      wall the courtyard is paved with great flags on each side of it      are living rooms       there is a long rattan chair a round table and a couple of      armchairs george is lying on the long chair looking at an      illustrated paper and the amah is seated on the ground smoking      her waterpipe  george with a smile putting down the paper youre not as chatty as usual this afternoon amah  amah suppose i got nothing to talk about i no talk  george you are an example to your sex amah your price is above rubies  amah no likee rubies velly much no can sell velly much money  george in point of fact i wasnt thinking of giving you rubies even reconstructed but if i did i cant think youd be so indelicate as to sell them  amah i no think you velly funny man  george i was afraid you didnt would you think it funny if i sat on my hat  amah yes i laugh then hi hi  george the inscrutable heart of china expands to the selfsame joke that convulses a duchess in london and a financier in new york  amah you more better read the paper  george wheres missy  amah i think she in her room you wanchee  george no  amah i think she come by and by  george looking at his watch mr anderson ought to be back from the office soon there is a loud knocking at the door hulloa whos that       a servant comes out of the house and going to the gateway      withdraws the bolt  amah i think doctor come see you maybe  george oh no hes not coming today he said hed look in tomorrow before i started       the amah gets up and looks at the doorway of which now the      servant has opened one side harold knox and his sister sylvia      are seen  knox may we come in  george good man of course       they come towards george sylvia is a very pretty simple      healthy and attractive girl she is dressed in a light summer      frock there is in her gait and manner something so springlike and      fresh that it is a pleasure to look at her  knox ive brought my young sister along with me as george rises to his feet dont get up you neednt put on any frills for a chit like that  george nonsense im perfectly well shaking hands with sylvia how dyou do my name is conway   knox i only omitted to inform her of that fact because she already knew it  sylvia strangely enough that happens to be true but i wish youd lie down again  george im sick of lying down the doctor says im perfectly all right im going home tomorrow   knox catching sight of the amah hulloa sweetheart i didnt see you sylvia i want you to know the only woman ive ever loved  george smiling this is mrs andersons amah  sylvia with a little friendly nod how do you do  amah all in a breath velly well thank you how do you do velly well thank you  you mr knox sister  sylvia yes  amah you missionary lady  sylvia no  amah what for you come china then  sylvia i came to see my brother  amah how old are you  knox be truthful sylvia  sylvia im twentytwo  amah how many children you got  sylvia im not married  amah what for you no married if you twentytwo  sylvia it does need an explanation doesnt it the truth is that nobodys asked me  knox what a lie  amah you come china catchee husband  sylvia certainly not  amah you christian  sylvia not a very good one im afraid  amah who baptized you  sylvia well you know its an awfully long time ago i forget  knox shes like me amah shes a presbyterian  amah you go to hell then only seventh day adventists no go to hell  sylvia itll be rather crowded then im afraid  amah you only baptized once  sylvia so far as i know  amah i baptized one two three four five times i velly christian woman  knox i say old man i dont want to dash your fond hopes but in point of fact we didnt come here to see you  george why not surely miss knox must want to see the principal sights of peking  knox the man is not a raving lunatic sylvia his only delusion is that hes a humourist  sylvia thought shed like to call on mrs harry  george im sure daisy will be very glad amah go and tell missy that theres a lady  amah can do  exit  knox i say have they caught any of those blighters who tried to kill you  george no not a chance they werent after me you know they were after harry  knox is there anyone who has a grudge against him  george i dont think so he doesnt seem very keen on discussing the incident  daisy comes in  knox here she is ive brought my sister to see you mrs harry  daisy shaking hands how do you do  sylvia what a wonderful place you live in  daisy its rather attractive isnt it you must see the temple before you go  sylvia id love to  daisy do sit down to knox what do you think of my patient  knox i think hes a fraud i never saw anyone look so robust  daisy delighted hes made a wonderful recovery  george thanks to you daisy you cant think how she nursed me  knox it was rather a narrow escape wasnt it  daisy for two days we thought he might die at any minute it wasit was rather dreadful  george and do you know all that time she never left me a minute to daisy i dont know how i can ever thank you  daisy oh well harry had his work i didnt think he ought to be robbed of his nights rest for a worthless creature like you and i hated the idea of a paid nurse looking after you  sylvia you must have been worn out at the end of it  daisy no im as strong as a horse and it was such a relief to me when the doctor said he was out of danger i forgot i was tired  knox i dont know why you bothered about him there are such a lot of fellows who want his job and they all know they could do it much better than he can  george everyones been so extraordinarily good to me i had no idea there was so much kindness in the world  daisy to sylvia very pleasantly will you come and look at the temple now while theyre bringing tea  sylvia yes id like to very much  daisy i think youll enjoy your tea more if you feel youve done the sight  sylvia its all so new to me everything interests me ive fallen passionately in love with peking  they wander off talking gaily  george harold youre a very nice boy  knox thats what the girls tell me but i dont know why you should  george i think it was rather sporting of you to bring your sister to see daisy  knox i dont deserve any credit for that she insisted on coming  george oh  knox she met harry at the club and took rather a fancy to him when i told her daisy was a halfcaste and people didnt bother much about her she got right up on her hind legs i told her shed only just come out to china and didnt know what she was talking about and then she gave me what she called a bit of her mind i was obliged to remark that if that was a bit i didnt much care about knowing the rest  george it sounds as though youd had a little tiff  knox she said she had no patience with the airs people gave themselves in the east a eurasian was just as good as anybody else and when i happened to say i was coming here today to see how you were she said shed come too  george its very kind of her daisy leads a dreadfully lonely life it would mean so much to her if she knew one or two white women if they take to one another you wont try to crab it will you i fancy daisy wants a friend rather badly  knox i shouldnt like it very much you know would you much care for your sister to be very pally with a halfcaste  george daisy is one in a thousand you cant think what shes done for me during my illness my mother couldnt have taken more care of me  knox theyre often very goodhearted but as a matter of fact nothing i can say will have the least effect on sylvia girls have changed a lot since the war if she wants to do a thing and she thinks it right shell do it and if i try to interfere shes quite capable of telling me to go to the devil  george she seems to be a young woman of some character  knox perhaps because shes had rather a rough time the fellow she was engaged to was killed in the war and she was awfully cut up she drove an ambulance for the last two years and then she went up to girton after that my father thought shed better come out here for a bit  george she ought to like it  knox if she doesnt put up peoples backs too much she cant stand anything like injustice or cruelty if she thinks people are unkind to daisy or sniffy about her shell stick to her like a leech however i daresay shell get married  george smiling thatll learn her  knox why dont you marry her its about time you settled down  george with a chuckle you fool  knox why youre by way of being rather eligible arent you  george i dont know why you want to get rid of her she seems a very nice sister  knox of course i love having her with me but she does cramp my style a bit and she ought to marry shed make you a firstrate wife  george much too good for the likes of me  knox of course shes a bit independent but one has to put up with that in girls nowadays and shes as good as gold  george one can see that at a mile my son  knox i say who was rathbone daisys first husband do you know  george his face a blank harry told me he was an american he said he was in business in the f m s  knox thats what harry told me i met a fellow the other day who lives in singapore who told me hed never heard of rathbone  george chaffing him perhaps he didnt move in the exalted circles that a friend of yours would naturally move in  knox i suppose there was a mr rathbone       there is a distant sound in the street of chinese instruments      being played  george hulloa theres the procession coming along  knox what procession  george its a manchu wedding the amah was talking about it this morning  knox i must call sylvia shed love to see it sylvia       daisy and sylvia come out of the house just as he calls  sylvia dont shout harold  knox come along and have your education improved a manchu wedding is just going to pass by  sylvia oh good lets go out into the street  daisy you can see it just as well from here ill have the doors opened boy open the gate  knox yes thats the ticket we shall see it better from here       wu during the last few speeches has appeared with the tea which      he sets down on the table on receiving daisys order he goes to      the doorway and draws the bolt he pulls back one heavy door while      knox pulls back the other the empty street is seen the music      grows louder now the procession comes gay brilliant and      barbaric against the white wall of the street first men on      horseback then buddhist monks in gray with their shaven heads      then the band playing wild discordant music after them passes a      long string of retainers in red with strange shaped hats then      come retainers bearing in open palanquins great masses of cardboard      fruits and all manner of foodstuffs silver vessels and gold these      are followed by two or three youths on horseback gorgeously      dressed and these again by the palanquin carved and richly      painted and gilt of the bride then pass more priests and another      band and finally a last string of retainers in red when the last      one has disappeared a beggar shows himself at the open doorway he      is excessively thin and he has a bush of long bristly hair he is      clothed in pale rags torn and patched his legs and feet are bare      he puts out a bony hand and breaks into a long highpitched      whine  knox oh lord get out  daisy oh no please harold give him a copper or two  george daisy never lets a beggar go away without something  daisy its not because im charitable im afraid theyll bring me bad luck  knox taking a coin from his pocket here you are clarence now buzz off       the beggar takes his dole and saunters away wu closes the      doors  sylvia enthusiastically i am glad i saw that  daisy youll get very tired of that sort of thing before youve been here long now lets have tea  sylvia oh i dont think well

stopfort do you know her  daisy i know who you mean  sylvia i think people are being absolutely beastly to her it simply makes my blood boil  daisy oh how  sylvia well you know that her husbands a drunken brute whos treated her abominably for years at last she fell in love with a man and now her husband is going to divorce her its monstrous that he should be able to  daisy are the ladies of peking giving her the cold shoulder  knox the cold shoulder hardly describes it the frozen silverside  george i think shes well rid of reggie stopfort at any price but im sorry the other party is andr√© leroux  sylvia why she introduced me to him i thought he was a very nice fellow  george well you see if hed been english or american he would have married her as a matter of course  sylvia so i should hope  daisy because she was divorced on his account you mean  george yes but the french havent our feeling on that matter im not quite sure if andr√© will be willing to marry her  sylvia oh that would be dreadful under those circumstances the man must marry the woman he simply must  george of course  knox come along sylvia we wont discuss womens rights now  sylvia giving daisy her hand very cordially and if theres anything i hate its people who say theyre going and then dont go goodbye mrs anderson  daisy its been very nice to see you  sylvia i do hope youll come and see me soon im

you very much goodbye       knox and sylvia go out daisy has walked with them towards      the doorway and now returns to george  george what a very nice girl daisy  daisy she seems to make a specialty of speckled peaches first me and then mrs stopfort  george i was hoping youd like her  daisy its hardly probable shes everything that im not she has everything that i havent no i dont like her but id give anything in the world to be her  george smiling i dont think you need envy her  daisy dont you think shes pretty  george yes very but youre so much more than pretty i expect you have more brains in your little finger than she has in her whole body  daisy gravely she has something that i havent got george and id give my soul to have  george embarrassed i dont know what you mean changing the conversation abruptly daisy now that im going away  daisy interrupting are you really going tomorrow  george breezily im quite well im ashamed to have stayed so long  daisy i dont look forward very much to the long empty days when youre no longer here  george seriously i must go daisy i really must  daisy after a moments pause what were you going to say to me dont thank me for anything i may have done its given me a happiness i never knew before  george except for you i should have died and when i think of the past i am ashamed  daisy what does the past matter the past is dead and gone  george and im ashamed when i think how patient you were when i was irritable how kind and thoughtful i hardly knew i wanted a thing before you gave it to me sometimes when i felt i couldnt breathe the tenderness of your hand on my foreheadoh it was like a dip in a highland stream on a summer day i think i never knew that there was in you the most precious thing that anyone can have goodness oh daisy it makes me feel so humble  daisy goodness with the shadow of a laugh oh george  george its because harry is better and simpler than i am that he was able to see it in you he felt it in you always and he was right  the amah comes in  daisy sharply what dyou want       the amah crosses from one to the other and a thin smile crosses      her eyes  amah master telephone daisy  daisy why didnt you take the message  she is about to go into the house  amah he have go now he say very much hurry i say no can findee you i think you go out  daisy why did you say that  amah i think more better maybe  george smiling thats right amah never tell the truth when a lie will do as well  daisy well what was the message  amah master say he must to go tientsin very important business no come back tonight come back first train tomorrow  daisy very well tell the boy that we shall be only two to dinner  amah i go talkee he  exit  george urbanely i say i dont want to be an awful trouble to you i think id better go back to my own place tonight  daisy looking at him why should you do that  george i was going tomorrow anyway  daisy do you think my reputation is such a sensitive flower  george lightly of course not but people arent very charitable it seems rather funny i should stay here when harrys away  daisy what do you suppose i care if people gossip  george i care for you  daisy with a smile almost archly its not very flattering to me that you should insist on going the moment harry does do i bore you so much as all that  george with a chuckle how can you talk such nonsense i havent wanted to get well too quickly ive so enjoyed sitting quietly here while you read or sewed ive got so much in the habit of seeing you about me that if i dont go at once i shall never be able to bring myself to go at all  daisy since that horrible accident ive been rather nervous at the thought of sleeping here by myself im terrified at the thought of being left alone tonight  george come in with me then the knoxes will be delighted to put you up for the night  daisy with a sudden change of manner i dont want you to go george i want you to stay  george as serious as she is daisy dont be too hard on me you dont know you dont know with an effort he regains his selfcontrol and returns to his easy chaffing tone dont forget its not only a wound in the lung that ive been suffering from while you and the doctor between you have been patching that up ive been busy sticking together the pieces of a broken heart its nicely set now no one could tell that thered ever been anything wrong with it but i dont think it would be very wise to give it a sudden jolt or jerk  daisy in a low quivering voice why do you say things like that what is the good of making pretences  george determined to keep the note of lightness it was very silly of me to bother you with my little troubles it was very hot i was overworked and nervous at the time or i shouldnt have made so much of it im sure that youll be as pleased as i am to know that im making a very good recovery thank you  daisy as though asking a casual question you dont care for me any more  george i have the greatest affection for you i admire you and of course im grateful to you but if i thought i was in love with you i was mistaken  daisy do you know why i wouldnt have a professional nurse and when you were unconscious for two days refused to leave you for a minute do you know why afterwards at night when you grew delirious i wouldnt let harry watch you i said it would interfere with his work i dared not leave you for a single moment and it was your secret and mine i wouldnt let anybody in the world share it with me do you know what you said in your delirium  george disturbed i expect i talked an awful lot of rot people always do i believe  daisy passionately you used to call me daisy daisy as though your heart was breaking and when i leaned over you and said im here you would take my face in your hands so that i could hardly believe you werent conscious and you said i love you  george oh god  daisy and sometimes i didnt know how to calm you you were frantic because you thought they were taking me away from you i cant bear it you said i shall die i had to put my hands over your mouth so that no one should hear  george i didnt know what i was saying i wasnt myself it was just the madness of the fever  daisy and sometimes you were so exquisitely tender your voice was soft and caressing and you called me by sweet names so that the tears ran down my cheeks you thought you held me in your arms and you pressed me to your heart you were happy then you were so happy that i was afraid youd die of it i know what love is and you love me  george for gods sake stop why do you torture me  daisy and then you were madly jealous you hated harry i think you could have killed him  george thats not true thats infamous never never  daisy oh you can say that with your lips sometimes you thought he put his arms round me and kissed me and you sobbed aloud oh it was so painful i forgot that you were unconscious and i took your hands and said hes not here you and i are alone alone alone and sometimes i think you understood you fell back and a look of peace came on your face as if you were in heaven and you saiddo you know what you said you said beloved beloved beloved       her voice breaks and the tears course down her cheeks george      is shattered by what she has told him  george i suppose there are few of us that wouldnt turn away from ourselves in horror if the innermost thoughts of our heart the thoughts were only conscious of to hate were laid bare but that shameful thing that showed itself in me isnt me i disown it  daisy i thought you had more courage i thought you had more sense do you call that you a few conventional prejudices the real you is the love that consumes you more hotly than ever the fever did the only you is the you that loves me the rest is only frills its a domino that you put on at a masked ball  george you dont know what you say frills its honour and duty and decency its everything that makes it possible for me to cling to the shadow of my selfrespect  daisy oh all that means nothing you fool you might as well try with your bare hands to stop the flow of the yangtze  george if i perish i perish oh of course i love you all night im tortured with love and tortured with jealousy but the day does come at last and then i can get hold of myself again my love is some horrible thing gnawing at my heartstrings i hate it and despise it but i can fight it fight it all the time oh ive been here too long i ought to have got back to work long ago work is my only chance daisy i beseech you to let me go  daisy how can i let you go i love you  george thunderstruck you impatiently with a shrug of the shoulders oh youre talking nonsense  daisy why do you suppose ive said all these things do you think a woman cares twopence for a mans love when she doesnt love him  george oh its impossible you dont know what youre saying i know how good and kind you are youve been touched by my love you mistake pity for love  daisy im not good and im not kind theres no room in my soul for pity in my soul theres only a raging hunger if i know what you feel its because i feel it too i love you i love you i love you  george and harry  daisy what do i care about harry i hate him because hes stood between me and you  george he is your husband he is my friend  daisy he doesnt exist ive loved you always from the first day i saw you the others were nothing to me lee tai and harry and the rest ive loved you always ive never loved anyone but you all these years ive kept the letters you wrote to me ive read them till i know every word by heart theyre all blurred and smudged with the tears ive wept over them they were all i had do you think im going to let you go now all my pain all my anguish are nothing any more i love you and you love me  george oh dont dont  daisy you cant leave me now if you leave me i shall kill myself  george i must go away i must never see you again whatever happens we must never meet  daisy exasperated and impatient thats impossible what will you say to harry  george if need be ill tell him the truth  daisy what difference will that make will you love me any the less yes tell him tell him that i love you and you only and that i belong to you and to you only  george oh daisy for gods sake try and control yourself we must do our duty we must we must  daisy i know no duty i only know love theres no room in my soul for anything else you say that love is like a wild beast gnawing at your entrails my love is a liberator its freed me from a hateful past its freed me from harry theres nothing in the world now but you and me and the love that joins us i want you i want you  george dont dont oh this is madness theres only one thing to be done god give me strength daisy you know i love you i love you with all my heart and soul but its goodbye ill never see you again never never so help me god  daisy how can you be so cruel youre heartless ive wanted you all these years ive hungered for you you dont know what my humiliation has been pity me because i loved you if you leave me now i shall die you open the doors of heaven to me and then you slam them in my face havent you made me unhappy enough youd have done better to kill me ten years ago you trampled me in the mud and then you left me oh what shall i do she sinks down to the ground weeping as though her heart would break george looks at her for a minute his face distorted with agony he clenches his hands in the violence of his effort to control himself he takes his hat and walks slowly towards the gate he withdraws the bolt that holds it when daisy hears the sound of this she starts to her feet and staggers towards him george no no not yet       she staggers and with a cry falls headlong she has fainted  george rushing towards her daisy daisy he kneels down and takes her head in his hands he is fearfully agitated oh my darling what is it oh my god daisy speak to me calling amah amah daisy slowly opens her eyes oh my beloved i thought you were dead  daisy lift me up  george you cant stand       he raises her to her feet so that when she is erect she is in his      arms she puts her arms round his neck  daisy dont leave me  george my precious my beloved       she turns her face to him offering her lips and he bends his      head and kisses her she closes her eyes in ecstasy  daisy take me in i feel so ill  george ill carry you       he lifts her up and carries her into the house from the opposite      side the amah appears she goes to the gateway and slips the bolt      forward into position then she comes to the teatable sits down      and takes a scone  amah hi hi       she bites the scone and chews placidly on her face is a smirk of      irony   end of scene v     scene vi   a small room in a

must all have one she distributes them and they all blow them up there it the sound of scratching at the door whos that i wonder  amah if you say come in perhaps you see  daisy open the door you old silly she begins to blow up the balloon again the amah goes to the door and opens it lee tai steps in lee tai send these away the amah makes a sign to the old chinaman he gives each child a hand and with their presents they go out the amah slips out after them i thought you were dead  lee tai im very much alive thank you  daisy ah well well hope for the best  lee tai i trust youre not displeased to see me  daisy gaily if youd come yesterday i should certainly have smacked your face but today im in such a good humour that even the sight of you is tolerable  lee tai you werent here yesterday       the amah comes in carrying on a little wooden tray two chinese      bowls and a teapot  daisy my dear mamma seems to think youve come to pay me a visit you mustnt let me keep you too long  lee tai you are expecting someone i know  the amah goes out  daisy chaffing him i always said you had a brain  lee tai no better a one than yours daisy it was a clever trick when you got me to try to put your husband out of the way so that you should be free for george conway  daisy it was nothing to do with me i told you id have nothing to do with it you made a hash of it one can forgive the good for being stupid but when rascals are fools theres no excuse  lee tai the best laid schemes of mice and men as my favourite poet robert burns so elegantly puts it gang aft agley  daisy i dont care a damn about your favourite poet what have you come here for today  lee tai as it turns out i do not see that there is any cause for regret that george conway got the knife thrust that was intended for your husband i wish it had gone a little deeper  daisy coolly as it turns out you only did me a service but still you havent told me to what i owe the honour of your visit  lee tai civility i like to be on friendly terms with my tenants  daisy surprised your what  lee tai urbanely this happens to be my house when i discovered that your honourable mother had taken the rooms in this courtyard so that you might have a place where george conway and you could safely meet i thought i would buy the whole house  daisy i hope it was a good investment  lee tai otherwise perhaps i should have hesitated it was clever of you to find so convenient a place with a curio shop in front into which anyone can be seen going without remark and an illlit passage leading to this court it is perfect  daisy what is the idea  lee tai with a twinkle in his eyes are you a little frightened  daisy not a bit what can you do you can tell harry tell him  lee tai affably george conway would be ruined  daisy with a shrug hed lose his job perhaps you would give him another youre mixed up in so many concerns you could surely find use for a white man who speaks chinese as well as george does  lee tai i find even your shamelessness attractive  daisy im profoundly grateful for the compliment  lee tai but do not fear i shall do nothing i bought this house because i like you to know that always always you are in my hand where you go i go where you are i am sometimes you do not see me but nevertheless i am close i do nothing i am content to wait  daisy your time is your own i have no objection to your wasting it  lee tai one day and i think that day is not very far distant you will come to me i was the first and i shall be the last if you like i will marry you  daisy with a smile i thought you had two if not three wives already i fancy that number four would have rather a thin time  lee tai my wife can be divorced i am willing to marry you before the british consul we will go to penang i have a house there you shall have motor cars  daisy its astonishing how easy it is to resist temptations that dont tempt you  lee tai sneer what do i care i wait what have you to do with white men you are not a white woman what power has this blood of your fathers when it is mingled with the tumultuous stream which you have inherited through your mother from innumerable generations our race is very pure and very strong strange nations have overrun us but in a little while we have absorbed them so that no trace of a foreign people is left in us china is like the yangtze which is fed by five hundred streams and yet remains unchanged the river of golden sand majestic turbulent indifferent and everlasting what power have you to swim against that mighty current you can wear european clothes and eat european food but in your heart you are a chinawoman are your passions the weak and vacillating passions of the white man there is in your heart a simplicity which the white man can never fathom and a deviousness which he can never understand your soul is like a rice patch cleared in the middle of the jungle all around the jungle hovers watchful and jealous and it is only by ceaseless labour that you can prevent its inroads one day your labour will be vain and the jungle will take back its own china is closing in on you  daisy my poor lee tai youre talking perfect nonsense  lee tai youre restless and unhappy and dissatisfied because youre struggling against instincts which were implanted in your breast when the white man was a hungry naked savage one day you will surrender you will cast off the white woman like an outworn garment you will come back to china as a tired child comes back to his mother and in the immemorial usages of our great race you will find peace       there is a moments silence daisy passes her hand over her      forehead against her will she is strangely impressed by what lee      tai has said she gives a little shudder and recovers herself  daisy george conway loves me and i oh  lee tai the white mans love lasts no longer than a summer day it is a red red rose now it flaunts its scented beauty proudly in the sun and tomorrow its petals wrinkled and stinking lie scattered on the ground  there is a sound of a footstep in the courtyard outside  daisy here he is go quickly       george opens the door and stops as he catches sight of lee tai  george hulloa whos this       lee tai steps forward smiling and obsequious  lee tai i am the owner of this house the amah complained that the roof leaked and i came to see for myself  george frowning its of no consequence please dont bother about it  lee tai i wish i neednt the amah has a virulent and active tonguei am afraid she will give me no peace till i have satisfied her outrageous demands  george you speak extraordinarily good english  lee tai i am a graduate of the university of edinburgh  daisy robert burns is his favourite poet  lee tai i spent a year at oxford and another at harvard i can express myself in english not without fluency  george let me compliment you on your good sense in retaining your national costume i think it a pity that the returned students should insist on wearing ugly tweed suits and billycock hats  lee tai i spent eight years abroad i brought back with me no more admiration for western dress than for western civilization  george that is very interesting  lee tai you are pleased to be sarcastic  george and you i think are somewhat supercilious believe me the time has passed when the mandarins of your country in their impenetrable selfconceit could put up a barrier against the advance of civilization if you have any love for china you must see that her only chance to take her rightful place in the world is to accept honestly and sincerely the teaching of the west  lee tai and if in our hearts we despise and detest what you have to teach us for what reason are you so confident that you are so superior to us that it behooves us to sit humbly at your feet have you excelled us in arts or letters have our thinkers been less profound than yours has our civilization been less elaborate less complicated less refined than yours why when you lived in caves and clothed yourselves with skins we were a cultured people do you know that we tried an experiment which is unique in the world  george goodnaturedly what experiment is that  lee tai we sought to rule this great people not by force but by wisdom and for centuries we succeeded then why does the white man despise the yellow shall i tell you  george do  lee tai with a smiling contempt because he has invented the machinegun that is your superiority we are a defenceless horde and you can blow us into eternity with a tinge of sadness you have shattered the dream of our philosophers that the world could be governed by the power of law and order and now you are teaching our young men your secret you have thrust your hideous inventions upon us fools do you not know that we have a genius for mechanics do you not know that there are in this country four hundred millions of the most practical and industrious people in the world do you think it will take us long to learn and what will become of your superiority when the yellow man can make as good guns as the white and fire them as straight you have appealed to the machinegun and by the machinegun shall you be judged       there is a pause suddenly george gives lee tai a      scrutinizing glance  george what is your name  lee tai with a thin amused smile lee tai cheng  george with a frigid politeness im sure you are very busy mr lee i wont detain you any longer  lee tai still smiling i wish you a good day       he bows slightly and shakes his own hands in the chinese manner      he goes out he leaves behind him an impression that is at once      ironic and sinister  george what the devil is he doing here  daisy amused he came to make me an offer of marriage i pointed out to him that i was married already  george not without irritation how did he know you were here  daisy he made it his business to find out  george does he know that  daisy coolly you know china better than most englishmen you know that the white man can do nothing without the chinese knowing it but they wont tell other white men unlessunless its to their advantage to do so  george you told me that this house belonged to the amah  daisy smiling that was a slight exaggeration  george you put it very mildly  daisy you said you wouldnt come to the temple it meant finding some place where we could meet or never seeing you at all  george sombrely we began with deceit and with deceit weve continued  daisy tenderly theres no deceit in my love george after all our love is the only thing that matters  george with a certain awkwardness im afraid ive kept you waiting andr√© leroux came to see me just as i was leaving the legation  daisy remembering i know mrs stopforts young man  george he said he knew mrs stopforts friends were rather anxious about her future and he wanted them to know that he was going to marry her as soon as she was free  daisy oh  george of course its the only decent thing to do but i wasnt sure if hed see it hes a very good fellow with a smile he spent at least half an hour telling me how he adored mrs stopfort  daisy goodhumouredly oh you know im not the sort of woman to grouse because youre a little late i can always occupy myself by thinking how wonderful it will be to see you and if i get bored with that i read your letters again  george i shouldnt have thought they were worth that  daisy i think i have every word you have ever written to methose old letters of ten years ago and the little notes you write to me now even though theyre only two or three lines saying youll come here or cant come theyre precious to me  george but do you keep them here  daisy yes theyre safe here theyre locked up in that box only amah has the key of this room  george  george yes  daisy will you do something for me  george if i can  daisy will you dine here tonight amah will get us a lovely little dinner  george oh my dear i cant ive got an official dinner that i cant possibly get out of  daisy oh how rotten  george but i thought harry was coming back this morning hes been gone a week already  daisy i had a letter saying he had to go on to kalgan but dont say anything about it he told me i was to keep it a secret  george he must hate having to be away so much as hes been lately the death of that man gregson has upset things rather  daisy smiling i wish i could thank gregson for the good turn he did us by dying at the psychological moment  george dryly i dont suppose that was his intention  daisy except for that harry would have insisted on going to chungking now theres no possibility of that for at least a year  george i suppose not  daisy weve got a year before us george a whole year and in a year anything can happen  george gravely do you never have any feeling that weve behaved rottenly to harry  daisy i ive been happy for the first time in my life at last ive known peace and rest oh george im so grateful for all youve given me in these three months youve changed the whole world for me i thought i couldnt love you more than i did i think every day my love grows more consuming  george with a sigh ive never known a single moments happiness  daisy thats not true when ive held you in my arms ive looked into your eyes and ive seen  george oh i know thereve been moments of madness in which i forgot everything but that i loved you im a low rotten cad no one could despise me more than i despise myself ive loved you so that there was room for nothing else in my soul waking and sleeping youve obsessed me  daisy thats how i want you to love me  george and ive hated myself for loving you ive hated you for making me love you ive struggled with all my might and a hundred times i thought id conquered myself and then the touch of your hand the softness of your lipsi was like a bird in a cage i beat myself against the bars and all the time the door was open and i hadnt the will to fly out  daisy tenderly oh darling why do you make yourself unhappy when happiness lies in the hollow of your hand  george have you never regretted anything  daisy never  george youre stronger than i am im as weak as dishwater its funny that it should have taken me all these years to find it out i was weak from the beginning but i was weakest of all that day i was distracted i thought you were dying i forgot everything except that i loved you  daisy with passion oh my sweetheart dont you remember how late in the night we went outside the temple and looked at the moonlight on the walls of the forbidden city you had no regrets then  george going on with his own thoughts and afterwards your tears your happiness the dread of giving you pain and the hot love that burnt mei was in the toils then i too knew a happiness that i had never known before on one side was honesty and duty and everything that makes a man respect himselfand on the other was love i thought youd be going away in two or three weeks and that would be the end of it oh it was no excusethere are no excuses for me i can never look harry in the face again but though my heart was breaking at the thought ii knew that in a few days i should see you for the last time  daisy scornfully do you think id have gone then  george and then came that sudden unexpected disastrous change in all harrys plans and this house and all the sordid horror of an intrigue and then there was nothing to do but face the fact that i was a cur i wouldnt wish my worst enemy the torture that ive undergone  daisy full of love and pity oh my darling you know id do anything in the world to give you happiness  george sombrely looking away from her daisy i think you can never give me happiness but you can help me not to make amends because thats impossible but to  impulsively looking at her now oh daisy do you really love me  daisy with all my heart with all my soul  george then help me let us finish  daisy quickly what do you mean  george i dont want to seem a prig i dont want to preach heaven knows ive never pretended to be a saint but what weve done is wrong you must see that as plainly as i do  daisy is it wrong to love how can i help it  george daisy i want tocease doing wrong  daisy you make me impatient how can you be so weak  george i want you to believe that i love you but i cant go on with this deceit id sooner shoot myself  daisy you couldnt say that if you loved me as i love you  george brutally i dont love you any more  daisy with a scornful shrug thats not true  george clenching his teeth i came here today to tell you thatwell that its finished and done with oh god i dont

startled you why  george i didnt trust myself you see ive lost my nerve so i applied for short leave im sailing for vancouver on the empress i leave here the day after tomorrow  daisy suddenly distraught you dont mean that youre going to leave me i didnt pay any attention to what you said i thought it was just a mood george george say that you dont mean that  george its the only thing to do for your sake and harrys and mine taking his courage in both hands this is goodbye daisy  daisy seizing him by the shoulders let me look at your eyes george youre crazy you cant go  george drawing away for gods sake dont touch me i wanted to break it to you gently i dont know whats happened everything has gone wrong im going daisy and nothing in the world can move me i implore you to bear it bravely she looks at him with suffering anxious eyes she is stunned im afraid youre going to be awfully unhappy for a little while but i beseech you to have courage soon the pain wont be so great and then youll see ive done the only possible thing  daisy sullenly how long are you going for  george three or four months a pause i knew youd be brave daisy do you know i was afraid youd cry most awfully it tears my heart to see you cry  daisy do you think im a child do you think i can cry now  george its goodbye then daisy       she does not answer she hardly hears what he says he hesitates      an instant wretchedly and then goes quickly out of the room      daisy stands as if she were turned to stone her face is haggard      in a minute lee tai comes softly in he stands at the door      looking at her then gives a little cough she turns round and sees      him  daisy fiercely what do you want  lee tai i was waiting till you were disengaged  daisy have you been listening  lee tai i have heard  daisy i wish i could have seen you with your ear to the keyhole you must have looked dignified       she begins to laugh angrily hysterically beside herself  lee tai let me give you a cup of tea its quite warm still  daisy i should have thought you were rather old and fat to stoop so much  lee tai fortunately the windows are only covered with rice paper so i was saved that inconvenience       he hands her a cup of tea she takes it and flings it at him the      tea is splashed over his black robe  daisy get out of here or ill kill you       he wipes his dress with a large silk pocket handkerchief  lee tai you forget sometimes the manners that were taught you at that elegant school for young ladies in england  daisy i suppose youve come to crow over me well crow  lee tai i told you that i thought i should not have to wait very long  daisy scornfully you fool do you think its finished  lee tai did i not tell you that the white mans love was weak and vacillating  daisy hes going away for four months do you think that frightens me hes loved me for ten years ive loved him for ten years do you think he can forget me in four months hell come back  lee tai not to

quietly hes going to be married to miss sylvia knox  daisy springs at him and seizes him by the throat  daisy thats a lie thats a lie take it back you pig       he takes her hands and drags them away from his throat he holds      her fast  lee tai ask your mother she knows the chinese all know  daisy calling amah amah its a lie how dare you  lee tai he told you he was going to an official dinner but he didnt tell you that as soon as he could get away he was going to play bridge at the knoxes pity you dont play they might have asked you too  the amah comes in  amah you call me daisy  daisy

he say to his friend george conway and my sister they going to make a match of it       a horrible change comes over daisys face as all its features      become distorted with rage and jealousy  daisy the liar       she stares in front of her hatred anger and mortification      seething in her heart then she gives a cruel malicious chuckle      she goes quickly to the korean chest and flings it open she takes      out a parcel of letters and crossing back swiftly to lee tai      thrusts them in his hands  lee tai what is this  daisy theyre the letters he wrote me let them come into harrys hands  lee tai why  daisy so that harry may know everything  lee tai after a moments thought and what will you do for me if i do this for you  daisy what you like only they must get to him quickly

contempt  daisy fool  amah what you mean daisy  daisy harry will divorce me and then  daisy gives a little cry of triumph   end of scene vi     scene vii   the sittingroom in the andersons apartments  the scene is the same as scene iv daisy and the amah  daisy is walking restlessly backwards and forwards  daisy at what time does the train from kalgan get in  amah five oclock my think so  daisy what

amah make her little daisy a pipe daisy very restless  daisy have you got opium  amah lee tai give me some she shows daisy a small tin box number one quality you have one little pipe daisy  daisy no  wu comes in with a card he gives it to daisy  miss knox say im not at home  wu yes missy  he is about to go out  daisy stop is she alone  wu she ride up to gate with gentleman and lady she say can she

now  daisy i shall get rid of her as soon as he does almost to herself i want to see for myself       sylvia comes in she wears a ridinghabit daisy greets her      cordially her manner which was restless becomes on a sudden gay      gracious and friendly  daisy oh my dear how sweet of you to come all this way  the amah slips out  sylvia i can only stop a second i was riding with the fergusons and we passed your temple i thought id just run in and see how you were i havent seen you for an age  daisy are the fergusons waiting outside  sylvia they rode on they said theyd fetch me in five minutes  daisy smiling how did your bridge party go off last night  sylvia how on earth did you hear about that did mr conway tell you i wish you played bridge we really had rather a lark  daisy george didnt come in till late i suppose  sylvia oh no he got away in fairly decent time where theres a will theres a way you know even at official functions  daisy with a little laugh oh i know im expecting him here in a minute i hope you wont have to go before he comes  sylvia well i saw him yesterday i can live one day without seeing him  daisy i wonder if he can live one day without seeing you  sylvia im tolerably sure he can do that  daisy as if she were merely teasing a little bird has whispered to me that theres a very pretty blonde in peking  sylvia interrupting probably peroxide  daisy not in this case who is not entirely indifferent to the assistant chinese secretary at the british legation  sylvia fancy  daisy i suppose you havent an idea who im talking about  sylvia not a ghost  daisy then why do you blush to the roots of your hair  sylvia i was outraged at your suggestion that my hair was dyed  daisy its too bad of me to tease you isnt it  sylvia im a perfect owl you know what a tactless idiot my brother is he will chaff me about george conway so it makes me selfconscious when anybody talks about him  daisy darling its nothing to be ashamed of why shouldnt you be in love with him  sylvia with a laugh but im not in love with him  daisy why does your brother chaff you then  sylvia because hes under the delusion that its funny  daisy but you do like him dont you  sylvia of course i like him i think hes a very good sort  daisy would you marry him if he asked you  sylvia my dear what are you talking about the thought never entered my head  daisy oh what nonsense when a mans as attentive to a girl as george has been to you she cant help asking herself if shed like to marry him or not  sylvia coldly but still smiling cant she im afraid i havent a close acquaintance with that sort of girl  daisy am i being very vulgar you know we halfcastes are sometimes  sylvia with a trace of impatience of course youre not vulgar but i dont know why you want to talk about something thats absolute greek to me  daisy the natural curiosity of the eurasian everybody tells me that youre engaged to george  sylvia look at my hand  she stretches out her left hand so that daisy should see there is no ring on the fourth finger daisy stares at it for a moment  daisy you always used to wear an engagement ring  sylvia gravely it was put on my finger by a poor boy who was killed i meant to wear it always  daisy why have you taken it off  she looks at sylvia she can no longer preserve her artificial gaiety and her voice is cold and hard before sylvia can answer george conway comes in  daisy regaining with an effort her earlier sprightliness there you are at last  george i couldnt come sooner i was with the minister  daisy we were wondering why you were so late  sylvia daisy was wondering  george shaking hands with sylvia i thought that was your pony outside  sylvia clever  george the fergusons were just riding up as i came  sylvia oh theyve come to fetch me i must bolt  george im afraid we kept you up till all sorts of hours last night  sylvia not a bit do i look jaded  george of course not you young things can stay up till three in the morning and be as fresh as paint wait till youre my age  sylvia you havent passed your hundredth birthday yet have you  george not quite but im old enough to be your father  sylvia i will not stay and listen to you talk rubbish goodbye daisy do come and see me one day this week  daisy goodbye  george ill come and help you mount shall i  sylvia oh no dont bother mr ferguson is there  george oh all right  she goes out  daisy her smiles vanishing hostile and cold you might shut the door  george doing so i will  daisy arent you going to kiss me  george daisy  daisy hastily oh no it doesnt matter dont bother  george you said you wanted to see me very importantly  daisy its kind of you to have come  george with an effort at ease of manner my dear child what are you talking about you must know that if theres anything in the world i can do for you im only too anxious to do it  daisy is that girl in love with you  george good heavens no what put that idea in your head  daisy the eyes in my head  george what perfect nonsense  daisy has it never occurred to you that she was in love with you  george never  daisy why do you lie to me ive been told that you were engaged to her  george thats ludicrous its absolutely untrue  daisy yes i think it is at the first moment i believed it and then i thought it over and i knew it couldnt be true i dont think youd do anything underhand  george at all events i shouldnt do that  daisy in fairness to me or in fairness to her  george my dear daisy what are you talking about  daisy did you break with me yesterday so that you might be free to propose to her  george no i swear i didnt  daisy why are you so emphatic  george oh daisy whats the good of tormenting yourself and tormenting me you know i loved you just as much as you loved me but im not like you it was a torture i knew it was wrong and hateful i couldnt go on  daisy do you think it would have seemed wrong and hateful if it hadnt been for sylvia  george yes  daisy you dont say that very convincingly  george i do think it is because she is so loyal and good and straight that i saw so clearly what a cad i was i think i found courage to do the only possible thing in her frankness and honesty  daisy i think you deceive yourself are you sure this admiration of yours for all her admirable qualities isntlove  george my dear im unfit to love her  daisy she doesnt think so if you asked her to marry you shed accept  george impatiently what nonsense what in heavens name made you think that  daisy i made it my business to find out  george well you can set your mind at rest im not going to ask her to marry me  the amah comes in  amah five oclock daisy  daisy leave me alone  the amah goes out  george when does harry come back  daisy after a pause in a strange hoarse voice today  george surprised at her tone and manner is anything the matter daisy  daisy im afraid i have some very bad news for you  george startled oh  daisy you know those letters i kept them locked in the box lee tai was furious because i wouldnt have anything to do with him last night he broke open the box hes sent the letters to harry  george overwhelmed my god  daisy im awfully sorry it wasnt my fault i couldnt dream that there was any risk  george was that why you sent for me  daisy say you dont hate me  george oh poor harry  daisy dont think of him now think of me  george what do we matter now you and i were a pair of rotters harry is a white man through and through he loved you and he trusted me  daisy what are we going to do  george give me a minute im all at sixes and sevens its such a knockout blow  daisy harry will be here soon his trains due at five  george well wait for him  daisy what  george did you think i was going to run away ill stay and face him  daisy hell kill you  george with anguish i wish to god he would  daisy oh george how can you be so cruel dont you love me any more i love you george what is to become of me if you desert me  george harry loves you so much and he loves me too heaven knows what sacrifices hes not capable of oh im so ashamed  daisy why do you bother about him he doesnt count hell get over it after all what can he do he can only divorce me and perhaps we can get him to let me divorce him  george could you allow him to do that  daisy it means so little to a man i dont care i was thinking of you it would make it so much easier for you he gives her a quick look he perceives the allusion to marriage george george you wouldnt leaveleave me in the cart  george of course ill marry you  daisy smiling now loving and tender oh george we shall be so happy and you know some day im sure youll think its better as its turned out i hate all this deceit just as much as you do oh itll make such a difference when our love can be open and above board when im your wife youll forget all that has tormented you oh george i know we shall be happy  all this time george has been thinking deeply  george how do you know that lee tai sent those wretched letters to harry  daisy he sent me a message he wasnt satisfied with doing a dirty trick he wanted me to know that hed done it  george how did he know you kept my letters there  daisy i told you i was reading them while i waited for you he came in and i put them away i suppose he suspected it was very easy for him to get into the room after amah and i went away  george sarcastically had you left the key of the box on the table  daisy what do you mean george id locked it up of course i took the key with me i suppose he broke it open what does it matter the harms done  george how do you know harry received the letters this morning  daisy lee tai said he would  george in kalgan  daisy yes  george how did he know harry was in kalgan  daisy the chinese know all ones movements  george they cant do miracles harry was going up there unexpectedly on a private mission the fellows in that company know very well how to keep their own counsel when its needful i imagine you were the only person in peking who knew harry was going to kalgan  daisy casually well it appears i wasnt  george how do you suppose lee tai found out something that harry had particularly told you to keep quiet about  daisy how can i tell he may have found out from the amah for all i know  george surely you hadnt told her  daisy of course not she may have read the letter she always does read my letters  george can she read english  daisy enough to find out about other peoples business  george why should she have told lee tai  daisy i suppose he bribed her shed do anything for a hundred dollars  george not if it would do you harm  daisy shes not so devoted to me as all that  george shes your mother daisy  daisy quickly how dyou know  george harry told me  daisy i thought he was too ashamed of it to do that  george persistently how did lee tai know that harry was in kalgan  daisy i tell you i dont know why do you crossexamine me good god im harassed enough without that what do you mean  george he seizes her wrists and draws her violently to him daisy did you send those letters to harry yourself  daisy never do you think im crazy  george did you give them to lee tai to send  daisy no  george god damn you speak the truth i will have the truth for once in your life       they stare at one another he is stern and angry she pulls      herself together she is fierce and defiant she shakes herself      free of him  daisy i gave them to lee tai  george hiding his face with his hands my god  daisy he told me you were engaged to sylvia for a moment i believed it and i gave him the letters i hardly knew what i was doing and now even though i know it wasnt true im glad i wish id done it long before  george you fiend  daisy violently do you think im going to let you go so easily do you think ive done all i have to let you marry that silly little english girl  george with anguish oh daisy how could you  daisy has it never struck you how you came to be wounded that night it wasnt you they wanted it was harry  george i know suddenly understanding daisy  daisy yes i could do that i only wish it had succeeded  george i cant believe it  daisy youre mine mine mine and ill never let you go  george with increasing violence do you think i can ever look at you again without horror in my heart ive known always that you were evil ten years ago when i first loved you there was a deep instinct within that warned me even though my heart was breaking for love of you i knew that you were ruthless and cruel ive loved you yes but all the time ive hated you ive loved you but with the baser part of me all that was in me that was honest and decent and upright revolted against you always always this love has been a loathsome cancer in my heart i couldnt rid me of it without killing myself but i abhorred it i felt that i was degraded by the love that burned me  daisy what do i care so long as you love you can think anything you like of me the fact remains that you love me  george if you had no pity for harry who raised you from the gutter and gave you everything he had to give oh if youd loved me youd have had mercy on me what do you think our life can be together dont you know what i shall be ruined and abject and hopeless oh not only in the eyes of everyone who knows me shall i be degraded but in my own do you think theres much happiness for you there  daisy i shall have you thats all the happiness i want id rather be wretched with youoh a thousand timesthan happy with anyone else  george wrathfully trying to wound her you were tormenting me just now because you were jealous of sylvia do you know what i felt for her it wasnt loveat least not what you mean by love i can never love anyone as ive loved you and god knows im thankful but i had such a respect for her ive been so wretched and she offered me peace and i did think that some day when all this horror was over if i could do something to make myself feel clean again i should go to her and all unworthy ask her if she would take me and now the bitterest pang of all is to think that she must know what an unspeakable cad ive always been       he has flung himself into a chair he is in despair daisy goes      up to him and going down on her knees beside him puts her arm round      him she is very tender  daisy oh george i can make you forget her so easily you dont know what my love can do i know ive been horrible but its only been because i loved you ten years ago i was all that she is im like clay in your hands and you can make me what you will oh george say you forgive me       in the caressing gestures of her hands as she tries to move him      one of them rests by chance on his coat pocket she feels something      hard he moves slightly away  george take care  daisy whats that in your pocket  george its my revolver since my accident ive always carried it about with me its rather silly but the minister asked me to he said hed feel safer  daisy oh george if you only knew the agony i suffered when you were brought in the remorse the fear i thought i should go mad  george with a bitter chuckle it must have been rather a sell for you  daisy oh you can laugh i knew youd forgive me my darling  george im sorry for all the rough things i said to you daisy i dont blame you for anything you only acted according to your lights the only person i can blame is myself its only reasonable that i should suffer the punishment  daisy my sweetheart  george i suppose you know that i shall be quite ruined  daisy youll have to leave the service does that really matter to you very much  george it was my whole life  daisy youll get a job in the post office with your knowledge of the language theyll simply jump at you its a chinese service it has nothing to do with europeans  george do you think the postmaster in a small chinese city is a very lucrative position  daisy what does money matter if id wanted money i could have got all i wanted from lee tai we can do with very little you dont know what a clever housekeeper i am  george in a level dead voice im sure youre wonderful  daisy well go to some city where there are no foreigners and we shall be together always well have a house high up on the bank and below us the river will flow flow endlessly  george you seem to have got it all mapped out  daisy if you only knew how often ive dreamed of it oh george i want rest and peace too im so tired i want endless days to rest in with a puzzled look at him what is the matter you look so strange  george with a weary sigh i was thinking of all the things youve been saying to me  daisy if you think itll be easier for you if you dont marry me you need not i dont care anything about that ill be your mistress and ill lie hidden in your house so that no one shall know im there ill live like a chinese woman ill be your slave and your plaything i want to get away from all these europeans after all china is the land of my birth and the land of my mother china is crowding in upon me im sick of these foreign clothes i have a strange hankering for the ease of the chinese dress youve never seen me in it  george never  daisy with a smile youd hardly know me ill be a little chinese girl living in the foreigners house have you ever smoked opium  george no daisy takes the amahs long pipe in her hands who does that belong to  daisy its amahs one day you shall try and ill make your pipes for you lee tai used to say that no one could make them better than i  george however low down the ladder you go theres apparently always a rung lower  daisy after youve smoked a pipe or two your mind grows extraordinarily clear you have a strange facility of speech and yet no desire to speak all the puzzles of this puzzling world grow plain to you you are tranquil and free your soul is gently released from the bondage of your body and it plays happy and careless like a child with flowers death cannot frighten you and want and misery are like blue mountains far away you feel a heavenly power possess you and you can venture all things because suffering cannot touch you your spirit has wings and you fly like a bird through the starry wastes of the night you hold space and time in the hollow of your hand then you come upon the dawn all pearly and gray and silent and there in the distance like a dreamless sleep is the sea  george you are showing me a side of you i never knew  daisy do you think you know me yet i dont know myself in my heart there are secrets that are strange even to me and spells to bind you to me and enchantments so that you will never weary  a pause  george standing up ill go and get myself a drink after all these alarums and excursions i really think i deserve it  daisy amah will bring it to you  george oh it doesnt matter i can easily fetch it myself the whiskys in the diningroom isnt it  daisy i expect so       he goes out daisy goes over to a chest which stands in the      room and throws it open she takes out the manchu dress which harry      once gave her and handles it smilingly she holds up in both her      hands the sumptuous headdress there is the sound of a door being      locked daisy puts down the headdress and looks at the door      enquiringly  daisy with a little smile what are you locking the door for george the words are hardly out of her mouth before there is the report of a pistol shot daisy gives a shriek and rushes towards the door george george what have you done she beats frantically on the door let me in let me in george  the amah comes in running from the courtyard  amah whats the matter i hear shot  daisy send the boys quick we must break down this door  amah i send the boys away i no want them here when harry come  daisy george george speak to me she beats violently on the door oh what shall i do  amah daisy whats the matter  daisy hes killed himself soonersooner than  amah aghast oh  daisy staggers back into the room  daisy oh my god       she sinks down on the floor she beats it with her fist the      amah looks at her for an instant then with quick determination      seizes her shoulder  amah daisy harry come soon  daisy with a violent gesture leave me alone what do i care if harry comes  amah you no can stay here come with me quick  daisy go away damn you  amah stern and decided dont you talk foolish now you come lee tai waiting for you  daisy with a sudden suspicion did you know this was going to happen george george  amah harry will kill you if he find you here come with me there is a knocking at the outer gate there he is daisy daisy  daisy dont torture me  amah i bolt that door he no get in that way he must come round through temple you come quick and i hide you we slip out when he safe  daisy with scornful rage do you think im frightened of harry  amah he come velly soon now  daisy raises herself to her feet a strange look comes over her face  daisy lee tai has made a mistake again bolt that door       the amah runs to it and slips the bolt while she does this      daisy takes the tin of opium and quickly swallows some of the      contents the amah turns round and sees her she gives a gasp      she runs forward and snatches the tin from daisys hand  amah what you do daisy daisy you die  daisy yes i die the day has come the jungle takes back its own  amah distraught oh daisy daisy my little flower  daisy how long will it take the amah sobs desperately daisy goes to the manchu clothes and takes them up help me to put these on  amah dumbfounded what you mean daisy  daisy curse you do as i tell you  amah i think you crazy daisy slips into the long skirt and the amah with trembling hands helps her into the coat in the middle of her dressing daisy staggers daisy  daisy recovering herself dont be a fool im all right  amah in a terrified whisper theres harry  daisy give me the headdress  harry outside open the door  daisy be quick  amah i no understand you die daisy you die  the knocking is repeated more violently  harry shouting daisy amah open the door if you dont open ill break it down       daisy is ready she steps on to the pallet and sits in the      chinese fashion  daisy go to the door open when i tell you       there is by daisys side a box in which are the paints and      pencils the chinese lady uses to make up her face daisy opens      it she takes out a hand mirror  harry whos there open i tell you open       daisy puts rouge on her cheeks she takes a black pencil and      touches her eyebrows she gives them a slight slant so that she      looks on a sudden absolutely chinese  daisy open  the amah draws the bolt and harry bursts in  harry daisy he comes forward impetuously and then on a sudden stops he is taken aback something he knows not what comes over him and he feels helpless and strangely weak daisy what does it mean these letters he takes them out of his pocket and thrusts them towards her she takes no notice of him daisy speak to me i dont understand he staggers towards her with outstretched hands for gods sake say it isnt true       motionless she contemplates in the mirror the chinese woman of      the reflection   the end
