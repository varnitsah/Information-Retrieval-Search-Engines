portion of our globe   sometimes designated as the top of the world    filled with such dreams as come to all explorers barwell dawson   fitted out the ice king for a trip to the north because of what had   happened it was but natural that he should invite andy and chet to   accompany him and equally natural that they should hasten to accept   the invitation    the boys knew that they would have no easy time of it yet they did   not dream of the many perils that awaited the entire party once the   staunch steamer was in danger of being crushed by an immense iceberg   in which event this chronicle would not have been written again the   boys and the others had a fierce fight with polar bears and with a   savage walrus when the ship was jammed hard and fast in the ice a   start was made by the exploring party accompanied by some esquimaux   and several dog sledges all had heard of the marvelous achievements   of cook and peary and all were fired with a great ambition to go and   do likewise with the thermometer often at fifty degrees below zero   they pushed on steadily facing death more than once to add to their   troubles they had sickness in camp and snowblindness and once some   esquimaux becoming scared rebelled and tried to run off with their   supplies then when the north pole was at last gained it became the   gravest kind of a problem how to return to civilization alive    in penning this volume i have had a twofold purpose in mind the first   to show what pure grit and determination can do under the most trying   of circumstances and the second to give my readers an insight into   esquimaux life and habits and to relate what great explorers like   franklin kane hall delong nansen cook and peary have done to   open up this weird and mysterious portion of our globe                                                     edward stratemeyer   november 15 1909     chapter i  andy and his uncle   what be you agoin to do today andy  im going to try my luck over to the storburgh camp uncle si i hardly think mr storburgh will have an opening for me but it wont hurt to ask him  did you try sam hickley as i told you to continued josiah graham as he settled himself more comfortably before the open fireplace of the cabin  yes but he said he had all the men he wanted andy graham gave something of a sigh seems to me there are more lumbermen in this part of maine than there is lumber  humph i guess you aint tried very hard to git work grumbled the old man drawing up his bootless feet on the rungs of his chair and spreading out his hands to the generous blaze before him did you see them plover brothers  no but chet greene did day before yesterday and they told him they were laying men off instead of taking em on  humph i guess thet chet greene dont want to work hed rather fool his time away in the woods huntin and fishin  chet is willing enough to work if he can get anything to do and hunting pays sometimes last week he got a fine deer and one of the rich hunters from boston paid him a good price for it  humph thet aint as good as a stiddy payin job i dont want you to be alazin your time away in the woodsi want you to grow up stiddy an useful besides we got to have money if we want to live  arent you going to try to get work uncle si asked the boy anxiously as he gazed at the large and powerfullooking frame of the man before him  to be sure im agoin to go to worksoon as im fit but i cant do nuthin with my feet an my stomach goin back on me can i  i thought your dyspepsia was about overyouve eaten so well the past week and youve walked considerably lately if you got something easy  now dont you go to tellin me what to do cried the old man wrathfully im a sick man thats what i am i aint able to work an its up to you as a dootiful nevvy to git work an support us both now you jest trot off to the storburgh camp an dont you come home till you git work an after this you better give up havin anything to do with thet goodfernuthin lazy chet greene  the boys eyes flashed for an instant and he was on the point of making a bitter reply to his relative but then his mouth closed suddenly and he turned away in silence he drew off his slippers donned his big boots and put on his overcoat and his winter cap then he pulled on his gloves slung a game bag over his shoulder and reached for a gun that stood behind a door  wot you takin thet fer demanded josiah graham with his eyes on the gun didnt i tell you to look fer a job  thats what im going to do was the reply but if i come across any game on the way i want the chance to bring it down  humph i know how boys are rather loaf around the woods than work any time  uncle si if you say another word began the youth and then he stopped short turned on his heel and walked from the cabin closing the door none too gently behind him  it was certainly a trying situation and as he stepped out into the snow andy felt as if he never wanted to go back and never wanted to see his uncle si again  its his laziness nothing else murmured the boy to himself as he trudged off hes as able to work as i am he always was lazyfather said so oh dear i wish he had never come to pine run  andy was a youth of seventeen of medium height but with welldeveloped chest and muscles his face was a round one and usually good to look at although at present it was drawn down because of what had just occurred  the boy was an orphan the son of a man who in years gone by had bought and sold lumber throughout the northern section of maine his mother had been taken away when he was a small lad and then he and his father had left town and come to live in the big cabin from which andy was now trudging so rapidly an old colored woman had come along to do the cooking and other household work  a log jam on the river had caused mr grahams death two years before this tale opens and for a short time andy had been left utterly alone there being no near neighbors and no relatives to take care of the orphan true he had been offered a home by a lumber dealer of bangor but the man was such a harsh fellow that andy shrank from going with him  then one day much to everybodys surprise josiah graham appeared on the scene and announced his intention to settle down and live with his nephew josiah was an older halfbrother to andys father and the boy had often heard of him as a shiftless lazy neerdowell who drifted from one town to another seldom keeping a job longer than two or three weeks or a month he did not drink but he loved to smoke and to tell stories of what he had done or was going to do  im agoin to take andy in hand an make a man of him he declared shortly after his arrival a young feller like him needs a guardeen and then he had his trunk carted to the cabin and without asking andys permission proceeded to settle down and make himself comfortable  at first it looked as if matters might go along smoothly enough for josiah graham managed to obtain a position as timekeeper at one of the lumber camps where andy was employed as a chopper but soon the mans laziness manifested itself and when he did not do his work properly he was discharged  it was the bosss fault twasnt mine he told andy but the youth knew better then he got into a quarrel with the negro woman who did the housework and told her to go away  twill be one less to feed he said to his nephew we can do our own work but he did not do a stroke extra and it fell to andys share to sweep and wash dishes and make his own bed uncle si wanted him to make the other bed too but he refused  if you want it made you can make it yourself declared andy with spirit you are not working at the camp while i am this led to a lively quarrel after that josiah graham did make up the bed a few times but usually when he crawled into it at night it was in the same mussedup condition as when he had crawled out in the morning  another quarrel came over the question of money the uncle wanted andy to hand over all his earnings but this the lad refused to do josiah graham had already gotten possession of the fifteen hundred dollars left by andys father but this was lost in a wildcat speculation in lumber for which the old man was morally if not legally responsible the youth felt that he must be cautious or his uncle might make him penniless  ill pay the bills and give you a dollar a week he told josiah graham that will buy those tablets you take for your dyspepsia you had better give up smoking  smoking is good for the dyspepsy was the reply you give me the money an ill pay the bills and then when andy still refused the uncle waited until payday and went to the lumber camp and collected his nephews wages this brought on more trouble and because of this andy lost his position  it was midwinter and to get another job was by no means easy the youth tramped from place to place but without success the money in the hands of josiah graham was running low and he was constantly nagging andy to go and do something he was perfectly able to look for work himself but was too indolent to make the effort he preferred to sit in front of the blazing fire and give advice once or twice a week he would shuffle off to the village two miles away to sit behind the pot stove in the general store and listen to the news  the laziest man in the whole district declared the storekeeper its a pity he showed up to bother andy graham i think the boy could have done better without him and this verdict was shared by many but nobody dared to tell josiah graham for fear of provoking a quarrel with the man  as mentioned before andys father had left fifteen hundred dollars he had also bequeathed to his son when he should become of age an interest in a large timber tract in upper michigan on his deathbed the father had secretly given his son some papers referring to the land telling him to beware or some lumber sharks would get the better of him and take his property away andy now had these papers hidden in a box under his bed he had not told his uncle of them feeling that his relative was not capable of looking after his rights andys education was somewhat limited yet he knew a great deal more than did josiah graham who had been too lazy to attend school even when he had the chance  ill keep the papers secret the lad told himself and some day when i get the chance and have the money ill go down to bangor or portland and get a lawyer to look into the matter for me if i let uncle si have them hell allow the land sharks to cheat me out of everything  andys father had been more or less of a hunter and the boy took naturally to a rifle and a shotgun he was a fair marksman and the winter previous had laid low three deer and a great variety of small game one of the deer had been brought down on a windy day and at long range and of that shot he was justly proud the venison and other meat had come in handy at the cabin and the deer skins and the horns of a buck had brought him in some money that was badly needed  if i cant get a job im going hunting for a few days said andy half aloud as he trudged through the snow its better than doing nothing uncle si to the contrary maybe i can get chet to go along i dont think he has anything else to do somehow or other it seems to be awfully dull around here this winter maybe i would have done better if i had tried my luck down in one of the towns  andy had to pass through the village of pine run consisting of a general store blacksmith shop church and a score of houses as he approached the settlement he saw a horse and cutter coming toward him at a smart rate of speed in the cutter sat a man of about thirty dressed in a fine fur overcoat  whoa called the man to his steed as he approached the youth and the horse soon came to a halt say can you tell me is this the road to moose ridge he asked  its one of the roads answered andy  then there is another  yes sir just beyond that fringe of trees yonder  which is the best road  what part of the ridge do you want to go to  up to a place called the blasted pines  then you had better take the other road you wont get through this way  you are sure of that i dont want to make any mistake  yes i am sure ive been up there hunting myself added andy he saw that the cutter contained a game bag and two gun cases  is the hunting any good  it was last year i havent been up there this year i got a fine big deer up there maybe ill get up there laterif i cant find work  out of employment eh  yes sir  well if you come up there perhaps well meet again said the man and started to turn the cutter back to the other road much obliged for the information  youre welcome answered andy and then he watched the turnout swing around and dash away for the other road  little did he dream of the strange circumstances under which he was to meet this man again or of what that encounter was to bring forth     chapter ii  at the lumber camp   leaving the village behind him andy struck out bravely for the storburgh lumber camp three miles up the river the thermometer was low but there was no wind and he did not mind the cold for he had plenty of good red blood in his veins all he was worried about was the question of getting work he knew that he must have money and that it could not very well be obtained without employment  if i were a fellow in a fairy story book i might find a bag of gold he mused but as im only a yankee lad i guess ill have to hustle around for all i get even if i went hunting and brought down a deer or two or a moose that wouldnt bring in enough if i were a regular guide i might get a job with that gentleman in the cutter he looked as if he had money to spend he must be a stranger in these parts or he wouldnt ask about the road to moose ridge  it was nearly noon when andy came in sight of the lumber camp from a distance he heard the ringing sounds of the axes and the shouts of the men to stand from under as a mighty monarch of the forest was about to fall skirting the yard he approached the building which was known as the office  is mr storburgh around he asked of the young man in charge  he is not was the reply and the clerk scarcely looked up from the sheet upon which he was figuring  when will he be here  i dont knowhes gone to new york  do you know if he has an opening for a chopper or on the teams  no opening whatever we laid off four men last week and were going to lay off four more this coming saturday  the clerk went on figuring and in silence andy withdrew he had had a walk of nearly five miles for nothing was it any wonder that he was disheartened  its the same story everywhere he told himself as he moved away slowly i might tramp to the elroy placethats six miles from herebut whats the use ill wear out bootleather for nothing i guess uncle si and i will have to pull up stakes or starve  not knowing what else to do andy walked along to where a number of men were at work just then the twelve oclock whistle sounded and the workers knocked off for their midday meal  hello andy sung out a cheery voice and turning the boy saw a brawny chopper named bill carrow approaching carrow had once worked with mr graham and knew the son fairly well  hello returned the youth going to feed the inner man and he smiled  thats what son how are you and the lumberman shook hands  fairly well but id feel better if i had a job  out of work eh thats too bad i dont suppose there is any opening here  the clerk said there wasnt anysaid they were discharging hands instead of taking em on  thats true business is badaccount of the panic last year you know bill carrow paused a moment had your dinner  no but i can wait until  you aint going to wait you come with me and ill fill you up your father did the same for me many a time come on  andy was hungry and could not resist this kindly invitation soon the pair were eating a plain but substantial dinner which carrow procured from the camp cook it was disposed of in a corner of the mess cabin apart from the other lumbermen as they ate the lumberman asked the youth about himself and his uncle  that uncle of yours ought to be ashamed of himself thats my opinion of it said bill carrow if i was you id not lift my finger to support him he was the laziest young feller i ever knew and its nothing but laziness now he ought to be supporting you instead of you supporting him  i can support myselfif hed only leave me alone and not try to get my money away from me  he squandered that money your father lefti know all about it id make him go to work  i cant make him do anything  the boys ought to go over and ride him on a rail or tar and feather him i guess that would wake him up  oh i hope they dont do that hes a bad man when he gets in a rage andy did not want any more trouble than had already fallen to his portion  by the way andy did a man named hopton call on you lately asked carrow after a pause  hopton i never heard of him who is he  why as near as i can learn he is a real estate mandeals in timber and farm lands he came here a week or so ago thinking you had a job here i told him where you lived and i supposed he called on you  i didnt see him what did he want  he wouldnt sayleastwise i didnt ask him seeings it was none of my business but he did ask me confidential likeafter he found out that i had known your father wellif your folks had any timber lands over in michigan  oh andy uttered the exclamation before he had time to think did hethat is did he ask about any land in particular  no i told him i didnt think you owned any land anywhere he looked satisfied at that and went away but i thought he called on you  where was he from  i dont know but they might tell you at the office have you got any land  it was an awkward question andy did not wish to tell a falsehood nor did he wish to disclose the secret left by his parent he bit off a mouthful of bread and pretended to choke upon it  hi look out or youll choke to death cried bill carrow slapping him on the back then andy ran to the door and continued to cough until the awkward question was forgotten other workmen came up and the talk became general perhaps carrow suspected that the boy did not wish to answer him for he did not refer to the matter again  after thanking his friend for the dinner andy walked back to the office he found the clerk smoking a pipe and reading a bangor newspaper having finished his midday meal a few minutes previously  its no use he said as andy came in we cant possibly take you on  i came back to get a little information if youll be kind enough to give it do you know a man named hopton  why yes i suppose you mean a q hopton the real estate dealer  does he deal in timber lands  i think he does  where is he from  he has an office in portland and another in grand rapids michigan  do you know where he is now  no he was here on business some days ago perhaps he went back to portland  thank you  want to buy a few thousand acres of land and the clerk chuckled at his joke  no i thought i could sell him a linen duster to keep the icicles off when hes on the road answered andy with a grin and then as there seemed nothing more to say he walked away and was soon leaving the storburgh lumber camp behind him  what he had heard set him to thinking deeply what did this a q hopton know about the lumber tract in michigan was it valuable and did it really belong to his fathers estate  i wish i knew more about such things mused andy the last time i tried to read the papers over i couldnt make head or tail of them i guess it would take a smart lawyer to get to the bottom of itand a lawyer would want a lot of money for the work i wonder and then andy came to a sudden halt  was it possible that mr a q hopton had called at the cabin during his absence and interviewed uncle si and if so how much had uncle si been able to tell the real estate dealer had the two gone on a hunt for the papers and if so had they found the documents  if uncle si has gone into any kind of a deal on this without consulting me illill bring him to account for it cried the youth vehemently after this he has got to leave my affairs alone he lost that fifteen hundred dollarshes not going to lose that timber land too  it occurred to andy that the best thing he could do would be to get home at once and interview his uncle for the time being he lost his interest in looking for work and also lost his desire to go gunning  ive tramped far enough for one day anyway he told himself ill just stop at the store for a few things and then go straight home  it was a long walk to the village and once there he was glad enough to rest while the storekeeper put up the few things he desired these he paid for in cash for he did not wish to risk a refusal should he ask for trust  your uncle was heregot some tobacco said the storekeeper he said you would pay for it  hell have to pay for it himself mr sands answered andy firmly  yes all right andy just as you say  i pay for what i buy and he can do the same  well i dont blame you my boy and the look of the storekeeper spoke volumes he handed over some change that was due by the way did you know there was a real estate dealer in town to see you he inquired  a mr hopton  thats the man  when  todayonly a few hours ago i was telling him where you lived when your uncle came along for the tobacco they talked a while together and then went off  towards our place  yes they took that road the real estate man had a sleigh and your uncle got in with him  what did mr hopton want  i dont know exactly i heard some words about papers and your uncle said he had them mr hopton said something about three hundred dollars in cashbut i dont know what it was  andys heart leaped into his throat was it possible that his uncle had found the timber claim papers and was going to let mr a q hopton have them for three hundred dollars  he shant do itill stop himi must stop him the boy told himself and catching up his bundles he left the general store and struck out for home as fast as his tired limbs would carry him     chapter iii  some papers of value   ever since his father had left him the papers andy had thought they might be of considerable value but now he was more convinced than ever of their importance  for all i know that claim may be worth a fortune he reasoned anyway its worth something or that man wouldnt be so anxious to get the papers  the youth tried his best to increase his speed but the snow was deep in spots and his long journey to the storburgh camp had tired him so it took some time to get even within sight of the cabin that was his home to the rear under the shed he saw a horse and cutter  he is there thats sure he told himself i wonder what they are doing  the path to the cabin wound in and out among some trees so that those inside could not witness his approach unless they were on the watch as the youth came closer a sudden thought struck him and he darted behind some bushes made a detour and came up in the shed here there was a back door opening into a summer kitchen  placing his bundles on a shelf in the shed andy softly opened the door to the summer kitchen and entered the place here there was another door opening into the general living room of the cabin it was not well hung and stood open several inches  well i know something about timber lands he heard his uncle saying if they are wuth anything they are generally wuth considerable  i am offering you more than this claim is worth was the reply from mr a q hopton he was standing in front of the fire warming himself while josiah graham was hunched up in his usual attitude in the easy chair both men were smoking cigars the real estate man having stood treat  wot makes you so anxious to git the papers went on josiah graham  my client simply wants to clear away this flaw as i told you answered a q hopton smoothly of course he could go ahead and claim everything just as it is and i dont think you could do a thing but he prefers to treat everybody right mr graham gave a hundred dollars for this claim so when you get three hundred for it you are getting a big price  humph josiah graham fell back on his favorite exclamation if ithat is if i let you have them papers andy may object  how can he youre his guardian arent you  sure i am but  then you have a right to do as you please you dont want me to buy the papers from him do you  no no you give the money to me cried josiah graham in alarm he dont know the vally of a dollar an i do if he had thet three hundred dollars hed squander it in no time  very well give me the papers and ill write you out a check  cant you give me cash it aint no easy matter fer me to git a check cashed up here josiah graham did not add that he was afraid the check might be worthless although that was in his mind  i dont carry three hundred dollars in my clothes i can give you fifty in cash though went on the real estate agent as he saw the old mans face fall and if you wish ill get one of the lumber bosses up here to vouch for the check  humph i suppose thet will have to do then buterone thing more mr hopton  what is that  josiah graham leaned forward anxiously  dont you let the boy know about this right away you give me a chanct to tell him myself  just as you wish youre his guardian and ill not interfere with you get the papers and ill give you the check and the cash right now and the real estate agent drew a pocketbook and a checkbook from his inside coat  andy had listened to the conversation with bated breath so far as worldly experience went he was but a boy yet he realized that in some way this mr a q hopton was trying to swindle him out of his inheritance and that his uncle si was willing to aid the schemer just for the sake of getting possession of the three hundred dollars  as his uncle arose to enter the room in which his nephew slept the boy slipped into the cabin like a flash he darted to his bedroom jumped inside and shut and bolted the door after him  hi there whats this cried the real estate dealer in astonishment  itsits the boy my nevvy gasped josiah graham he come in through the back door he must have been alistenin to our talk  is that so thats too bad the real estate agent was dazed by the sudden turn of affairs he had a gun with him  yes he took it with him when he went for work josiah graham walked over to the door and tried it andy open that door  i will not was the answer  was you alistenin to our talk  i was  humph nice thing fer a boy to do  i guess i had a right to listen was the cool answer as he spoke andy was examining the box in which he had stored the papers he found things much disarranged showing that his uncle had gone through the contents during his absence but the papers were there and the sight of them caused him to breathe a sigh of relief  they shant have these papers no matter what happens he said to himself and stuffed the documents into an inside pocket  open thet door commanded josiah graham and his voice now sounded harsh and threatening  i guess you had better teach that boy manners was mr a q hoptons comment  ill teach him sumthin answered the old man open thet door i say an come out here  you want to get those papers said andy he was wondering what to do next  well aint i your guardeen an aint i got a right to em  the papers are mine and im not going to give them up answered andy doggedly i dont like that mr hopton and hes not going to get the papers im going to turn them over to a lawyer  at these words the real estate man was much disturbed  that boy is an imp he said in a low voice id not let him talk to me that way if i were you  i aint goin to answered josiah graham andy you open thet door or ill bust it in  dont you dare break down the door answered andy in increased alarm if you doillillwell remember ive got my gunand its loaded too  dont ye shoot dont ye shoot yelled uncle si in sudden terror and he backed away several steps dont ye dare oh was ever there sech a boy  do you think hed dare to shoot asked the real estate dealer  i dunno hes got lots o spirit sometimes  maybe we had better try to reason with him  all right josiah graham raised his voice andy this is allerfoolishness come out o there  to this the youth did not answer he was considering what he had best do next he did not want to shoot anybody and he was afraid that the two men would in some manner get the better of him and take away the papers  andy do ye hear me come outi aint goin to hurt ye  youll take those papers away from me  he is going to sell me the papers and at a good price broke in a q hopton  i dont want to sellto you answered andy he was moving around the bedroom rapidly having decided on a course of action  im your guardeen an i know wots best broke in josiah graham open the door an no more foolin about it  i dont recognize you as my guardian was andys reply as he spoke he tiptoed his way to the window and opened it then he threw out a small bundle and his gun and game bag followed  i am your guardeen stormed josiah graham you open the door  instead of answering andy pushed a chair to the window in another instant he had mounted it and then he crawled through the opening he landed in a heap in the snow and scrambled up immediately with bundle gun the game bag in his possession he ran back of the shed and then down the road leading to the village  at that minute he did not know where he was going or what he was going to do he had the precious papers in his pocket and his one idea was to keep these away from his uncle and mr a q hopton  ill not go back until ive stored the papers in a safe place he told himself finally i wonder who would keep them for me without asking too many questions  although the sun hung low in the west it was still light and reaching a turn in the road andy stopped to look back much to his chagrin he saw that his flight had already been discovered  they are coming after me he murmured as he saw the horse and cutter flash into view his uncle and the real estate dealer were on the seat and the latter was urging the horse into a run through the heavy snow  unfortunately for andy there was but one road in that vicinity and that ended at the graham cabin on all sides were the pine woods with their scrub timber and underbrush still partly laden with the fall of snow of the week previous  if i stick to the road theyll catch me sure and if i leave it ill have to go right into the woods and theyll easily see my trail he reasoned  he broke into a run and thus managed to pass another bend of the highway behind him he heard the jingle of the sleighbells as the cutter drew closer in a few minutes more his pursuers would be upon him  ill chance it in the woods he muttered and reaching a spot where the undergrowth was thick he leaped between the bushes and then walked on to a clump of pines he was barely under the pines when he heard the cutter dash past the men were talking excitedly but he could not make out what was being said  as the jingle of the sleighbells grew more distant another thought came to andys mind one that made him smile grimly in spite of the seriousness of the situation  might as well return and get something to eat he told himself they wont come back right away  it did not take him long to retrace his steps to the cabin the cutter with its occupants had kept on towards the village so he had the place entirely to himself he quickly found something to eat and to drink and made a substantial meal then he placed a few more of his belongings in his bundle  it wont do for me to stay here as long as i have the papers with me he told himself i guess id better try to get to the old smith cabin for tonight then i can make up my mind what to do in the morning  the smith cabin was a deserted place nearly a mile away to reach it andy had to tramp directly through the woods but the youth did not mind this for he had often been out hunting in the vicinity  i might get a shot at something he mused a rabbit or a couple of birds wouldnt go bad for breakfast  he lost no time in striking out half the distance was covered when he saw a big rabbit directly in his path he blazed away and the game fell dead then he caught sight of a squirrel and brought that down also  now ill have something besides crackers and bacon when im hungry he told himself with satisfaction  soon he came in sight of the old smith place much to his surprise smoke was curling from the chimney and he saw the ruddy glare of an open fire within  somebody is here he thought some hunter most likely wonder who it can be and he strode forward to find out     chapter iv  chet greenes past   hello andy  hello chet i never expected to find you here this is a real pleasure and andy rushed into the old cabin threw down his luggage and grasped another lad by the hand  and i never expected you to come here tonight said chetwood greene as a smile lit up his somewhat square face i thought i was booked to camp here alone what brought you hunting  not exactly its a long story chet say im glad you have a fire im half frozen from tramping through the woods the snow was pretty deep in spots  i know all about it for i have been out all day here draw up to the blaze i was just getting supper ready youve got some game i see i had very little luckthree rabbits and a wild turkey i looked for deer but it was no use  youve got to go pretty well back for deer these days answered andy  thought you were going to strike storburgh for a job  so i did but its the same story everywhere  too bad well you are no worse off than myself im sick of even asking for work ive about made up my mind to try my luck at hunting i guess i can bring down enough to live on and thats better than starving  chetwood greene always called chet for short was about the same age as andy but a trifle taller he had a square chin and dark piercing eyes that fairly shot forth fire when chet was provoked he was a good fellow in the main but he had a hasty temper that occasionally got him into much trouble andy liked him very much and the two boys were more or less chums  there was a mystery surrounding chet which few folks in that district knew many supposed that both of his parents were dead but the fact of the matter was that chets father disappeared when the lad was fourteen years old some thought him dead while others imagined he had run away to escape punishment incidental to a large transaction in lumber some signatures were forged and it was held that tolney greene was guilty he protested his innocence but failed to stand trial running away between two days as it was termed he was traced to new bedford and there it was reported that he had last been seen boarding a sailing vessel outward bound what had become of him after that nobody knew  mrs greene had believed her husband innocent and it grieved her greatly to be thus deserted she tried to bear up however but during the following winter contracted pneumonia and died leaving chet alone in the world  nobody seemed to want anything to do with the ladthinking him the son of a forger and possibly a suicide some tried to talk to him but when they mentioned the supposed guilt of his parent he flew into a rage  my father wasnt guilty and you neednt say so he stormed if you say it ill lick you and then he knocked one man flat he was subdued after a while but he refused utterly to live with those who offered him a home saying he did not want to be an object of charity and that he could get along alone he took his belongings and a little money left by his mother and moved to another part of the stateclose to where andy resided here he lived with an old guide for a while and then got employment at one of the lumber camps the old guide had departed during the past year for the adirondacks and chet was now living alone in a cabin that had seen better days  it had been no easy matter for andy and chet to become chums at first when they met at a lumber camp where both were employed chet was silent and morose but little by little warmed by andys naturally sunny disposition he thawed out and told his story in all its details he knew a few things that the general public did not know and these he confided to andy  my father went off on a whaler named the betsey andrews he once said he said he would come back some day and clear himself the mate wrote to my mother that my fathers mind was affected a little but he hoped he would be all right by the end of the trip  well hasnt the betsey andrews got back yet had been andys question  no  where is she  thats the worst part of itnobody knows  do you think she was lost  i hope notbut i dont know had been chets somewhat sad answer he lived in daily hope of hearing from his parent again  chet knew andys story of josiah grahams meanness and laziness and of the papers left by andys father and he now listened with deep interest to what his chum had to tell about the visit of mr a q hopton and of the escape through the bedroom window  now what do you make of the whole thing chet asked andy after he had finished his recital  it looks to me as if this real estate dealer was mighty anxious to get the papers was the answer and that means that the papers are valuable  just what i think  your uncle has no right to sell em for three hundred dollars or any other amount pursued chet i understand enough about law to know that hes got to get a court order to sell property to my way of thinking hed like to do this on the sly and pocket the three hundred hes no good even if he is your uncle  hes only my fathers halfbrother and he always was a poor stick i wish i knew of some lawyer to go to  why not try mr jennings over at lodgeport ive heard hes a good man and smart too  i might try him but its a twelvemile tramp  never mind ill go along and we may be able to pick up some game on the way answered chet  the boys talked the matter over for two hours during which time chet prepared supper and the two ate it then andy fixed the fire for the night and the boys turned in tired out from their long tramps through the snow  it took some time for andy to get to sleep for the events of the day had disturbed him greatly but at last he dozed off and neither he nor chet awoke until it was daylight  phew but its cold cried chet as he put his head out of doors and it snowed a little last night too  is it snowing now questioned andy anxiously his mind was on the trip to lodgeport a heavy fall of snow might mean much delay  no the storm is clearing away  then let us get breakfast and start  both of the youths had been camping so often that they knew exactly what to do the fire was stirred up and fresh wood put on and they prepared a couple of cups of coffee and broiled two squirrels they had bread and crackers and a little cheese and thus made quite a good breakfast  the meal over they lost no time in packing up and placing the larger portion of their outfits in hiding in the old cabin to carry them to lodgeport would have been too much of a load  we can carry a little food and our guns said chet if we cant get back tonight we can return tomorrow i dont believe anybody will come here during that time  i hope i dont meet uncle sior mr hopton said andy  we can watch out and easily keep out of their way  to get to the road that led to lodgeport the two lads had to cross a heavy patch of timber here under the pines it was intensely cold and they had to move along rapidly to keep their blood in circulation  talk about greenlands icy mountains i guess this is bad enough cried chet as he slapped his hands to keep them warm  well soon be out in the sunlight again answered andy but he was mistaken for by the time they reached the open country once more the sun had gone under a fringe of light clouds so it was as cold as ever  at the end of four miles they passed through one of the lumber settlements and then leaving the wagon road took to a trail running in the neighborhood of moose ridge  i met a man yesterday who was coming out to the ridge to hunt said andy wonder if hell have any success  hunting is not as good as it might be answered his chum the best of the game was killed off at the very beginning of the season still he may get some deer or a moose if hes a good hunter  id like to get a moose myself chet  oh so would i if you see one kindly point him out to me and chets usually serious face showed a grin  i willafter i have brought him down with my gun answered andy and then both laughed  less than fifteen minutes later they came on the trail of a deer the marks were so fresh both boys could not resist the temptation to go after the game they plunged through some bushes and andy went headlong into a hollow  wuow he spluttered as the snow got into his ears and down his neck what a tumble  maybe youre training for a circus cried chet  not out hereand in this cold help me up will you  chet gave his chum a hand and slowly andy came out of the hollow he had dropped his firearm but this was easily recovered from the snowdrift  i dont want another such tumble said the unfortunate one as he tried to get the snow out of his coat collar im cold enough already  once more they went on after the deer but the game had evidently heard their voices and taken fright for when they came to a long open stretch no living creature was in sight  another mile was covered in the direction of lodgeport and then they reached one end of the rock elevation locally termed moose ridge here there was a goodsized cliff with smaller cliffs branching off in various directions  there used to be some good hunting around here said chet as having climbed a small rise they paused to catch their breath i once brought down a dandy buck over yonder  he had scarcely spoken when from a distance ahead there sounded out the crack of a rifle followed a few moments later by a second report  somebody is out cried andy wonder if he hit what he was aiming at  maybe well see come ahead  i hope he isnt shooting this way  the reports came from the top of the big cliff  the two boys moved on keeping their eyes on the alert for the possible appearance of the hunter who had fired the two shots  look look cried andy suddenly and pointing over the top of a small tree that stood between them and the big cliff ahead  what did you see  maybe i was mistaken but i thought i saw a man tumble off the cliff  a man perhaps it was a deer or a moose  no it looked like a man to me come on if he fell to the bottom he may be killed  andy set off as rapidly as the depth of the snow permitted and chet followed in his footsteps soon they rounded half a dozen trees and came in full view of the big cliff both uttered cries of horror and with good reason  halfway down the edge of the cliff was a narrow ledge and on this rested the body of a mana hunter as was shown by his gun and game bag he had tumbled from the top of the cliff and the fall had rendered him unconscious he lay half over the edge of the ledge and was in imminent danger of falling still further and killing himself     chapter v  the man on the ledge   is he dead questioned chet in a strained voice  i dont knowbut i dont think so answered andy he has certainly had a nasty tumble  it looks to me as if he was going to tumble the rest of the way unless he holds on  let us see if we cant help him  both youths stood their guns against a tree and made their way to the bottom of the cliff as they did this they saw the mans body shift slightly and then came a low moan  hes alive cried andy hi there he shouted look out for yourself or youll get another tumble  to this the man on the ledge did not answer but the boys listening intently heard him moan again  i wonder if we can get at him mused chet i dont see any way up the cliff from here do you  oh we must find a way to get to him cried andy  maybe we can catch him if he falls if welook out  andy leaped to one side and the next instant the mans gun dropped down on the rocks and fell in the snow the game bag followed they now saw the man in his unconscious state turn partly over  hell fall sure unless we help him said chet but i dont know what to do  i have it returned his chum come on  where to  ill show you  wondering what his friend had in mind to do chet followed andy to where was located an ash sapling of fair size it had been broken off about two feet above the groundhow they could not tell  we can put that against the cliff and use it as a ladder said andy  provided we can get it over andy  both began to tug at the sapling and at last got it free from the stump end then they fairly rushed with it to the bottom of the cliff  you hold the end and ill raise it up said chet who was a little the stronger of the two we can put the top right against the man and that will keep him from rolling down  if it will reach that far  i think it will  their experience as lumbermen stood them in good stead and while andy kept the bottom of the ash sapling from slipping in the snow his chum raised it slowly but steadily until it stood upright then chet let it go over against the cliff with care so that the man might not be further injured the little tree reached several feet above the mans head  ill go up and see what i can do for him said andy throwing off his overcoat you steady the tree chet  all right but be careful  from early boyhood days andy had been a good climber and he went up the ash sapling with ease the young tree was strong so there was no danger of its breaking beneath his weight soon his feet touched the ledge and he knelt down beside the hurt man  why i know him he called down to his chum hes the man i told you aboutthe one who asked me about the road to moose ridge  pull him back before he has a chance to slip ordered chet and this andy did the movement made the man groan and presently he opened his eyes for an instant  oh what a fall he murmured and then relapsed into unconsciousness again  well have to get him down from here and try to do something for him announced andy he has a bad cut behind his left ear i cant do anything for him up hereits too slippery  cant you climb down the tree with him ill hold it steady  ill try it  andy made his preparations with care for what he proposed to attempt was difficult and dangerous a tumble to the rocks at the foot of the cliff might mean broken limbs if not worse  with care he raised the unconscious form up and placed it over his shoulder then he turned around and inch by inch felt his way out on the sapling  im coming he called hold it chet or well both come down  ill hold it was the confident reply  gripping the knees of the man with his left hand andy held on to the sapling with his right stepping and sliding he came down slowly the young tree bent and threatened once to slip to one side but chet braced it with all his strength in a minute more andy was down and had stretched the man out on the snow the boy was panting from his exertions  i suppose we ought to have a doctor for him said chet as he made an examination of the unfortunate ones wounds but i dont know of any around here  nor do i we cant leave him herehell freeze to death where do you suppose we ought to take him  i dont know of a single place within a mileand i dont suppose we ought to carry him as far as that he may be hurt inside and if he is it wont do to move him too much  much perplexed by the situation which confronted them the two boys talked the matter over it was so cold at the foot of the cliff that to remain there was out of the question at last chet suggested moving to a clump of pine trees where they might fix up some sort of temporary shelter and build a fire they picked up their guns and the belongings of the man and chet took the unfortunate over his shoulder he groaned several times but did not speak or open his eyes  he is certainly hurt quite seriously said andy i hope he doesnt die on our hands  do you know his name or where he comes from  no but i guess we can find that out by looking in his pockets he must have cards or a notebook or something  he looks as if he was well off that gun is an a no 1 piece  yes and look at the fine clothing he is wearing  it was a hard walk and they had to take turns in carrying the unconscious man to add to the gloom of the situation it now commenced to snow again  presently they reached a spot that looked good to them there were a series of rocks to the northward backed up by a thick growth of pines at the foot of the rocks grew some brushwood  chet had calculated to spend some time hunting and had with him a hatchet with which to cut firewood in a very few minutes he had cut out some of the brushwood leaving a cleared space about eight feet square over the top of the cleared space he threw some saplings and pine branches and then wove in pine branches around the sides by this means he soon had a shelter ready which while it was by no means airtight was a great deal better than nothing on the floor of the shelter he placed other pine branches and there he and andy made the suffering man as comfortable as possible as soon as they had reached the spot andy had started up a fire right in front of the opening and this now gave out a warmth that was much appreciated  with some warm water made from melted snow the lads washed the wounds of the man and then bound them up with strips torn from their shirts they used other water for making coffee and poured some of this down the mans throat they also rubbed his hands and wrists doing what they could think of to revive him  in the meantime the snow continued to come down lightly at first and then so thickly that the entire landscape around the shelter was blotted out  its going to be a corker of a storm announced chet as he gazed out  i cant see a thing anywhere was andys answer wonder how long it will last  several hours maybe  i dont see how we are going to get a doctor to come here while it is like this  better not try to find one if you go out you may lose your way  they replenished the fire and cut a good stock of wood and then sat down to watch the man in one of his pockets they found a cardcase  his name is barwell dawson announced andy and he comes from brooklyn  what business is he in  it doesnt say  that the stranger was rich was quite evident he wore a fine gold watch and chain and an elegant diamond ring in one pocket he had a wallet filled with bills of large denomination  he is one of your hightoned sportsmen announced chet some of em come up to maine every fall to hunt  its a wonder he didnt have a guide chet  oh some of em think they can do better without one  suddenly the man opened his eyes wide stared around for a moment and then sat up the change was so unexpected that the boys were amazed  wherewho are you he stammered  youve had a bad fallcame down over the cliff answered andy  what oh yes so i did ii the man felt of his head why im all bandaged up  you got cut pretty badly said chet were wondering if you broke any bones  yes the man gave a little groan im hurt thats sure oh and then he put his hand to his side  you had better keep quiet for a while said andy gently it wont do you any good to stir around wed get a doctor only its snowing so were afraid we might miss the trail  snowing it wasnt snowing when i fell  that was nearly two hours ago  and ive been knocked out all that time the man fell back on the pine boughs no wonder i feel so broken up  he closed his eyes and the boys thought he was going to faint chet got some more coffee  here drink this it will do you good he said and placed the tin cup to the sufferers lips the man gulped down the beverage and it seemed to give him a little strength presently he sat up again  did you two see me take the tumble he questioned with a weak attempt at a smile  i saw you answered andy you didnt come all the way over the cliff you struck a ledge and hung there and we got you down and brought you here  i see  we were afraid some of your bones were broken put in chet are they  i dont know slowly the man moved his arms and his legs he winced a little  all right but my left ankle he announced i reckon that got a bad twist beats the dutch doesnt it he added with another attempt at a smile  its too bad returned andy  no you dont understand i mean my coming to maine to do a little quiet hunting and then to get knocked out like this why ive hunted all over this globethe west india africa and even in the arctic regionsand hardly got a scratch i didnt think anything could happen to me on a quiet little trip like this     chapter vi  a worldwide hunter   the two boys listened to the mans words with keen interest he had hunted in the wild west in india africa and even in the arctic regions surely he was a sportsman out of the ordinary  youre like old tom casey said andy he fought the forest fires here for years and never got singed and then went home one day and burnt his arm on a redhot stove i hope the ankle isnt bad  i cant tell about that until i stand on it give me a lift will you  both boys helped the man to his feet he took a couple of steps and was then glad enough to return to the pine couch  its no usei cant walk yet he murmured  do you think you need a doctor asked chet  hardlyalthough id call him in if he was handy im pretty tough although i may not look it who are you  my name is chet greene and this is a friend of mine andy graham  i am glad to know you and very thankful for what you have done for me ill make it right with you when im able to get around my name is dawsonbarwell dawson im a traveler and hunter and occasionally i write articles for the magazineshunting articles mostly  oh are you the man who once wrote a little book about bearshow they really live and what they do and all that cried andy  yes im the same fellow  ive got that book at homeyou once gave it to my father when i was about eight years old  is that so i dont remember it  my father was up on the penobscot lumbering he went out with you into the woods and you found a honey tree you gave him the book for his little boythat was me  oh yes i remember it now cried barwell dawson so that was your father how is he  my father is dead answered andy and his voice dropped a little  indeed i am sorry to hear it and your mother  she is dead too  then you are alone in the world do you live near  i live two miles from pine run with an uncle it was i who told you how to get to moose ridge when you were driving on the wrong road  oh yes i thought i had seen you somewhere  here the conversation lapsed for barwell dawson was still weak he lay back and closed his eyes and the boys did not disturb him  it continued to snow until the fresh fall covered the old to the depth of several inches the boys kept the campfire going and cooked such game as they had brought along  we are booked to stay here for a while thats certain observed chet no lodgeport today  after a while barwell dawson sat up again and gladly partook of the food offered to him his injuries consisted of a hard shaking up a bruised ankle and several cuts on his head  i am thankful that no bones are broken and that i did not get killed he said and then he requested them to give the details of the rescue from the ledge the boys related their story to which he listened closely  it was fine of you to get me down he declared fine ill have to reward you  i dont want any reward answered andy promptly  nor do i added chet  well you ought to let me do something for you persisted the one who had been rescued  you might tell us of some of your hunting adventures said andy with a smile id like to hear about hunting in the far west and other places  so would i added chet if i had the money id like to do like you have done travel all over the world and hunt and his eyes glistened with anticipation  what do you do now  nothing at present we cant get an opening at any of the lumber camps  i understand business is very dull this season  after that barwell dawson asked for more particulars concerning the boys and they told him how they were situated he was surprised to learn that chet was practically alone in the world  it is certainly hard luck he said kindly you must let me do something for you  then after his ankle had been bathed in hot water and bound up the hunter and traveler told them of his trips to various portions of the globe and how he had hunted deer and moose in one place bears and mountain lions in another and tigers and other wild beasts elsewhere he had two very interested listeners  it must be great murmured chet oh that would suit me down to the groundto go out that way  i have made one trip to the north continued barwell dawson and i am soon going to make another  you mean to canada queried andy  not exactly i am going to greenland and then into the polar regions i want to hunt seals polar bears and musk oxen  youll be frozen to death  hardly answered the hunter on my previous trip i stood the cold very well and this time i shall go much better prepared somehow i like hunting in the arctic circle better than hunting anywhere else besides i wish tobut never mind that now and barwell dawson broke off rather abruptly then he told a story of a hunt after polar bears that made chets eyes water  thats the stuff whispered chet to andy that beats a deer hunt all hollow  yes provided the polar bear doesnt eat you up  huh id not be afraid i dont believe a polar bear is any more dangerous than a moose  i saw a moose just before i had the tumble said barwell dawson i climbed up the cliff after him but i couldnt get very close i took two shots at him but he got away  if we are going to be snowed up here we ought to try for some game said chet maybe i can stir up some rabbits or something  it was decided that he should go out leaving andy to look after mr dawson and the campfire  but dont go far cautioned andy the snow is coming down so thick that you may get lost  oh ill take care of myself answered chet  he knew it would be a bad move to go out into the open so he kept to the timber blazing a tree here and there as he went along he knew very little game would be stirring  if i get anything it will be more accident than anything else he reasoned no animal is going to stir out in this storm  he was just passing under a big spruce tree when chancing to glance up he saw a sight that quickened his pulse on a limb close at hand were several wild turkeys huddled together to keep warm  with great caution he moved to one side to get a good aim then raising his gun he blazed away there was a whirr and a flutter and two of the turkeys came down one dead and the other wounded rushing forward chet caught the wounded bird by the neck and soon put it out of its misery  thats a good start he told himself with much satisfaction i hope my luck continues  placing the game in his bag he went forward again looking for more signs of birds and also for signs of squirrels and rabbits  it was growing dark and chet began to think it was time to turn back when he saw some rabbits in a thick clump of bushes he sprang in after them and they leaped out into the snow and across a small opening then before he could fire they were out of sight again  you shant get away from me as easily as that the youth muttered to himself and ran out into the opening here the snow was so thick he could see but little yet he kept on and soon reached more brushwood he saw some branches close to the snow move and blazed away in the dark  his aim proved true for when he came up he found one rabbit dead another had been wounded as the blood on the snow showed in all haste he made after the limping game but the rabbit had considerable life left in it and dove deep into the brushwood but at last it had to give up and chet secured the additional game without much trouble  it had grown dark rapidly and in some anxiety the young hunter turned back in an endeavor to retrace his steps this was no easy matter for the snow was coming down as thickly as ever and he could scarcely see two yards ahead of him  it wont do for me to get lost out here he reasoned if i dont get back andy will be worried to death  bending to meet the snowfor the wind was now blowing briskly chet pushed forward until another clump of trees was gained walking was becoming irksome and he panted for breath under the trees he paused to get his bearings  i must be right he thought yet try his best he could not locate any of the trees he had blazed a short while before  any other lad might have become frightened at the prospect but chet was used to being alone and he simply resolved to move forward with increased caution  if the worst comes i can fire three shots in succession andy will know what that means he reasoned on previous trips to the woods the boys had arranged that three shots meant i am lost where are you a single shot was to be the answerrepeated of course as often as necessary  another hundred feet were covered and chet was looking vainly for one of the blazed trees when an unexpected sound broke upon his ears  it was an unusual and uncanny noise and he stopped short to listen it came from a clump of spruces to his left  now what can that be he asked himself i never heard a noise like that before  he listened and presently the sound was repeated to him it seemed as if some unseen giant were in deep distress  chet was not superstitious or he might have thought he heard a ghost he knew there must be some rational reason for the unusual noise and he resolved to investigate  anybody there he cried as he raised his gun in front of him and tried to peer through the snowladen air  there was no answer nor was the peculiar sound repeated with cautious steps he advanced toward the clump of spruces underneath all was now as dark as night could make it  again he paused something warning him to be extra cautious his nerves were now at a high tension for he felt something unusual was coming  an instant later it came through the snow and darkness chet caught a momentary gleam of a pair of eyes shining like two balls of fire then a bulky form shot out of the darkness and bumped up against him hurling him flat ere he could arise the form leaped over him and went limping off puffing and snorting as it did so  a moose gasped chet as he felt in the snow for his gun and wounded it must be the one mr dawson tried to get  he thought the big beast was retreating but soon found out otherwise the moose was badly wounded and ugly in the extreme around he wheeled and then came straight for chet the lad could not locate his gun and feeling his peril darted for the nearest tree and leaped high up among the branches     chapter vii  chet and the moose   phew that was a narrow escape  such were chets words as he drew himself higher up into the tree the big beast below had come up and struck the tree a blow that made it shiver from top to bottom had he not been holding on tightly the boy would have been hurled down and at the very feet of the moose  the animal was fullgrown powerful and with wide and heavy antlers he had been wounded in one of the forelegs but was still able to stand now he stood under the spruce on three legs gazing up at chet speculatively  like to smash me wouldnt you murmured the youth well i guess notnot if i know it  chet wished with all his heart that he had his gun but the weapon was out of sight under the snow and the moose was standing over the spot  what to do next the lad did not know the moose did not show any inclination to leave he breathed heavily as if his wound hurt him but chet was certain that there was still a good deal of fight in the creature  perhaps hell keep me here all night thought the boy dismally  presently an idea came to him to call for help andy might hear him and come up with his gun  that shelter is a long way off but it wont do any harm to try it chet reasoned and expanding his chest he let out a yell at the top of his lung power he repeated the cry several times and then listened with strained ears no answer came back but the gentle sighing of the rising wind as it swept through the woods  huddled inside the shelter i suppose to keep warm chet murmured dismally i might yell my head off and it wouldnt do a bit of good ill have to try something else  what that something else was to be was not clear he moved from one branch to another to investigate then a thought struck him and he resolved to act upon it  with caution so as not to attract the attention of the moose he climbed far out on a branch of the spruce and thus gained a grip on the widespreading limb of another tree he swung himself to this and crawling along and past the trunk of the second tree moved to the end of a branch on the opposite side  he was now a good twentyfive feet from where the moose was standing would it be wise to drop down in the snow and make a dash for liberty  if he catches me hell kill mehes so ugly from that wound chet told himself if it wasnt so awful cold id stay here till morning  cautiously he lowered himself toward the snow below he was on the point of dropping when he heard the moose move the animal came on the rush and in drawing up into the tree again chet had one foot scraped by the mooses antlers  no escape that way he told himself and lost no time in pulling himself still higher into the tree  thus far he had managed to keep warm but now as he sat down to rest and to study the situation he became colder and colder occasionally the wind drove in some of the snow to add to his discomfort  presently chet thought of another idea and wondered why it had not occurred to him before he knew that all wild animals dread fire he resolved to make himself a torch and try that on the moose  making sure that he had his matches he got out his jackknife and cut off the driest branch that he could find then holding it with care he struck a match shielding it from the wind as best he could and lit the end of the branch at first it did not ignite very well but he nursed the tiny flame and soon it blazed up into quite a torch  now well see how you like this chet muttered and started to climb to the lower branch once more  with eyes that still blazed the moose had watched the flaring up of the light at first he was all curiosity but as the flame grew larger he gave a snort of fear far back in the past he had felt the effects of a forest fire and now he thought he saw another such conflagration starting up as chet swung down he turned and limped off moving faster at every step  hurrah that did the trick cried the boy in deep satisfaction and then as he saw the moose plowing off through the deepening snow he jumped to the ground and rushed off to where he had dropped his gun perhaps he could lay the beast low after all  as luck would have it chet did not have to look long for the firearm the moose had kicked the snow from part of the barrel and the glare of the torch lit upon this in a trice the youth had the gun in his hand the moose was disappearing in the snow and darkness but taking hasty aim he fired  the animal went on but chet felt certain his shot had gone true hastily reloading so that he might have both barrels ready in case he wanted them he set off after the game as fast as the now heavy fall of snow would allow he was a true sportsman and made up his mind that now he had his firearm once again the moose should not escape him  as is well known although a moose is one of the swiftest of wild animals on clear ground or even on the rocks and in the woods the creature is at a disadvantage in soft snow because of its small legs and hoofs its weight causes it to sink to the very bottom of every hollow  chet had advanced less than two hundred feet when he saw the moose floundering in the snow behind some bushes over which it had leaped  now ive got you cried the boy and advancing fearlessly he took careful aim and blazed away the animal went down thrashed around sending the snow in all directions and then lay still  not to be caught in any trap chet reloaded once more and then came up with caution but the big creature was dead and the heart of the young hunter bounded with delight it was an event to lay low such a monarch of the forest as this  as big a moose as ive seen brought in from these parts he mused wont andy be surprised when he sees the game but mr dawson deserves some of the credithe hit the moose first  what to do with his prize chet did not know to haul it to the temporary camp alone and through such deep snow was impossible and if he left it where it was some wolves or other wild beasts might get at it  ill kick the snow over it and let it go at that he finally decided its time i got back its so dark it wont be long before i cant see a thing  sticking his torch in the snow he made a mound over the game and on top stuck a stick with his handkerchief tied to it then he retraced his steps to the clump of spruces and searched once again for the blazes he had made on the trees  at last just as he was about to shoot off his gun as a signal of distress he found one of the blazes and a minute later discovered another he now had the proper direction in mind and set off as rapidly as his weary limbs and the everincreasing depth of snow would permit  hullo chet where are you  it was a call from andy sounding out just as the young hunter came in sight of the campfire andy was growing anxious and had come forth from the shelter several times in an endeavor to locate his chum  here i am was the answer christopher but im tired  any luck  a little how are those for wild turkeys  fine now well have a good breakfast anyway  how is mr dawson  he says he feels pretty easy but his ankle is badly swollen say hes a splendid man and one of the greatest hunters you ever heard of chet and hes rich toohe owns a ranch out west and a bungalow down on the jersey coast and a yacht and i dont know what all  you can tell him i brought down the moose he wounded  what and andys eyes showed his astonishment  its true the moose almost laid me low first but i got the best of him after all  where is the animal  about a quarter of a mile from here i covered him with snow and put a stick and my handkerchief over the spot  did he attack you  he certainly did answered chet  both boys entered the temporary shelter barwell dawson was awake and he and andy listened with keen attention to the story chet had to tell  it must have been the moose i hit said barwell dawson but i think hes your game anyway chet  well we can divide up answered the young hunter modestly  the tramp in the snow and the excitement had made chet weary and he was glad enough to lie down and go to sleep during his absence andy had cut more pine boughs and piled them around the sides and on top of the shelter so it was now fairly cozy although not nearly as good as a cabin would have been  in the morning andy was the first to stir he found the entrance to the shelter blocked by snow and the campfire was all but out the snow had stopped coming down but the air seemed to be still full of it  weve got to get out of here or well be snowed in for certain he told chet and then kicked the snow aside and started up the fire and commenced to get breakfast they cooked one of the wild turkeys and it proved delicious eating to the lads although mr dawson thought the meat a trifle strong  the man who had had the tumble over the cliff declared that he felt quite like himself aside from his ankle which still pained him the swelling of the member had gone down some which was a good sign  i guess your uncle will wonder what has become of you said chet to andy i suppose hell hunt all over the village for you  let him hunt chet i am not going back until i find out about that timber land and about what sort of man that hopton is the more i think of it the more im convinced that mr a q hopton is a swindler and is trying to swindle both uncle si and myself  well its no credit to your uncle to stand in with him  of course it isntand ill give uncle si a piece of my mind when i get the chance  i dont think youre going to get to lodgeport today  well it doesnt matter much i dont think there is any great hurry about this business the matter has rested ever since father died  this talk took place outside the shelter so barwell dawson did not hear it inside the man dressed his ankle while the boys cleared away the remains of the morning meal and started the fire afresh with more pine sticks  we really ought to try to get out of here said andy after an hour had passed i think it will snow again by night and it would be rough to be snowbound in such a place as this  id like to get out myself but i am afraid i cant walk said barwell dawson with a sigh a bruised ankle is worse than a broken armwhen it comes to traveling he added with a grim smile  supposing we took turns at carrying you suggested chet i think we could do it  how far  well we might try for a cabin that is about threequarters of a mile from here wed be far more comfortable at the cabin than hereand maybe you could get some liniment for your bruises  well im willing to try it if you are answered mr dawson who did not like the temporary shelter any better than did the boys  preparations were accordingly made and half an hour later the party of three set off it was agreed that chet should first do the carrying of the hurt one and andy brought up the rear with the guns game bags and other things     chapter viii  a talk of importance   the cabin for which the little party was headed was one owned by a man named upham jeffer this man was something of a hermit and scientist and rarely showed himself in the settlements of that vicinity but on two occasions chet had done professor jeffer a good turn and he was therefore hoping they would get a cordial reception  but just now the main question was could they reach the jeffer place the boys had the way fairly well fixed in their heads but walking was hard and treacherous on the level the snow was at least a foot deep while they ran the risk of going down in deep hollows filled by the wind  anyway im glad the wind is on our backs said andy as they trudged along if it was in our faces it would be awful  you must take frequent rests came from barwell dawson there is no use in exhausting yourselves by hurrying  when about onequarter of the distance had been covered they rested and then chet and andy exchanged loads they had now some rough ground to cover and of a sudden andy went down in a hollow taking the man he was carrying with him  be careful cried chet in alarm  andy and mr dawson rolled over and over and landed in snow up to their necks fortunately the fall was a soft one or both might have been seriously injured  chet threw down his load and aided the pair to get out of the hollow andy came out with a neck full of snow and his coat half off his back  say i dont want any more of that he panted digging the snow from one ear  in a few minutes they went on again chet with the outfit taking the lead progress was slow and all were glad to rest when the top of a small rise was gained  there is the jeffer cabin said chet pointing it out  i dont see any smoke added andy what shall we do if professor jeffer isnt at home  oh i dont think hes away answered his chum but even so i guess hell let us use the placein such a snow as this  we can pay him for the accommodations put in barwell dawson ill take care of that  it was nearly noon when they gained the cabin rather a large structure set in a grove of pines and on the edge of a brook that was now covered with snow and ice chet who was in advance knocked loudly on the door  at first there was no answer then a low voice asked who was there  it is i chet greene professor  oh come inif you can get the door open  chet tried the doorto find it bolted then he heard a movement within and the barrier was opened  oh i thought you were alone said the man within he was tall and thin and wore a heavy beard and big spectacles  no professor jeffer this is my friend andy graham and this is a gentleman who fell over moose ridge cliff and got hurt can we bring him in  why yes certainly of course cried upham jeffer hurt eh where  he has a bruised ankle and some cuts on his head  i see well bring him in and what remedies i have on hand shall be at his service im a bit sick myselfbeen making some experiments with nitrogen that didnt agree with me you see i reasoned out that if nitrogen could be dissolved by means of  where can i place the gentleman broke in chet who knew upham jeffers weakness for going off into scientific discussions  oh yes of course i forgot why place him anywhere make yourselves at home the old scientist looked around rather helplessly there is my medicine closet use whatever you can find there  he was really a fine old man but so wrapped up in his scientific experiments that he paid little attention to the world at large or what was going on around him he was very learned but apt to be forgetful to the last degree he lived alone and it was reported that he had a goodly sum in the bank certainly he never seemed to want for funds although his mode of living was far from extravagant  barwell dawson was placed in an easychair in the living apartment and the professor busied himself in getting out some medicine and a liniment which he said would do much good  shall i start up the fire asked andy who saw that the blaze had been allowed to die down  why yes of course i forgot all about the fire answered upham jeffer you see when i get interested in my experiments i usually and then he stopped talking being busy measuring some medicine in a glass  andy stirred up the fire and brought in some wood from a pile in a nearby shed in the meantime chet introduced barwell dawson to the old scientist  why i know you sir cried mr dawson as he looked closely at the professor werent you once up northwith the welber exploring expedition  why yes of course answered professor jeffer and youit seems to me your face looks familiar why yes i have it now you were up there at the same time on a hunting trip  youve struck it i am glad to meet you again professor jeffer  i have forgotten your name mr  dawsonbarwell dawson  ah yes of course i remember it well now strange how i should forget but you know i am so wrapped up in my experiments that ibut let us stop talking and attend to this ankle of yours well wash it well with hot water and pour on this liniment and the swelling will soon go down you see the curative qualities of witch hazel when combined with wintergreen and and then the professor stopped and went to work  inside of half an hour barwell dawsons hurts had all been attended to and he felt much better the cuts on his head had stopped bleeding and he insisted upon having the bandages removed  im not such a baby as you think he said ill be all right by tomorrow watch and see all i want is a good smoke to cure me and he lit his briarroot pipe  ill be glad to hear it answered andy  nevertheless dont imagine that i dont appreciate what you two lads have done for me went on mr dawson earnestly it was a fine thing to do and ill not forget it in a hurry  it had begun to snow again and all three were glad that they had exchanged the temporary shelter in the woods for the large and comfortable cabin of the old professor the cabin was well furnished and on the walls hung horns and skins of various wild animals there were a goodsized table and some chairs and in one corner stood a bookcase with a hundred volumes or more opening out of the living room were a kitchen and two bedrooms it was in the kitchen that professor jeffer had been conducting the experiments which had made him ill a powerful odor filled the air of the apartment and to get rid of it chet opened a window for a while  i should have had something open when i tried the experiment said the professor but i became so interested that i forgot if you hadnt come when you did i dont know what would have happened  you want to be careful in the future professor said barwell dawson science cannot afford to lose a man like you and this latter remark tickled the old scientist very much he was really quite learned and he was glad to have it known  if this snow keeps on well have to stay here all night said andy to chet  you are welcome to remain as long as the storm lasts answered professor jeffer who overheard the remark i have a wellfilled larder and with what you have brought we can get along very well  we have a moose about a mile from hereif only we could bring him here said chet  im afraid your game will have to wait if you went for it now youd surely get lost it is snowing furiously  what the professor said about the storm was true the snow was accompanied by a high wind which whistled loudly around the cabin all of the party were glad enough to gather in front of the big open fireplace for that was the one spot that was thoroughly warm  as they sat around chet told in detail his story of the moose and then the boys listened while barwell dawson and professor jeffer related some things that had happened to them when they had met in the far north  i should like exceedingly to take another trip to the polar regions said the professor the other trip was too short for me i did not gain half the knowledge i desired  i am going up there again answered barwell dawson quietly  ah indeed when  as soon as my ship is ready for me  your ship are you equipping a ship demanded professor jeffer while the boys listened in astonishment  i am i have not said much about it as yet for i did not want to excite public comment but i am fitting out a ship for polar exploration and barwell dawson smiled quietly as if fitting out such an expedition were an everyday occurrence  why really youyou astonish me cried the professor this is most extraordinary sir are you may i ask fitting out this ship yourself  i am footing the bill yes  it will cost a large amount of money  i guess i can afford it i am fairly welltodo and last year an uncle died and left me several hundred thousand dollars  i seevery good professor jeffer rubbed his hands together it is a grand thing to be able to gratify ones wish in this manner now i have a little money but not enough to fit out such an expedition as you mention still id like very much to go north again  could you stand the trip  me why sir i am as strong as ironyou can ask captain welber about it i withstood the cold and the hardships long after some of the others succumbed i am a little weak just nowthe effects of that foolhardy experimentbut by tomorrow ill be as well and strong as ever why sir i can tramp twenty or thirty miles a day with ease and i can go fortyeight hours without food if it is necessary  are you anything of a hunter  yes since i came to maine i have done considerable shooting  indeed he has broke in chet ive been with him and i know of three firstclass shots that he made  any one who is to go with me must be a good shot and must be able to withstand great hardships pursued barwell dawson  how long do you expect to be gone asked professor jeffer with increased interest  i dont know exactlyperhaps two years  two yearsin the land of ice and snow cried andy thats a pretty long trip  yes but i have planned to do a great deal answered barwell dawson as i stated before i dont want to say too much about it yet for if i do ill have all sorts of curiosity seekers at my heels if some folks knew what i had in mind to do theyd be crazy to be taken along  well i presume i am one of the crazy ones returned professor jeffer  with you professor it is different you have been to the far north and know what to expectand besides you are learned and your knowledge might prove valuable  ah then you will agree that i shall go demanded the scientist eagerly  that depends i have not told you all yet i am going to the far north to hunt but i am likewise going for something elsesomething of greater importance  and that is asked the professor while the boys listened in wonder  i am going to try to reach the north pole     chapter ix  something about the north pole   it was with much amazement that andy and chet as well as professor upham jeffer listened to the words of barwell dawson  going to try to reach the north pole repeated andy  yes  its never been doneat least not by anybody who came back alive said chet  a grand project nevertheless were professor jeffers words a truly grand project but have you counted the costi do not mean in money it may cost you your life  i shall be as careful in my plans as possible answered barwell dawson his eyes lit up and he arose to his feet i dont mind telling you that to reach the north pole has been my ambition ever since i first went hunting in the arctic regions  it has been the dream of many men said professor jeffer i once had the dream myselfi presume all those who go to the north have it  its a good long journey from maine said andy  how do you expect to get there asked chet you cant take a ship that far no matter how strongly she is built  i shall do as the majority of north pole explorers do was barwell dawsons answer i shall sail as far north as the ship will go then winter in the ice and as soon as summer comes again make a dash over the ice for the pole with dogs sledges and esquimaux  it will assuredly be a grand trip said professor jeffer i envy you  you would like to go with me  very much sir i have absolutely nothing to keep me here being alone in the world  then perhaps it can be arranged  i have here some books and maps relating to polar discoveries continued the professor perhaps you wont mind pointing out on the maps what you hope to do  he brought from the bookcase several books and maps and placed them on the table the boys who were sitting on the floor near the open fireplace took them down and gazed at them with interest here was something that was surely new and novel  i have a larger map in my bedroom went on professor jeffer ill get that  while he was gone the two boys and mr dawson pored over the books and maps and the hunter mentioned a place on one of the maps where he had once gone hunting  here is the coast of greenland he said pointing it out i shall take my vessel up baffin bay as far as cape york and possibly to etahand maybe further if the ice will permit there we shall have to spend the long arctic night  how long asked andy  from october to february  what as long as that cried chet wont there be any sun at all during that time  no sunshine but i think we can look for good moonlight especially when the moon is full  and how long is it going to take to get to the north pole from etah asked andy that is what do you calculate  i havent any idea excepting that i shall try to carry enough food to last for the entire summer and i shall also do all the hunting possible so long as there is any game in sight i do not expect to find any in the vicinity of the pole  and what do you think is at the pole questioned chet  ice and snow principally answered barwell dawson smiling i do not look for anything out of the ordinary it is only the honor of having been able to reach that point  and a great honor it will be said professor jeffer as he reentered with another map  i suppose a whole lot of men have tried to reach the pole said chet  yes explorers from all over europe as well as from america have tried their hand at it answered barwell dawson  one of the books i have here tells of the various american expeditions said professor jeffer thumbing over a volume rapidly ah here it is you ought to read itit is very interesting  i have read over the accounts many timestrying to map out a route of my own said barwell dawson  then he told the boys of what had been done by various explorers to lift the mystery of the frozen north  one of the wellknown arctic explorers was sir john franklin an englishman said he franklin was lost somewhere up north and when he did not return various expeditions were sent out for his relief the first from america was that commanded by lieutenant e j de haven of the united states navy in 1851 de haven reached 78° n he was followed three years later by elisha kent kane who sailed north by way of smith sound and gained 80° 35 n lat  how far was that from the pole questioned chet whose knowledge of degrees and latitude was rather hazy  the highest degree is ninety which is at the pole explained the professor roughly speaking a degree of latitude is equal to seventy miles  then kane was still nearly seven hundred miles from the pole  about six hundred and fifty  after kane continued barwell dawson commodore john rodgers commanded an expedition that went through bering strait and reached herald island at 71° 18 n lat then in 1860 isaac l hayes reached grinnell land at cape joseph goode and from 1860 to 1869 charles f hall explored the cumberland gulf and reached the polar sea northwest of greenland in 82° 11 n  that was crawling a little closer was andys comment  after that explorations were made by lieutenant p h ray lieutenant g a doane and commander george w de long all of the government service the latter explored the arctic ocean to the coast of asia then followed the international polar expedition under lieutenant afterwards general a w greely of the united states army this expedition reached a point north of 83° 24  what about peary asked chet i know he is a great polar explorer  i was going to speak of him answered barwell dawson commander robert e peary is the greatest polar explorer we have had he has been at it since 1892 and during that time he has covered the entire northern portion of greenland the northern portion of grinnell land and a goodly portion of the arctic ocean on april 21 1906 he managed to reach 87° 6 n latwithin less than two hundred miles of the pole  its a pity he couldnt make the two hundred milesafter going so far was andys comment  he is now fitting out another expedition said professor jeffer i believe he will keep at it until he gains the pole  there have been numerous other expeditions under walter wellman robert stein a p low e p baldwin and some canadian explorers continued mr dawson but nobody has been able to equal commander pearys record  its a wonder that somebody doesnt try to reach the pole with an airship said chet  one explorer intends to try that a european explorer andree once went up from spitzbergen in a balloon and he was never heard of again its a dangerous piece of business for one cannot tell where one is going to land and to get much in the way of supplies in that forsaken portion of the globe is out of the question  maybe somebody will reach the pole with an aeroplane suggested andy  not all the exploring has been done by the americans resumed barwell dawson one of the greatest foreign explorers was dr fridtjof nansen a norwegian he made a memorable voyage in a vessel named the fram and managed to reach 86° 14 n lat  almost as high as commander peary got cried chet  another explorer of note was the duke of the abruzzi an italian who sailed for franz josef land and wintered at teplitz bay in 1899 and 1900 the duke managed to reach 86° 33 n lat thus doing a trifle better than nansen  good for the duke said chet  you certainly know a lot about the pole said andy admiringly youve got it on your fingers ends  ever since i took the question up seriously i have read everything i could find on the subject answered barwell dawson i do not intend to go at this in a haphazard fashion my ship is going to be fitted out with the best possible carereënforced throughout the entire hull to resist the ice pressureand i shall pick my crew from among the strongest and bravest fellows i can find to take a weakling on board would be foolhardy for he could never stand the cold  i suppose it is much colder than here in maine said chet  yes although not always even in upper greenland the weather is at times comparatively mild the worst time is the long night as it is termed then it is not only bitterly cold but darkness is apt to take the heart out of a fellow some men cannot stand the night at all and nearly go crazy but i have never been affected that way  give me a good lamp and i shall not mind it said professor jeffer i would spend the time in profitable reading or in writing a book or magazine article  when you were up there hunting did you sail along the greenland coast asked chet suddenly  of course  did you ever meet any whalers  oh yes quite a number some of them go north quite a distance they have to sail many miles to get the right kind of whales  did youdid you ever meet a whaler named the betsey andrews  the betsey andrews mused barwell dawson where was she from  from new bedford captain jacob spark  why yes i did what do you know of her  i dont know much excepting that my father sailed on her some years ago and the vessel has failed to come backso far as i know  thats too bad so far as i can remember the ship was all right when i saw her if i remember rightly however our captain said he thought she was pretty far north for a whaler  do you think she was wrecked in a storm  i dont know we did have some pretty fierce storms just before i landed to go hunting i know one storm came up right after a dense fog and it nearly ran us into a tremendous iceberg  maybe an iceberg sunk the betsey andrews said chet and his voice quivered a little in spite of his effort to control himself  have you made inquiries about the whaler lately asked professor jeffer you know there is a regular record kept of all marine disasters  i didnt know where to goor who to write to answered chet i hated to bother strangers  but you want to find your father dont you asked barwell dawson  oh very much  then well have to look into this matterwhen this storm clears away and we are able to get out of here  after that the hunter questioned chet about his parent and the youth told him how his father had shipped aboard the whaler he did not mention that tolney greene had disappeared under a cloud as it did not seem necessary and chet wanted to avoid anything that was so unpleasant  following this barwell dawson told more of his proposed trip north now that he had revealed what was on his mind he was very enthusiastic and he communicated a great deal of his enthusiasm to his listeners  you must take me along cried professor jeffer i will pay my waythat is so far as i am ableand i will promise not to be a hindrance youll certainly want one scientist on your expedition even though it is not what you might term a scientific expedition  i will give the matter every consideration answered barwell dawson and if i can possibly arrange it you shall become one of the party  how many will there be asked chet  outside of the captain and the crew i do not expect to carry more than five or six men of course up in greenland i shall hire a number of esquimaux to do some hunting for me and to manage the dogs and sledges  chet said no more just then but he was wondering if it would aid him to find his father if he should join this expedition to the frozen north  id be willing to suffer anythingif only i could learn where dad was he told andy afterwards     chapter x  bringing in some game   the snowstorm proved such a heavy one that for three days the party at professor jeffers cabin were completely stormbound once andy and chet went outin an endeavor to bring the dead moose in but were unable to accomplish their object  during the time spent at the cabin the boys became very well acquainted with barwell dawson and found the hunter and explorer a person very much to their liking although he was rich and well educated he did not act as if he considered himself above them he took a lively interest in all they had to tell and knew how to draw them out so that almost before he knew it andy had related the details of his troubles with his shiftless uncle si and with the mysterious mr a q hopton  more than likely that fellow hopton will bear close watching said barwell dawson if he is a sharperand it looks as if he might behe will try to swindle both you and your uncle it was very unwise for your uncle to try to do business with him without seeing a lawyer  uncle si wanted to get the money without my knowing it answered andy bitterly he was glad to open his heart to somebody who could understand him  i believe youand that is not to your uncles credit you say he is shiftless and lazy  veryand everybody around here knows it  then he is not fit to be your guardian  i dont believe he is legally he just said he was going to be thats all  well that doesnt make him so answered the hunter with a grim smile  with andy he went over the papers the boy had brought from home they seemed to prove that the lads father owned a divided interest in a large tract of timber in the upper portion of michigan the papers had evidently been drawn up by somebody who knew very little about legal matters and the phraseology was highly perplexing after poring over them for an hour and asking professor jeffers advice barwell dawson shook his head slowly  i think it is an honest claim and in your fathers favor he said but it will take a skillful lawyer to unravel it certainly your father bought something and paid for it for here are the words one thousand dollars the receipt of which from andrew s graham is hereby admitted the writer meant acknowledged but i guess admitted is good enough  i was going to take it to a lawyer in lodgeport  is he a reliable man andy  i dont knowi suppose so  well supposing you let me look into this matter with you i am in no hurry to get away from these parts and i feel that you ought to let me do something in return for what you and chet did for me  ill be very glad to have your help mr dawsonif you can spare the time  i hope the claim proves of valuefor i take you to be the kind of a lad who deserves to get along said barwell dawson smiling  during the time spent in the cabin barwell dawson and professor jeffer discussed the trip to the far north in many details and the hunter even traced out an imaginary route on one of the scientists maps both men were equally enthusiastic and after mr dawson had asked the professor some more questions about himself he at last consented that the latter should become one of the exploring party  but remember he said impressively if you suffer great hardships or lose your life nobody must blame me  trust me no one will be blamed but myself answered professor jeffer with equal gravity then his face beamed it will be a wonderful trip wonderful and we shall see so many new thingsmake so many interesting discoveries i shall take along a set of the best instruments available and make all sorts of observations such a record alone will be worth all it costs to get it  i do not doubt it professor  and then the famethink of it the fame why sir if we succeed in gaining the north poleor even if we succeed in going above commander pearys highest mark latitude 87° 6it will be something for the entire civilized world to know  true  from today on i shall go into the hardest kind of training continued professor jeffer i shall fit myself to withstand the most intense hunger and the most intense cold it is the only way  it is certainly a good idea answered barwell dawson it wont do to go up north soft as they call it  on the morning of the fourth day it cleared and andy and chet decided to go out once more after the moose mr dawsons ankle was now well but he did not want to try walking a long distance on it just yet  you can get your game today he said and we can start for lodgeport tomorrow there ill see that lawyer for andy and then ill try to return to my camp back of moose ridge and see what the storm did to it  if you want me to ill go back to the ridge with you said chet i havent anything else to do now that i cant get work at one of the lumber camps  very well ill be glad of your company  andy and chet were soon on their way to where the latter had left the moose fortunately they had been able to borrow snowshoes from professor jeffer who owned several pairs both lads knew how to use the articles and glided over the newly fallen snow with ease  just imagine we were bound for the north pole cried andy wouldnt it be great  id like to look for my father andy and chets face clouded  oh chet im sorry i spokei didnt want to remind you  oh its all right andy if i dont hear from my father soon id like firstrate to go north with mr dawsons expedition  i dont think hed want to bother with boys  we are not so very young and both of us know how to rough itand we are pretty good shots too  i guess youve been thinking about it pretty strongly  havent you  yes i have mr dawson seems to be such a splendid man the trip ought to be fine even if the north pole wasnt reached  just my idea we would do lots of hunting and riding behind the esquimaux dogs just think of being on a sledge with eight or ten dogs to pull you over the ice and snow  and the thermometer 50° below zero dont forget it is fearfully cold up there  well its mighty cold here sometimes anyway id like to goif hed take me  same herebut he doesnt want boys he wants men and tough ones too  so the talk ran on as the boys made their way to the clump of spruces where chet had had his adventure at a distance they saw the stick with the handkerchief deep in the snow  well there is your landmark anyway said andy i hope nobody disturbed the game  it looks all right answered his chum but of course the snow would cover any tracks even if the game was disturbed  with eager hands they uncovered the mound and soon brought to light the big moose with his widespreading antlers  certainly a dandy cried andy as he surveyed the game you can be thankful he didnt hit you before you reached the tree chet he would have smashed you into a jelly  well as it was he caused mr dawson a bad fall  the boys went back to the trees and after a careful inspection took a hatchet and cut a long branch for a drag on this they bound the deer and then started on the return to professor jeffers cabin hauling their load behind them  it was hard work to make progress through the deep snow and they had to rest several times to catch their breath  i think we had better take the long way around said chet after half the distance had been covered we cant very well get up the hill this side of the cabin and besides there is a bad gully to cross this side of the brook  you show the way answered his chum you know these parts a little better than i do  by the new route they had to pass through a patch of woods where the snow made the branches of the trees hang low it was hard work to pass between some of the trees and once it looked as if they would have to turn back  we are earning this meat was andys comment as he paused to pick up the cap that a branch had swept from his head  looks like it answered chet laconically  i guess we should have waited until the weather was better  now as it chanced chet was as tired as andy and consequently his quick temper showed itself  you didnt have to come for the moose if you didnt want to he cried quickly  oh im not complaining chet  its the same thing  not at alland there is no cause for you to get mad about it  well then dont find fault im pulling as hard on this load as you  i know it we made a mistake to come this way i am afraid  oh yes thats youblame that on me too chet now looked thoroughly angry ive a good mind to leave the old moose where he is and he let go of the branch on which the game rested  chet  andy uttered the name reproachfully and gazed fearlessly into his chums eyes there was an awkward pause then the face of the quicktempered youth grew red  well i dont care he began and took hold of the drag again  yes you do careand i care too we cant afford to quarrel and all over nothing come on well get through somehow said andy  guess i said too much murmured chet and began to haul on the load as if his life depended upon it i thoughtoh andy theres a shot for us  the quicktempered lad who was equally quickeyed stopped and pointed to a tree some distance on their right andy saw something move but could not make out what it was  partridge announced his companion and swung his gun around im going to take a shot when they go up  he glided over the snow and andy came behind him then up went four partridge with a whirr that would have startled one not accustomed to the sound bang went chets gun and bang came the report of andys immediately after two of the partridges came fluttering down while the two others circled around in a helpless dazed fashion  we must get those too cried chet and blazed away again and then andy took another shot down came the game and the boys glided forward to secure the prizes the partridges were of good size and plump and the lads gazed at them and turned them over in deep satisfaction  well prove to mr dawson that we can hunt cried chet his recent ill humor had completely disappeared  in getting back to where they had left the moose andy struck an icy rock and rolled over and over in the snow chet was compelled to laugh but quickly subsided thinking his chum might be angry but though he had hard work to get up and secure the game he had been carrying andy retained his peace of mind  fortune of war he said as he dug the loose snow from his clothing birr but its cold  want to go to the north pole now said chet quizzically  this minute if i had the chance was the quick reply  the partridges were tied on top of the moose and once again the two lads headed for the cabin soon they came in sight of the place and set up a loud whistling which brought the two men to the door  a fine moose cried barwell dawson and fine partridge too  dont you think we are pretty fair hunters asked chet  firstclass returned mr dawson     chapter xi  a serious loss   having brought their game around to the shed attached to the cabin the boys were glad enough to rest before the generous fire while professor jeffer proceeded to cut out some choice moose meat having been requested by barwell dawson to do so  the moose is yours mr dawson said to the boys but i must have at least one steak although it may be rather tough  you can have as much as you like answered chet i dont think andy wants it all and i am sure i dont  darkness was settling down once more around the cabin when andy chanced to think of the papers concerning the land claim in michigan he had placed them in an inside pocket of his jacket and now he inserted his hand to bring them forth to make certain that they were safe  oh he cried and his heart began to beat wildly  whats the matter queried chet who was near hurt  the papers  what of them  they are gone  gone repeated chet and now professor jeffer and barwell dawson listened with interest  yes gonei cant find them anywhere andy rapidly went through every pocket in his clothing and in the overcoat he had hung on a horn yes they are gone he groaned oh this is the worst luck yet  but they must be somewhere around said barwell dawson have you any idea where you dropped them  no although it might have been when i took that tumble in the snow  if you lost em there we ought to go back for em right away declared chet the wind is rising and that will drift the snow over em  a vain search was made around the cabin and the shed and then tired as he was andy donned his overcoat and cap to go out chet did the same  oh you neednt mind chet said andy  i just will mind andy we are going to get those papers back was the brisk reply  here take a lantern said professor jeffer and brought forth an acetylene lamp similar to those used on bicycles that ought to help you find the papers he added  in a minute more the two lads had set off through the snow as chet had said the wind was rising and it often caught the snow up in a mad whirl and hurled it into their faces  phew this is not so pleasant panted chet when they paused to catch their breath having covered about a quarter of the distance to where andy had fallen takes the wind right out of a chap but never mind come on he continued and started on once more  the rays of the acetylene lamp lit up the way fairly well and here and there they could see their former trail although it was growing more indistinct every moment the wind now whistled through the pines and sprucesa sound as dismaying as it was lonely  might have brought down some game with the aid of this lamp said chet as they trudged forward on their snowshoes  im not looking for game just now  at last they reached what they thought was the spot where andy had had the fall so far they had seen no trace of the missing documents now they gazed around much crestfallen the hollow was completely filled with the drifting snow and a ridge had formed wiping out the trail utterly  i am going to try digging said andy wish i had brought a shovel along  the lamp was hung on the branch of a tree near by and both youths set to work shoving and kicking the snow to one side or another thus they worked in something of a circle for the best part of an hour not a trace of the papers could be seen anywhere  maybe i lost them further backwhere we found the moose said andy im going to look but you neednt go with me if you dont care to chet  ill go where you go andy i want to see you get those papers back  again they moved forward the wind and snow cutting each in the face and sometimes almost blinding them they had to rest twice before they reached the spot of chets thrilling adventure  again the search began and it was kept up until both lads were wellnigh exhausted from stooping over and sifting the snow andy straightened his back and gave a sigh  i guess its no use he groaned they are gone ill never see them again and that claim is gone too  oh dont give up yet cried chet trying to cheer him up if we cant locate them tonight well do it in the morning when the sun shines they must be somewhere around they made quite a package with a rubber band around it and such a package cant vanish completely  to this andy could only answer with a sigh he doubted very much if the precious documents would ever come to light again  utterly fagged out the boys turned their backs on the wind and made their way to professor jeffers cabin here they found the others anxiously awaiting their return  what luck sang out barwell dawson  none answered andy and dropped into a chair as tired out as he was disheartened  youll have to go out in the morning  just what i said came from chet oh well get those papers back dont worry but although he spoke thus lightly it was only to cheer his chum up he too was afraid the documents were gone forever  andys sleep was a troubled one he dreamed that his uncle si was after him and that both had a tussle in the snow over the papers then a q hopton came up with a pitchfork speared the papers and bore them off in triumph he awoke to find chet shaking him  andy stop your groaning chet was saying you are going on to beat the band  i guess i had a nightmare answered andy sheepishly what time is it  just getting daylight  then i am going to get up eat a little breakfast and start on another search for those papers  sureand ill go along  the boys arose as quietly as possible and dressing went to the kitchen and prepared their morning meal of wheat cakes and a small moose steak and coffee they were just finishing the repast when professor jeffer showed himself  up early i see he said with a smile  we are going to look for those papers again explained chet  to be sure well i trust you find them although i am afraid you will have quite a search  the sun was just peering over the trees to the eastward when the two lads left the cabin it promised to be a clear day it was intensely cold and the wind still blew although not so hard as during the day and the night gone by  andy took the lead and each boy strained his eyes to catch sight of anything that might look like the documents once andy saw something at a distance and ran to it with a rapidly beating heart but it was nothing but a strip of birch bark and again his heart sank  the noon hour found them still on the hunt fortunately they had brought some lunch along in one of the game bags and they sat down in a sunny and sheltered nook to eat this warming up a can of coffee over a tiny campfire chet kindled then the hunt was renewed and kept up in various places until the sun began to go down over the woods to the westward  it will be dark in an hour more andy said chet kindly i guess we had better return to the cabin we can come out again tomorrow if you wish  ii dont think it will be any use to come out again chet andys voice was very unsteady i am afraid the papers are gone for good  oh i wouldnt give it up yet  if i only knew where i had dropped them but i dont know they may be right around here and they may be half a mile away  it was with a downcast heart that andy followed his chum back to the cabin somehow he had hoped that the timber claim would prove a valuable one and that he would get a goodly share of it now that hope was shattered  i wont be able to prove a thing without the documents he told himself and it would be useless to try  that evening the matter was talked over by the men and the boys from every point of view but nothing came of it barwell dawson agreed with andy that nothing could be accomplished until the missing documents were brought to light  i really think your uncle is to blame for this said the hunter if he had not acted as he did you would not have been forced to run away and then the papers might be safe and sound at your cabin  id like to know what became of that a q hopton said andy  well he didnt get the papers and thats one comfort said chet with a sickly grin  there was now no use in going to lodgeport to see a lawyer and instead andy and chet went out again for another search but this was as useless as the others not a trace of the missing documents could be found anywhere  might as well give it up sighed andy they are gone and that is all there is to it  again matters were talked over and barwell dawson advised andy to go home and face his uncle  if you wish ill go with you said the hunter perhaps i can get him to tell just what that a q hopton was up to  id like it firstrate if you would go along mr dawson answered the boy quickly  want me along asked chet  you might as well come answered andy we can take some of the moose meat the horns are yours chet  they set off for the graham cabin on the following morning barwell dawsons ankle was now quite well although he was prudently careful how he used it it had cleared off rather warm so the trip was a pleasant one the boys had with them all the meat they could carry and also their guns and wore the snowshoes professor jeffer had loaned them  on the way chet asked barwell dawson how soon he expected to start for the north  i hope to get the ice king ready by the middle of february or first of march was the hunters reply you see for such a trip we require an immense amount of stores and of just the proper kinds it wont do to take stuff that will freeze and burst open once i remember i was up there and had some bottles of catsup along the bottles froze and burst and we had catsup scattered all over the camp  i suppose you cant get much up there said chet  absolutely nothing outside of gamemusk oxen polar bears and hares seal walrus and some birds in some parts of greenland you can get moss that you can put in soup but it doesnt amount to a very hearty meal in a cold climate like that one needs to eat plenty of meat and the more fat the better the esquimaux live on the fattest kind of meat they can get and on blubber and they think tallow candles a real delicacy  excuse me from eating candles said andy  if you were real hungry youd eat anything answered barwell dawson gravely i was once lost on the ice and was glad enough to chew strips of seal hide to ease the pangs of hunger when i got back to camp my stomach was in such a condition that they fed me my first meal very carefully just a bit at a time if i had eaten my fill quickly i might have died     chapter xii  a letter of interest   the place looks shut up observed chet when the party came in sight of the graham homestead not a bit of smoke and the snow isnt cleared away from the doorstep  maybe uncle si is sick and cant get around answered andy quickly  sick lazy you mean returned his chum  they advanced to the front door and knocked there was no sound from within and andy walked around to the shed the door was locked but the key was on a shelf near by and he quickly opened the door  uncle si is away he announced as he walked through the cabin and let the others come in my but its cold here well have to start a fire right away  ill do that answered chet you sit down and rest that sore ankle he went on to barwell dawson and the hunter was glad to do as bidden  while chet started a lively blaze in the big open fireplace andy went through the cabin looking for some trace of his uncle much to his surprise he found josiah grahams traveling bag missing and also all of the mans clothing  he has gone away he cried and then caught sight of a letter pinned fast to the top of a chest of drawers the outside of the letter was addressed to andy graham the communication was written in lead pencil in a chirography anything but elegant and ran as follows    my dere nephy andy i hav got a chanct to git a job up haveltown way   and i think i beter tak it you dont seme to car for to have me tak car   of you so i am goin to leave you to tak car of yourself mr hopton   wanted to treet you square but you would knot listen so you must tak   the konseakenses he said the pappers aint much akont anyhowe i leave   my lov even if you dont lik me                     josiah graham  it took some time for andy to decipher the communication and for the first time in his life he realized how very limited had been the education of his fathers halfbrother he read the epistle to chet and barwell dawson  he has deserted you cried chet well good riddance to bad rubbish say i  i think he was afraid that you would make trouble for him was mr dawsons comment he thought you would take those papers to some lawyer or to the authorities and tell how he tried to sell them to mr a q hopton on the sly  i guess thats the way it is said andy he drew a deep breath well i am glad to get rid of him so easily i sincerely hope he stays away  but he wont stay away returned chet hell wait until he thinks everything is all right again and then hell sneak back to live on you  hell not live on me again declared andy i know him thoroughly now if he wants to stay here hell have to work the same as i do  well you are in possession of your own declared barwell dawson as he rested in the chair uncle si had used you can now take it as easy as you please and he smiled broadly  i dont see how i am going to take it easy if i cant get work answered andy soberly a fellow cant live on air of course i can go out hunting and fishing and all that but that isnt earning a regular living  you cant get work anywhere you look like a strong young man and willing  i am strong and willing too but times are dull and there are more men up here than there is work if it wasnt for having the cabin here i think id try my chances elsewhere  where  i dont knowperhaps down in one of the towns  andy invited barwell dawson to remain at the cabin for the rest of the day and the invitation was accepted the chums set to work to prepare a good dinner and of this the hunter partook with great satisfaction  you boys certainly know how to cook he declared as he finished up  a fellow has to learn cooking and everything in a place like this answered andy  its a good thing to know how to cook ive found it so many a time when off on a hunt  mr dawson id like to put a proposition to you burst out andy of course if it doesnt suit all youve got to do is to say no but i hope you will give it serious consideration and andy looked at chet as much as to say shall i go ahead to which his chum nodded eagerly  what is the proposition  that you take chet and me with you on your trip north i know you would prefer men but we are not so young and each of us is strong and healthy and we can do about as much as a man we are both used to cold weather and to roughing it and you know we can shoot and tramp over the ice and snowand cook we talked this over between us and wed like to go very much we dont want any pay or any reward all we want is our food and some ammunition and we are perfectly willing to rough it along with the rest we are both practically alone in the world so nobody will be worried over us even if we dont come back alive  yes but you want to come back dont you asked barwell dawson quizzically  of course but we realize the danger and we are ready to face it  well go wherever you go broke in chet and well do just whatever you want us to do as andy says we are used to roughing it and i think both of us can stand as much as anybody why i dont know that ive had a sick day in my life  and i have been sick very littlenone at all since i grew up added andy  the hunter and explorer looked sharply at the two boys he saw by the clear look in their eyes that they were honest to the core and in earnest in all they said  well it is something not to have any family ties he said i have two friends who wish to go along but both have wives and one has two children i dont think it would be fair to take them i am a bachelor myself and my relatives do not care what i do i believe if i died all some of them would think about would be my money he added the last words rather bitterly  then you will consider taking us pleaded andy  yes i will consider it but i must think it over a week or two before i give you my answer when a man plans such a trip as this he cannot be too careful as to who are his companions i must say i like you lads very much and i havent forgotten how you aided me at the cliff but i must have time to think it over carefully and make a few inquiries  with this the lads had to be content and for the time being the subject was dropped but later on barwell dawson showed his interest by asking them a great number of questions about themselves  i think hell take us along whispered chet to andy on retiring for the night and i sincerely hope he does it may give me a chance to find out what became of the betsey andrews and my father  dont be too sure of our going answered andy if you are you may be bitterly disappointed  in the morning it was decided that the two lads should accompany barwell dawson to the lodge he had occupied back of moose ridge they went along gladly wishing to become better acquainted with the hunter and explorer the storm had now cleared away entirely the wind had died down and the clear sun shone upon the ice and snow with great brilliancy  on the way the party managed to pick up some small game and barwell dawson showed his skill by hitting a partridge at a great distance he shot with ease showing that he was thoroughly familiar with the use of firearms he even gave the boys points for which they were grateful  he certainly knows how to shoot said andy to chet i dont see how he missed that moose  he lost his footing thats how was the reply the very best of sportsmen miss it sometimes  isnt he a splendid fellow chet  the finest ive met oh i do hope he takes us along with him  when the lodge was reached the boys built a fire and cooked another appetizing meal the hunter meanwhile resting his ankle which was still sore the reader can rest assured that andy and chet did their best over the meal for they wanted to let mr dawson know of their real abilities in the culinary line the repast was as much liked as the other had been  if you go with me ill have to throw out the man i was going to take for a cook declared the hunter and explorer i dont believe anybody could serve food better than this  oh well do the cooking all right declared chet enthusiastically  of course there will be a ships cook explained mr dawson but he wont go along over the ice and snow hell have to remain with the sailors on the ship  how many will be in the party to leave the ship asked andy  i dont know yetprobably five or six and the esquimaux  having reached barwell dawsons lodge the party settled down for a week to hunt and to take it comfortably during that time the hunter and explorer asked chet much about himself and his father  we must try to find out about that whaler as soon as i go back to town said barwell dawson somebody ought to know something about her  during the week the hunter and the boys became better friends than ever the man liked the frank manner of the lads and andy and chet were fascinated by the stories the explorer had to tell  i am going down to portland next week announced barwell dawson one day if you both want to go along and see the city ill take you and foot the bill then we can go up to the little town where the ice king is being fitted out and you can let me know what you think of the ship  this proposal filled the boys with delight and they accepted on the spot both andy and chet made hurried trips to their cabin homes and came back with the best of their belongings in their grips then they helped barwell dawson pack up and two days later started for pine run  there was mild surprise in the village when it was learned the two boys were going away even though it might be only for a short while to nobody in the village did barwell dawson mention his proposed trip to the frozen north  they wouldnt understand it and it would only make me out an object of idle curiosity he explained to the boys  from the general storekeeper andy learned that his uncle si had tried to borrow ten dollars but without success the storekeeper said josiah graham and mr a q hopton had had a bitter quarrel and parted on bad terms he did not know where either individual was now  well let uncle si shift for himself said andy to chet it will do him good  right you are andy but what a shame that you lost those papers  oh dont mention them chet it makes me feel bad every time i think of it  you ought to go back some day and take another look for them ill help you  yes i intend to go backif not right away then when the snow clears off  provided we are not bound north by that time  yes provided we are not bound for the pole     chapter xiii  barwell dawson reaches a decision   the trip to portland proved full of keen interest to both boys who had spent most of their lives in the backwoods barwell dawson procured rooms for all at a hotel not far from monument square and then he allowed the lads to do all the sightseeing they pleased they took several trolley trips and visited many points of interest not forgetting the big stores which were as much of a revelation as anything to them  the hunter and explorer set to work without delay to find out if possible what had become of the whaler betsey andrews at first he could learn little but one day came a letter from new bedford from a maritime agency stating that the whaler had not been heard of since stopping at disko island off the coast of greenland two years before it was supposed that she had either been hit by an iceberg or been sunk in a storm with all on board once a small boat belonging to the whaler had been found washed up on the coast of greenland but it had contained no persons dead or alive  this news was very disheartening to chet and for several days he was not himself at all and andy could do little to cheer him up but it was not as bad as if the youth had not expected something of this sort before and his hopes soon came back to him  ill not believe father is dead until i see the proofs he told his chum he may have been cast away on the coast of greenland and been unable to find a ship to bring him back home  let us hope that is true answered andy and let us hope that he gets back soon but though andy spoke thus he had small expectations of ever seeing mr greene alive  i expect professor jeffer down tomorrow said barwell dawson one morning after reading his mail as soon as he comes well run up the coast to where the ice king is being fitted out  the weather had cleared off warm and the snow was fast vanishing the professor arrived on time and was full of enthusiasm concerning the proposed trip to the north  i wish we were sure of going said andy to him and then told of what had been said to mr dawson  i like you lads very much returned the old scientist i hope mr dawson sees fit to take you along  perhaps you can put in a good word for us suggested chet  ill do it was the prompt answer  professor jeffer was as good as his word and that evening he and barwell dawson had a long talk concerning the boys the hunter and explorer could not help but smile at upham jeffers enthusiasm  well if you are on their side too ill surely have to take them he said at length but it is a risky thing to dothey are not men remember  they will stand the trip as well as though they were men was the professors answer they are in the best of health and full of vigor besides it is well to have the enthusiasm of youth with us it may help to cheer up many a lonely hour  i like the idea of their being without close family connections professor i hate to take a man away from those near and dear to him  true sir trueespecially when it is not actually necessary yes id take the boys by all means i do not think youll regret it of course though each will have to have a complete outfit  you can trust me to get the best there is  when andy and chet heard the good news they could scarcely contain themselves andy danced a jig right in the hotel room while both lads had to shake barwell dawson by the hand several times and then they shook hands with professor jeffer too  it makes me feel just as if we were one big family cried andy enthusiastically oh chet just to think of it well hunt musk oxen and polar bears and seals and walruses and go clear to the pole too  and travel on dog sledges put in chet say im ready to go this minute  so am i mr dawson you cant start any too soon for us  well boys dont be too enthusiastic remember this is going to be no childs playtrying to get to the north pole and we wont try to reach that point at all unless when we get into the arctic regions we find the conditions more or less favorable you must remember that many brave and vigorous men have tried to reach the pole and have failed there are immense fields of ice and snow to cross and leads or rivers of icy water and if you lose your supplies there remains nothing to do but to starve  nevertheless even though he spoke thus barwell dawson was secretly as hopeful as were the boys could he have seen what was before him his enthusiasm might have quickly died within him  now that it had been settled that they could go the two boys were eager to see the vessel which was to be their home during the coming summer and winter the ice king was being fitted out at the seaport town of rathley and they took the train for the place arriving there about noon the vessel was tied up at the dock and the lads and professor jeffer were invited by mr dawson to come on board  ill introduce you to captain williamson said the hunter he is in charge of the repairs that are being made he is a fine man and i know you will like him  the captain proved to be a bluff and hearty old salt who had at one time commanded a whaler he shook hands with a grip that made andy and chet wince and looked them over with a twinkle in his eye  so you are going to try to hunt polar bears and such eh he said well you look out that the bears dont eat you up and he laughed broadly  well try to keep out of the way answered chet modestly  and what are you going to do when the thermometer drops to fifty below zero  work around and keep warm answered andy with a grin and this made the captain laugh again  guess youll do he said anyway well try you  the ice king was a twomasted steamer that had been built for use in the icy seas of the north she was small broad of beam and shallow with an outer jacket of stout oak planks and a prow and stern of steel inside all the bracings were extra heavy and the railings of the deck were of the hardest kind of timber she carried an engine of great power and steam could be gotten up both with coal and with oil  you see it will not do to take too large a ship explained barwell dawson a small vessel can often get through where a big one would get stuck the ice king is built shallow so that instead of being crushed in the floating ice she will slide up on it or over it the sides are two feet thick and they ought to resist a tremendous pressure we have to have great engine power and a steel prow for sometimes well have to simply smash our way through  the entire lower portion of the ship was to be given over to the storage of provisions and coal and coal was also to be stored at the start on deck the quarters for the crew were forward in a forecastle of the usual order at the stern was a fairsized cabin half above and half below the deck with quarters for barwell dawson the captain and the others the boys were conducted to a stateroom not over six feet by seven it had an upper and a lower berth on one side and a tiny washstand and some clothing hooks on the other  well all have close quarters said barwell dawson my own room is but two feet larger than this  its large enough said andy he turned to his chum well be as snug as a bug in a rug in here wont we  suits me right down to the ground returned chet not much room for clothing but as we havent much thats all right  professor jeffer was to share his stateroom with another man who had not yet arrived he asked for a cabinet in which he might store his scientific instruments and mr dawson said he would attend to the matter  next week i shall commence the purchase of all supplies said the man who headed the expedition until that time there will be little for any of you to do and you can go where you please  im going back hometo have another look for those missing papers said andy besides i want to bring away the rest of my things and nail up the cabin  and ill go along said chet i want to get my things too about the cabin i dont care much what becomes of it for it has seen its best days  the two boys spent three days in the vicinity of pine run during that time both went out twice to look for the documents andy had lost but without success  they are gone and ill have to make the best of it said andy with a deep sigh  the two boys packed up what few things they wished to take along and then each cabin was nailed up tightly both wondered if they would ever see the places again  maybe well never come back from the far north said chet  are you afraid chet demanded andy quickly  not a bit of it just the same we may never see maine again what happened to my father may happen to us  professor jeffer had come back also to ship his case of scientific instruments and also another case of books the professor did not want much in the way of clothing but it would have been a real hardship had he been deprived of his other belongings  the success of this trip will depend upon accurate scientific observations said he to the boys when on the return to rathley it is all well enough to hunt and even to reach the north pole but of what use is it if we cannot return with full data of what we have observed  you are right professor answered andy but your instruments are beyond me  i will teach you how to use some of them after we are on board ship there will be many days when you boys will have little to do and it will be an excellent opportunity to improve your minds  well i wouldnt mind a little more education said chet bluntly  ill be pleased to teach you my boy i was once a schoolmasteralthough that was years ago  professor do you really think well reach the pole asked andy earnestly  i do not think i hope many have tried and failed but i believe the pole will be gained some day and well have an excellent chance of success mr dawson is a wonderful manhe seems more wonderful every time i talk to him he is fitting up his ship with the greatest possible care and forethought and has made a deep study of polar conditions besides he has had practical experience on the fields of ice and snow and knows just what to expect in the way of hardships  the run to rathley was made in less than two hours it had been decided that the party should put up at a hotel for a few days until some painting on board the ice king was finished then they were to go aboard and make themselves at home as best they could until the day set for the departure  they reached the hotel in the evening and that night all slept soundly in the morning after breakfast chet suggested they walk down to the steamer and see how the painting was progressing  hark cried andy when they were within two blocks of the wharf what is that man crying  fire fire fire yelled the individual in question as he came rushing up the street  where is it asked andy and chet in a breath  down at the dock a steamer is on fire  a steamer exclaimed professor jeffer can it be the ice king  oh i hope not burst out andy and then he set off on a run with chet by his side and the professor following more slowly     chapter xiv  the fire on the steamer   she is doomed there goes our chance to reach the north pole  such were the words that escaped from chets lips as he and andy came out on the dock where the ice king was tied up  before them lay the twomasted steamer with a thick volume of smoke rolling up from her main hatchway the fire alarm was sounding and men and boys were running to the scene of action  what a catastrophe the words came from professor jeffer he was almost out of breath from running i hope they can save her  wonder what is burning queried andy he too felt his heart sink within him  can of benzine exploded answered a man standing near the painters had it and one of em dropped a lighted match on the can  he ought to be blown up with it fumed chet who ever heard of such carelessness  there was the tooting of a whistle and a fire engine came dashing down the street followed by a hose cart and a hook and ladder company in the meantime captain williamson had sounded the alarm on the ship and set some men to work at a hand pump for the engineer had no steam in the boilers  can we do anything captain asked andy as he ran up the gangplank  i dont know was the short answer might help at the pump or help carry buckets of water if we had the engine going wed soon get a good stream on that blaze but we didnt look for anything like this  andy and chet tried to get to the pump but found that already manned then they got buckets and ropes and commenced to haul up water over the side and a number of other boys and men did likewise some sailors took the full buckets and threw the water down the hatchway where they thought it would do the most good then the fire engine on the dock got into action and a steady stream was directed down into the interior of the steamer  but the conflagration had gained considerable headway and some cans of paints and oils added ready fuel to the blaze the smoke grew thicker and thicker and presently a tongue of flame shot skyward  shes doomed sure groaned chet oh was there ever such luck  the trouble is that the water doesnt do much good on the paint and oil exclaimed professor jeffer sand or dirt would be better  here comes a chemical engine cried andy maybe that will do some good  it will do more good than throwing water said the old scientist  the chemical engine got into action without delay and as the chemicals were forced down the hatchway the smoke became even thicker than before but the tongues of flame died down which the boys took for a good sign  barwell dawson was not on hand he having gone to boston on business  if the vessel isnt saved it will be an awful blow to him was andys comment  the boys continued to work and so did the sailors and the firemen thus an anxious quarter of an hour passed then the chief of the fire department happened to pass chet  will the vessel be saved asked the lad  sure thing cried the old firefighter but its a blaze hard to get at if a man tried to go down there hed be smothered in a minute  nevertheless some of the hook and ladder men went into the engine room and there chopped a hole through a bulkhead into the hold then more chemicals were used and more water and soon it was announced that the fire was under control a little later the smoke cleared away and the firemen went below to put out any stray sparks  it was found that the total damage was confined to that portion of the hold where the painters had stored their paints and oils here the woodwork was much charred and some beams and braces were burnt through but captain williamson estimated that two hundred dollars would make everything as good as ever  and that im going to get out of those painters he went on doggedly if they dont pay up ill have em arrested for gross carelessness it may be said here that in the end the painters had to pay for the repairs although they did so unwillingly  a telegram was sent to mr dawson and he came from boston on the first train he was much disturbed and roundly berated the painter who had caused the conflagration the man had been smoking and the hunter gave orders that in the future they were to smoke on deck only and use no matches whatever while below  the repairs made necessary by the fire were made within ten days and then the task of getting the ice king ready for her long trip to the arctic regions went forward as rapidly as ever mr dawson was a busy man for he superintended the buying of everything from fur clothing to pemmican  pemmican is the great thing in the arctic regions he explained one day when andy asked about the food it is nothing but the round of beef cut into strips and dried and then mixed with beef tallow and currants it will keep for a long time and is highly nutritious  is it appetizing asked andy with a grin  it is when you are good and hungry andy besides it is comparatively light and easily carried i dont know what explorers would do without it of course as long as we can get fresh meat well eat that but well have to fall back on pemmican more or less youll find it more appetizing than seal blubber such as the esquimaux eat  the hunter purchased for the lads some silk underwear that was extra warm and some stout boots and outer garments of wool and of fur and also some oilskins for wet weather then he took them to a gun shop in portland and fitted them out with pistols repeating rifles and stout hunting knives he also purchased for them watertight match safes and colored goggles of the automobile varietythe latter to ward off headache and snowblindness  you need not wear the goggles all the time up north he explained but as soon as your eyes hurt the least bit put them on  you are very kind to get us all these things said chet the new repeating rifle made his eyes sparkle with pleasure  indeed you are kind cried andy we didnt expect half so much  i want you to go away completely equipped answered barwell dawson half of the failures of exploring expeditions is due to the lack of proper equipment its like going hunting with a gun that wont shoot straight sometimes you hit your game but more times you dont  the hunter and explorer also went over the scientific instruments with professor jeffer to see that nothing should be lacking to take all manner of observations and measurements some linen notebooks were also provided which could not be torn easily and likewise fountain pens and ink made of liquids that would not readily freeze mr dawson also procured a number of cameras for taking pictures and films that would not be affected by the intense cold  youve got to think about the cold every time you buy anything observed andy wonder what about a jackknife i was going to buy a new one and i dont want to ask mr dawson about ithe has bought enough already  i guess you can get any kind you want answered his chum but dont use it when its too cold or the steel will stick to your skin  oh i know that i once put my tongue on some cold iron and i had a terrible time getting it off again  the boys were in portland and set off to buy some trifles having still a few dollars of their own andy purchased the knife at a hardware store and they were just coming from the place when chet caught him by the arm  what is it chet  look at the man across the way it is your uncle si  uncle si cried andy so it is and he has seen me  andys first impulse was to run but he did nothing of the sort he stood his ground and gazed at his uncle coldly as the latter shuffled up josiah graham looked anything but tidy and prosperous and andy rightly imagined that his relative had been going through some hard times  humph so here you be were josiah grahams first words i was awonderin what had become of yer  what are you doing here uncle si asked andy as calmly as possible  me wots thet to you id like to know  oh you dont have to tell me if you dont want to  im alookin fer work be you workin now  not just at present  how did you git here  came on the train  humph neednt be so pert maybe you had an offer o work here  no  we havent got to look for a job said chet weve got something better to look forward to  better eh wot is it and josiah grahams small eyes gazed shrewdly at the youths  never mind what it is broke in andy hastily with a warning look at his chum  ah i know cried the man with a leer you came down to sell thet land claim goin to do it without my knowledge an consent  no i didnt come for that  you cant tell me andy graham i know better i do the old man shrilled but you remember im your guardeen an you cant sell nuthin without me  you are not my guardian uncle si you went away of your own free will and now i want you to let me alone  did you sell them papers yet  no  then you better give em to me you was a big fool to run away as you did i was agoin to make a good bargain fer yer  uncle si if you had sold those papers to that mr a q hopton i could have had you arrested said andy quietly but firmly  at these words the face of the shiftless man changed color and his jaw dropped  me arrested he stammered  yes arrested i have had advice on the subject you had no right to do a thing without the consent of the court  humph so you have been to a lawyer eh pretty way to donot to trust your uncle who allers did so well by yer has thet lawyer got them papers now  i wont tell you a word about the papers  humph you aint got no right to run away like this  i am not running away i have a right to go where i pleaseand do as i please  who told you thet  never mind who told me  youre agettin too hightoned fer your boots andy graham how much money have you got  that is my business  aint you agoin to tell me  no  where be you astopping  that is my business too  dont git sassy  i am not sassy as you call it i intend in the future to mind my own business and i want you to mind yours  you had better leave andy alone put in chet who saw that the shiftless man was working himself up into the worst possible humor you never helped him and he doesnt want anything to do with you  say this aint none o your business chet greene  andy is my friend  humph he better not be snarled josiah graham you aint no fit boy fer nobuddy to go withyou the son o a thief an mebbe wuss i want youoh  what josiah graham wanted next was never made known for just then he landed flat on his back in the gutter where a welldirected blow from chets fist had sent him     chapter xv  the start of the cook expedition   if ever a man was surprised that man was josiah graham even andy was astonished for he had not dreamed that chet could be so quicktempered  oh chet that was a hard blow  he deserved it was chets answer his voice was strained and his face pale ill allow nobody to talk that way to me  yoyou young villain spluttered josiah graham as he rolled over in the dirt of the gutter and picked himself up illill  after this you keep a civil tongue in your head interrupted chet he still had his fists clenched  youyou  if you call me any more names ill knock you down again  chets manner was so aggressive that josiah graham retreated several feet a few persons had witnessed his fall and a crowd began to collect  whats the trouble  is it a fight  do you want a policeman  no we dont want any policeman said andy in alarm chet we had better get out of this he whispered if we dont well all be taken to the station house  your uncle is the meanest man i ever met he ought to have a sound thrashing answered chet recklessly  i know but we dont want to have the police come down on us  ive a good mind to have the law on yer howled the man who had been knocked down  do soand ill have the law on you retorted chet you cant slander me for nothingand you cant try to rob andy either  the last shot told and josiah graham backed still further away  well settle this some other time he muttered and then turning he disappeared into the crowd and hurried away much faster than was his usual speed  not to be questioned by those who had gathered andy and chet pushed through the crowd in the opposite direction soon they were a couple of blocks from where the encounter had taken place and then they slackened their pace  the miserable hound muttered chet he was still completely upset  dont take it so hard chet answered andy soothingly its just uncle sis mean way thats all  i suppose he tells everybody what he thinks i am  oh i dont think that he was riled up and wanted to say something extra mean and it was meanas mean as dirt added andy  he continued to talk soothingly to his chum and presently chet cooled down somewhat but he still said he wished he had stayed and given josiah graham the thrashing of his life  he thinks i have the lost papers said andy later on  and id let him continue to think so answered his chum if you say they are lost your uncle may tell that fellow hopton and the real estate man may fix it up to do you out of that claim anyway id keep them in complete ignorance of the truth  andy thought this a good idea and resolved to follow the suggestion he wondered if his uncle would make another move against him he was soon to learn how really mean josiah graham could be  for the two boys waiting for the steamer to sail on her momentous voyage the days passed slowly after their outfits had been purchased and stowed away aboard the ice king there was little for them to do they read some books on polar exploration and spent hours in poring over the maps of the arctic regions which barwell dawson and the professor possessed they traced out the routes of kane de long greely peary and others and wondered what route mr dawson would pursue  he is going up the west coast of greenland anyway said chet and that suits me for that is where the betsey andrews was last heard of no matter what was going on thoughts of his missing parent continually drifted across his mind would he ever see his father again and would his parent be able to clear himself of the accusations brought against him  do you suppose there are any other exploring expeditions north just now asked andy of professor jeffer at the breakfast table one morning all were now stopping at a hotel in rathley  but very few i believe i understand robert peary is about to try it again this coming summer just as we are going to do and mr dawson tells me that a noted hunter and explorer from brooklyn dr frederick a cook is now somewhere up north this dr cook went up north to hunt walrus and polar bears but he is quite an explorer and he may take it into his head to strike out for the pole especially as he had for his captain robert bartlett who commanded pearys ship the roosevelt during pearys wonderful trip in 1905 and 1906  do you think well meet any of those other parties up there asked chet  it is possible but not probable for the country is so large but we shall probably hear of dr cooks party through the esquimaux as soon as we arrive those men of the frozen north make good messengers and news travels for hundreds of miles in an incredible space of time considering the ice and snow  what professor jeffer had to say about dr frederick a cook was true and as the name of this famous hunter and explorer was soon to be on everybodys tongue it will be well to give more details concerning him and his party  dr cook was born in hortonville new york state he was of german descent and his family originally spelt the name koch his father was a physician and so was his grandfather so it was but natural that the lad should take up the study of medicine  in his younger life he had to work hard the family moved to port jervis n y and there frederick entered high school then the family moved again this time to the williamsburgh section of brooklyn n y while studying the boy did his best to earn some money working with a produce dealer in fulton market and also as a printer then he purchased a milk route and having gotten ahead a little financially entered a medical school from which in due course of time he received his diploma while in college he was married but his wife died shortly after the wedding  the young doctor was looking around for an opening when he heard that commander peary was fitting out an expedition for polar exploration this was the first peary expedition and a competition was opened for the position of surgeon with the party dr cook won in the contest and thus took his first trip to the far north in the ship kite in 1891 the northwestern coast of greenland was explored the party reaching a north latitude of 82° and dr cook received a splendid training for future work in that territory  returning home he married again and for a short time settled down to the practice of a physician but the wish for hunting and for exploration was in his heart and in 1893 he went north again and took a third trip the year following then came a voyage on an illfated ship the miranda and the explorer came close to going to the bottom of the ocean the ship collided with an iceberg off the coast of labrador and also hit some reefs off the coast of south greenland a transfer was made to another vessel and the miranda was left at sea a hopeless derelict  in 1897 dr cook joined the belgica arctic expedition as surgeon and anthropologist and spent nearly two years in that service then he went north in another ship the erie carrying supplies for the peary party then again in the polar regions  after that a trip was made to alaska and the intrepid explorer tried the ascent of mount mckinley said to be 20300 feet highthe tallest mountain in america at first he failed but another year he came back and made the grand ascent a truly great achievement he wrote a book on the subject and also another volume relating his experiences while a surgeon and explorer in the frozen north  dr cook had a great friend in mr john r bradley a man of means who was a wellknown traveler and hunter the two talked the matter over and decided to fit out a vessel and make a trip as far north as possible in the main the project was kept secret and neither boasted of what they were about to attempt to do at gloucester mass they found a ship that suited their purpose and she was thoroughly overhauled and renamed the john r bradley suitable provisions for a long trip were taken on board and the vessel left gloucester harbor july 3 1907 it did not look at all like a north pole expedition and its departure excited very little comment it was thought that mr bradley and dr cook had merely gone off on a hunting trip after bears and walrus  it took until the end of august for the bradley to reach the upper end of smith sound in baffin bay here was located the port of etah and not many miles away another port called annootok all of the provisions and other supplies were landed at the latter port and then the vessel sailed back to the united states leaving dr cook and his party to hunt and explore to their hearts content the vessels return created some surprise and then the word gradually spread that it was possible dr cook would try to reach the north pole mr bradley was at once besieged with questions but gave no definite information  at annootok dr cook found many esquimaux assembled all ready for a great bear hunt as he could speak their language he talked to them and engaged a number of them with their dogs and sledges to serve him  work was at once begun to make annootok a regular base of supplies a small house was erected and also a storehouse and a workshop all the provisions brought along were packed away and the explorer obtained from the native hunters large quantities of polar bear meat and other game  and so he set off on his memorable trip northward and what this brought forth we shall learn later     chapter xvi  a trick and what followed   day after tomorrow we shall set off on our trip to the frozen north  it was barwell dawson who made the announcement to the boys and professor jeffer after a long consultation with captain williamson  good shouted andy swinging his cap in the air  suits me added chet ive been on pins and needles to go for a month and more  you mustnt be impatient replied mr dawson with a smile even as it is well be getting away nearly a month before i originally planned to go but i am ready and so is captain williamson so there is no use in delaying  what about mr wilson asked andy referring to a man who had signed for the trip  he is sick and cannot go but dr slade will be on hand and likewise mr camdal they sent me a telegram last night  i suppose all the crew are here questioned professor jeffer  to a manand all as anxious as we are to start  do they know we are going to try for the pole  not exactly but ive told themand so has the captainthat we intended to stay in the polar regions for at least two years  winter had passed and now it was the middle of spring the weather was warm and pleasant just the sort for a cruise as andy declared  the boys had had but little to bother them outside of another meeting andy had with his uncle si who had followed him to rathley josiah graham had tried to bulldoze the youth and had wanted andy to give him ten dollars but the boy had refused and walked away leaving his uncle in a more bitter frame of mind than ever  i dont know how he manages to live andy told chet he doesnt seem to work  if he isnt willing to work he ought to starve answered chet he had no tender feelings for the man who had called him the son of a thief  i am sorry he came to rathley i dont understand how he found out we were here  oh hed take more trouble to find you than to hunt up a job answered chet  on the day previous to that set for the ice king to sail chet was walking down one of the docks when he saw two men in earnest conversation one man was pointing his long forefinger toward the vessel that was bound north and drawing closer chet recognized josiah graham  now what can he be up to the youth asked himself he seems to be quite excited  the men were standing near a high board fence that separated one dock from another chet ran back through a warehouse and scaled the fence coming up quickly on the other side through a knothole he could see the two men and hear all that was being said  at first he could not catch the drift of the talk but presently discovered that the stranger was some sort of officer of the law the two were talking about andy and at last josiah graham said  i dont want him to run away from me its up to you to stop him an i want for you to do it  are you his guardian  o course i beim his only livin relative hes got property but hell go to the dogs if he aint looked after i want him brung ashore when thet ship sails an i understand shes agoin to sail tomorrer  well ill see what can be done answered the stranger will you come to the office and make some sort of a complaint  have i got to do that questioned josiah graham anxiously  it would be best  all right then ill do it its fer his own good answered the shiftless one well catch him when he leaves the hotel to go to the ship then the two men walked away towards the center of the town  the mean rascalto try to keep andy from going on this trip murmured chet to himself ill soon put a spoke in his wheel  he started on a hunt for andy who had gone uptown to make a small purchase he looked into several stores and at last located his chum in a barber shop  last haircut for some time to come announced andy after this i guess ill let my hair growit will be warmer  ive got something to tell you returned chet hurry up  cant hurry when im getting my hair cut chet  nevertheless andy told the barber not to waste time and ten minutes later both boys were on the street there chet related what he had overheard andy listening in wonder  he certainly is the limit chet now what do you suppose i had best do  i dont knowtell mr dawson i suppose  but i dont want to get him into trouble  do you think it will do that  it mightand he might tell me it would be best for me to stay behind answered andy gloomily and im not going to stay behind he cried desperately  then i know what you can do exclaimed chet struck by a sudden idea  what  play a trick on your uncle si but it will cost you a fivedollar bill  thats cheapif only i can get rid of the old curmudgeon  then come with me to the writingroom of the hotel  andy did as requested and there chet unfolded his plan andy agreed to it at once and without loss of time the following letter was penned    dear uncle si i am sorry i caused you so much trouble will you   come to pine run at once i inclose five dollars for the trip how   much money can you get for those papers thought id like to go on   that ocean trip but i suppose sailoring is harder than lumbering   isnt it                                                        your nephew                                                           andy  andy had in his pocket an envelope postmarked pine run and addressed to himself with care he erased the name andrew and substituted josiah and then he changed the address he knew where his uncle was stopping a cheap lodging house  i guess that will set him off the trail said chet with a grin after the envelope had been sealed with care and we havent told him any falsehood either  the boys laid their plans with care and hired a youth employed around the lodging house to hand the letter to josiah graham but without stating where it came from then andy and chet set watch  in the middle of the afternoon they saw josiah graham enter the lodging house they waited impatiently and half an hour later saw him emerge carrying his faded grip in his hand he headed directly for the depot  i guess the plan is going to work whispered chet let us follow him  he mustnt see meor it would spoil everything  they followed on behind the man and saw him enter a police station he came forth five minutes later looking flushed and humiliated  ill wager he has withdrawn his charge against you said chet and his surmise was correct  from the station house josiah graham hurried to the depot it was three oclock and a train for pine run was due in fifteen minutes  pine run ticket chet heard him demand at the window and it was handed to him then he came out on the platform and sank down on a bench with his grip at his feet  you are rid of him andy cried chet gayly  it was fine of you to think of the trick responded andy gratefully  say ive got a good mind to have some fun with the old man went on chet  fun i hope you dont mean to knock him down  no for he might have me arrested and that would keep me from going on the trip ill just quiz him a little  better be careful  dont worryi know what i am doing  while andy still kept out of sight chet sauntered slowly across the depot platform as if looking for somebody josiah graham stared at him and leaped to his feet  wot you adoin here demanded the lazy man  oh cried chet in wellassumed surprise is andy with you he questioned anxiously  no he aint snapped josiah graham  do you know where he has gone  dont you know  he was at our hotel yesterday but he isnt there now  mebbe hes on thet ship sniffed josiah graham  no he isnt on that ship either  wasnt he agoin to sail with you  so he said but chet paused then you really dont know where he is  if i do i aint agoin to tell you chet greene  dont be hard on me mr graham now i am down on my luck  humph its your own fault you aint got no work why didnt you stay around pine run  at this question chet only sighed he took on a very forlorn look  would youerwould you  wot  i hate to ask it but would you mind lending me the price of a ticket for pine run he said falteringly  me shrilled josiah graham not much i wont you go an earn your money young man serves you right if you are out o pocket an aint got a cent  then you wontereven give me the price of aera dinner  not a cent you dont deserve it i see how it is went on josiah graham craftily thet man who owns the ship has got sick o you an andy too an dont want nuthin more to do with yer well i dont blame him now ye can both go back to pine run an go to work  how can a fellow get back if he hasnt the price of a ticket asked chet in a hopeless fashion although he could scarcely keep from laughing  go to work an earn money i tell yer i have to do it an you aint no better nor i be  have you been working  o course ive been working  then you wont even give me ten cents for some bread and coffee  no go to workit will do yer good  will you tell me about andy  well if ye want to know so awful bad andy has gone back to pine run he has found out the errors o his ways an has sent fer me to take care o him i dont think hell be arunnin away agin very soon  too bad too bad and the mischievous chet placed a handkerchief to his eyes  its wot a boy gits when he wont mind his uncle went on josiah graham stiffly after this i guess hell toe the mark its a pity you aint got nobuddy to bring you to your senses  maybe youd like to take me under your care suggested chet with a most woebegone look on his face  noi got my hands full with andy here is my train so i cant talk to yer no longer go to work an earn somethin to eat an the price o a railroad ticket and then josiah graham swung himself aboard the train which pulled out from the station a moment later  oh chet how could you do it roared andy when the chums were alone i thought id split listening to the talk  wouldnt even give a fellow the price of a meal returned chet coolly well i rather think hell be surprised when he gets back to your cabin and finds everything locked up and then he too laughed heartily over the trick that had been played on andys shiftless relative     chapter xvii  an encounter with icebergs   off at last chet  yes and your uncle si didnt stop you either responded chet with a broad grin  if only we could have seen him when he got to the cabin exclaimed andy ill wager he was mad  well boys it will be a long while before you see the united states again remarked barwell dawson as he came up so use your eyes for all they are worth  just what we are doing answered andy  the ice king had cast off her lines quarter of an hour before and a steam tug had headed her out of the harbor of rathley now under the steam of her own powerful engines she was heading straight out into the atlantic ocean  it was an ideal day and the boys were in the best of spirits even though they were leaving their native land for the first time chet was full of the hope that in some manner he would hear something about the missing whaler and his father  the ice king was loaded to the brim as andy expressed it below every available space was filled with provisions and other necessities and coal and on deck many bags of coal were piled up amidships  to get through the ice the ship must have a good head of steam on said mr dawson and to have that weve got to have coal or oil  how soon do you suppose well strike ice questioned chet  oh any time after we round the coast of nova scotia  at the last moment some extra supplies had come on board and these were still awaiting proper distribution the boys watched land slowly disappear in the blue haze of distance and then set to work to assist in making everything shipshape  it will seem queer to live on a ship im thinking said chet  i hope we dont get sick answered his chum  oh i dont think we shall  dont be too sure  the boys had already become acquainted with the other members of the party dr john slade a quiet but friendly gentleman who had once spent two years in lower greenland and mr samuel camdal an old hunter who had shot with barwell dawson in the far west and in africa mr camdal could tell some famous storiesof hunting and of narrow escapes from wild animalsand the lads felt that he would make good company during the days when there was not much to do  it was a real pleasure for the lads to put their stateroom in order although the room was small it had a homelike air about it that was pleasing neither lad was burdened with excess baggage so they were not as crowded as they might otherwise have been  the course of the ice king was to be up the coast of nova scotia and newfoundland and then into davis strait to baffin bay the boys had studied the chart thoroughly for a sea trip was altogether a novelty to them  shall we stop anywhere along the coast of greenland asked chet of barwell dawson  yes i have arranged to stop at upernivik for an extra supply of coal which a collier from the lower coast is to bring up for us  how long do you suppose well be at upernivik  two or three days at leastperhaps a week  and can andy and i go ashore  certainly but it is only a small settlement and you wont find much of interest  i wanted to make inquiries about the betsey andrews  oh i see well ill help you chet but dont be too sanguine you may not hear a word of the whaler  i want to do all i can to hear from my father  i dont blame you id be that way myself if my father were missing  in a few hours the ice king was out on the broad atlantic the long swells made the steamer roll a good deal and soon the two boys felt this in their legs and then in their stomachs each looked at the other in a woebegone manner  whats the matter asked andy  nothing returned chet manfully striving to overcome a feeling he could not subdue whats the matter with you  nothing much onlyii feel sort of crawly inside  youre seasick andy  how about yourself retorted andy and he made a movement toward the side of the steamer  i guess ii amwithyou gasped chet and also ran for the rail  after that the two chums lost all interest in living for several hours they felt as miserable as a person with a dose of seasickness can feel they remained on deck for a while and then sought the seclusion of their stateroom here dr slade came to their assistance  two more down eh said the physician with a little smile well ill do what i can to fix you up and he brought forth his medicine case  whwho else is sick asked andy in seasickness misery loves company every time  mr camdal and ben haven the first mate  the first mate queried chet between his groans do sailors get sick  some of them do i know the captain of an ocean liner who has crossed the atlantic forty or fifty times he told me confidentially that he is sick about every third or fourth voyage its just the condition his stomach happens to be in  then it isnt soso babyish after all said chet and that gave him a grain of comfort  the doctor did what little he could for the two lads and by noon the next day they felt quite like themselves let me add that during the remainder of the voyage they were not seasick again  although well weighted by her heavy cargo and by the extra planking on her sides and extra bracings inside the ice king made good time on her trip it was summer yet as the vessel turned northward it became colder daily and soon the boys were glad enough to take barwell dawsons advice and don heavier underwear then as it grew still colder they put on thicker outer garments also  i think well see some icebergs soon announced captain williamson one evening i can feel em in the air and he threw back his head to take in a deep breath many old sailors who have been in northern waters affirm that they can often smell icebergs before the bergs can be seen  the boys retired as usual that night and slept soundly until about five oclock in the morning when a tremendous thump on the vessels side aroused them and threw chet sprawling on the floor  for goodness sake whats that gasped the lad as he scrambled up  before andy could speak there came another tremendous thump which added to their alarm a series of smaller thumps followed on deck they heard captain williamson giving a series of rapidfire orders  i think i know whats up cried andy at last as he donned his clothing with all possible speed weve struck some floating ice  that must be it answered chet and he too began to dress with dispatch  when the youths reached the deck a cry of astonishment burst from their lips it seemed as if during the night the ice king had entered another world on all sides were large and small cakes of floating ice and in the distance half a dozen big icebergs loomed up  looks as if we were getting to the north pole fast remarked andy grimly  phew but its cold added chet as he buttoned his clothing tightly about him  well boys how do you like this sang out barwell dawson as he noticed them  got into it kind of sudden like didnt we asked chet  i think so although the captain said last night to expect it  shall we have this all the way up now asked andy  hardly i think and so does captain williamson that there is clear water beyond  the captain was on deck with his glass scanning the ocean ahead anxiously several large icebergs appeared to be drifting directly toward the steamer and he gave orders that the course be changed slightly  the ice king wont mind the small ice said he but there is no sense in trying the big bergs yet well get all we want of that later  right you are sir responded barwell dawson dont take any chances when they are not necessary  after watching the ice for a while the boys went below for breakfast at the table they sat down with professor jeffer and dr slade  i am going to try to get some photographs of the icebergs said the professor i trust we get close enough to them to get some good views  they ought to make good pictures responded the doctor  all the while the boys were eating the small cakes of ice thumped against the sides of the steamer but this did no damage although as the professor explained there was danger of some ice getting caught in the propeller  and we cant afford to have that damaged he added  when the boys came on deck again they saw that the ice king was much closer to several of the large icebergs in fact the steamer appeared to be picking her way through a veritable field of floating ice  it is much thicker than the captain expected said barwell dawson gravely  is there any danger asked andy quickly  there is always danger when so much ice is floating about but we hope to get through all right  the lads could readily see that not only mr dawson but also the captain mate and sailors were much concerned captain williamson still had his glass in use and was scanning the sea ahead  i think we can make it he said to mr dawson but it is going to be a tight squeeze  well we dont want such a tight squeeze that we get our ribs stove in answered the explorer  are we going to pass between the icebergs yonder asked chet  well have toto reach the clear sea beyond answered the captain  the speed of the steamer had been reduced and the course again changed they were pushing away from one of the big bergs that seemed to tower up into the sky like some giant of the polar regions  if that iceberg hit us it would knock us to flinders was chets comment as he viewed the oncoming mass  on one side of the ship were the icebergs and on the other the floating cakes the latter growing thicker every minute the ice king was turned into the floating cakes which thumped and bumped loudly on the bow and sides then came an unexpected crashing from the stern  whats that cried the mate who was at the wheel steering under captain williamsons directions  ice in the propeller answered a sailor  as he spoke the engine stopped and in a twinkling the steamer swung around until her bow pointed directly toward the big iceberg  look look yelled andy we are going to be hit sure  if we are we are doomed echoed chet  before anything could be done the big iceberg came drifting on them slowly and majestically a very mountain of crystallike whiteness so terrible was it that it fascinated the boys who could do nothing but stare in commingled wonder and horror an upper mass of the iceberg hung over the top as if ready to fall and crush the steamer beneath it  a moment passedto the lads it seemed an eternityand then the big iceberg scraped the side there was a strange grinding and crashing and some pieces of ice came showering on the deck then the steamer began to rock and some of the shrouds became entangled in the mass that overhung the deck the ice king commenced to move backward  we are being carried along by the iceberg cried barwell dawson and his words told the truth of the awful situation     chapter xviii  shooting wild geese   it was certainly a time of extreme peril and the boys realized it fully as well as did the men the steamer was caught in the grip of the big iceberg and the deck was directly beneath an overhanging portion that might at any time break off and crush the vessel and all on board  captain williamson had run aft to learn what could be done with the propeller and he had already told the mate to get the sailors out with fenders to save the ship as much as possible from chafing on the side of the berg  the loose ice on the other side helps to keep us against the big berg said barwell dawson  i have tried to get some pictures but the big iceberg is too close came from professor jeffer who was as cool as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened  well were going to get away from it mighty quickif we can answered mr camdal pointedly the close quarters did not suit him any better than it suited mr dawson and the boys  to clear the propeller a man had to be hoisted over the stern in a sling he carried with him a pickpole and with this dug out the cake which had become caught in the blades of the propeller  this work had hardly been accomplished when another grinding sound came from the big iceberg and a shower of small ice came down on the forecastle knocking out several lights of glass andy was struck on the head and hurled flat  oh andy are you hurt cried chet in alarm as he rushed to his chums assistance  not much but that was a pretty good crack was andys reply as he felt his head where a lump was rapidly rising  you boys had better go below said barwell dawson you cant do anything up here and you may get a worse dose next time  but the lads were loath to retire and so lingered on the deck but took good care to keep out of the way of the ice that fell a little later  finding that the propeller would now work captain williamson gave orders for full speed astern as soon as the engines started there was more crashing of ice the small stuff being ground down under the ship and the ice of the pinnacle breaking off along the shrouds everybody on deck had to get out of the way for the deck took on the appearance of an icehouse upset as chet put it big chunks of the frozen material lying in all directions  hurrah we are leaving the big iceberg behind cried andy a few minutes later and his words proved true  i can see clear water ahead called out professor jeffer shortly afterwards and then he turned to get the photographs he wanted of the big iceberg  the report concerning open water was correct and having left the vicinity of the big iceberg captain williamson had the steamer steered in something of a big circle thus they avoided all but the small ice the latter however thumped and bumped on the bow and sides as strongly as ever and once there came a shock that threw everybody on the deck headlong  i hope that doesnt damage us any observed andy when this new scare was over  it may start some of the seams answered barwell dawson although the vessel was reënforced to withstand just such knocks  inside of an hour the ice king had passed all the big icebergs and a large portion of the floating cakes clear blue water was ahead for which all on board were thankful  i didnt expect this so far south said captain williamson after making a tour of the ship and having had the deck cleaned up it is unusual  i know it answered barwell dawson i am thankful we didnt run into the big iceberg at night  yes darkness would have made the situation much worse  have we started any of the ships seams asked dr slade  not as far as i have been able to discover  the boys went to the forecastle to see what damage had been done there and found the ships carpenter putting in some new lights of glass one sailor had received a black eye from a chunk of falling ice but otherwise little bodily harm had resulted  well i call that a narrow escape said andy after the excitement was over  so do i responded chet i dont want another such experience  you will have to go through harder things than that up north said barwell dawson who overheard the talk  well be prepared then answered andy this wasnt expected  i am afraid you boys dont realize what you are up against went on the hunter and explorer we are going to face many perils in the polar regions if you feel you dont want to go further you can leave us when we get to upernivik  no no we want to see this thing through perils or no perils cried andy hastily  indeed we do added chet i guess youll find we can stand as much as anybody after we get used to it  late that afternoon the steamer came in sight of a large flock of wild geese professor jeffer calculated that there must be thousands of them and ran for his camera to take some snapshots  cant we do a little shooting asked chet of mr dawson they are heading this way  permission was granted and both boys rushed below for shotguns when they came up the geese were flying almost directly over the ice king uttering their strange cries as they did so  it did not take andy and chet long to get into action and both shotguns spoke up at almost the same time each youth fired twice in rapid succession the geese were so thick they could not help but strike some of them and three came fluttering down on the deck of the vessel  not a bad haul was barwell dawsons comment now you can have roast goose stuffed with onions for tomorrows dinner  and well invite all hands to join us answered chet gaily i guess there will be enough to go around  i dont know about this shooting birds from the ship said captain williamson in a low voice some of the sailors dont believe in that sort of thing they think it brings bad luck  what do you think asked chet  oh i am not superstitious responded the commander  the master of the vessel was rightsome of his hands were very superstitiousand these deplored the killing of the geese and refused to touch any of the meat when it was cooked  well have trouble see if we dont said one sailor  maybe it will sink us said another with a serious shake of his head then they muttered among themselves and cast ugly glances at andy and chet  too bad whispered chet to his chum if i had known the sailors would take it so seriously id not have shot those geese  oh the affair will soon blow over was andys answer but his surmise did not prove correct  in the morning the boys heard that the ice king had sprung several leaks the captain had had the wellhole sounded and had ordered the pumps started  the icebergs and the floating cakes did it said barwell dawson i was hopeful we would escape but it seems not  what are you going to do asked andy  i dont know yetwell see how bad the leaks are  the ships carpenter was below examining the seams and now captain williamson and barwell dawson joined him a thorough examination was effected and when the party came on deck again they were talking earnestly  its pretty bad i guess said andy to chet  a consultation took place in the cabin between the captain and the explorer and at the conclusion the course of the vessel was changed  instead of heading for upernivik we are going to put in at holstenborg for repairs explained barwell dawson to professor jeffer and the others i am sorry for the delay but it cannot be helped the ice must have hit us harder than we thought  well the delay wont worry me answered the scientist calmly it will give me a chance to see something of another part of greenland  where is holstenborg questioned chet  it is on the western coast of greenland about four hundred and fifty miles below upernivik it is not much of a place but captain williamson thinks it would be unwise to attempt to reach upernivik in our present condition  well i dont care if we do land further down the coast said chet thinking that here would be another chance to make inquiries concerning the lost whaler  it soon became whispered around that the ice king was leaking badly some of the hands took the matter calmly but others were excited  its because those geese were shot cried one sailor it was wrong to do it and i said so  those boys ought to be heaved overboard said another  right you are answered the tar who had first found fault  some of this talk presently reached the ears of ben haven the mate and watching his chance he came up to where chet and andy were standing amidships  i want to tell you lads something said he in a low voice  what is it asked chet  if i were you boys id not walk forward for the present went on ben haven some of the sailors are down on you for killing those geese better keep out of their way until we reach portwhich will be tomorrow morning  why do you think theyd try toto harm us asked chet  they mightif matters get worse with the ship some sailors are awfully headstrong when they get frightened  chet and andy promised to heed the warning although both were inclined to laugh at it they kept away from the forecastle and it was not until after supper that one of the sailors came near them it was then reported that the steamer was leaking worse than before and the pumps were kept going constantly  you boys are responsible for this said the sailor he was a tall thin individual who rejoiced in the name of pep loggermore  what do you mean demanded chet stiffly  you know well enough what i mean growled the tar if we go to the bottom there wont be nobody to blame but you  thats nonsense broke in andy the ice started the ships seamswe had nothing to do with it  you shot them geese and  oh thats foolishness cried chet we dont want to hear it a man with sense ought to know better than to talk that way  i know what i am talking about grumbled pep loggermore  you go on about your business said andy sharply  loggermore was about to argue some more when captain williamson put in an appearance he slouched off but when out of sight turned and shook his fist at the youths  i aint going to sail with no such fellers as you he muttered to himself and i dont think the other men will want to sail with you either if we ever get ashore alive well see to it that you two fools dont come aboard again  what did that fellow want of you demanded the captain of the chums  oh it wasnt much answered andy evasively he did not want to get loggermore into trouble  did he threaten you  he didnt like it because we shot the geese said chet  what tomfoolery muttered the captain well if he bothers you again let me know and ill teach him to mind his own business  what about the leaks captain asked andy to change the subject  they are pretty bad but i hope to reach port without serious trouble was the reply  but the look on the face of the commander of the ice king showed that he was greatly worried     chapter xix  greenland and the esquimaux   there was a good deal of ice near the coast yet by setting a constant watch in the crows nest of the steamer captain williamson was able to steer a fairly straight course for holstenborg  it is only a small danish settlement said barwell dawson in reply to a question from chet ordinarily on account of the marine laws made by denmark we might have trouble in landing but being in need of repairs i fancy there will be no difficulty  a little later land was discovered and presently the coast loomed up dark and rocky with the mountain tops covered with snow and ice then through the glasses they made out a few buildings of stone and wood clustered together near a natural harbor  not much of a town thats sure was andys comment  signals were set and as the steamer came to anchor a small boat came out from shore it contained one of the government officials a roundfaced pleasantlooking dane with yellowish hair and mild blue eyes  it was with some difficulty that matters were explained and then arrangements were made to have the ice king towed to a spot where the necessary repairs could be made work on the vessel began the next day and while this was going on the boys received permission to go ashore  they found but little to see there was a mine back of the settlement where ore was being blasted out and they watched several blasts go off then they walked to where a fishing vessel had just come in with a large quantity of seals and some fish which were called cod but which they found to be of a different variety from those caught off the new england coast  those seals ought to be valuable said andy think of the price of a sealskin coat  not this kind of seal answered professor jeffer who chanced to be near at the time the seals from which we get sealskin coats such as you refer to come from the coast of labrador and from alaskan waters these seals as you will find by close examination do not have a skin of fur but one of hair like a horse but the esquimaux use them for garmentmaking an esquimau woman will make herself a very fine dress out of these sealskins  the boys watched the fish and seals taken ashore and then caught sight of a man in the crowd who looked as if he might be american or english  id like to talk to that man said chet and watching his chance he called to the individual the fellow called back and when his work was ended walked over to the boys  my name is rooney jack rooney he said after the youths had introduced themselves im from new brunswick although i once lived in maine glad to know you and he shook hands  have you been along the coast of greenland long asked chet  about fifteen years off and on  then you must know something about the whalers that come up here  yes ive been aboard plenty of emone time and another  did you ever see the betsey andrews  jack rooney stood for a moment in deep thought and then scratched his grizzled chin  how long ago is it she was in these parts  oh two years ago at least  who was her captain do you know  captain jacob spark  spark oh yes i remember him a onearmed man an old war veteran  yes i was told he had but one arm chets heart began to beat a little faster then you remember him and his ship  oh yes  my father was on board the betsey andrews he shipped the last time she left new bedford  i see  she never came back and i cant find out what became of her continued chet  what was she lost at sea but hold on i remember hearing something about that jack rooney scratched his head lets see who was it told me oh i remember now tom fetjen he told me something about her getting fast in the ice but i dont remember the particulars  who is tom fetjen  oh hes a fellow who travels up and down the greenland coast bartering with the esquimauxin a small way you know  you dont remember what he said about the betsey andrews  none of the particulars no but fetjen could tell you i am sure he knew this onearmed spark quite well often told stories about the captain  where is tom fetjen now  i dont know but maybe i can find out answered jack rooney  the fisherman became interested in the boys and had chet tell more about his missing parent then he went in search of some men who had business dealings with tom fetjen and talked to them in danish  they say tom fetjen went up the coast to upernivik said rooney after the interview if your ship is bound for that port youll probably find him there he owns a boat called the northland a little twomaster  this was all the information chet could obtain in holstenborg concerning the missing whaler  well thats something said andy you can talk to this tom fetjen when we reach upernivik  if he doesnt leave there before we arrive  rooney said he was apt to stay there quite a while chet  i know he did well i suppose i can only wait and see and chet heaved a deep sigh  while andy and chet were ashore interviewing jack rooney and others who could speak english captain williamson was waited on by three of his hands the delegation was headed by pep loggermore  what do you want demanded the master of the ice king briefly he could readily see that trouble was brewing  we came to speak about them boys replied loggermore doggedly we been talkin amongst ourselves and we dont want to take no more chances  what boys asked the captain although he knew perfectly well who were meant  the boys that shot them geese and brought us bad luck  see here loggermore this is all nonsense  excuse me capn but it aint nonsense at all we talked it over and we are sure it was the killin of them geese  you talk like a fool interrupted the master of the steamer those boys are no more responsible for our ill luck than you or i the ice knocked us a bit too hard thats all  we want them boys kept ashore cried pep loggermore aint that so mates he added turning to his companions and they nodded  what are you going to try to dictate to me roared captain williamson  we aint asking anything but whats right we  not another word loggermore go forard all of you and dont let me hear another word of this nonsense said the captain sharply  but capn  not another word i told you unless you want the cat answered captain williamson  he drew himself up and his eyes flashed dangerously and the men silently left him and resumed their work in the forward part of the ship  sailors are queer fellows was dr blades comment once they get an idea in their heads you cant drive it out  ill drive it out dont fear answered the captain  it is too bad that the boys have made such enemies went on the ships physician i am afraid it will spoil a good deal of their pleasure  when the chums came back to the steamer that evening they noticed that two of the sailors looked at them darkly yet nothing was said to them of what had occurred the sailors being afraid to speak and the others not wishing to make the boys uneasy  but among the sailors there was quite a talk over andy and chet  well make em stay ashore if we can said loggermore just wait until we are ready to sail i am not going to trust myself with fellows like that to bring me bad luck  the repairs to the ice king took the best part of a week to make but at the end of that time the ships carpenter pronounced the craft as seaworthy as ever  she may stay up here for a year now and never start those seams again he said  let us hope so answered barwell dawson a leaky ship isnt at all to my liking  pep loggermore and a crony watched for a chance to catch andy and chet ashore what the sailors might have done there is no telling but certainly they would have done all in their power to prevent the boys from returning to the ice king but the lads kept on the vessel there being nothing more to visit on land  we might heave em overboard some night suggested loggermore but the other sailor would not listen to this proposal he was willing to have the youths left behind but that was as far as he cared to go  never mind we can watch them at upernivik said the tar there will be a better chance to leave them behind there than there was here and with this proposal the affair rested although loggermore declared that if there was any more killing of birds from the ship he would heave the boys overboard sure this may seem a terrible threat to some of my readers but they must remember that some sailors especially ignorant ones are extremely superstitious and they deem the killing of a bird at sea the worst kind of a bad omen  the run up the greenland coast was made without unusual incident they passed a number of icebergs but always at a distance and the small ice did not bother them seriously the weather moderated a little so that life on deck proved delightful the boys saw more wild geese some ducks and also some northern petrel but warned by captain williamson did no more shooting  upernivik is about the last settlement north of any importance said professor jeffer to the boys it can be called the most northern town in the world it is a trading station for the esquimaux and also has a mine from which large quantities of cryolite are obtained  and what is cryolite asked chet curiously  the professor smiled faintly it is a substance found only in greenland from which washing soda is made and also some kinds of baking powder the metal aluminum is obtained from it and it is also used in the making of certain kinds of glass greenland has a very large stratum or deposit of cryolite and it is a source of considerable revenue to the mine owners and also to the danish government the latter putting a heavy export tax on it  it was nightfall when the steamer dropped anchor in the harbor of upernivik from the deck of the vessel barwell dawson who had visited the settlement before pointed out the governors house the moravian church and other buildings  there are quite a number of esquimaux here fullblooded and halfbreeds said he most of them live in the stone huts along the mountain side  what do you mean by halfbreeds questioned andy  the halfbreeds are the families of the danish men who have married esquimaux women replied the explorer some of the halfbreeds are very intelligent and they are also much cleaner than the fullblooded esquimaux  are the esquimaux very dirty asked chet  they are the dirtiest people on earth was the emphatic answer and why shouldnt they be they never wash and the only thing they rub on their bodies is whale or seal oil to keep out the cold and to help limber them up  gracious i shouldnt want to live in the same house with them cried andy  you couldnt live with them that is not for any great length of time the smell would make you sick     chapter xx  fast in the ice   well there is one piece of luck said barwell dawson the next morning our collier is here so we can take on coal at once and get away from here inside of three or four days  yes we want to take advantage of the weather while it lasts answered the captain of the ice king and the task of transferring the coal began an hour later  andy and chet asked for permission to go ashore and after word had been sent to the governor of the place they entered a steam launch in company with barwell dawson and professor jeffer the explorer knew what was on chets mind and aided him to find out if the northland was at upernivik  she is here said barwell dawson after making inquiries i will have you taken to her  chet found tom fetjen a danishamerican tall and powerful with a shrewd but kindly face he listened to the boys story with interest and then shrugged his big shoulders  i no can tell you mooch bout dat whaler betsey andrews he said slowly i not know for truf what happen to him but i hear somting las year two esquimaux men come to me an da say dat de whaleboat he got stuck by de ice far up dare and tom fetjen waved his hand northward  stuck in the ice queried chet  dat is what de esquimaux men say da climb up de ice mountain an see him ship stuck fast but gowhat you say himfloat yes float up dat way and again the trader pointed northward  do you mean that the betsey andrews got stuck in some floating ice and was carried northward asked chet  yes dat is eet nobody hear more of de whaleboat  where did you hear this  hear him at etah las summer  how did the esquimaux know it was the betsey andrews asked andy  one esquimau big chief got glass to look he see de capn who got de one arm he try to git to ship but tumble in watermost drown heem den snowstorm come big an cant see de ship no more  this was all the trader could tell he was of the opinion however that the whaler had been finally crushed in the ice and all those aboard had been lost  but chet would not believe this he shut his teeth hard and looked at his chum  ive got to have positive proof before i give up he said in a voice that choked with sudden emotion  although the boys were not aware of it pep loggermore and his crony did their best to follow them around upernivik hoping to place them in some position whereby it would be impossible to regain the ship but by mere chance the boys kept out of the sailors way and when the coaling was at an end and the ice king sailed they were on the ship  let us try it again at etah said loggermore to his crony  as you please pep answered the other his hatred of the lads who had killed the geese had somewhat subsided but loggermore was as much against andy and chet as ever he had it firmly fixed in his mind that if they were taken along dire disaster would surely overtake the expedition  the course of the ice king was now up baffin bay and past cape york to the entrance to smith sound although it was midsummer the weather seemed to grow colder hourly and it was not long before the boys were glad enough to don additional clothing  as soon as we get to etah you will get your first taste of polar exploration said barwell dawson well go out on a hunt  is it much of a settlement asked chet  hardly any settlement at all in the summer the esquimaux have their skin tents pitched there and in the winter they put up a few igloos that is ice huts and thats all  that night came another scare they almost ran into a tremendous iceberg that towered like a giant in the water but the lookout saw the monster just in timeit was rather foggy or he would have seen it soonerand they sheered to windward  what a high iceberg exclaimed chet when the danger was past  yes and to think that it is much deeper in the water than out of it added andy  they reached the inlet leading to etah in a fog and that afternoon experienced a snowstorm that lasted for over two hours then the weather cleared and they made out a number of tents lining the coast here and there they saw some esquimaux in their strange little boats fishing the natives set up a shout when the ice king came to anchor and some lost no time in coming on board they were strangelooking creatures short of form and round of face with straight black hair and mouths unusually large but they were goodnatured and smiled and laughed as they talked to barwell dawson professor jeffer and captain williamson all of whom could speak a little of the esquimaux tongue  the boys were allowed to go on a hunt the next day led by two of the esquimaux the party went off in one of the small boats to a point where it was said game might be found they were out for six hours with barwell dawson and came back loaded down with birds and with a small polar bear chet and andy had shot the bear between them and were proud of their haul  the first polar bear cried andy i dont think it will be the last  before returning to the ship the two boys went off on a little excursion by themselves pep loggermore followed them and tried to think of some way of keeping them from returning to the ice king but got no opportunity of carrying out his plan to do them harm  at etah a large quantity of meat was purchased from the esquimaux who had been awaiting mr dawsons arrival for over a month they had been out hunting bears musk oxen walrus seals and other game for him and they had likewise collected for him over a hundred of the best esquimaux dogs to be found with the dogs they brought six sledges that were light but strong  my but those esquimaux do smell was andys comment when ten of them came on board and took quarters in the forward part of the ship they smell worse than a fish market  the dogs were penned up and made the air hideous with their barking and snarling all the supplies were taken on board and then the ice king steamed away from etah on her voyage into the great unknown  its goodby now to everything civilized and uncivilized said barwell dawson from now on we have got to trust to luck as to what comes  it was the explorers plan to push as far as the ice would let him into smiths sound then when the ice king could sail no further they would disembark and prepare for the coming winterthe terrible long night now it was summer and daylight at all hours of the twentyfour  a good deal of floating ice was encountered within six hours after leaving etah and after that the thumping and grinding on the sides was kept up night and day although the vessel had full steam up the engines were run slowly as too hard a crash might result disastrously occasionally they could make out the shore line but usually low icebergs shut the land from sight  i dont think we can go much further remarked andy on the third day out from etah the ice seems to be closing in all around us  nevertheless the next day they struck a wide lead and ran through this for miles but then the ice became thicker than ever and captain williamson shook his head gravely  not much further mr dawson he said i think we had best make for the shore yonder and he pointed with his gloved hand  as you think best captain was the explorers reply we have now come about as far as i thought we could go  the boys watched the working of the vessel until late that night when they awoke in the morning they found that the engines had stopped they dressed and ran on deck  well i never cried andy we are high and dry now and no mistake  all around them were immense fields of ice and snow the ice king had slid up on the ice and the big transparent blocks held her as if in a vise not far away was an iceberg that looked like a small mountain  this is as far as the ship will go said professor jeffer to the lads the rest of our journey will be made by walking or on the dog sledges  it was so cold the boys were glad enough to hurry below and drink some steaming coffee while eating they learned that barwell dawson had already arranged to take the most of the supplies ashore and house them on a hill not far away the esquimaux were getting out the sledges and dogs to do the carting  well go off on a hunt soon said the explorer but before we do that we must get ready for winter which will ere long be upon us  several days of hard labor for all hands followed as many of the supplies were taken off the steamer and carted on the sledges to a small hill upon which the americans erected a living hut and a storehouse and the esquimaux put up half a dozen igloos and dog shelters the boys were glad to work for it helped to keep their blood in circulation  the esquimaux had a perfect system regarding their dogs and sledges and were under the leadership of a chief named olalola olalola had the largest sledge and the best dogs and it was a sight to see him load up and start his team of half a dozen or more  crack would go the whip and away the dogs would bound with their load sometimes the boys or the men would ride on the sledge and andy and chet thought it the best sport they had ever experienced  a week passed and during that time they experienced two blinding snowstorms but then the weather cleared off as if by magic and barwell dawson asked the boys if they wanted to go off on a hunt after polar bears  just the thing cried andy and chet said practically the same  it was decided that the party should be made up of mr dawson the boys olalola and several others the esquimau was to take along some provisions on the sledge for it was thought the party might be out several days  this is something like it cried chet as they trudged along over the snow and ice i hope we bag about a hundred polar bears  why not make it two hundred while you are at it answered his chum dryly  the first day was a disappointment as no game of any sort appeared in sight but on the following morning olalola said there were bears ahead and they soon came upon unmistakable traces of the game  they were going toward an icy hill and rounding this they saw at least a dozen bears telling the esquimau and the others to remain to the rear barwell dawson crept up on the bears taking andy and chet with him  dont fire until i give the command said the hunter and both boys nodded to signify that they understood  it was a thrilling moment for andy and chet but they were used to hunting big game so they did not get nervous coming up within gunshot mr dawson gave the signal and all three fired their weapons one bear fell dead and another was badly wounded  hurrah thats the way to do it cried andy come on let us bag some more  he ran forward and chet and mr dawson followed the polar bears were evidently dumfounded and did not know for the moment what to do some turned to run away but others arose on their hind legs to do battle  some of em are coming for us cried chet in alarm and then mr dawsons rifle spoke up and another of the big fellows was laid low but the other bears leaped for the boys as if to hug them to death or eat them up     chapter xxi  a fight with polar bears   look out hes coming for you shouted barwell dawson  both chet and andy heard the words but paid no attention their guns were raised and each was aiming at the bear nearest to him crack went andys firearm and the polar bear was halted by a wound in the forepaw  chet was not so fortunate as his gun failed to go off the next instant the polar bear leaped on him and bore him to the ice as boy and beast went down barwell dawson opened fire and the bear was hit in the side a wound that made him more savage than ever  although chet was sent sprawling he did not lose his presence of mind as quick as a flash he rolled over from under the very forepaws of the polar bear and continued to roll down a slight hill to one side  by this time andy and mr dawson were firing again and olalola coming up used several spears with telling effect at the increase in noisethe esquimau adding his yells to the cracks of the weaponsone after another of the bears turned and commenced to run away  dont go after them sang out barwell dawson they may turn again if you do shoot them from a distance  once more he discharged his gun and andy did likewise then chet scrambled up and used his firearm the piece this time responding to the touch on the trigger  another of the bears was now killed outright while the largest of the group was badly wounded in the hind quarters this bear dropped behind the others and drawing closer chet let him have a shot in the ear that finished him the other beasts disappeared behind a hummock of ice and that was the last seen of them  are you hurt asked andy of his chum as soon as the excitement was over and while all were reloading their weapons and the esquimau was securing his spears  got a scratch on the back of the neck answered chet its bleeding a little but thats all say this is a dandy haul isnt it he continued enthusiastically  we must be more careful in the future said barwell dawson usually polar bears are timid and run away but these chaps must have been very hungry and that made them aggressive  the largest of the polar bears was all of eight feet long and correspondingly heavy to lift him on the sledge was no easy task and with the others the hunters found they had all the game the dogs could drag over the ice and snow  we may as well start for the ship at once said barwell dawson olalola thinks a snowstorm is coming and we dont want to get caught out in it if we can help it  they returned to where they had encamped for the night and picked up the few belongings left there then they started direct for the shelters put up near the ship  the last halfmile of the journey was covered in a heavy snowstorm and all were glad when they caught sight of the ice king they found captain williamson and professor jeffer on the deck watching for them  i was afraid you would be snowbound said the captain  he and the professor were astonished at the sight of the polar bears the game was taken to one of the storehouses where some of the natives were set to work to prepare it for use during the winter now close at hand  it had been arranged that the esquimaux and some of the sailors were to live on shore while barwell dawson and his party and the captain and engineer and two others remained on the steamer thus all had more elbow room than if they had crowded the entire party in one place or the other from the hold of the vessel several large lamps were produced and put into readiness for use  the darkness of the winter months is the worst feature of a trip to these parts explained barwell dawson to the boys of course i hope for a great deal of moonlight but even so the dark days are many and lights are absolutely necessary  the darkness has a strange effect on some people said professor jeffer i have heard of sailors going mad because of it but i trust nothing of the sort happens to any one in our party  after that there was a good deal to do for a week around the ship and up at the hut and the days passed swiftly then one clear morning the explorer called to andy and chet  come with me if you want to get your last look at the sun for some months said he  they left the ice king and walked to the top of an icy cliff a mile away professor jeffer was with them and so were dr slade and mr camdal  on the top of the cliff they had to wait nearly an hour before the sun showed itself the long beams of light flashed across the ice and then gradually grew dimmer and dimmer and then disappeared altogether  gone said chet in a low tone all had been very silent for several minutes  yes answered barwell dawson and youll not see the sun again until next february  what a night murmured andy and somehow his heart seemed to sink within him  it was a silent party that returned to the ship andy and chet both began to wonder how the long spell of darkness was going to affect them  it wont be so bad the first few daysor nights said andy but after that he finished with a grave shake of his head  let us try to occupy our minds with work and by reading answered chet i guess its the only way to keep from going crazy  the lights were lit after that and kept burning brightly all through the long winterone large lamp on the deck of the ice king and another equally large in front of the hut on shore smaller lamps were likewise kept burning constantly indoors  hunting continued from week to week and the boys aided in the shooting of more polar bears and also in bringing down several large musk oxen the musk oxen with heads resembling big buffalo bulls were a source of great wonder to the lads  this is hunting and no mistake said andy i wonder what the fellows in maine would say to these if they could see them  beats moose hunting doesnt it andy  rather by the way chet id like to know how my uncle si is making out  he ought to be up here phew wouldnt he complain of the cold it was 38° below zero this morning  i know it and professor jeffer says it will be colder than that before long  they had to guard carefully against the cold for it would have been an easy matter to have an ear or ones nose frostbitten as it was one of the sailors had a big toe nipped by the frost and suffered greatly because of it the boys found it unwise even to touch anything metallic with a bare hand for fear the member would get burnt or cling fast  it was late in november that something happened which disturbed the party not a little late in the day while andy and chet were dozing in their bunks they not having anything to do there came a curious grinding sound from the sides of the ice king  what is that asked andy as he sat up and rubbed his eyes  bless me if i know responded chet let us go on deck and see  they donned their fur coats and mitts and ran out on the deck just as the grinding increased they found captain williamson and barwell dawson engaged in earnest conversation  its the ice pack explained the explorer it is closing in on us  closing in cried andy why its as close in now as it can get  not quite was the grim reply  why do you mean andy stopped short  isnt the ice king strong enough to stand the pressure questioned chet  the steamer is braced to stand a great deal but this ice has an enormous power replied captain williamson if it comes against us too strongly it may crush the ship like an eggshell  at first the commander could think of nothing to do to relieve the vessel but presently it was suggested that the ice be chopped away from the bow and one side in a slanting direction all hands including the boys went at the work with picks and crowbars and spades  it was a fight against nature and the elements and never did men and boys work harder as they labored the ice of the vast pack continued to move closer to the ship causing the ice king to groan and crack in every timber  if she breaks jump for your lives cried captain williamson he was more anxious than words can describe yet he managed to keep cool and directed the work as well as he was able  by night the ice had been chopped away to the depth of a foot and a half the entire length of the vessel then the wind which had been blowing strongly from one direction shifted to another and the pressure on the vessel let up a little  i think we are safe for the present said the captain all hands can rest for a few hours but come in a hurry if i blow the whistle  utterly exhausted by their labors the boys went to their stateroom and threw themselves down to rest both fell asleep instantly and it seemed to andy that he had not slept more than five minutes when chet shook him  on deck cried the former the whistle is blowing  they had been asleep five hours and the rest had refreshed them greatly they hurried again to the deck and as they did so they felt the ice king tremble from stem to stern  id rather be outside than inif she is going to be crushed said andy in a voice he tried in vain to steady he well knew what it would mean to be cast away in the arctic regions without a ship  again everybody was set to work to cut away the ice at the side and the bow of the ice king small holes were drilled and cartridges exploded in them to help the work along in the meantime the crashing of the ice pack continued as the wind having changed to its former course drove the great white mass tighter and tighter against the vessel  i am afraid the ship is doomed cried professor jeffer he was laboring as well as his years permitted  a little deeper cried captain williamson and throw all the coal on deck overboard  the coal added considerable to the weight of the ship and when this was deposited on the ice the vessels draught was lessened by several inches with a straining and cracking she came up and then the work of cutting the ice at her side continued  by noon the prospect of clearing the ice king was almost hopeless the interior timbers were cracking and one had snapped in twain to prevent a conflagration the fires were put out and the lamps also extinguished  another hour will tell the tale said barwell dawson almost sadly a little more pressure and if she doesnt come up she will be smashed as flat as a pancake  captain williamson was now trying to raise the vessel by means of steel cables slipped under the bow and stern the cable ends on the ice pack side were fastened down by crowbars set in deep holes and the other ends were hauled as near taut as possible by means of temporary windlasses  i believe well make it cried the captain presently now then one more turn on the cables  the windlasses groaned and twisted and then of a sudden one broke from its fastenings and hit the side of the ship letting the steel cable slip down into the water this allowed the bow to rise and the stern to go down  the ice pack is moving yelled one man its coming in for all it is worth the ice king is doomed     chapter xxii  through the long night   the crashing and cracking sounds which rent the air seemed to justify the mans cry it was true the ice pack was being driven in sharply by the wind which had greatly increased during the past hour it pressed on the side of the ship with telling force and all those outside heard several timbers give way inside and collapse  but just at the crucial moment the work the men had been doing proved its worth the ice began to crack and split a little deeper down and suddenly the ice king gave a start upward  i think she is coming up cried dr slade and even as he spoke the steamer rose up higher as part of the ice pack got under the hull then came a swishing sound some water spurted up into the air and the vessel came up still higher while the ice appeared to close in solidly under the keel  saved roared captain williamson and his face showed his relief  are you sure asked andy anxiously  yes my lad the ice king is now riding on top of the ice instead of between it any additional move of the ice pack will simply force us upward  she may tip over on her side cried chet  we can easily guard against that chet yes we are saved and i am mighty glad of it  and so am i added barwell dawson  the grinding of the ice pack continued for several days and the vessel was squeezed several inches higher but the pressure on the side was gone completely and the ships carpenter was set to work to repair the damage done one of the timbers running across the boys stateroom had been snapped in twain and the lads viewed the wreckage in deep concern  if we had been sleeping in here when that happened we might have been killed said chet and his chum agreed with him  during the following three weeks it snowed a great deal it was however clear on christmas day and the boys went out for a walk in the vicinity of the vessel all hands were treated to a dinner of wild duck and plum pudding and something of a church service was held by the captain assisted by dr slade who had a good tenor voice and had once sung in a church choir  makes a fellow feel just a little bit less like a heathen remarked chet after the church service had come to an end  indeed that is true answered andy at pine run he had attended the village chapel whenever he had the chance to do so  as professor jeffer had predicted it grew steadily colder and there were many days between christmas and the middle of january when the boys did not care to venture outside outdoor work was out of the question and all hands busied themselves within as best they could the men smoked and played games and sometimes got up boxing matches the boys often took part in the games and chet showed his skill as a boxer by flooring two of the tars handrunning  yet with it all the time passed slowly and both andy and chet were anxious for the long night to come to an end the darkness was beginning to tell on many of the party and pep loggermore especially began to act strangely once he began to sing hysterically and the doctor had to give him some medicine to quiet him  hes a strange dick that chap said captain williamson i am sorry i had him sign articles with me hes one of the oldfashioned superstitious kind that i dont like  the boys were glad when the full moon shone down on the ship for then it was almost as bright as day the moonshine made the distant cliffs and peaks of ice look like castles of white and added a rare beauty to the scene professor jeffer took several photographs in the moonlightof the ship the hut and storehouse and of different members of the party to pass the time some of these films and plates were developed on the ship and the boys aided in printing the pictures many of which proved very good  one moonlight night andy and chet determined to take a short walk to a point some distance behind the storehouse and in the direction of the igloos of the esquimaux so far they had not seen the inside of any of the houses of ice and they were a bit curious to know just how the natives lived  they soon met olalola who had been on a hunt and he invited them inside his temporary home and one after another they crawled through the passageway that answered for a vestibule  inside the igloo was about ten feet in diameter and rounding upward into a dome a foot or two above their heads here lived six of the esquimaux they had some dirty skins on the floor and in the center was a tiny fire resting on some flat stones the smoke escaping through some small holes in the top of the dome  the smell was something awful in the place coming from some seal meat that was cooking over the fire and also from the pipes of the esquimaux who were all smoking stuff that the lads later on learned was a combination of plug tobacco and seal hairthe hair being added to the tobacco to make the latter last longer  olalola could speak a few words of english and he invited the lads to have some of the stew that was being made just for the novelty each lad tried a mouthful but to swallow the nauseating mess was impossible and they had to spit it out at this all of the esquimaux laughed loudly they were not in the least offended because the boys did not like the food  boy no eat me eat said olalola and filled his mouth with great gusto then the youths excused themselves and got out as fast as possible  phew talk about fresh air cried chet when he and his chum were in the open wouldnt you think the esquimaux would die in that kind of rot  i dont believe they are very healthy answered andy dr slade says they are not  they all need a bath and need it badly said chet in deep disgust it was his first and last visit to the igloos  when it was clear the esquimaux often played games one was leapfrog and another was of the snapthewhip variety in the latter sport they would roar loudly when the last man was sent whirling over and over on the ice  youd think hed break his head was andys comment as he saw one unfortunate land with a crash on a hummock of ice  well they are rough fellows and so their sports must be rough answered professor jeffer  nearly every esquimau is skillful with the dogwhip and one of their pastimes amused the boys very deeply the men would gather around in a big circle and in the center of this a small object usually of wood would be half buried in the snow then the men each with his long doglash would try to snap the object from the ring crack would go the lash making a report like a pistol and the snow would come up in a little whirl and sometimes the object would come with it  pretty good shots some of them said andy  wait until we get on the road with the sledges answered barwell dawson then youll see some fancy doings with the whips some of those chaps can reach a dog twenty feet away and take a nip out of his hide as quick as a wink thats the way they get the dogs under such perfect control  i wish i could learn how to drive the dogs said andy  youll have plenty of chance when we get on the move again returned the explorer  two days later andy was walking from the storehouse to the ship when in the dim light from the lamp near the hut he saw something unusual that attracted his attention a man was crawling along on allfours muttering wildly to himself  whatever can that fellow be up to asked the boy of himself for the instant he thought he might be mistaken and that the form was that of some wild beast  his curiosity aroused to a high pitch the lad stopped short and then made a detour coming up on the opposite side of the storehouse here he found the man still on allfours bending over a case of some sort  oh this darkness why dont the sun shine the man was muttering to himself i must have light i will have light  it is pep loggermore and he is as crazy as a loon murmured andy i had better tell the captain of this at once the sailor may hurt somebody if i dont  andy turned around to make a quick run toward the ship when he heard the scratching of a match a tiny flash of flame followed and in that little flare of light he saw the crazed sailor bending over what looked to be a can of oil  he is going to set something on fire thought andy maybe the storehouse thats his crazy idea of getting light  andy was right loggermore was trying to set fire to the storehouse already he was pouring oil from the can over a number of boxes the ends of which formed that side of the shelter  if i run to the ship it will take time reasoned andy by the time i get back with some of the others it may be too late what shall i do  it was a hard question to answer he had no desire to tackle the crazy sailor alone but even while he stood debating with himself he saw loggermore strike another match  stop dont light that loggermore  so shouting andy leaped toward the man who was still crouched down mumbling to himself about wanting a light at the sound of the youths voice the sailor turned and something like a snarl broke from his lips  go away go away he shrieked  loggermore you mustnt set anything on fire  i want light i must have light i hate the darkness growled the crazed sailor  youll burn up all our stores if you do that well starve to death continued andy as he drew closer  i want light went on loggermore doggedly the darkness hurts my headi cant think straight stand back and see what a fine light ill soon have and so speaking he lit another match for the other had fallen in the snow and gone out  help help yelled andy at the top of his lungs he could think of nothing else to do help help  shut up cried the crazed sailor shut up and now dropping the match he had just struck he leaped at andy and caught him by the shoulder and the arm  the grip of the crazy fellow was like steel and do his best the boy could not break away pep loggermore whirled him around and sent him crashing up against the boxes of the storehouse there both stood panting heavily with the sailors eyes glowing like two balls of fire  lelet me go gasped andy loggermore you are crazyyou dont know what you are doing dont be so foolish thats a good fellow  no no ill not let you go you are a jonah andy graham you shot the geese you and that other lad and youve brought us all kinds of trouble ill not let you go shrieked loggermore and then he slammed andy against the boxes once more the feet of both came down on the can and on the box of matches the sailor had dropped smashing each down into the ice and snow  then suddenly a light flared up coming from the broken box of matches they spluttered an instant and set fire to the oil and also to the clothing of the man and the boy loggermore was too crazy to mind this but andy was filled with horror  let go yelled the youth and struggled in vain to release himself but he could not break that awful hold and so he dragged the tar with him and both rolled over and over in the snow andy tried to kick out the fire around his legs and in the meanwhile loggermore got a grip on his windpipe as if to strangle him the boy tried to fight the man off but could not and presently all grew dark around him and then he knew no more     chapter xxiii  north pole or bust   down in the cabin of the ice king close to a roaring fire captain williamson and barwell dawson were playing a game of checkersthe captains favorite amusement chet had been watching with interest but had now gone on deck for a few minutes to get the fresh air and to see what had become of his chum  suddenly through the stillness of the arctic night chet heard andys cry for aid he strained his eyes and saw the flicker of a light as loggermore struck one of the matches  something is wrong cried chet to himself and then tumbled down the companionway in a hurry  whats the matter exclaimed captain williamson startled by the youths abrupt entrance  something is wrong with andyhe is calling for help answered chet  both the captain and the explorer leaped up scattering the checkers in all directions each ran for his fur coat and mitts and each caught up a gun and chet did the same then they scrambled up on deck in doublequick haste and leaped over the side of the steamer on to the uneven ice below  where is he asked barwell dawson  up at the storehouse he yelledlook the place is on fire  both men gazed in the direction and then captain williamson let out a yell that could be heard throughout the entire ship all hands turn out to fight fire  chet started on a run with barwell dawson at his heels the captain remaining behind to rouse the hands to action for in a twinkling he realized what it would mean were the stores burned  when chet reached his chum andy lay flat on his back in the snow motionless pep loggermore was dancing before the everincreasing flames shouting gleefully  light at last i told you id have light shrieked the crazed sailor  andy what is it asked chet and bent over his chum then he saw some sparks on andys clothing and saw that part of his lower garments had been burnt off loggermore had had sense enough to extinguish the blaze on his own clothing  soon half a dozen of the sailors and esquimaux were on the scene and they began to put out the flames by throwing snow and cakes of ice on the storehouse in the meantime chet pulled andy to a safe distance as he did this the latter opened his eyes and started up  lelet go loggermore he gasped  its all right andy  oh is that you chet whewhere is loggermore  dancing around like a maniac  he is crazy hehe tried to burn me and strangle me panted andy  what in the world made him crazy  the darkness he wanted a light so he set fire to the storehouse  by this time andy felt a little better but he was very weak and chet had to help him back to the steamer here he sat down and told his tale then chet went out to relate what he had heard to captain williamson and the others  it took but a few minutes of energetic work to put out the fire when the commander of the ice king saw the battered oil can and box of matches he was furious  the man who did this ought to be strung up on the yardarm he exclaimed  loggermore did it but he is not accountable said chet and told what andy had had to say  where is loggermore asked dr slade ill have to take him in hand  a hurried search was made for the crazed man but he had run away a party was sent out for him and he was found nearly a mile from the ship dancing on the ice singing loudly and tearing his clothing to shreds it was with difficulty that he was brought back and placed in the ships brig then dr slade gave him a sleeping potion and he sank into a profound slumber when he came out of his sleep he said he had had some bad dreams but he could not remember anything of the fire or of his attack on andy  he is not to be trusted said the ships physician you can give him his liberty but i advise that an eye be kept on him  well keep an eye on him never fear answered captain williamson grimly  andy suffered very little from the attack of the frenzied sailor and in a day or two he felt as well as ever  but ill never trust loggermore again he told chet after this he must keep his distance  day after day passed and at last the long night came to an end there was general rejoicing and when andy saw the sun once more he threw up his cap in his delight and fairly danced a jig  its grand chet he cried  grand doesnt express it was chets answer its sublime andy i dont know how you feel but i dont want to go through another such spell of darkness  nor inot for a hundred thousand dollars oh a fellow doesnt know how good sunshine is until he cant have it  preparations for the departure northward had been going on steadily the esquimaux getting their dogs and sledges in readiness and barwell dawson and the others going over the supplies to be taken along of the supplies the greater portion was pemmican over a thousand pounds being placed on the sledges they also had bear meat peas beans bacon and a small quantity of coffee and tea with salt sugar and pepper they likewise carried a portable alcohol stove with some tins of alcohol matches in watertight boxes and such cooking utensils as were absolutely necessary professor jeffer had the scientific instruments including a highgrade sextant thermometer and barometer and also a good film camera with numerous rolls of films four shotguns were taken along and three rifles with a large quantity of ammunition dr slade carried his medicine case  as soon as the long night was at an end more esquimaux put in an appearance with their dogs and sledges one of these was named estankawak and barwell dawson learned that he was considered one of the best dogdrivers in the arctic region  then we must have estankawak by all means said the explorer and interviewed the fellow without delay when he came back from the interview his face showed his excitement  i have just heard great news he cried to professor jeffer and dr slade  what is it asked the professor while the boys listened with interest  according to what this fellow estankawak says dr frederick cook reached the north pole last spring  reached the north pole exclaimed professor jeffer and dr slade in a breath  yes he got there april 21 1908 and he is now on his way back to the united states to break the news  was the esquimau able to give you any particulars questioned the doctor  some but not a great many he says dr cook left annootok about the middle of february taking with him eleven natives with their sledges and over a hundred dogs the party pushed on steadily day after day across ellesmere land to the garfield coast hunting considerably on the way from nansen sound dr cook made almost a beeline for the pole a distance of about eight degrees or roughly speaking five hundred and fifty miles on his final dash he had with him only two esquimaux the others being sent back at various times  and where is he now questioned andy  he is getting back to civilization as fast as possible to send word home if what estankawak says is true dr cook has done a wonderful thingsomething for which explorers have been striving for ages  then we wont be the first at the pole said chet ruefully  never mind chet if we get there well be the first boys at the pole answered andy quickly  thats so answered chet and looked a little relieved  did you ask the esquimau if he knew anything about commander pearys trip this year questioned dr slade  yes he tells me that peary is north of us at cape sheridan and has been there since the middle of last september he too is going to make a dash for the pole and may even now be on the way  perhaps well meet him cried andy  it is not likely with so many miles of snow and ice between us answered barwell dawson  the news concerning dr cook made the explorer more anxious than ever to be on the way and one bright wednesday afternoon it was announced that the expedition would start northward on the following morning the party was to consist of mr dawson the professor dr slade mr camdal and the two boys and eight esquimaux the natives were to drive eight of their best sledges drawn by ninetysix dogs they were to travel northward to grant land and then make a straight dash for the pole captain williamson and his men were to remain as near them along the coast as the weather would permit awaiting their return  and i hope with all my heart that you all come back safe and sound said the commander of the ice king  wish you were going along captain said andy  so do i lad but my place is by the ship youll want the ice king when you get back  at last came the moment for leaving all the sledges were packed and the dogs harnessed and ready for action at the side of the leading team stood estankawak long whip in hand  all ready shouted barwell dawson after a general handshaking  good luck to you cried captain williamson be sure and bring that north pole back with you  sureon our shoulders answered andy gleefully  the explorer motioned to the esquimau crack went estankawaks long whip and off the leading sledge started the others followed in rapid succession there was a cheer from those left behind and an answering cheer from those who were leaving  its north pole or bust said chet with a curiously dogged look on his face  north pole or bust answered andy  do not be too sanguine said dr slade because dr cook has reached that point does not say that we shall be equally successful  dont you think well get there doctor asked chet quickly  i hope so but i am prepared to take what comes i do not believe that you boys understand the dangers and difficulties of the trip before us we may not reach the pole and we may not even get back alive arctic explorations have in the past cost many hundreds of lives  dont discourage the lads broke in professor jeffer briskly we shall succeedi know it i feel it and when we stand on the apex of the worldwhere there is no east no west no north only southah what a glorious prospect and he waved his arms enthusiastically  thats the talk shouted andy well get there somehow and dont you forget it  its north pole or bust repeated chet north pole or bust     chapter xxiv  the last hunt   it was barwell dawsons intention to strike out directly for cape richards the most northerly point of grant land it may be added that this locality was only a short distance west of the point from which commander peary made his successful dash for the pole dr cooks route was still further westward so mr dawsons trail lay almost midway between those of the worldrenowned poleseekers  it was a clear mild day and for the first few miles the going was excellent everybody was in the best of humor and the boys felt like whistling estankawak was in the lead with his sledge and olalola followed him while the others came behind in a bunch the dogs trotted along evenly and the drivers had little trouble with them  this weather is fine remarked barwell dawson i only trust it continues  well it will continue for a few days that is certain answered professor jeffer but after that he shrugged his shoulders well have to take what comes  for several days the expedition traveled through the heart of ellesmere land and there found excellent hunting polar bears musk oxen and caribou were there in plenty and the party also laid low many arctic hares and foxes and likewise a few arctic petrel  we must hunt while we have the chance said barwell dawson the more meat we secure now the greater will be our stock of provisions when we get to where there is nothing but ice and snow and all understood this and hunted to the best possible advantage  by the time the north shore of grant land was reached it was much colder and now they occasionally encountered snowstorms but fortunately these were of short duration reaching the vicinity of cape richards they went into a temporary camp to rest up and repair some of the sledges which had become broken  i am going on another hunt tomorrowpossibly our last announced barwell dawson do you boys want to go along  both were eager to go and the start was made directly after breakfast they took with them two rifles and a shotgun and provisions to last for four meals  after skirting a small hill of ice they came upon a narrow lead of clear blue water and following this reached a point where the ice had been driven in a tight pack for miles here they saw the traces of a polar bear and were soon hot on the trail which led them along the lead and then into the interior  i see him whispered andy after nearly a mile had been covered he is lying down behind yonder hummock  andy was right but before they could reach his bearship the animal scented them and hobbled away  he is lame cried chet i think we can catch him anyway let us try  the others were willing and away they went over the ice which soon became comparatively smooth once chet lost his footing and went flat but he soon got up and continued after the others  finding he could not escape those who were pursuing him the polar bear turned as if to attack them both andy and barwell dawson fired at the beast and he rolled over in a death convulsion and was speedily put out of his misery by chet with his hunting knife  see his forefoot is gone said andy as they surrounded the game looks to me as if some other animal had chewed it off  if it hadnt been for that he would have outrun us answered mr dawson  they spent the remainder of the day looking for more game and toward nightfall started for camp dragging the bear after them  well take him as far as possible and then send the esquimaux out for him with a sledge said the explorer  all thought they knew the direction of the camp but in looking for game they had become more or less turned around and now barwell dawson called a halt  we may as well camp here for tonight he said we dont want to tire ourselves out when it isnt necessary  some snow was scraped up and a hut constructed and they went inside and had supper it was a cold meal but they were hungry and enjoyed every mouthful then they fixed the snow hut a little better and lay down to sleep  they had been resting for about three hours when chet awoke with a start a loud barking had awakened him  dogs he murmured must be one of the esquimaux has come for us  the barking had also awakened the others and getting up the three crawled out of the snow hut  they are not dogs they are foxes cried barwell dawson  yes and look at the number ejaculated andy must be fifty at least  fifty repeated chet all of a hundred or else i dont know how to count  chet was rightthere were all of a hundred foxes outside sitting in a bunch with their heads thrown back barking lustily they had followed the bloodstained trail of the polar bear and wanted to get at the game  this is very unpleasant said the explorer gravely i didnt think wed meet foxes so far north they cant get much to eat up here and they must be very hungry  do you fancy they will attack us questioned andy  i dont know what they will do they want the bear thats certain  if we only had a good campfire that would keep them at a distance  yes but there is nothing here with which to build a fire  supposing we give em a dose of shot suggested chet  you can try it  chet had the shotgun and taking careful aim at the pack of foxes he fired the flash of the firearm was followed by a wild yelp from the animals and three leaped up and then fell on the ice badly wounded the others of the pack retreated for a few minutes then came back to their former position barking more loudly than ever  they are certainly game said mr dawson killing off a few of them dont scare the others  what are we to do asked chet dubiously he had fancied the foxes would disappear at the discharge of the shotgunfor that was what foxes usually did down in maine  well do our best to stand them off until it grows lighter answered barwell dawson  do you think they will run away if we go out after them  not if they are very hungry remember a hungry animal is always desperate  sleep was now out of the question and they took turns in watching the foxes from the entrance to the snow hut it was too cold to remain outside long  they are coming closer announced andy after two hours had passed the foxes had stopped barking some time previously  the report was true the beasts were coming up stealthily moving a foot or two and then stopping to reconnoiter  ill give them another shot from the gun said chet and was as good as his word this time two of the foxes were killed and almost immediately their companions fell upon the carcasses and began to tear them apart  that shows how hungry they are declared barwell dawson  shall we give up the bear to them asked chet  not yetbut we may have to do so in order to escape them answered the explorer with a doubtful shake of his head  another hour went by slowly and by shouting they managed to make the foxes keep their distance but then the animals commenced to come closer once more slowly but surely encircling the snow hut  it was a perilous situation to be in and the youths realized it fully as did mr dawson at any moment the foxes might make a concerted attack and what could three persons do against ninety or more of such beasts  but now it was growing lighter for which those in the hut were thankful as the glow of the morning sun shone in the sky andy set up a loud shout and flung a fairsized cake of ice at the foxes the ice went gliding along and struck one fox in the forelegs wounding him severely  hurrah why didnt we think of that before cried chet  a good idea put in barwell dawson well treat them as if they were tenpins  some loose ice was handy and taking aim at the foxes they sent piece after piece bowling over the icy surface on which they stood the animals had again gathered in a pack so they could not be missed if one leaped out of the way the chunk of ice hit the next and soon there were howls of pain from several then the foxes retreated and when chet fired another shot they suddenly turned tail and trotted off around a distant hill and out of sight  they didnt like the ice and the daylight said barwell dawson i doubt if they come back very soon they may try it again tonight but well be in camp by that time  again they took up the march for camp dragging the bear behind them as before going was fairly easy and dragging the bear over the smooth surface was not much work but whether they were heading just right was a question many times barwell dawson tried to get his bearings but without success  i think ill have to climb yonder hill and take a look around said he when the sun was fairly high we ought to be able to locate the camp from there  well go along said andy who did not care to be left alone in such a field of desolation  yes i would like to take a look around myselfjust to see how the landor rather icelies added his chum  leaving the bear where it was the three started to climb the icy hill on their left the snow on the side aided them and they reached the summit with little difficulty  phew here is where one feels the wind cried andy as he drew his coat closer  cuts like a knife doesnt it answered chet wonder what it will be up at the pole  colder than thisyou may be sure of that answered barwell dawson  all gazed around them to the east and west as well as the south lay the long stretches of snow and ice northward were the same ice and snow with numerous leads of clear bluish water  there is our camp said the explorer pointing to some dark objects in the distance  how far is it asked chet  i cant say exactly probably two miles distances are very deceiving in this atmosphere  there is that lead of water we must have followed yesterday said andy pointing  yes answered barwell dawson we wont go back that way thoughwell try the route over yonder  they were soon down the hill again and making for the spot where they had left the polar bear resuming the load they struck off as best they could in the direction of the camp  about half the distance had been covered when they found themselves quite unexpectedly on the edge of some young icethat is ice recently frozen it did not seem safe and barwell dawson decided to turn back in the direction of the route they had followed when leaving camp this brought them to the lead of the day previous and they were surprised to note that the water was much wider than before  the ice must be moving said barwell dawson i think the sooner we get back to camp the better  they had a small hill of ice before them and started to skirt this andy was in the lead and as he passed a rise of ice and snow he heard a sudden roar that made him jump  what was that he cried in alarm  a walrus answered barwell dawson and close at hand too get your guns ready boys     chapter xxv  crossing the great lead   in less than a quarter of a minute more they came in sight of the walrus stretched out on the ice close to the lead it was a large specimen weighing a good many hundred pounds and as awkward as it was heavy  at the sight of the man and boys the beast raised itself up slightly and started as if to turn back into the water as it did this barwell dawson raised the rifle took steady aim and sent a bullet through its head  thats a fine shot exclaimed andy as the walrus fell back uttering a roar of pain shall i give it another  might as well was the explorers answer and the lad quickly complied the shot scattering into the walruss head killing it almost instantly  scarcely had the echo of the discharge penetrated the air when there came a number of loud roars from a little further around the icy hill the hunters advanced and chet uttered a yell  look look did you ever see so many walruses in your life  he pointed ahead but there was no need to do this for all saw only a couple of hundred feet away a veritable herd of walruses numbering at least a hundred if not twice that number they had heard the deathcry of their mate and were lumbering forward to see what was the matter  we cant fight such a crowd as that exclaimed andy aghast we had better clear out  i wish the esquimaux were here returned barwell dawson we could make a mighty haul of walrus meat and that is what we need he looked at the boys who is the better runner of you two he asked  andy answered chet promptly he can outrun me twice over  then supposing you leg it for camp just as hard as you can continued the explorer tell the esquimaux and mr camdal to come as quickly as possible  without waiting for more words andy was off like a shot directly past the walruses who simply raised themselves up to gaze stupidly at him the others had withdrawn from sight and when the beasts saw andy running away they thought themselves alone slowly they lumbered over the ice and surrounded their dead companion uttering hoarse roars that could be heard a long way off  andy had the direction of the camp well in mind and made as straight a run for it as the nature of the ice permitted with such heavy clothing a record run was impossible yet he covered the distance in good time  he found the esquimaux outside of their igloos listening to the roaring of the walruses which could be heard far away over the ice he soon made them acquainted with what was wanted and with a glad shout they started off with their spears and bows and arrows then he aroused mr camdal and the latter got his shotgun and an ax  an ax is sometimes better than a gun explained mr camdal you can sometimes crush a walruss skull with one wellaimed blow from an ax  the esquimaux were ahead but the others soon caught up with them the walruses were still roaring and bellowing one of the natives said this was a sign that they were getting ready to move  as they drew closer the esquimaux spread out in a semicircle and held up their spears ready for use olalola was in the lead for he was considered by all to be the best hunter  the walruses were found almost where they had been when andy went for aid a few surrounded the dead beast sniffing the carcass suspiciously evidently they had never been hunted and did not know the meaning of a gunshot  as soon as the esquimaux were sufficiently close they threw their spears and followed these up with a number of arrows in the meantime the others discharged their firearms and then mr camdal rushed in boldly with his ax by this means eight of the huge creatures were laid low before they could help themselves the others turned to gain the open water and went sousing in sending the icy spray in all directions  in his enthusiasm chet had drawn close to the lead and before he knew it he found two of the walruses confronting him he dodged one but the other beast knocked him flat with one blow of a flipper it looked as if his life would be crushed out a moment later  andy saw his chum fall and for the moment his heart leaped into his throat then he jumped to the front and sent a bullet into the breast of the walrus but this was not fatal and the walrus still lurched forward  pull chet away yelled mr dawson and fired from a distance the bullet hitting the walrus just below the head then a spear whizzed through the air thrown by olalola this caught the beast in the mouth and went part way down its throat the walrus flopped backward and at that moment andy caught his chum by the leg and dragged him out of danger then mr camdal came to the front and a blow from the ax finished the beast  the battle was now practically over for the walruses that were alive had taken to the water those that were badly wounded could not swim very well and the esquimaux went after them bringing in two the total killing amounted to thirteen  thats a lucky thirteen was barwell dawsons comment after the excitement was over the meat is just what we want for the esquimaux and the dogs and the hides will come in handy for footwear and harness  it was no easy task to get the walruses and the polar bear to the camp and several of the dog sledges had to be brought up for that purpose then two days were spent in getting the meat ready for use and in preparing the hides  it was a clear cold day when the next start northward was made a light wind blew from the westward barwell dawson calculated that they might cover twenty if not twentyfive miles  from now on we must do our best said he we can afford no more delays otherwise our food supply may give out before we get back  fortunately all were in the best of health although professor jeffer suffered a little from snowblindness he at once donned a pair of smoked goggles and several of the others did likewise  the end of the week found them a hundred and fifteen miles closer to the pole they had encountered two leads but had managed to get across without great difficulty one of the sledges had been badly damaged and it was resolved to break it up and use the parts in repairing the other turnouts two of the dogs were sick and had to be killed  the next day the weather changed and for fortyeight hours they struggled on through a heavy snowstorm with the wind fortunately on their backs during this storm one of the sledges fell into some open water and three dogs were drowned while a small portion of the outfit went out of sight into the arctic sea  all hands must be more careful after this said barwell dawson as we advance going will probably become more treacherous keep your eyes wide open  as soon as it cleared off professor jeffer brought out his sextant and his artificial horizon a pan of mercury and took an observation he announced that they were close to the eightyfourth degree of north latitude  that means we have but six more degrees to coverabout four hundred miles said chet  professor will you explain how you take the observation asked andy  to be sure certainly was the reply of the scientist it is very easy when one knows how here is the sextant shaped as you can see like a piece of pie the curved side has a scale on it which is just onesixth of a circle hence the name of the instrument here is a telescope which is adjustable and here are two glasses one for the rays of the sun or a star and one for the horizon at sea i would use the natural horizon but that is impossible here amongst the ice and snow and so i use an artificial horizon made of a pan of mercury  when i want to take an observation i watch my chronometer and wait until it is exactly twelve oclock then i point the sextant in such a fashion that the rays of the sun reflected downward seem to meet or kiss the horizon as soon as i have the light of the sun in a direct range with the horizon i use this thumbscrew which sets the scale below which as you see is divided into degrees minutes and seconds as soon as i have read the scale by means of this magnifying glass i consult this book i carry the ephemeris or nautical almanac and knowing the altitude of the sun i readily calculate just where we are located in degrees minutes and seconds north latitude  its certainly a great instrument said andy id like to try it some day  you shall do so answered professor jeffer and the very next day he allowed andy to aid him in getting a true sight and showed the boy how to work out the necessary calculations and also make some allowancesfor such observations are not absolutely perfect in themselves  they had now to advance with more caution than ever and several days later came to some open water that looked as if it would bar all further progress the lead was six or seven hundred feet wide and ran east and west as far as eye could reach  looks as if we were stumped murmured chet how are we ever going to get across  a consultation was held and then barwell dawson sent one party of esquimaux to the eastward and another to the westward to look for a crossing place  the esquimaux were gone for two days and during that time a fierce snowstorm came up blotting out the landscape on all sides it was so cold that the boys could do nothing outside and were glad enough to crouch in an igloo for warmth during the snowstorm more of the dogs became sick and four of the finest of the animals died  something is wrong with them said barwell dawson and had dr slade make an examination it was then learned that the dogs had been poisoned by eating tainted seal meat the meat was inspected and over a hundred pounds thrown away  when the natives who had been sent out came back they reported that to the east and the west the lead was wider than ever  any smooth floating ice asked barwell dawson  yes some smooth ice had been seen and the explorer went out the next day to investigate as a result some large cakes were floated close to the temporary camp and these were lashed together with walrus thongs  what do you intend to do with those questioned professor jeffer  i am going to try to get across to the other side answered barwell dawson well use the flat ice for a ferry  its a dangerous piece of business sir  i know it but we must do something was the firm answer  two of the esquimaux agreed to get on the floating cakes of ice taking with them one of the teams and a sledge it was no easy matter to induce the dogs to go aboard as it might be called and the natives were a good hour getting started but once afloat they crossed the lead without serious danger and then began the task of getting the rest of the expedition over this took all of that day and also the next on one of the trips an esquimau went overboard and dr slade also took an icy bath but both were quickly rescued and bundled up in clothing that was dry and warm  there i am glad we are over that lead exclaimed barwell dawson when the last of the men and sledges had crossed i trust we dont have any more of the sort to cross  i am afraid well have a great many answered professor jeffer getting to the north pole is going to be the hardest kind of a struggle  well get thereif we keep our health and the provisions last said the explorer confidently  once again they turned northward into that vast region of ice and snow and solitude it was certainly a gigantic undertaking would they succeed or would all their struggles go for naught     chapter xxvi  on a floating mass of ice   one hundred and thirty miles more andy  who said so  professor jeffer he just took an observation answered chet as he crawled into the igloo and slapped his mittened hands to get them warm  andy shook his head slowly chet it doesnt look as if wed make it does it  barwell dawson says we are going to make it or die in the attempt  well im just as eager almost as he is but eagerness isnt going to make these leads close up and isnt going to give us extra food and drink  getting sick of pemmican and walrus meat  arent you  ratherbut there is no use in kicking  say do you know what day this is  no  the first of april maybe some folks would call us april fools to try to reach the pole  here the two boys became silent for both were too tired and too cold to do much talking  the last few weeks of traveling had been very badso bad in fact that half of the esquimaux had been turned back to make a camp and wait the return of the others mr camdal had been taken sick and he had been left behind and now dr slade was ailing and so were two of the natives sixteen of the dogs had perished and their bodies had been fed to the other canines  the hardships had been beyond the power of pen to describe they had encountered numerous snowstorms and a cutting west wind had for three days made traveling impossible the smooth ice had given way to little hills and ridges that battered the sledges frightfully one more had gone to pieces and the parts had been used for mending purposes as before  the effects of the hardships were beginning to tell on everybody the boys were thin and holloweyed and when they walked or rather toiled along their legs felt like lead to get up any speed was impossible and if in ten hours walking they managed to cover fifteen or twenty miles they thought they were doing well the glare on the ice and snow also affected them so that their eyes appeared like little slits professor jeffer had been in danger of having his nose frostbitten but the boys had noticed it just in time and come to the old scientists rescue by rubbing the member with soft snow thus putting the blood again in circulation  well lads how do you feel asked barwell dawson as he entered the igloo followed by professor jeffer dead tired i suppose  tired doesnt fit it answered chet with a sickly grin i am nextdoor to being utterly played out  perhaps i had better leave you two boys behind while professor jeffer and myself with one sledge make the final dash  no now ive come so far im going to stick it out answered chet grittily  and so am i added andy i guess well feel better after a good sleep he went on hopefully  a few minutes later all sank into a profound slumber from which they did not awaken until well in the morning then the barking of the dogs and the shouting of one of the esquimaux made them leap up and crawl outside  olalola says the wind has died down said barwell dawson we may as well make the most of it  a hasty breakfast was prepared and inside of half an hour they were again on the way toiling over ice that was rough in the extreme they pushed on steadily until noon when it being bright sunlight professor jeffer took another observation  one hundred and sixteen miles more he said after his calculations were complete we are gradually lessening the distance we shall make it after all and his face showed his enthusiasm to such a scientist as the professor gaining the pole meant far more than it did to the boys  in the middle of the afternoon came another setback another lead came into view broad and with the water flowing swiftly at this the esquimaux shook their heads dismally  we cannot go over that said one in his native tongue  we must answered barwell dawson briefly with the north pole so close at hand he was determined that nothing should keep him from reaching the goal  the party gathered at the edge of the lead and there found the ice cracked and uncertain andy was with olalola who had a sledge drawn now by but six dogs  suddenly as the men were walking up and down the shore looking for some means of crossing the water there came an ominous cracking andy tried to leap back and so did olalola but ere they could do so the ice upon which they and the dogs and sledge were located broke away from the main field and floated out into the lead  look out there exclaimed chet in horror  throw us a rope yelled andy while olalola uttered a cry in his native language  but no rope was handy and in a few seconds the strong current of the water carried the cake of ice far out into the lead it still kept its balance but there was no telling how soon it might turn over and send andy the esquimau and the dogs to their death  oh we must save andy screamed chet what can we do  well do all we can answered the explorer  he ran to one of the loads and tore from it a long rope then he hurried along the edge of the lead in the direction whence the current was carrying the flat cake of ice with its human freight  andy and olalola saw the movement and both understood at once that they must make some sort of a fastening for the rope should they be able to catch it with a sharppointed knife andy picked away a small hole and in it set a peg taken from the sledge  while the lad was doing this barwell dawson curled up the rope as if it were a lasso his outings on the plains now stood him in good stead and he threw the end of the rope with the skill of a cowboy lassoing cattle olalola caught it and slipped it over the peg and then he and andy did all they could to hold the peg in the ice  it now became a question if the explorer could haul the floating ice in or if the current would be too strong for him chet came to his aid and so did two of the esquimaux  beware of where you stand sang out chet the shore is cracked all along here  this was true and all were in danger of going down the ice was the most rotten they had yet encounteredwhy they could not tell  working with care they at last turned the floating mass shoreward until it bumped lightly but just as they did this the ice at their feet began to give way  jump for it dont wait yelled barwell dawson and andy jumped and so did olalola the latter tried to drive the dogs but ere he could do so the peg came up allowing the rope to free itself and off floated the big cake again carrying the dogs sledge and supplies with it andy and olalola got into water up to their knees but managed to throw themselves headlong on the firm ice and roll over and over to safety  im glad to see you safe said mr dawson but its too bad about those dogs and the supplies  cant we get them in asked professor jeffers  we can try it  they did try it but just below where they stood the lead widened out and another lead cut crosswise so their further progress was barred they stood on the edge of the ice watching the dogs and sledge disappear around a hill to the north of the lead the dogs howled dismally as if knowing they were doomed  the loss of so many dogs and so much of their outfit sobered the entire party and estankawak berated olalola soundly for allowing the team to get away from him estankawak had been fainthearted for several days and now he came to barwell dawson and advised that all turn back  we cannot reach the big nail said he we have not enough food and not enough dogs by the big nail he meant the north pole  we have certainly suffered a severe loss but i think we can reach the pole anyway answered mr dawson  estankawak wants to go back  very well you can go back if you want tobut youll have to go alone  this of course did not suit the esquimau at all he said he wanted the other esquimaux to go with him and walked away grumbling to himself  hell have to be watched said chet to andy when he heard of this talk  right you are answered his chum andy had not suffered from his adventure but it must be confessed that he had been badly scared  on the following morning while they were still trying to get over the lead a strong wind came up from the northeast this began to move the ice on the north shore and in less than six hours the lead was completely choked up with it when they looked at this transformation the boys could scarcely believe their eyesight  now is our chance cried barwell dawson olalola says it is perfectly safe to cross the ice although it will be a terribly rough journey  they went forward estankawak most unwillingly and inside of two hours left the lead behind them they now struck ice that was comparatively smooth so progress became more rapid by the next day they were within just a hundred miles of their goal  well get there cried andy but in less than ten hours his tune changed for it commenced to snow furiously while the wind became a perfect gale all hands were glad enough to crawl into some hastilyconstructed igloos and even the dogs sought whatever shelter they could find  they were thus stormbound for several days to make any move whatever would have been folly and barwell dawson attempted none yet he chafed roundly at the delay the more so as he saw his stock of supplies rapidly diminishing  we must go on shorter rations said the explorer and cut down the quantities that very day this led to increased dissatisfaction on the part of estankawak and he conversed earnestly with another of his tribe muckaloo by name but not in the hearing of olalola  he is up to no good and we must watch him whispered andy to chet maybe he will try to bolt and take some of our things with him  this was just what estankawak had in mind to do and he readily got muckaloo to join in the scheme early in the morning of the next day when the weather showed signs of clearing the two esquimaux crawled out of their hut and sneaked over to one of the sledges and harnessed up the team of six dogs on the sledge they placed such of the stores as were handy  the boys were watching them and andy immediately notified barwell dawson  going to mutiny eh cried the explorer and snatching up a shotgun he ran outside without waiting to don his fur coat he saw estankawak and muckaloo at the sledge just ready to drive off  stop you rascals he roared in the native tongue go a step and ill shoot you down  the esquimaux were startled for they had not dreamed that any one outside of themselves was stirring in the camp they looked at barwell dawson and at the leveled shotgun and estankawak dropped the whip he had raised while muckaloo hung his head  you are going to stay with us went on the explorer if you want to leave you must go without any of our things  it is death to try to reach the big nail growled estankawak  it will be death if you try to run off with any of my things replied barwell dawson grimly go back to your igloo and stay there until i call you and at the point of the shotgun he made the mutinous natives retire to one of the ice huts     chapter xxvii  how commander peary reached the pole   after the trouble with estankawak and muckaloo mr dawson had a close conference with olalola he found the latter as faithful as ever and so put him in sole charge of the dogs and sledges and warned him to keep a close watch on the others  do not let them steal anything said the explorer and when we return to civilization you shall be richly rewarded i will give you a boat a gun and a hunting knife  this to the esquimau was riches indeed and he promised to keep watch day and night he had a stern talk with estankawak and muckaloo and came close to thrashing them both after that the mutinous natives caused but little trouble  two days went by and slowly but surely the party drew closer to the pole the professor took another observation and announced that they had now but sixtyeight miles more to cover to reach the top of the world  that wouldnt be so bad if walking was good but it seems to grow worse said andy he had already worn out two pairs of walrushide footcoverings and now the third pair looked woefully ragged  id like to know something of commander peary observed chet he must be in this region  he is answered barwell dawson but just where there is no telling perhaps he has been to the pole and is now coming back  they would have been much surprised if they had known that commander peary was at that moment less than a hundred miles away from their camp this intrepid explorer had pushed his way steadily northward over the ice from cape columbia to which point he journeyed from cape sheridan during the latter part of february his outfit at this time consisted of seven members of the expedition seventeen esquimaux 133 dogs and nineteen sledges it was the largest and best outfit lieutenant peary had ever had at his command for this work  it was the explorers plan to establish supply stations all along the route and for this purpose some of the party were at first sent ahead they found conditions very similar to those which i have already described and lost several sledges and a good many dogs while some of the natives became sick and had to be sent back  by hard work commander peary reached the 85th degree of north latitude on march 18th and five days later managed to cover another degree it was intensely cold the thermometer registering fifty and more degrees below zero one man had his foot frozen and had to be sent back to one of the bases of supplies  feeling that the goal was now within his grasp commander peary kept on steadily and soon passed the 87th degree of latitudehis highest point during the expedition previously taken this was a day of rejoicing here he dispensed with his last supporting party and pushed into the great unknown with only a handful of faithful followers  at the end of march he was held up most unexpectedly by open water and every one of the party was much disheartened but this water was crossed april 2d and two days later the great explorer found himself within one degree of his goal  despite the intense bitterness of the cold he pushed on as steadily as ever it was a nerveracking ordeal yet he had but one thought one ambitionto reach the goal for which he had been striving for twenty years he could scarcely sleep and eat so anxious was he to get to the end of the task he had set for himself  at last he stopped on april 6th to take another observation this showed him to be within a few miles of the pole and if he went wild with joy who can blame him he called to those with him and away they went over the ice paying no heed to the keen wind that cut like a knife  and then came the supreme moment of joy the north pole was gainedthe height of his ambition had at last been realized he really and truly stood upon the top of the world it was to him the moment of moments and yet he could not realize it for it all seemed so commonplace at the pole it did not look different from what it did for miles around the soughtfor spot all was a field of ice and snow vast and desolate  thirty hours were spent at and around the pole taking observations and photographs and in planting the stars and stripes and also some records then commander peary started back to break the news of his success to a world that had just been astonished by the reports of dr cooks achievements of the year before  it was but a few hours after the professor had made the announcement that they had but sixtyeight miles more to cover that the party under barwell dawson came to another lead it was wide and of great depth as a sounding proved and how to cross this became the next problem even olalola shook his head  there is no end to it he said sadly i go with you but how  we must find a way answered the explorer and he and chet went out on a tour of discovery  they came back discouraged and that night all rested on the edge of the lead wondering what they should do next at last barwell dawson called the boys and the professor to him  i think it best that we make the rest of the journey alone said he we can take the best of the dogs and the best sledge and try to make a quick dash leaving the others here to await our return what do you say  the boys were willing to do anything and the professor was of a like turn of mind  but how are you going to get over the lead asked andy  ill find some kind of a way answered the explorer  the matter was explained to olalola he was sorry to have them leave him but promised faithfully to look after the camp and after dr slade who was still ill while they were gone he said that by following the lead westward they might be able to cross it  i think so myself answered mr dawson  the start was made early the next day andy and chet taking turns at driving the six dogs the pick of what were left of the pack the course was along the lead westward and after a mile had been covered they reached a spot where some new ice covered the water  do you think it will hold us asked andy  ill test it and see was mr dawsons reply  after an examination the explorer came to the conclusion that they might risk the new ice  but we must go over it quickly he cautioned dont let the dogs stop  they walked a distance back and set the sledge in motion then out on the ice they spun chet cracking his long whip in true esquimau fashion the new ice cracked and groaned under their weight and when they were in the middle of the lead it began to buckle  spread outdont keep together yelled barwell dawson chet whip up the dogs and let em go it alone  the boy understood and gave the canines the lash away they sped at breakneck speed then chet leaped to one side and he and the others continued on their way a distance of fifty or more feet from each other  it was a great risk they had assumed and each instant they thought the ice would break and let them down in the water a rescue under such conditionswith the thermometer standing at fiftythree degrees below zerowould have been out of the question  the ice is going down screamed andy just as he was within a rod of the north shore hurry up  there was no need to sound the warning for all understood the peril only too well they increased their speed and slid the remaining few feet then just behind them they saw the ice buckle and break allowing a stream of icy water to run over it  safe and thank heaven for it murmured barwell dawson when he could catch his breath  dont ask me to take another such run panted professor jeffer i thought wed surely be drowned  as soon as they had recovered somewhat from the dash they walked on to where the dogs had stopped in letting them go mr dawson had known that they were in no physical condition to run out of sight when the travelers came up they found the canines stretched out resting the harness was in a snarl and it took them the best part of a quarter of an hour to get the team straightened out again  did you notice that the ice looks purple remarked andy as they went on once again  i did answered barwell dawson it is as peculiar as it is beautiful  he had noticed the purple ice several days before and also several mirages in the skymirages that looked like hills and mountains but which he knew were only optical delusions coming northward the party had also had a splendid view of the aurora borealis or northern lights that mysterious glow thought to be electrical or magnetic once andy had said that he could hear the lights and that they sounded like the low hissing of steam  it grew colder that night and it was all the explorers could do to keep from freezing they had a small quantity of tea lefta quarter of a poundand after melting some snow over their alcohol stove drank the beverage boiling hot then they made themselves a hot stew of pemmican and groundup peas each of the dogs received a chunk of frozen walrus meat something they gnawed on savagely so great was their hunger  the next day the sun was clouded so that it was impossible for the professor to take any observations but they knew they had not yet reached their goal and so they pushed on over ice that was hummocky but not nearly as bad as it had been  hello cried andy about the middle of the afternoon whats that yonder  he pointed to their left where a dark object lay on the ice half covered with loose snow  might as well see what it is said barwell dawson who was as curious as the others so far in that land of desolation they had seen absolutely nothing but ice snow and open water  they moved to the spot and saw that the dark object was the carcass of a dog frozen stiff beside the dog lay a board of a sledge  look exclaimed barwell dawson as he held up the board do you see what it says  all looked at the bit of wood and saw burnt upon it the following                           peary1909  it is something from the peary expedition said professor jeffer he must have gotten up here ahead of us  it certainly looks that way answered barwell dawson well he deserved to reach the pole after his many years of untiring efforts  leaving the board as a silent monument the four continued on their way northward again the wind was blowing from the west and they calculated that it was on the increase  with the thermometer down so low if it blows very strong well be frozen stiff declared chet why a winter in maine is a hothouse alongside of this  the next day owing to the wind they made but scant progress it was cloudy yet just around noon the sun peeped from behind the clouds and professor jeffer hurried to take an observation barwell dawson gave him the correct time and the old scientist quickly succeeded in making his computations  well how do we stand asked mr dawson when professor jeffer had finished  we are within twentytwo miles of the pole was the answer that thrilled the hearts of all     chapter xxviii  the top of the world at last   well get there tomorrow  if the weather permits andy  oh we must get there chet just think of itonly twentytwo miles more why its nothing alongside of what we have already traveled  well food is running very low  oh i know that didnt i take an extra hole in my belt last night after supper i feel as flat as a board  a day had been spent in camp with the wind blowing furiously and a fine saltlike snow falling they had tried to go on but had covered less than half a mile when barwell dawson had called a halt  its no use he had said with a sigh we cant do anything in this wind let us keep our strength until it subsides  they had spent the day in mending the sledge which was in danger of going to pieces and in fixing up their foot coverings which were woefully ragged  it was still blowing when they started again on their journey but it was not nearly so bad as before and the snow had ceased to come down the sun however was still under the clouds and the sky looked gray and sullen  i dont know that id care to live here the year round said andy with an attempt at humor it would be too hard to dig the potatoes  or go swimming answered chet every time a fellow wanted a bath hed have to chop a hole in the ice  or tumble in a lead  but just the same if we do reach the pole what a story well have to tell when we get back  well not be the first at the pole  well be the first boys at the pole  right you are  they trudged on occasionally urging the lagging dogs the canines seemed to realize the loneliness of the situation and occasionally stopped short squatted down and rent the air with dismal howlings  they dont see any food and shelter ahead and i dont blame them said barwell dawson  by nightfall they calculated they had covered twelve miles if that was true only ten miles more separated them from their goal  and well make that tomorrow or bust cried andy he was deadtired and ached in every limb but a strange light shone in his eyesthe same fire that lit up the eyes of barwell dawson  in the morning the sky looked more forbidding than ever but there was only a gentle breeze and the thermometer registered fortyeight degreesseveral degrees warmer than it had been  well travel until noon announced barwell dawson then well make camp and wait until we can take an observation  they progressed almost in silence the boys occasionally cracking the whip and urging the dogs barwell dawson and professor jeffer were busy with their thoughts their fondest hopes seemed about to be realized the boys thought of home would they ever see maine again  seems like a lifetime since we left pine run remarked chet once  two lifetimes responded andy one such trip as this is enough for me  the lads were footsore and weary to the last degree but neither complained they did not want to worry barwell dawson and what would have been the use he could not aid them it was now a question of every one for himself  it was one oclock when the explorer called a halt on every hand was the field of ice and snow but far ahead could be seen something which looked like a big iceberg the sun was still under a cloud  i think we have gone far enough said barwell dawson well camp here and wait until we can take an observation  no time was lost in gathering cakes of ice and building a fairsized igloo the boys worked with renewed interest had they really and truly reached the north pole at last  at the most we cannot be over a mile or two away from it said the explorer  all were glad to rest yet sleep was almost out of the question the one thought of each member of the party was are we at the pole or how much further have we to go  early in the morning it was cloudy but about ten oclock the sun came out faintly  unless it comes out full i cannot take an accurate observation said the professor  all waited impatiently and watched the sky when it was a quarter to twelve the clouds rolled away to the eastward and the sun burst forth with dazzling brightness  now is our chance cried chet  all assisted the professor in his preparations to take the allimportant observation the old scientists chronometer was compared with that of barwell dawson  a difference of but three seconds said the former we will split the difference when i take the observation and this was done  the sextant was raised and the old scientist looked through it with great care his artificial horizon had been arranged but a short distance away  time roared barwell dawson and the professor set the thumbscrew of his instrument then through the magnifying glass he read the figures and set to work with pen and pencil making his computations with his nautical almanac before him all awaited breathlessly what he might have to say suddenly the aged man threw down the paper and pencil and threw his arms into the air  we are at the 90th degree of north latitude he cried we have reached the north pole  hurrah yelled andy and chet simultaneously and barwell dawson joined in the cheer  you are certain of that asked the explorer we must make no mistake  read the observation for yourself answered the old scientist  it is true said barwell dawson when he had verified the figures we are really and truly at the north pole now then to raise the flag  the others understood all through the bitter journey they had carried an american flag and a fairsized flagpole once the flag had become torn but they had mended it with care  in a twinkling the pole was brought forth and planted in the ice and snow then the flag was raised and it floated proudly in the breeze  three cheers for old glory cried barwell dawson and the cheers were given with a will  three cheers for barwell dawson cried andy and he and chet and the old scientist gave them roundly then there followed a cheer for professor jeffer  and now a cheer for the first boys at the north pole cried barwell dawson and he and professor jeffer raised their voices as loudly as they could the boys could scarcely contain themselves and both danced a jig and then andy turned half a dozen handsprings just by way of working off his superfluous spirits  it was wonderful what a difference reaching the pole made in them all the hardships of the past weeks were forgotten and even the men acted like schoolboys out for a holiday they walked around the vicinity of the igloo and sang and whistled and for once completely forgot their hunger then during the course of the afternoon professor jeffer took more observations and a number of photographs  the next day the sun continued to shine brightly and promptly at noon another observation was made this gave the same result as before so all were assured that they were really at the 90th degree of north latitude  we must be at the north pole said andy for see while we call one part of the twentyfour hours day and the other night the sun goes right around us and never seems to rise or sink  yes that is something of a test answered professor jeffer but it is not as infallible as that made by the sextant the earth is more or less flat here and that makes a difference  to make dead certain that they had covered the north pole the entire party journeyed five miles further ahead and also an equal distance to the right and left at one point they saw traces of another exploring party but the snow and ice had covered up the records left behind  and now to get back said barwell dawson at the close of the third day spent at and around the pole we have no time to spare if we want to get out of this land of desolation before winter sets in again  i am ready answered professor jeffer i have taken all the observations and photographs i wish and have collected a valuable amount of data  you cant get back any too quick for me said chet dryly  there is no use in disguising the fact that our provisions are very low continued barwell dawson gravely we have very little left for the dogs  what will you do with them asked chet  one is a little lame if the worst comes to the worst well kill him and feed him to the others  they left the igloo standing and on the top placed a metallic box containing a brief record of their trip then they took down the flag and placed it on the sledge  they started on the return at seven in the morning the weather was not so cold as it had been and going seemed to be better so they covered the twentytwo miles to their old camp without much difficulty here they had to repair the sledge again and also had to kill off the lame dog this made a feast for the others and gave them some food that was much needed  i could almost eat dog meat myself said chet  it may come to that answered andy i guess it is a heap better than nothing when a chap is starving  they found the new ice on the lead much thicker than it had been and so crossed with ease but now came on a heavy fall of snow and all traces of their former trail were wiped out  well have to steer by eyesight and the compass announced barwell dawson  the boys were so hungry that they kept an eye open continually for game but not so much as a bird showed itself it was truly the land of ice and snow and nothing else  on the fifth day the case containing alcohol sprung a leak and all of the precious stuff was lost in the snow  well have to eat our meals cold after this said barwell dawson too bad but it cant be helped  i dont care how cold they are if only we could get enough grumbled chet an almost empty stomach did not tend to put him in good humor  another day passed and again it snowed the flakes were so thick they could not see around them and so had to halt and go into camp their provisions were now so low that only half rations were dealt out  we cant stand this cried chet ive got to have something to eat  oh chet dont grumble answered andy we are as bad off as you are  tomorrow if we find it necessary well kill off one of the dogs for food said barwell dawson that will leave us a team of four and we ought to be able to get back to where we left the others with those the sledge has next to nothing on it now  the morning dawned dull and cheerless they had a few mouthfuls of food and then hitched up the dogs once more nobody felt like talking and they started on their long journey in silence  painfully they covered fifteen miles each was footsore and weary to the last degree and not able to go another step they sat down on a ridge of ice and looked at each other  we have got to have something to eat declared chet i am going to have one square meal if i have to die tomorrow  chet exclaimed andy reprovingly  well kill one of the dogs and eat him said barwell dawson its the only way out of it     chapter xxix  fighting off starvation   yet to kill off one of the dogs was a serious undertaking as they well knew in that country to travel without a dog sledge was all but impossible and the remaining animals might fail them at any moment  let us wait until tomorrow said andy something may turn up  id rather have something to eat now growled chet  i will deal out a little pemmican answered barwell dawson and served each person about five ounces  then with increasing slowness they covered three miles more ahead was a little hill and the explorer thought to climb this and take a look around to get his bearings  hardly had he climbed the hill when he uttered a cry calling the others to him  there is something to our right he said some dark object half hidden in the snow  perhaps another memento of the peary expedition grumbled chet i dont want any more of emi want to get back  well have a look cried andy he turned to his chum come brace up chet and stop grumbling thats a good fellow  all right exclaimed chet suddenly i suppose youve got as much right to grumble as i have but my stomach is as flat as a pancake he continued woefully i could fill up on sawdust if i had any  all of the party set off in the direction of the object barwell dawson had discovered the explorer was in advance and suddenly he set up a ringing shout  saved saved  what do you mean asked chet quickly  it is our old sledgethe one the dogs ran away with it is stuck in a crack of the ice  are the stores on it asked andy  yes everything seems to be here returned the explorer joyfully  how the sledge had gotten there they did not know and at that moment they did not care probably the floating ice had bumped against the shore and the dogs had started northward not knowing what else to do then the sledge had become caught in the crack and the dogs growing impatient had broken their harness they had gnawed at the coverings of the stores but had been unable to get at the food and had then disappeared utterly  the finding of the sledge with its provisions and its supply of alcohol filled the entire party with joy and they uttered a prayer to heaven for their deliverance from what looked to be starvation as quickly as it could be done they fixed the little stove and lit it and made themselves a steaming hot broth which they devoured with gusto then they fed the dogs built a rough igloo and sank down in a profound slumber from which nobody awakened until ten hours later  although we have found these supplies we must be very sparing of them said barwell dawson when they awoke there is no telling when or how we will be able to get morecertainly not until we have joined the rest of our party and gotten down to where we can find game  all were now anxious to rejoin those who had been left behind and they journeyed steadily southward as fast as the weather would permit they had one wide lead to cross and it took a whole day to get to the south shore then came more snow and they had to lose a day  but luck was with them and one day late in the afternoon they heard a loud shout and saw an esquimau standing on a hillock of ice waving his arms at them it was olalola and they soon reached him  chief dawson reach the big nail asked the esquimau eagerly  we did was the answer  olalola much glad went on the native and his smiling face proved his words  all in the camp including dr slade who was better were glad that those who had gone to the pole had returned and the very next day everything was packed on the sledges and the journey to the ship was begun the food supply was very low and all the extra dogs were killed and fed to the other canines the esquimaux lived on blubber and walrus meat the boys tried blubber once but had to give it up  it turns me wrong side out in a minute was the way andy expressed it  as they drew further south the weather moderated for which they were thankful but they had much open water to cross and this consumed a good deal of time  i wouldnt mind it if only we could find something to eat said chet he suffered more from hunger than did any of the others for he had always been a hearty eater  the next morning there was great excitement among the natives a muskox had been seen and all were eager for the hunt  we must get that beast by all means said andy think what it meansoxroast galore  the trail of the game was readily followed and about seven oclock in the evening the hunters came upon a herd of six musk oxen resting in the shelter of a small hill they surrounded the game and succeeded in bringing down three of them the others were pursued but managed to get away  this ends short rations was chets comment and his eyes brightened wonderfully what he said was true and that evening the explorers enjoyed a better meal than they had had for many weeks the esquimaux and dogs came in for their full share and the big meal put even estankawak in good humor and he thought no more of deserting them  as they came down into the heart of ellesmere land they picked up mr camdal and his party they shot other game and so had all the food they could eat and more the hunting just suited barwell dawson for as he told the boys he was more of a hunter than he was an explorer  how soon do you suppose well reach the ice king asked andy one day  if we have luck we ought to sight the vessel in four or five days  will you sail for home at once  i think so andy i presume youll be glad to get back and mr dawson smiled faintly  yes and no replied the youth i wont know what to do after i return i dont want to live with uncle si  you ought to go on another hunt for those missing papers  ill do that of course  and even if you cant find them ill look into the matter and see if i cant learn what rights your father had in that timber tract ill not have much to do myself for a while ill not want to go on another exploring expedition in a hurry  so far aside from dr slades attack there had been but little sickness in the party but on the next day barwell dawson was taken down and all had to go into camp for three days until he felt better during that time andy and chet went out hunting and brought down another polar bear of which they were justly proud  its a great place to hunt said andy but i dont think i care to come up here again  nor i added chet then he heaved a long sigh i wish he stopped short  what chet were you thinking of your father and andys voice softened  yes i was i thought sure when i came up here that id get some trace of him  its too bad i wish i could help you answered andy and that was all he could say  with their broken sledges and their small dog teams the party moved slowly forward to where the ice king had been left along the coast they did not expect to find the vessel fast in the ice but hoped that captain williamson would be cruising near on the lookout for them  when we get to the coast if the vessel is not in sight well fire some signals said barwell dawson the captain will be sure to answer them  two days more passed and they came to something of an open bay dotted here and there with floating ice at the sight the boys set up a cheer  the sea the sea  it was indeed the seaor rather the upper entrance to smith sound the party had traveled too far to the eastward and had now to turn southward skirting the coast here the going was very rough and the very next morning one of the sledges went down in a crack of the ice and was smashed completely  thank goodness we do not need it any longer was barwell dawsons comment what stores the sledge had contained were hauled up from the crack and loaded on the remaining turnouts  another day passed and now all kept on the lookout for a sign of the ship but though they climbed to the top of a high hill skirting the coast no sign of a vessel was to be seen anywhere  again they resumed their journey and thus two days passed then andy who was in the lead with olalola set up a cry  i see the hut and the storehouse  he was right they had at last arrived at the spot where they had embarked from the ice king the place was deserted and they could easily see where the steamer had pushed through the floating ice and made her way to the broad lead beyond  well hoist our flag and fire a signal said barwell dawson and without delay a pole was nailed to the top of the storehouse and old glory was swung to the breeze then one of the shotguns was fired off three times in succession all waited long for some answer to the reports but none came  he must have gone off for some reason or other said barwell dawson all we can do is to wait for his return  perhaps the steamer was hit by an iceberg and sunk suggested professor jeffer  let us hope no such calamity has befallen us answered the explorer gravely  it sobered all of the party a good deal to find themselves alone at the spot where they had so confidently thought to find the ice king they knew that there was great danger of a squeeze in the floating ice and wondered what they should do if the craft had gone to the bottom of the polar sea they might possibly get down to a point opposite etah but it would be a hard journey and after it was made there was no telling if they could cross the water to that settlement  three days went by and the hearts of the party sank lower and lower a few went out hunting for the larder was again getting low but for the most part all remained in the vicinity of the shore awaiting eagerly some sign of the missing steamer  at last early one morning andy made out a cloud of smoke far off on the water he drew chets attention to it and then called olalola the three watched the cloud draw nearer and at last the esquimau began to smile  ship he said ship with firemeaning thereby a steam vessel  the word was soon passed that a ship was in sight and all gathered to watch the approach of the craft as it came closer they saw that it was the ice king and on the deck stood captain williamson and his crew waving them a welcome the captain had seen them with his spyglass  hurrah for the ice king cried chet and the cheer was given with a will  this ends our troubles here added andy now to get aboard and start for home     chapter xxx  home again   it was no easy matter for the ice king to push her way through the ice and reach the shore but at last this was accomplished and a gangplank was put out so that our friends could go aboard  did you reach the pole were captain williamsons words  we did answered barwell dawson but it was a hard journey i can tell you  good i mean im glad to know you got to the pole went on the captain he looked over the party look well too  we look better than we did a few weeks ago said andy then you might have taken us for a lot of starved cats  have you been on a trip questioned chet he saw that the commander of the ice king was looking at him rather curiously  yes i left here eight days ago after i had heard of a whaler that had gone to pieces in the ice some esquimaux brought the word and said that a crew of five white men and one negro were on the shore to the northwestward  and did you find them asked chet eagerly  i did lad and ive got news for you  about my father  aye chet  was it the betsey andrews that went down is my father among the men  yes it was the betsey andrews that was caught in the ice she drifted for months before she got a squeeze that finished her then the crew went ashore and did what they could to save themselves  but my fatheris healive  yesor he was the last that was heard of him  he isnt with the men you found  no they are on board and you can listen to their story later after the whaler went to pieces another vessel came alonga small ship bound for nova scotia the evans and she took six of the crew with her and among those was your father  the evans what port was she bound for  halifax  and was my father all right when the evans sailed  yes although he had suffered somewhat from exposure as had all of the crew  the fact that word had at last been obtained of his parent filled chets heart with joy he lost no time in introducing himself to the sailors who had been rescued by captain williamson and from them obtained a full account of the illfated trip of the betsey andrews  the ship had been all over the whaling grounds and had had almost a full supply of oil and whalebone when the commander against the wishes of the mate and many of the crew had decided to turn northward in quest of another whale or two the captain had acted queerly as if out of his mind and had run the ship into a situation among the icebergs from which it was impossible to escape  many months of anxiety had been passed on the whaler and the climax had come when the awful squeeze crushed her as if she had been an eggshell in that calamity the captain and two of the men had lost their lives  after the disaster the mate had taken charge and the men had transferred their supplies to the shore and gone to living there they had had more than enough oil to burn and during the winter had kept a beacon light going hoping it might bring some one to their assistance several had proved themselves good hunters so they did not suffer for something to eat although their diet was a limited one  at last the evans put in an appearance and lots were drawn as to who should go aboard tolney greene was one of the lucky ones and the evans had left promising to leave word regarding the others at upernivik and other ports  oh i am so thankful to know that father is alive said chet to andy  i am glad too chet answered his chum i hope you meet him as soon as we get back  so do i but its a long sail andy and chet heaved a sigh  one day was spent in getting the things aboard the ice king and then the bow of the steamer was turned southward and the long trip homeward was begun  it was a slow and tedious journey with many perils from icebergs and fogs and during that time captain williamson had more trouble with pep loggermore as a result the sailor was put in irons at upernivik he was allowed to go ashore and that was the last seen of him  if he has deserted i am glad of it said the captain and andy and chet said the same  at upernivik the esquimaux were paid off and barwell dawson rewarded olalola as he had promised the native shook hands warmly with the boys  nice boys he said olalola wish he had boys like you  take good care of yourself olalola said andy  and if you ever visit the states come and see us added chet  no come to states said the esquimau too big sun fry olalola like fat and this quaint remark made the lads laugh  at upernivik the ice king took on a fresh supply of coal and then without delay continued on her journey southward chet had had a long talk with barwell dawson and the explorer had promised to stop at halifax to learn what had become of the evans and mr greene  and i will do all in my power to see that your father gets a square deal added mr dawson of course if he is guilty i can do nothing for him but if he is innocent then well do what we can to bring the guilty parties to justice  i know he is innocent answered chet stubbornly  i trust that you prove to be right chet was all the explorer could say  as the steamer drew southward the weather became milder until it was a real pleasure to be on deck the boys discarded their furs which they hung up as relics of the great trip  looking back it seems like a dream doesnt it said andy  a good deal that way responded his chum  i suppose by this time the whole country is talking about what dr cook and commander peary have done  more than likely  at last they reached halifax and all in a quiver of excitement chet made inquiries regarding his father he learned that mr greene had had a chance to ship for portland maine and had done so eight days previously  ill meet him there cried chet  so you will answered andy for we are going to portland instead of rathley  the run to portland was made without special incident and as soon as the ice king had tied up chet went ashore with andy to hunt up the evans  he found that the craft lay at a dock three blocks away and soon covered the distance she had come in the day before and was busy unloading her cargo  so you are tolney greenes son eh said the captain to chet ive heard of you for your father spoke of you several times  and where is he  started for home yesterdayto find you he said and to catch a rascal named hopton who had gotten him into trouble  hopton ejaculated andy who was present do you mean a man named a q hopton  thats the fellow mr greene had it in for him good and proper he committed some kind of a crime and then fixed it on mr greene but greene had the evidence against himpicked it up somewheres just after signing to go on the betsey andrews  this was all the captain of the evans could say but it was enough and without delay chet arranged to go to pine run and andy said he would go along barwell dawson agreed to meet them later and insisted upon giving each youth a small roll of bankbills for expenses  it was midsummer and hota big contrast to the weather which the lads had so recently experienced as the train rolled toward their home they discussed mr greenes affairs and wondered how mr a q hopton had gotten him into trouble  but he is equal to it said andy i know that by the way he tried to treat me and how he tried to pull the wool over uncle sis eyes  where do you suppose your uncle si is now  hanging around most likely waiting for something to turn up replied andy  i hope youre not going to let him have any of that money mr dawson gave you  not a cent if he wants any money hell have to go to work and earn it  at last the two youths reached pine run and both walked to the general store that being the center for information as well as supplies the storekeeper looked at them in surprise  back again eh he cried  have you seen my father questioned chet  yes he was here this morning chet he was full of business  where did he go  up to your cabin he was very much put out that you had gone away  do you know anything of my uncle si asked andy  well rather the storekeeper laughed outright richest thing ever was he chuckled  what  the way the men around here treated him they got tired of his laziness and habit of borrowing money and told him he must go to work he wouldnt do it at first and they hauled him out of bed one night and said they were going to tar and feather him then he got scared to death and promised to go to work and hes been at work ever sinceover at larringtons sawmill he came in last saturday and paid his bill in full and bought some groceries for spot cash i reckon hes turned over a new leaf  ill be thankful if he has said andy  by the way continued the storekeeper he was talking of some property that is coming to you  property  yessome timber land in michigan i believe you had the papers and lost em well one day some hunters found the papers in the woodspretty well soaked but all thereand they brought em to your uncle si hes got em now and hes waiting to hear from you he told me a real estate fellow named hopton wanted em but he was going to hold on to em until he heard from you  good for uncle si cried andy he is coming to his senses at last i am glad the papers have been found i must see him at once     chapter xxxi  good newsconclusion   to get to his own place chet had to pass the cabin belonging to andy and so the chums left the village together in a carriage they hired with some of the money barwell dawson had given them  the thoughts of each youth were busy so but little was said by them during the journey as they came in sight of andys home they saw smoke curling from the chimney  uncle si must have gotten back from work said andy most likely hes cooking supper chet will you stop  well id rather see my father first was the answer  i dont blame you well come over tomorrow unlesshello there is a stranger  andy pointed to a man who had come to the cabin door he having heard the sound of the carriage wheels chet stared hard at the individual then he took a flying leap to the ground and ran forward  father  the man started and then flung out his hands  if it isnt chetmy own son chet he burst out joyfully i was just wishing with all my heart that i knew where you were and he shook hands over and over again  and ive been hurrying to you as fast as i could for weeks answered chet with a glad look in his eyes i heard you were at our cabin and was going there  i was there and came here to ask mr graham about you answered tolney greene  josiah graham had come to the door holding in his hand a frying pan containing bacon he gave one look at the newcomers  andy he burst out and in his amazement let the frying pan clatter to the doorstep scattering the strips of bacon in all directions is it really you or your ghost  no ghost about me uncle si answered the boy they tell me you have gone to work  why eryeas i have a job at the sawmill  i am glad to know it  ieri got over my sickness an so im agoin to work stiddy after this went on josiah graham lamely  thats the best news ive heard in a year  where have you been andy  oh on a little trip to the north pole and elsewhere was the cool reply  youre joking me but have your funit aint none o my affair but i want to tell yer somethin went on the old man impressively i got them papers back  so i heard i hope youll not give them to that a q hopton  not much hopton is a swindleri found thet out in portland when i was there  what about hopton demanded mr greene who had been in earnest conversation with chet do you mean the real estate dealer  i do answered josiah graham  where is he now he is the man who caused me all my trouble just let me get at him he covered up his tracks pretty well but ive now got the evidence against him  i dont know where hopton is now but i guess i kin find out answered josiah graham  all entered the cabin and there each told his story in detail the men listened to the boys in openmouthed wonder  and to think you came north and was so close to me said mr greene to his son  he said he had been half crazy when he signed articles for the trip on the betsey andrews then he had gotten word about a q hopton and had discovered that the real estate man was guilty of the crimes of which he himself was accused he had gone to the captain of the whaler to get his release but the captain had refused to let him go and had locked him up aboard the ship until the voyage was well begun  he was a strange man that captain said mr greene and it is no wonder that he lost his ship and his life in the frozen north  and you have the evidence to prove your innocence and prove this a q hopton guilty asked chet  yes my son i can prove that hopton was guilty and nobody else  oh how glad i am of it murmured chet  a substantial supper was prepared for allandy assisting his uncle in getting it ready  uncle si isnt a bit like his old self whispered andy to chet when they sat down going to work has waked him up and made another man of him  hope he sticks to it answered chet  that evening after all the stories had been told in detail josiah graham brought out the papers andy had lost in the woods as the storekeeper had said they had been well soaked by the snow and rain but they were still decipherable  i am going to tell mr dawson about them and then turn them over to some firstclass lawyer said andy if they are really worth anything i want to know it  on the following day the two boys and mr greene returned to portland chets father conferred with the police and as a consequence mr a q hopton was located some days later in augusta and placed in custody he was subjected to a close examination and finally broke down and confessed his guilt he said that tolney greene had had nothing to do with the crimes and chets father was completely exonerated he also told about the timber land in michigan and through a firm of good lawyers andys claim to a substantial interest was establishedan interest said to be worth fifteen thousand dollars  with all that money you wont have to work no more said josiah graham to the boy  but i am going to work just the same answered andy and you are going to work with me uncle si some day well have a big lumber camp of our own  and what is thet greene boy goin to do  he is going into partnership with mewhen we are old enough answered andy  do you think its wuth it to work so hard when youve got so much money asked uncle si wistfully  certainly i do its the best thing for meand for you too i shouldnt want to be idle even if i was a millionaire  well jest as you say andy the old man heaved a long sigh i suppose you are rightanyway its your money and then he went to work again and said no more on the subject  as soon as his name was cleared tolney greene looked around for work through andys influence he obtained the position of superintendent at the lumber tract in michigan and chet went to work with him  and what are you going to do asked chet of andy one day  i am going to rest for a month or so was the answer then mr dawson who has been appointed my guardian is going to send me to a firstclass boarding school  and after that andy  i am going into the lumber businessand you are going with me chet  me  yes  but i havent any money  never mind when i go in for myself you are going to have an interest replied andy and his tone showed that he meant what he said  the report that the barwell dawson expedition had reached the north pole created a great stir many would not believe it and the explorer and professor jeffer were called upon to submit proofs this they did willingly then barwell dawson was asked to lecture but declined but professor jeffer took to the platform and made a great deal of money thereby and from the book he issued later  it was a grand tripa truly marvelous trip the professor was wont to say butbut i do not think i desire to go again  you are right answered barwell dawson once is sufficient after this i shall devote my time to hunting and exploring in localities not quite so cold  and where there is plenty of food put in andy  yes dont forget the food said chet as long as i live i never want to get so close to starving again  and all the others agreed with him  the end
