58329395	john ingerfield and other stories   contents  to the gentle reader  in remembrance of john ingerfield and of anne his wife  the woman of the saeter  variety patter  silhouettes  the lease of the cross keys     to the gentle reader also to the gentle critic   once upon a time i wrote a little story of a woman who was crushed to death by a python  a day or two after its publication a friend stopped me in the street  charming little story of yours he said that about the woman and the snake but its not as funny as some of your things the next week a newspaper referring to the tale remarked we have heard the incident related before with infinitely greater humour  with thisand many similar experiencesin mind i wish distinctly to state that john ingerfield the woman of the saeter and silhouettes are not intended to be amusing  the two other itemsvariety patter and the lease of the cross keysi give over to the critics of the new humour to rend as they will but john ingerfield the woman of the saeter and silhouettes i repeat i should be glad if they would judge from some other standpoint than that of humour new or old     in remembrance of john ingerfield and of anne his wife a story of old london in two chapters   chapter i   if you take the underground railway to whitechapel road the east station and from there take one of the yellow tramcars that start from that point and go down the commercial road past the george in front of which startsor used to standa high flagstaff at the base of which sitsor used to sitan elderly female purveyor of pigs trotters at threehapence apiece until you come to where a railway arch crosses the road obliquely and there get down and turn to the right up a narrow noisy street leading to the river and then to the right again up a still narrower street which you may know by its having a publichouse at one corner as is in the nature of things and a marine storedealers at the other outside which strangely stiff and unaccommodating garments of gigantic size flutter ghostlike in the wind you will come to a dingy railedin churchyard surrounded on all sides by cheerless manypeopled houses  sadlooking little old houses they are in spite of the tumult of life about their ever open doors  they and the ancient church in their midst seem weary of the ceaseless jangle around them  perhaps standing there for so many years listening to the long silence of the dead the fretful voices of the living sound foolish in their ears  peering through the railings on the side nearest the river you will see beneath the shadow of the sootgrimed churchs sootgrimed porchthat is if the sun happen by rare chance to be strong enough to cast any shadow at all in that region of grey lighta curiously high and narrow headstone that once was white and straight not tottering and bent with age as it is now  there is upon this stone a carving in basrelief as you will see for yourself if you will make your way to it through the gateway on the opposite side of the square  it represents so far as can be made out for it is much worn by time and dirt a figure lying on the ground with another figure bending over it while at a little distance stands a third object  but this last is so indistinct that it might be almost anything from an angel to a post  and below the carving are the words already half obliterated that i have used for the title of this story  should you ever wander of a sunday morning within sound of the cracked bell that calls a few habitbound oldfashioned folk to worship within those dampstained walls and drop into talk with the old men who on such days sometimes sit each in his brassbuttoned long brown coat upon the low stone coping underneath those broken railings you might hear this tale from them as i did more years ago than i care to recollect  but lest you do not choose to go to all this trouble or lest the old men who could tell it you have grown tired of all talk and are not to be roused ever again into the telling of tales and you yet wish for the story i will here set it down for you  but i cannot recount it to you as they told it to me for to me it was only a tale that i heard and remembered thinking to tell it again for profit while to them it was a thing that had been and the threads of it were interwoven with the woof of their own life  as they talked faces that i did not see passed by among the crowd and turned and looked at them and voices that i did not hear spoke to them below the clamour of the street so that through their thin piping voices there quivered the deep music of life and death and my tale must be to theirs but as a gossips chatter to the story of him whose breast has felt the press of battle        john ingerfield oil and tallow refiner of lavender wharf limehouse comes of a hardheaded hardfisted stock  the first of the race that the eye of record piercing the deepening mists upon the centuries behind her is able to discern with any clearness is a longhaired seabronzed personage whom men call variously inge or unger  out of the wild north sea he has come  record observes him one of a small fierce group standing on the sands of desolate northumbria staring landward his worldly wealth upon his back  this consists of a twohanded battleaxe value perhaps some forty stycas in the currency of the time  a careful man with business capabilities may however manipulate a small capital to great advantage  in what would appear to those accustomed to our slow modern methods an incredibly short space of time inges twohanded battleaxe has developed into wide lands and many head of cattle which latter continue to multiply with a rapidity beyond the dreams of present day breeders  inges descendants would seem to have inherited the genius of their ancestor for they prosper and their worldly goods increase they are a moneymaking race  in all times out of all things by all means they make money  they fight for money marry for money live for money are ready to die for money  in the days when the most saleable and the highest priced article in the markets of europe was a strong arm and a cool head then each ingerfield as inge long rooted in yorkshire soil had grown or been corrupted to was a soldier of fortune and offered his strong arm and his cool head to the highest bidder  they fought for their price and they took good care that they obtained their price but the price settled they fought well for they were staunch men and true according to their lights though these lights may have been placed somewhat low down near the earth  then followed the days when the chief riches of the world lay tossed for daring hands to grasp upon the bosom of the sea and the sleeping spirit of the old norse rover stirred in their veins and the lilt of a wild sea song they had never heard kept ringing in their ears and they built them ships and sailed for the spanish main and won much wealth as was their wont  later on when civilisation began to lay down and enforce sterner rules for the game of life and peaceful methods promised to prove more profitable than violent the ingerfields became traders and merchants of grave mien and sober life for their ambition from generation to generation remains ever the same their various callings being but means to an end  a hard stern race of men they would seem to have been but justso far as they understood justice  they have the reputation of having been good husbands fathers and masters but one cannot help thinking of them as more respected than loved  they were men to exact the uttermost farthing due to them yet not without a sense of the thing due from them their own duty and responsibilitynay not altogether without their moments of heroism which is the duty of great men  history relates how a certain captain ingerfield returning with much treasure from the west indieshow acquired it were perhaps best not to inquire too closelyis overhauled upon the high seas by kings frigate  captain of kings frigate sends polite message to captain ingerfield requesting him to be so kind as to promptly hand over a certain member of his ships company who by some means or another has made himself objectionable to kings friends in order that he the said objectionable person may be forthwith hanged from the yardarm  captain ingerfield returns polite answer to captain of kings frigate that he captain ingerfield will with much pleasure hang any member of his ships company that needs hanging but that neither the king of england nor any one else on god almightys sea is going to do it for him captain of kings frigate sends back word that if objectionable person be not at once given up he shall be compelled with much regret to send ingerfield and his ship to the bottom of the atlantic  replies captain ingerfield that is just what he will have to do before i give up one of my people and fights the big frigatefights it so fiercely that after three hours captain of kings frigate thinks it will be good to try argument again and sends therefore a further message courteously acknowledging captain ingerfields courage and skill and suggesting that he having done sufficient to vindicate his honour and renown it would be politic to now hand over the unimportant cause of contention and so escape with his treasure  tell your captain shouts back this ingerfield who has discovered there are sweeter things to fight for than even money that the wild goose has flown the seas with her belly full of treasure before now and will if it be gods pleasure so do again but that master and man in her sail together fight together and die together  whereupon kings frigate pounds away more vigorously than ever and succeeds eventually in carrying out her threat  down goes the wild goose her last chase endeddown she goes with a plunge spit foremost with her colours flying and down with her goes every man left standing on her decks and at the bottom of the atlantic they lie to this day master and man side by side keeping guard upon their treasure  which incident and it is well authenticated goes far to prove that the ingerfields hard men and grasping men though they bemen caring more for the getting of money than for the getting of loveloving more the cold grip of gold than the grip of kith or kin yet bear buried in their hearts the seeds of a nobler manhood for which however the barren soil of their ambition affords scant nourishment  the john ingerfield of this story is a man very typical of his race  he has discovered that the oil and tallow refining business though not a pleasant one is an exceedingly lucrative one  these are the good days when george the third is king and london is rapidly becoming a city of bright night  tallow and oil and all materials akin thereto are in ever growing request and young john ingerfield builds himself a large refining house and warehouse in the growing suburb of limehouse which lies between the teeming river and the quiet fields gathers many people round about him puts his strong heart into his work and prospers  all the days of his youth he labours and garners and lays out and garners yet again  in early middle age he finds himself a wealthy man the chief business of life the getting of money is practically done his enterprise is firmly established and will continue to grow with ever less need of husbandry  it is time for him to think about the secondary business of life the getting together of a wife and home for the ingerfields have ever been good citizens worthy heads of families openhanded hosts making a brave show among friends and neighbours  john ingerfield sitting in his stiff highbacked chair in his stiffly but solidly furnished diningroom above his countinghouse sipping slowly his one glass of port takes counsel with himself  what shall she be  he is rich and can afford a good article  she must be young and handsome fit to grace the fine house he will take for her in fashionable bloomsbury far from the odour and touch of oil and tallow  she must be well bred with a gracious noble manner that will charm his guests and reflect honour and credit upon himself she must above all be of good family with a genealogical tree sufficiently umbrageous to hide lavender wharf from the eyes of society  what else she may or may not be he does not very much care  she will of course be virtuous and moderately pious as it is fit and proper that women should be  it will also be well that her disposition be gentle and yielding but that is of minor importance at all events so far as he is concerned the ingerfield husbands are not the class of men upon whom wives vent their tempers  having decided in his mind what she shall be he proceeds to discuss with himself who she shall be  his social circle is small methodically in thought he makes the entire round of it mentally scrutinising every maiden that he knows  some are charming some are fair some are rich but no one of them approaches near to his carefully considered ideal  he keeps the subject in his mind and muses on it in the intervals of business  at odd moments he jots down names as they occur to him upon a slip of paper which he pins for the purpose on the inside of the cover of his desk  he arranges them alphabetically and when it is as complete as his memory can make it he goes critically down the list making a few notes against each  as a result it becomes clear to him that he must seek among strangers for his wife  he has a friend or rather an acquaintance an old schoolfellow who has developed into one of those curious social flies that in all ages are to be met with buzzing contentedly within the most exclusive circles and concerning whom seeing that they are neither rare nor rich nor extraordinarily clever nor well born one wonders how the devil they got there  meeting this man by chance one afternoon he links his arm in his and invites him home to dinner  so soon as they are left alone with the walnuts and wine between them john ingerfield says thoughtfully cracking a hard nut between his fingers  will im going to get married  excellent ideadelighted to hear it im sure replies will somewhat less interested in the information than in the delicately flavoured madeira he is lovingly sipping  whos the lady  i dont know yet is john ingerfields answer  his friend glances slyly at him over his glass not sure whether he is expected to be amused or sympathetically helpful  i want you to find one for me  will cathcart puts down his glass and stares at his host across the table  should be delighted to help you jack he stammers in an alarmed tonepon my soul i should but really dont know a damned woman i could recommendpon my soul i dont  you must see a good many i wish youd look out for one that you could recommend  certainly i will my dear jack answers the other in a relieved voice never thought about em in that way before  daresay i shall come across the very girl to suit you  ill keep my eyes open and let you know  i shall be obliged to you if you will replies john ingerfield quietly and its your turn i think to oblige me will  i have obliged you if you recollect  shall never forget it my dear jack murmurs will a little uneasily it was uncommonly good of you  you saved me from ruin jack shall think about it to my dying daypon my soul i shall  no need to let it worry you for so long a period as that returns john with the faintest suspicion of a smile playing round his firm mouth  the bill falls due at the end of next month  you can discharge the debt then and the matter will be off your mind  will finds his chair growing uncomfortable under him while the madeira somehow loses its flavour  he gives a short nervous laugh  by jove he says so soon as that  the date had quite slipped my memory  fortunate that i reminded you says john the smile round his lips deepening  will fidgets on his seat  im afraid my dear jack he says i shall have to get you to renew it just for a month or twodeuced awkward thing but im remarkably short of money this year  truth is i cant get whats owing to myself  thats very awkward certainly replies his friend because i am not at all sure that i shall be able to renew it  will stares at him in some alarm  but what am i to do if i havnt the money  john ingerfield shrugs his shoulders  you dont mean my dear jack that you would put me in prison  why not  other people have to go there who cant pay their debts  will cathcarts alarm grows to serious proportions  but our friendship he cries our  my dear will interrupts the other there are few friends i would lend three hundred pounds to and make no effort to get it back  you certainly are not one of them  let us make a bargain he continues  find me a wife and on the day of my marriage i will send you back that bill with perhaps a couple of hundred added  if by the end of next month you have not introduced me to a lady fit to be and willing to be mrs john ingerfield i shall decline to renew it  john ingerfield refills his own glass and hospitably pushes the bottle towards his guestwho however contrary to his custom takes no notice of it but stares hard at his shoebuckles  are you serious he says at length  quite serious is the answer  i want to marry  my wife must be a lady by birth and education  she must be of good familyof family sufficiently good indeed to compensate for the refinery  she must be young and beautiful and charming  i am purely a business man  i want a woman capable of conducting the social department of my life  i know of no such lady myself  i appeal to you because you i know are intimate with the class among whom she must be sought  there may be some difficulty in persuading a lady of the required qualifications to accept the situation says cathcart with a touch of malice  i want you to find one who will says john ingerfield  early in the evening will cathcart takes leave of his host and departs thoughtful and anxious and john ingerfield strolls contemplatively up and down his wharf for the smell of oil and tallow has grown to be very sweet to him and it is pleasant to watch the moonbeams shining on the piledup casks  six weeks go by  on the first day of the seventh john takes will cathcarts acceptance from its place in the large safe and lays it in the smaller box beside his desk devoted to more pressing and immediate business  two days later cathcart picks his way across the slimy yard passes through the countinghouse and enters his friends inner sanctum closing the door behind him  he wears a jubilant air and slaps the grave john on the back  ive got her jack he cries  its been hard work i can tell you sounding suspicious old dowagers bribing confidential servants fishing for information among friends of the family  by jove i shall be able to join the dukes staff as spyinchief to his majestys entire forces after this  what is she like asks john without stopping his writing  like  my dear jack youll fall over head and ears in love with her the moment you see her  a little cold perhaps but that will just suit you  good family asks john signing and folding the letter he has finished  so good that i was afraid at first it would be useless thinking of her but shes a sensible girl no confounded nonsense about her and the family are poor as church mice  in factwell to tell the truth we have become most excellent friends and she told me herself frankly that she meant to marry a rich man and didnt much care whom  that sounds hopeful remarks the wouldbe bridegroom with his peculiar dry smile when shall i have the pleasure of seeing her  i want you to come with me tonight to the garden replies the other she will be in lady heatheringtons box and i will introduce you  so that evening john ingerfield goes to covent garden theatre with the blood running a trifle quicker in his veins but not much than would be the case were he going to the docks to purchase tallowexamines covertly the proposed article from the opposite side of the house and approves heris introduced to her and on closer inspection approves her still morereceives an invitation to visitvisits frequently and each time is more satisfied of the rarity serviceableness and quality of the article  if all john ingerfield requires for a wife is a beautiful social machine surely here he has found his ideal  anne singleton only daughter of that persistently unfortunate but most charming of baronets sir harry singleton more charming it is rumoured outside his family circle than within it is a stately graceful highbred woman  her portrait by reynolds still to be seen above the carved wainscoting of one of the old city halls shows a wonderfully handsome and clever face but at the same time a wonderfully cold and heartless one  it is the face of a woman half weary of half sneering at the world  one reads in old family letters whereof the ink is now very faded and the paper very yellow long criticisms of this portrait  the writers complain that if the picture is at all like her she must have greatly changed since her girlhood for they remember her then as having a laughing and winsome expression  they saythey who knew her in afterlifethat this earlier face came back to her in the end so that the many who remembered opening their eyes and seeing her bending down over them could never recognise the portrait of the beautiful sneering lady even when they were told whom it represented  but at the time of john ingerfields strange wooing she was the anne singleton of sir joshuas portrait and john ingerfield liked her the better that she was  he had no feeling of sentiment in the matter himself and it simplified the case that she had none either  he offered her a plain bargain and she accepted it  for all he knew or cared her attitude towards this subject of marriage was the usual one assumed by women  very young girls had their heads full of romantic ideas  it was better for her and for him that she had got rid of them  ours will be a union founded on good sense said john ingerfield  let us hope the experiment will succeed said anne singleton    chapter ii   but the experiment does not succeed  the laws of god decree that man shall purchase woman that woman shall give herself to man for other coin than that of good sense  good sense is not a legal tender in the marriage mart  men and women who enter therein with only sense in their purse have no right to complain if on reaching home they find they have concluded an unsatisfactory bargain  john ingerfield when he asked anne singleton to be his wife felt no more love for her than he felt for any of the other sumptuous household appointments he was purchasing about the same time and made no pretence of doing so  nor had he done so would she have believed him for anne singleton has learned much in her twentytwo summers and winters and knows that love is only a meteor in lifes sky and that the true lodestar of this world is gold  anne singleton has had her romance and buried it deep down in her deep nature and over its grave to keep its ghost from rising has piled the stones of indifference and contempt as many a woman has done before and since  once upon a time anne singleton sat dreaming out a story  it was a story old as the hillsolder than some of thembut to her then it was quite new and very wonderful  it contained all the usual stock material common to such stories the lad and the lass the plighted troth the richer suitors the angry parents the love that was worth braving all the world for  one day into this dream there fell from the land of the waking a letter a poor pitiful letter you know i love you and only you it ran my heart will always be yours till i die  but my father threatens to stop my allowance and as you know i have nothing of my own except debts  some would call her handsome but how can i think of her beside you  oh why was money ever let to come into the world to curse us with many other puzzling questions of a like character and much severe condemnation of fate and heaven and other parties generally and much selfcommiseration  anne singleton took long to read the letter  when she had finished it and had read it through again she rose and crushing it her hand flung it in the fire with a laugh and as the flame burnt up and died away felt that her life had died with it not knowing that bruised hearts can heal  so when john ingerfield comes wooing and speaks to her no word of love but only of money she feels that here at last is a genuine voice that she can trust  love of the lesser side of life is still left to her  it will be pleasant to be the wealthy mistress of a fine house to give great receptions to exchange the secret poverty of home for display and luxury  these things are offered to her on the very terms she would have suggested herself  accompanied by love she would have refused them knowing she could give none in return  but a woman finds it one thing not to desire affection and another thing not to possess it  day by day the atmosphere of the fine house in bloomsbury grows cold and colder about her heart  guests warm it at times for a few hours then depart leaving it chillier than before  for her husband she attempts to feel indifference but living creatures joined together cannot feel indifference for each other  even two dogs in a leash are compelled to think of one another  a man and wife must love or hate like or dislike in degree as the bond connecting them is drawn tight or allowed to hang slack  by mutual desire their chains of wedlock have been fastened as loosely as respect for security will permit with the happy consequence that her aversion to him does not obtrude itself beyond the limits of politeness  her part of the contract she faithfully fulfils for the singletons also have their code of honour  her beauty her tact her charm her influence are devoted to his serviceto the advancement of his position the furtherance of his ambition  doors that would otherwise remain closed she opens to him  society that would otherwise pass by with a sneer sits round his table  his wishes and pleasures are hers in all things she yields him wifely duty seeks to render herself agreeable to him suffers in silence his occasional caresses  whatever was implied in the bargain that she will perform to the letter  he on his side likewise performs his part with businesslike conscientiousnessnay seeing that the pleasing of her brings no personal gratification to himselfnot without generosity   he is ever thoughtful of and deferential to her awarding her at all times an unvarying courteousness that is none the less sincere for being studied her every expressed want is gratified her every known distaste respected  conscious of his presence being an oppression to her he is even careful not to intrude it upon her oftener than is necessary  at times he asks himself somewhat pertinently what he has gained by marriagewonders whether this social race was quite the most interesting game he could have elected to occupy his leisurewonders whether after all he would not have been happier over his countinghouse than in these sumptuous glittering rooms where he always seems and feels himself to be the uninvited guest  the only feeling that a closer intimacy has created in him for his wife is that of indulgent contempt  as there is no equality between man and woman so there can be no respect  she is a different being  he must either look up to her as superior to himself or down upon her as inferior  when a man does the former he is more or less in love and love to john ingerfield is an unknown emotion  her beauty her charm her social tacteven while he makes use of them for his own purposes he despises as the weapons of a weak nature  so in their big cold mansion john ingerfield and anne his wife sit far apart strangers to one another neither desiring to know the other nearer  about his business he never speaks to her and she never questions him to compensate for the slight shrinkage of time he is able to devote to it he becomes more strict and exacting grows a harsher master to his people a sterner creditor a greedier dealer squeezing the uttermost out of every one feverish to grow richer so that he may spend more upon the game that day by day he finds more tiresome and uninteresting  and the piledup casks upon his wharves increase and multiply and on the dirty river his ships and barges lie in everlengthening lines and round his greasy cauldrons sweating witchlike creatures swarm in everdenser numbers stirring oil and tallow into gold  until one summer from its nest in the far east there flutters westward a foul thing  hovering over limehouse suburb seeing it crowded and unclean liking its fetid smell it settles down upon it  typhus is the creatures name  at first it lurks there unnoticed battening upon the rich rank food it finds around it until grown too big to hide longer it boldly shows its hideous head and the white face of terror runs swiftly through alley and street crying as it runs forces itself into john ingerfields countinghouse and tells its tale john ingerfield sits for a while thinking  then he mounts his horse and rides home at as hard a pace as the condition of the streets will allow in the hall he meets anne going out and stops her  dont come too near me he says quietly  typhus fever has broken out at limehouse and they say one can communicate it even without having it oneself  you had better leave london for a few weeks  go down to your fathers i will come and fetch you when it is all over  he passes her giving her a wide berth and goes upstairs where he remains for some minutes in conversation with his valet  then coming down he remounts and rides off again  after a little while anne goes up into his room  his man is kneeling in the middle of the floor packing a valise  where are you to take it she asks  down to the wharf maam answers the man mr ingerfield is going to be there for a day or two  then anne sits in the great empty drawingroom and takes her turn at thinking  john ingerfield finds on his return to limehouse that the evil has greatly increased during the short time he has been away  fanned by fear and ignorance fed by poverty and dirt the scourge is spreading through the district like a fire  long smouldering in secret it has now burst forth at fifty different points at once  not a street not a court but has its case  over a dozen of johns hands are down with it already two more have sunk prostrate beside their work within the last hour  the panic grows grotesque  men and women tear their clothes off looking to see if they have anywhere upon them a rash or a patch of mottled skin find that they have or imagine that they have and rush screaming half undressed into the street  two men meeting in a narrow passage both rush back too frightened to pass each other  a boy stoops down and scratches his legnot an action that under ordinary circumstances would excite much surprise in that neighbourhood  in an instant there is a wild stampede from the room the strong trampling on the weak in their eagerness to escape  these are not the days of organised defence against disease  there are kind hearts and willing hands in london town but they are not yet closely enough banded together to meet a swift foe such as this  there are hospitals and charities galore but these are mostly in the city maintained by the city fathers for the exclusive benefit of poor citizens and members of the guilds  the few free hospitals are already overcrowded and illprepared  squalid outlying limehouse belonging to nowhere cared for by nobody must fight for itself  john ingerfield calls the older men together and with their help attempts to instil some sense and reason into his terrified people standing on the step of his countinghouse and addressing as many of them as are not too scared to listen he tells them of the danger of fear and of the necessity for calmness and courage  we must face and fight this thing like men he cries in that deep din conquering voice that has served the ingerfields in good stead on many a steelswept field on many a stormstruck sea there must be no cowardly selfishness no fainthearted despair  if weve got to die well die but please god well live  anyhow we will stick together and help each other  i mean to stop here with you and do what i can for you  none of my people shall want  john ingerfield ceases and as the vibrations of his strong tones roll away a sweet voice from beside him rises clear and firm  i have come down to be with you also and to help my husband  i shall take charge of the nursing and tending of your sick and i hope i shall be of some real use to you  my husband and i are so sorry for you in your trouble  i know you will be brave and patient  we will all do our best and be hopeful  he turns half expecting to see only the empty air and to wonder at the delirium in his brain  she puts her hand in his and their eyes meet and in that moment for the first time in their lives these two see one another  they speak no word  there is no opportunity for words  there is work to be done and done quickly and anne grasps it with the greed of a woman long hungry for the joy of doing  as john watches her moving swiftly and quietly through the bewildered throng questioning comforting gently compelling the thought comes to him ought he to allow her to be here risking her life for his people followed by the thought how is he going to prevent it  for in this hour the knowledge is born within him that anne is not his property that he and she are fellow hands taking their orders from the same master that though it be well for them to work together and help each other they must not hinder one another  as yet john does not understand all this  the idea is new and strange to him  he feels as the child in a fairy story on suddenly discovering that the trees and flowers has he passed by carelessly a thousand times can think and talk  once he whispers to her of the labour and the danger but she answers simply they are my people too john it is my work and he lets her have her way  anne has a true womans instinct for nursing and her strong sense stands her in stead of experience  a glance into one or two of the squalid dens where these people live tells her that if her patients are to be saved they must be nursed away from their own homes and she determines to convert the large countinghousea long lofty room at the opposite end of the wharf to the refineryinto a temporary hospital  selecting some seven or eight of the most reliable women to assist her she proceeds to prepare it for its purpose  ledgers might be volumes of poetry bills of lading mere street ballads for all the respect that is shown to them the older clerks stand staring aghast feeling that the end of all things is surely at hand and that the universe is rushing down into space until their idleness being detected they are themselves promptly impressed for the sacrilegious work and made to assist in the demolition of their own temple  annes commands are spoken very sweetly and are accompanied by the sweetest of smiles but they are nevertheless commands and somehow it does not occur to any one to disobey them  johnstern masterful authoritative john who has never been approached with anything more dictatorial than a timid request since he left merchant taylors school nineteen years ago who would have thought that something had suddenly gone wrong with the laws of nature if he had beenfinds himself hurrying along the street on his way to a druggists shop slackens his pace an instant to ask himself why and wherefore he is doing so recollects that he was told to do so and to make haste back marvels who could have dared to tell him to do anything and to make haste back remembers that it was anne is not quite sure what to think about it but hurries on  he makes haste back is praised for having been so quick and feels pleased with himself is sent off again in another direction with instructions what to say when he gets there  he starts off he is becoming used to being ordered about now  halfway there great alarm seizes him for on attempting to say over the message to himself to be sure that he has it quite right he discovers he has forgotten it  he pauses nervous and excited cogitates as to whether it will be safe for him to concoct a message of his own weighs anxiously the chancessupposing that he does soof being found out  suddenly to his intense surprise and relief every word of what he was told to say comes back to him and he hastens on repeating it over and over to himself as he walks lest it should escape him again  and then a few hundred yards farther on there occurs one of the most extraordinary events that has ever happened in that street before or since john ingerfield laughs  john ingerfield of lavender wharf after walking twothirds of creek lane muttering to himself with his eyes on the ground stops in the middle of the road and laughs and one small boy who tells the story to his dying day sees him and hears him and runs home at the top of his speed with the wonderful news and is conscientiously slapped by his mother for telling lies  all that day anne works like a heroine john helping her and occasionally getting in the way  by night she has her little hospital prepared and three beds already up and occupied and all now done that can be done she and john go upstairs to his old rooms above the counting house  john ushers her into them with some misgiving for by contrast with the house at bloomsbury they are poor and shabby  he places her in the arm chair near the fire begging her to rest quiet and then assists his old housekeeper whose wits never of the strongest have been scared by the days proceeding to lay the meal  annes eyes follow him as he moves about the room  perhaps here where all the real part of his life has been passed he is more his true self than amid the unfamiliar surroundings of fashion perhaps this simpler frame shows him to greater advantage but anne wonders how it is she has never noticed before that he is a wellset handsome man  nor indeed is he so very oldlooking  is it a trick of the dim light or what  he looks almost young  but why should he not look young seeing he is only thirtysix and at thirtysix a man is in his prime  anne wonders why she has always thought of him as an elderly person  a portrait of one of johns ancestors hangs over the great mantelpieceof that sturdy captain ingerfield who fought the kings frigate rather than give up one of his people  anne glances from the dead face to the living and notes the strong likeness between them  through her halfclosed eyes she sees the grim old captain hurling back his message of defiance and his face is the face she saw a few hours ago saying i mean to stop here with you and do what i can for you  none of my people shall want  john is placing a chair for her at the table and the light from the candles falls upon him  she steals another glance at his facea strong stern handsome face capable of becoming a noble face  anne wonders if it has ever looked down tenderly at anyone feels a sudden fierce pain at the thought dismisses the thought as impossible wonders nevertheless how tenderness would suit it thinks she would like to see a look of tenderness upon it simply out of curiosity wonders if she ever will  she rouses herself from her reverie as john with a smile tells her supper is ready and they seat themselves opposite each other an odd air of embarrassment pervading  day by day their work grows harder day by day the foe grows stronger fiercer more allconquering and day by day fighting side by side against it john ingerfield and anne his wife draw closer to each other  on the battlefield of life we learn the worth of strength  anne feels it good when growing weary to glance up and find him near her feels it good amid the troubled babel round her to hear the deep strong music of his voice  and john watching annes fair figure moving to and fro among the stricken and the mourning watching her fair fluttering hands busy with their holy work her deep soulhaunting eyes changeful with the light and shade of tenderness listening to her sweet clear voice laughing with the joyous comforting the comfortless gently commanding softly pleading finds creeping into his brain strange new thoughts concerning womenconcerning this one woman in particular  one day rummaging over an old chest he comes across a coloured picture book of bible stories  he turns the torn pages fondly remembering the sunday afternoons of long ago  at one picture wherein are represented many angels he pauses for in one of the younger angels of the groupone not quite so severe of feature as her sistershe fancies he can trace resemblance to anne  he lingers long over it  suddenly there rushes through his brain the thought how good to stoop and kiss the sweet feet of such a woman and thinking it he blushes like a boy  so from the soil of human suffering spring the flowers of human love and joy and from the flowers there fall the seeds of infinite pity for human pain god shaping all things to his ends  thinking of anne johns face grows gentler his hand kinder dreaming of him her heart grows stronger deeper fuller  every available room in the warehouse has been turned into a ward and the little hospital is open free to all for john and anne feel that the whole world are their people  the piledup casks are goneshipped to woolwich and gravesend bundled anywhere out of the way as though oil and tallow and the gold they can be stirred into were matters of small moment in this world not to be thought of beside such a thing as the helping of a human brother in sore strait  all the labour of the day seems light to them looking forward to the hour when they sit together in johns old shabby diningroom above the countinghouse  yet a lookeron might imagine such times dull to them for they are strangely shy of one another strangely sparing of wordsfearful of opening the floodgates of speech feeling the pressure of the pentup thought  one evening john throwing out words not as a sop to the necessity for talk but as a bait to catch annes voice mentions girdlecakes remembers that his old housekeeper used to be famous for the making of them and wonders if she has forgotten the art  anne answering tremulously as though girdlecakes were a somewhat delicate topic claims to be a successful amateur of them herself  john having been given always to understand that the talent for them was exceedingly rare and one usually hereditary respectfully doubts annes capabilities deferentially suggesting that she is thinking of scones anne indignantly repudiates the insinuation knows quite well the difference between girdlecakes and scones offers to prove her powers by descending into the kitchen and making some then and there if john will accompany her and find the things for her  john accepts the challenge and guiding anne with one shy awkward hand while holding aloft a candle in the other leads the way  it is past ten oclock and the old housekeeper is in bed  at each creaking stair they pause to listen if the noise has awakened her then finding all silent creep forward again with suppressed laughter wondering with alarm half feigned half real what the prim methodical dame would say were she to come down and catch them  they reach the kitchen thanks more to the suggestions of a friendly cat than to johns acquaintanceship with the geography of his own house and anne rakes together the fire and clears the table for her work  what possible use john is to herwhat need there was for her stipulating that he should accompany her anne might find it difficult if examined to explain satisfactorily  as for his finding the things for her he has not the faintest notion where they are and possesses no natural aptitude for discovery  told to find flour he industriously searches for it in the dresser drawers sent for the rollingpinthe nature and characteristics of rollingpins being described to him for his guidancehe returns after a prolonged absence with the copper stick anne laughs at him but really it would seem as though she herself were almost as stupid for not until her hands are covered with flour does it occur to her that she has not taken that preliminary step in all cooking operations of rolling up her sleeves  she holds out her arms to john first one and then the other asking him sweetly if he minds doing it for her  john is very slow and clumsy but anne stands very patient  inch by inch he peels the black sleeve from the white round arm  hundreds of times must he have seen those fair arms bare to the shoulder sparkling with jewels but never before has he seen their wondrous beauty  he longs to clasp them round his neck yet is fearful lest his trembling fingers touching them as he performs his tantalising task may offend her  anne thanks him and apologises for having given him so much trouble and he murmurs some meaningless reply and stands foolishly silent watching her  anne seems to find one hand sufficient for her cakemaking for the other rests idly on the tablevery near to one of johns as she would see were not her eyes so intent upon her work  how the impulse came to him where hegrave sober businessman johnlearnt such storybook ways can never be known but in one instant he is down on both knees smothering the floury hand with kisses and the next moment annes arms are round his neck and her lips against his and the barrier between them is swept away and the deep waters of their love rush together  with that kiss they enter a new life whereinto one may not follow them one thinks it must have been a life made strangely beautiful by selfforgetfulness strangely sweet by mutual devotiona life too ideal perhaps to have remained for long undimmed by the mists of earth  they who remember them at that time speak of them in hushed tones as one speaks of visions  it would almost seem as though from their faces in those days there shone a radiance as though in their voices dwelt a tenderness beyond the tenderness of man  they seem never to rest never to weary  day and night through that little stricken world they come and go bearing healing and peace till at last the plague like some gorged beast of prey slinks slowly back towards its lair and men raise their heads and breathe  one afternoon returning from a somewhat longer round than usual john feels a weariness creeping into his limbs and quickens his step eager to reach home and rest  anne who has been up all the previous night is asleep and not wishing to disturb her he goes into the diningroom and sits down in the easy chair before the fire  the room strikes cold  he stirs the logs but they give out no greater heat  he draws his chair right in front of them and sits leaning over them with his feet on the hearth and his hands outstretched towards the blaze yet he still shivers  twilight fills the room and deepens into dusk  he wonders listlessly how it is that time seems to be moving with such swift strides  after a while he hears a voice close to him speaking in a slow monotonous tonea voice curiously familiar to him though he cannot tell to whom it belongs  he does not turn his head but sits listening to it drowsily it is talking about tallow one hundred and ninetyfour casks of tallow and they must all stand one inside the other  it cannot be done the voice complains pathetically  they will not go inside each other  it is no good pushing them  see they only roll out again  the voice grows wearily fretful  oh why do they persist when they see it is impossible  what fools they all are  suddenly he recollects the voice and starts up and stares wildly about him trying to remember where he is  with a fierce straining of his will he grips the brain that is slipping away from him and holds it  as soon as he feels sure of himself he steals out of the room and down the stairs  in the hall he stands listening the house is very silent  he goes to the head of the stairs leading to the kitchen and calls softly to the old housekeeper and she comes up to him panting and grunting as she climbs each step  keeping some distance from her he asks in a whisper where anne is  the woman answers that she is in the hospital  tell her i have been called away suddenly on business he says speaking in quick low tones i shall be away for some days  tell her to leave here and return home immediately  they can do without her here now  tell her to go back home at once  i will join her there  he moves toward the door but stops and faces round again  tell her i beg and entreat her not to stop in this place an hour longer there is nothing to keep her now  it is all over there is nothing that cannot be done by any one  tell her she must go homethis very night tell her if she loves me to leave this place at once  the woman a little bewildered by his vehemence promises and disappears down the stairs  he takes his hat and cloak from the chair on which he had thrown them and turns once more to cross the hall  as he does so the door opens and anne enters  he darts back into the shadow squeezing himself against the wall  anne calls to him laughingly then as he does not answer with a frightened accent  johnjohn dear  was not that you  are not you there  he holds his breath and crouches still closer into the dark corner and anne thinking she must have been mistaken in the dim light passes him and goes upstairs  then he creeps stealthily to the door lets himself out and closes it softly behind him  after the lapse of a few minutes the old housekeeper plods upstairs and delivers johns message  anne finding it altogether incomprehensible subjects the poor dame to severe examination but fails to elicit anything further  what is the meaning of it  what business can have compelled john who for ten weeks has never let the word escape his lips to leave her like thiswithout a word without a kiss  then suddenly she remembers the incident of a few moments ago when she had called to him thinking she saw him and he did not answer and the whole truth strikes her full in the heart  she refastens the bonnetstrings she has been slowly untying and goes down and out into the wet street  she makes her way rapidly to the house of the only doctor resident in the neighbourhooda big brusquemannered man who throughout these terrible two months has been their chief stay and help  he meets her on her entrance with an embarrassed air that tells its own tale and at once renders futile his clumsy attempts at acting  how should he know where john is  who told her john had the fevera great strong hulking fellow like that  she has been working too hard and has got fever on the brain  she must go straight back home or she will be having it herself  she is more likely to take it than john  anne waiting till he has finished jerking out sentences while stamping up and down the room says gently taking no notice of his denialsif you will not tell me i must find out from some one elsethat is all then her quick eyes noting his momentary hesitation she lays her little hand on his rough paw and with the shamelessness of a woman who loves deeply wheedles everything out of him that he has promised to keep secret  he stops her however as she is leaving the room  dont go in to him now he says he will worry about you  wait till tomorrow  so while john lies counting endless casks of tallow anne sits by his side tending her last case  often in his delirium he calls her name and she takes his fevered hand in hers and holds it and he falls asleep  each morning the doctor comes and looks at him asks a few questions and gives a few commonplace directions but makes no comment  it would be idle his attempting to deceive her  the days move slowly through the darkened room  anne watches his thin hands grow thinner his sunken eyes grow bigger yet remains strangely calm almost contented  very near the end there comes an hour when john wakes as from a dream and remembers all things clearly  he looks at her half gratefully half reproachfully  anne why are you here he asks in a low laboured voice  did they not give you my message  for answer she turns her deep eyes upon him  would you have gone away and left me here to die she questions him with a faint smile  she bends her head down nearer to him so that her soft hair falls about his face  our lives were one dear she whispers to him  i could not have lived without you god knew that  we shall be together always  she kisses him and laying his head upon her breast softly strokes it as she might a childs and he puts his weak arms around her  later on she feels them growing cold about her and lays him gently back upon the bed looks for the last time into his eyes then draws the lids down over them  his people ask that they may bury him in the churchyard hard by so that he may always be among them and anne consenting they do all things needful with their own hands wishful that no unloving labour may be mingled with their work  they lay him close to the porch where going in and out the church their feet will pass near to him and one among them who is cunning with the gravers chisel shapes the stone  at the head he carves in basrelief the figure of the good samaritan tending the brother fallen by the way and underneath the letters in remembrance of john ingerfield  he thinks to put a verse of scripture immediately after but the gruff doctor says better leave a space in case you want to add another name  so the stone remains a little while unfinished till the same hand carves thereon a few weeks later and of anne his wife     the woman of the saeter   wildreindeer stalking is hardly so exciting a sport as the evenings verandah talk in norroway hotels would lead the trustful traveller to suppose  under the charge of your guide a very young man with the dreamy wistful eyes of those who live in valleys you leave the farmstead early in the forenoon arriving towards twilight at the desolate hut which for so long as you remain upon the uplands will be your somewhat cheerless headquarters  next morning in the chill mistladen dawn you rise and after a breakfast of coffee and dried fish shoulder your remington and step forth silently into the raw damp air the guide locking the door behind you the key grating harshly in the rusty lock  for hour after hour you toil over the steep stony ground or wind through the pines speaking in whispers lest your voice reach the quick ears of your prey that keeps its head ever pressed against the wind here and there in the hollows of the hills lie wide fields of snow over which you pick your steps thoughtfully listening to the smothered thunder of the torrent tunnelling its way beneath your feet and wondering whether the frozen arch above it be at all points as firm as is desirable  now and again as in single file you walk cautiously along some jagged ridge you catch glimpses of the green world three thousand feet below you though you gaze not long upon the view for your attention is chiefly directed to watching the footprints of the guide lest by deviating to the right or left you find yourself at one stride back in the valleyor to be more correct are found there  these things you do and as exercise they are healthful and invigorating but a reindeer you never see and unless overcoming the prejudices of your britishbred conscience you care to take an occasional pop at a fox you had better have left your rifle at the hut and instead have brought a stick which would have been helpful  notwithstanding which the guide continues sanguine and in broken english helped out by stirring gesture tells of the terrible slaughter generally done by sportsmen under his superintendence and of the vast herds that generally infest these fields and when you grow sceptical upon the subject of reins he whispers alluringly of bears  once in a way you will come across a track and will follow it breathlessly for hours and it will lead to a sheer precipice  whether the explanation is suicide or a reprehensible tendency on the part of the animal towards practical joking you are left to decide for yourself then with many rough miles between you and your rest you abandon the chase  but i speak from personal experience merely  all day long we had tramped through the pitiless rain stopping only for an hour at noon to eat some dried venison and smoke a pipe beneath the shelter of an overhanging cliff  soon afterwards michael knocked over a ryper a bird that will hardly take the trouble to hop out of your way with his gunbarrel which incident cheered us a little and later on our flagging spirits were still further revived by the discovery of apparently very recent deertracks  these we followed forgetful in our eagerness of the lengthening distance back to the hut of the fading daylight of the gathering mist  the track led us higher and higher farther and farther into the mountains until on the shores of a desolate rockbound vand it abruptly ended and we stood staring at one another and the snow began to fall  unless in the next halfhour we could chance upon a saeter this meant passing the night upon the mountain  michael and i looked at the guide but though with characteristic norwegian sturdiness he put a bold face upon it we could see that in that deepening darkness he knew no more than we did  wasting no time on words we made straight for the nearest point of descent knowing that any human habitation must be far below us  down we scrambled heedless of torn clothes and bleeding hands the darkness pressing closer round us  then suddenly it became blackblack as pitchand we could only hear each other  another step might mean death  we stretched out our hands and felt each other  why we spoke in whispers i do not know but we seemed afraid of our own voices  we agreed there was nothing for it but to stop where we were till morning clinging to the short grass so we lay there side by side for what may have been five minutes or may have been an hour  then attempting to turn i lost my grip and rolled  i made convulsive efforts to clutch the ground but the incline was too steep  how far i fell i could not say but at last something stopped me  i felt it cautiously with my foot it did not yield so i twisted myself round and touched it with my hand  it seemed planted firmly in the earth  i passed my arm along to the right then to the left  i shouted with joy  it was a fence  rising and groping about me i found an opening and passed through and crept forward with palms outstretched until i touched the logs of a hut then feeling my way round discovered the door and knocked  there came no response so i knocked louder then pushed and the heavy woodwork yielded groaning  but the darkness within was even darker than the darkness without  the others had contrived to crawl down and join me michael struck a wax vesta and held it up and slowly the room came out of the darkness and stood round us  then something rather startling happened  giving one swift glance about him our guide uttered a cry and rushed out into the night  we followed to the door and called after him but only a voice came to us out of the blackness and the only words that we could catch shrieked back in terror were saetervronen  saetervronen  the woman of the saeter  some foolish superstition about the place i suppose said michael  in these mountain solitudes men breed ghosts for company  let us make a fire  perhaps when he sees the light his desire for food and shelter may get the better of his fears  we felt about in the small enclosure round the house and gathered juniper and birchtwigs and kindled a fire upon the open stove built in the corner of the room  fortunately we had some dried reindeer and bread in our bag and on that and the ryper and the contents of our flasks we supped  afterwards to while away the time we made an inspection of the strange eyrie we had lighted on  it was an old logbuilt saeter  some of these mountain farmsteads are as old as the stone ruins of other countries  carvings of strange beasts and demons were upon its blackened rafters and on the lintel in runic letters ran this legend hund builded me in the days of haarfager  the house consisted of two large apartments  originally no doubt these had been separate dwellings standing beside one another but they were now connected by a long low gallery  most of the scanty furniture was almost as ancient as the walls themselves but many articles of a comparatively recent date had been added  all was now however rotting and falling into decay  the place appeared to have been deserted suddenly by its last occupants household utensils lay as they were left rust and dirt encrusted on them  an open book limp and mildewed lay face downwards on the table while many others were scattered about both rooms together with much paper scored with faded ink  the curtains hung in shreds about the windows a womans cloak of an antiquated fashion drooped from a nail behind the door  in an oak chest we found a tumbled heap of yellow letters  they were of various dates extending over a period of four months and with them apparently intended to receive them lay a large envelope inscribed with an address in london that has since disappeared  strong curiosity overcoming faint scruples we read them by the dull glow of the burning juniper twigs and as we lay aside the last of them there rose from the depths below us a wailing cry and all night long it rose and died away and rose again and died away again whether born of our brain or of some human thing god knows  and these a little altered and shortened are the letters  extract from first letter     i cannot tell you my dear joyce what a haven of peace this place is    to me after the racket and fret of town  i am almost quite recovered    already and am growing stronger every day and joy of joys my brain    has come back to me fresher and more vigorous i think for its    holiday  in this silence and solitude my thoughts flow freely and    the difficulties of my task are disappearing as if by magic  we are    perched upon a tiny plateau halfway up the mountain  on one side the    rock rises almost perpendicularly piercing the sky while on the    other two thousand feet below us the torrent hurls itself into the    black waters of the fiord  the house consists of two roomsor    rather it is two cabins connected by a passage  the larger one we    use as a living room and the other is our sleeping apartment  we    have no servant but do everything for ourselves  i fear sometimes    muriel must find it lonely  the nearest human habitation is eight    miles away across the mountain and not a soul comes near us  i    spend as much time as i can with her however during the day and    make up for it by working at night after she has gone to sleep and    when i question her she only laughs and answers that she loves to    have me all to herself  here you will smile cynically i know and    say humph i wonder will she say the same when they have been    married six years instead of six months  at the rate i am working    now i shall have finished my first volume by the spring and then my    dear fellow you must try and come over and we will walk and talk    together amid these stormreared temples of the gods  i have felt a    new man since i arrived here  instead of having to cudgel my    brains as we say thoughts crowd upon me  this work will make my    name  part of the third letter the second being mere talk about the book a history apparently that the man was writing     my dear joycei have written you two lettersthis will make the    thirdbut have been unable to post them  every day i have been    expecting a visit from some farmer or villager for the norwegians are    kindly people towards strangersto say nothing of the inducements of    trade  a fortnight having passed however and the commissariat    question having become serious i yesterday set out before dawn and    made my way down to the valley and this gives me something to tell    you  nearing the village i met a peasant woman  to my intense    surprise instead of returning my salutation she stared at me as if    i were some wild animal and shrank away from me as far as the width    of the road would permit  in the village the same experience awaited    me  the children ran from me the people avoided me  at last a grey    haired old man appeared to take pity on me and from him i learnt the    explanation of the mystery  it seems there is a strange superstition    attaching to this house in which we are living  my things were    brought up here by the two men who accompanied me from drontheim but    the natives are afraid to go near the place and prefer to keep as far    as possible from any one connected with it  the story is that the house was built by one hund a maker of runes one of the old saga writers no doubt who lived here with his young wife  all went peacefully until unfortunately for him a certain maiden stationed at a neighbouring saeter grew to love him  forgive me if i am telling you what you know but a saeter is the name given to the upland pastures to which during the summer are sent the cattle generally under the charge of one or more of the maids  here for three months these girls will live in their lonely huts entirely shut off from the world  customs change little in this land  two or three such stations are within climbing distance of this house at this day looked after by the farmers daughters as in the days of hund maker of runes  every night by devious mountain paths the woman would come and tap lightly at hunds door  hund had built himself two cabins one behind the other these are now as i think i have explained to you connected by a passage the smaller one was the homestead in the other he carved and wrote so that while the young wife slept the maker of runes and the saeter woman sat whispering  one night however the wife learnt all things but said no word  then as now the ravine in front of the enclosure was crossed by a slight bridge of planks and over this bridge the woman of the saeter passed and repassed each night  on a day when hund had gone down to fish in the fiord the wife took an axe and hacked and hewed at the bridge yet it still looked firm and solid and that night as hund sat waiting in his workshop there struck upon his ears a piercing cry and a crashing of logs and rolling rock and then again the dull roaring of the torrent far below  but the woman did not die unavenged for that winter a man skating far down the fiord noticed a curious object embedded in the ice and when stooping he looked closer he saw two corpses one gripping the other by the throat and the bodies were the bodies of hund and his young wife  since then they say the woman of the saeter haunts hunds house and if she sees a light within she taps upon the door and no man may keep her out  many at different times have tried to occupy the house but strange tales are told of them  men do not live at hunds saeter said my old greyhaired friend concluding his talethey die there  i have persuaded some of the braver of the villagers to bring what provisions and other necessaries we require up to a plateau about a mile from the house and leave them there  that is the most i have been able to do  it comes somewhat as a shock to one to find men and womenfairly educated and intelligent as many of them areslaves to fears that one would expect a child to laugh at  but there is no reasoning with superstition  extract from the same letter but from a part seemingly written a day or two later     at home i should have forgotten such a tale an hour after i had heard    it but these mountain fastnesses seem strangely fit to be the last    stronghold of the supernatural  the woman haunts me already  at    night instead of working i find myself listening for her tapping at    the door and yesterday an incident occurred that makes me fear for my    own common sense  i had gone out for a long walk alone and the    twilight was thickening into darkness as i neared home  suddenly    looking up from my reverie i saw standing on a knoll the other side    of the ravine the figure of a woman  she held a cloak about her    head and i could not see her face  i took off my cap and called out    a goodnight to her but she never moved or spoke  thengod knows    why for my brain was full of other thoughts at the timea clammy    chill crept over me and my tongue grew dry and parched  i stood    rooted to the spot staring at her across the yawning gorge that    divided us and slowly she moved away and passed into the gloom and    i continued my way  i have said nothing to muriel and shall not  the    effect the story has had upon myself warns me not to do so  from a letter dated eleven days later     she has come  i have known she would since that evening i saw her    on the mountain and last night she came and we have sat and looked    into each others eyes  you will say of course that i am madthat    i have not recovered from my feverthat i have been working too    hardthat i have heard a foolish tale and that it has filled my    overstrung brain with foolish fancies i have told myself all that    but the thing came neverthelessa creature of flesh and blood a    creature of air a creature of my own imaginationwhat matter it    was real to me     it came last night as i sat working alone  each night i have    waited for it listened for itlonged for it i know now  i heard    the passing of its feet upon the bridge the tapping of its hand upon    the door three timestap tap tap  i felt my loins grow cold and    a pricking pain about my head and i gripped my chair with both hands    and waited and again there came the tappingtap tap tap  i rose    and slipped the bolt of the door leading to the other room and again    i waited and again there came the tappingtap tap tap  then i    opened the heavy outer door and the wind rushed past me scattering    my papers and the woman entered in and i closed the door behind her    she threw her hood back from her head and unwound a kerchief from    about her neck and laid it on the table  then she crossed and sat    before the fire and i noticed her bare feet were damp with the night    dew     i stood over against her and gazed at her and she smiled at mea    strange wicked smile but i could have laid my soul at her feet  she    never spoke or moved and neither did i feel the need of spoken words    for i understood the meaning of those upon the mount when they said    let us make here tabernacles it is good for us to be here     how long a time passed thus i do not know but suddenly the woman    held her hand up listening and there came a faint sound from the    other room  then swiftly she drew her hood about her face and passed    out closing the door softly behind her and i drew back the bolt of    the inner door and waited and hearing nothing more sat down and    must have fallen asleep in my chair     i awoke and instantly there flashed through my mind the thought of    the kerchief the woman had left behind her and i started from my    chair to hide it  but the table was already laid for breakfast and    my wife sat with her elbows on the table and her head between her    hands watching me with a look in her eyes that was new to me     she kissed me though her lips were cold and i argued to myself that    the whole thing must have been a dream  but later in the day passing    the open door when her back was towards me i saw her take the    kerchief from a locked chest and look at it     i have told myself it must have been a kerchief of her own and that    all the rest has been my imagination that if not then my strange    visitant was no spirit but a woman and that if human thing knows    human thing it was no creature of flesh and blood that sat beside me    last night  besides what woman would she be  the nearest saeter is    a threehours climb to a strong man and the paths are dangerous even    in daylight what woman would have found them in the night  what    woman would have chilled the air around her and have made the blood    flow cold through all my veins  yet if she come again i will speak to    her  i will stretch out my hand and see whether she be mortal thing    or only air  the fifth letter     my dear joycewhether your eyes will ever see these letters is    doubtful  from this place i shall never send them  they would read    to you as the ravings of a madman  if ever i return to england i may    one day show them to you but when i do it will be when i with you    can laugh over them  at present i write them merely to hide    awayputting the words down on paper saves my screaming them aloud     she comes each night now taking the same seat beside the embers and    fixing upon me those eyes with the helllight in them that burn into    my brain and at rare times she smiles and all my being passes out of    me and is hers  i make no attempt to work  i sit listening for her    footsteps on the creaking bridge for the rustling of her feet upon    the grass for the tapping of her hand upon the door  no word is    uttered between us  each day i say when she comes tonight i will    speak to her  i will stretch out my hand and touch her  yet when    she enters all thought and will goes out from me     last night as i stood gazing at her my soul filled with her    wondrous beauty as a lake with moonlight her lips parted and she    started from her chair and turning i thought i saw a white face    pressed against the window but as i looked it vanished  then she    drew her cloak about her and passed out  i slid back the bolt i    always draw now and stole into the other room and taking down the    lantern held it above the bed  but muriels eyes were closed as if    in sleep  extract from the sixth letter     it is not the night i fear but the day  i hate the sight of this    woman with whom i live whom i call wife  i shrink from the blow of    her cold lips the curse of her stony eyes  she has seen she has    learnt i feel it i know it  yet she winds her arms around my neck    and calls me sweetheart and smoothes my hair with her soft false    hands  we speak mocking words of love to one another but i know her    cruel eyes are ever following me  she is plotting her revenge and i    hate her i hate her i hate her  part of the seventh letter     this morning i went down to the fiord  i told her i should not be    back until the evening  she stood by the door watching me until we    were mere specks to one another and a promontory of the mountain shut    me from view  then turning aside from the track i made my way    running and stumbling over the jagged ground round to the other side    of the mountain and began to climb again  it was slow weary work    often i had to go miles out of my road to avoid a ravine and twice i    reached a high point only to have to descend again  but at length i    crossed the ridge and crept down to a spot from where concealed i    could spy upon my own house  shemy wifestood by the flimsy    bridge  a short hatchet such as butchers use was in her hand  she    leant against a pine trunk with her arm behind her as one stands    whose back aches with long stooping in some cramped position and even    at that distance i could see the cruel smile about her lips     then i recrossed the ridge and crawled down again and waiting    until evening walked slowly up the path  as i came in view of the    house she saw me and waved her handkerchief to me and in answer i    waved my hat and shouted curses at her that the wind whirled away    into the torrent  she met me with a kiss and i breathed no hint to    her that i had seen  let her devils work remain undisturbed  let it    prove to me what manner of thing this is that haunts me  if it be a    spirit then the bridge wilt bear it safely if it be woman     but i dismiss the thought  if it be human thing why does it sit    gazing at me never speaking why does my tongue refuse to question    it why does all power forsake me in its presence so that i stand as    in a dream  yet if it be spirit why do i hear the passing of her    feet and why does the nightrain glisten on her hair     i force myself back into my chair  it is far into the night and i    am alone waiting listening  if it be spirit she will come to me    and if it be woman i shall hear her cry above the stormunless it be    a demon mocking me     i have heard the cry  it rose piercing and shrill above the storm    above the riving and rending of the bridge above the downward    crashing of the logs and loosened stones  i hear it as i listen now    it is cleaving its way upward from the depths below  it is wailing    through the room as i sit writing     i have crawled upon my belly to the utmost edge of the still standing    pier until i could feel with my hand the jagged splinters left by the    fallen planks and have looked down  but the chasm was full to the    brim with darkness  i shouted but the wind shook my voice into    mocking laughter  i sit here feebly striking at the madness that is    creeping nearer and nearer to me  i tell myself the whole thing is    but the fever in my brain  the bridge was rotten  the storm was    strong  the cry is but a single one among the many voices of the    mountain  yet still i listen and it rises clear and shrill above    the moaning of the pines above the sobbing of the waters  it beats    like blows upon my skull and i know that she will never come again  extract from the last letter     i shall address an envelope to you and leave it among these letters    then should i never come back some chance wanderer may one day find    and post them to you and you will know     my books and writings remain untouched  we sit together of a    nightthis woman i call wife and ishe holding in her hands some    knitted thing that never grows longer by a single stitch and i with a    volume before me that is ever open at the same page  and day and    night we watch each other stealthily moving to and fro about the    silent house and at times looking round swiftly i catch the smile    upon her lips before she has time to smooth it away     we speak like strangers about this and that making talk to hide our    thoughts  we make a pretence of busying ourselves about whatever will    help us to keep apart from one another     at night sitting here between the shadows and the dull glow of the    smouldering twigs i sometimes think i hear the tapping i have learnt    to listen for and i start from my seat and softly open the door and    look out  but only the night stands there  then i closeto the    latch and shethe living womanasks me in her purring voice what    sound i heard hiding a smile as she stoops low over her work and i    answer lightly and moving towards her put my arm about her feeling    her softness and her suppleness and wondering supposing i held her    close to me with one arm while pressing her from me with the other    how long before i should hear the cracking of her bones     for here amid these savage solitudes i also am grown savage  the    old primeval passions of love and hate stir within me and they are    fierce and cruel and strong beyond what you men of the later ages    could understand  the culture of the centuries has fallen from me as    a flimsy garment whirled away by the mountain wind the old savage    instincts of the race lie bare  one day i shall twine my fingers    about her full white throat and her eyes will slowly come towards me    and her lips will part and the red tongue creep out and backwards    step by step i shall push her before me gazing the while upon her    bloodless face and it will be my turn to smile  backwards through    the open door backwards along the garden path between the juniper    bushes backwards till her heels are overhanging the ravine and she    grips life with nothing but her little toes i shall force her step    by step before me  then i shall lean forward closer closer till i    kiss her purpling lips and down down down past the startled sea    birds past the white spray of the foss past the downward peeping    pines down down down we will go together till we find the thing    that lies sleeping beneath the waters of the fiord  with these words ended the last letter unsigned  at the first streak of dawn we left the house and after much wandering found our way back to the valley  but of our guide we heard no news  whether he remained still upon the mountain or whether by some false step he had perished upon that night we never learnt     variety patter   my first appearance at a music hall was in the year one thousand eight hundred and s  well i would rather not mention the exact date  i was fourteen at the time  it was during the christmas holidays and my aunt had given me five shillings to go and see phelpsi think it was phelpsin coriolanusi think it was coriolanus  anyhow it was to see a highclass and improving entertainment i know  i suggested that i should induce young skegson who lived in our road to go with me  skegson is a barrister now and could not tell you the difference between a knave of clubs and a club of knaves  a few years hence he will if he works hard be innocent enough for a judge  but at the period of which i speak he was a redhaired boy of worldly tastes notwithstanding which i loved him as a brother  my dear mother wished to see him before consenting to the arrangement so as to be able to form her own opinion as to whether he was a fit and proper companion for me and accordingly he was invited to tea  he came and made a most favourable impression upon both my mother and my aunt  he had a way of talking about the advantages of application to study in early life and the duties of youth towards those placed in authority over it that won for him much esteem in grownup circles  the spirit of the bar had descended upon skegson at a very early period of his career  my aunt indeed was so much pleased with him that she gave him two shillings towards his own expenses sprung half a dollar was how he explained the transaction when we were outside and commended me to his especial care  skegson was very silent during the journey  an idea was evidently maturing in his mind  at the angel he stopped and said look here ill tell you what well do  dont lets go and see that rot  lets go to a music hall  i gasped for breath  i had heard of music halls  a stout lady had denounced them across our dinner table on one occasionfixing the while a steely eye upon her husband who sat opposite and seemed uncomfortableas low horrid places where people smoked and drank and wore short skirts and had added an opinion that they ought to be put down by the policewhether the skirts or the halls she did not explain i also recollected that our charwoman whose son had lately left london for a protracted stay in devonshire had in conversation with my mother dated his downfall from the day when he first visited one of these places and likewise that mrs philcoxs nursemaid upon her confessing that she had spent an evening at one with her young man had been called a shameless hussy and summarily dismissed as being no longer a fit associate for the baby  but the spirit of lawlessness was strong within me in those days so that i hearkened to the voice of skegson the tempter and he lured my feet from the paths that led to virtue and sadlers wells and we wandered into the broad and crowded ways that branch off from the angel towards merry islington  skegson insisted that we should do the thing in style so we stopped at a shop near the agricultural hall and purchased some big cigars  a huge card in the window claimed for these that they were the most satisfactory twopenny smokes in london  i smoked two of them during the evening and never felt more satisfiedusing the word in its true sense as implying that a person has had enough of a thing and does not desire any more of it just thenin all my life  where we went and what we saw my memory is not very clear upon  we sat at a little marble table i know it was marble because it was so hard and cool to the head  from out of the smoky mist a ponderous creature of strange undefined shape floated heavily towards us and deposited a squat tumbler in front of me containing a pale yellowish liquor which subsequent investigation has led me to believe must have been scotch whisky  it seemed to me then the most nauseous stuff i had ever swallowed  it is curious to look back and notice how ones tastes change  i reached home very late and very sick  that was my first dissipation and as a lesson it has been of more practical use to me than all the good books and sermons in the world could have been  i can remember to this day standing in the middle of the room in my nightshirt trying to catch my bed as it came round  next morning i confessed everything to my mother and for several months afterwards was a reformed character  indeed the pendulum of my conscience swung too far the other way and i grew exaggeratedly remorseful and unhealthily moral  there was published in those days for the edification of young people a singularly pessimistic periodical entitled the childrens band of hope review  it was a magazine much in favour among grownup people and a bound copy of vol ix had lately been won by my sister as a prize for punctuality i fancy she must have exhausted all the virtue she ever possessed in that direction upon the winning of that prize  at all events i have noticed no ostentatious display of the quality in her later life  i had formerly expressed contempt for this book but now in my regenerate state i took a morbid pleasure in poring over its denunciations of sin and sinners  there was one picture in it that appeared peculiarly applicable to myself  it represented a gaudily costumed young man standing on the topmost of three steep steps smoking a large cigar  behind him was a very small church and below a bright and not altogether uninviting looking hell  the picture was headed the three steps to ruin and the three stairs were labelled respectively smoking drinking gambling  i had already travelled twothirds of the road  was i going all the way or should i be able to retrace those steps  i used to lie awake at night and think about it till i grew half crazy  alas since then i have completed the descent so where my future will be spent i do not care to think  another picture in the book that troubled me was the frontispiece  this was a highlycoloured print illustrating the broad and narrow ways  the narrow way led upward past a sundayschool and a lion to a city in the clouds  this city was referred to in the accompanying letterpress as a place of rest and peace but inasmuch as the town was represented in the illustration as surrounded by a perfect mob of angels each one blowing a trumpet twice his own size and obviously blowing it for all he was worth a certain confusion of ideas would seem to have crept into the allegory  the other paththe broad waywhich ended in what at first glance appeared to be a highly successful display of fireworks started from the door of a tavern and led past a music hall on the steps of which stood a gentleman smoking a cigar  all the wicked people in this book smoked cigarsall except one young man who had killed his mother and died raving mad  he had gone astray on short pipes  this made it uncomfortably clear to me which direction i had chosen and i was greatly alarmed until on examining the picture more closely i noticed with much satisfaction that about midway the two paths were connected by a handy little bridge by the use of which it seemed feasible starting on the one path and ending up on the other to combine the practical advantages of both roads  from subsequent observation i have come to the conclusion that a good many people have made a note of that little bridge  my own belief in the possibility of such convenient compromise must i fear have led to an ethical relapse for there recurs to my mind a somewhat painful scene of a few months later date in which i am seeking to convince a singularly unresponsive landed proprietor that my presence in his orchard is solely and entirely due to my having unfortunately lost my way  it was not until i was nearly seventeen that the idea occurred to me to visit a music hall again  then having regard to my double capacity of man about town and journalist for i had written a letter to the era complaining of the way pit doors were made to open and it had been inserted i felt i had no longer any right to neglect acquaintanceship with so important a feature in the life of the people  accordingly one saturday night i wended my way to the pav and there the first person that i ran against was my uncle  he laid a heavy hand upon my shoulder and asked me in severe tones what i was doing there  i felt this to be an awkward question for it would have been useless trying to make him understand my real motives ones own relations are never sympathetic and i was somewhat nonplussed for an answer until the reflection occurred to me what was he doing there  this riddle i in my turn propounded to him with the result that we entered into treaty by the terms of which it was agreed that no future reference should be made to the meeting by either of usespecially not in the presence of my auntand the compact was ratified according to the usual custom my uncle paying the necessary expenses  in those days we sat some four or six of us round a little table on which were placed our drinks  now we have to balance them upon a narrow ledge and ladies as they pass dip the ends of their cloaks into them and gentlemen stir them up for us with the ferrules of their umbrellas or else sweep them off into our laps with their coat tails saying as they do so oh i beg your pardon  also in those days there were chairmenaffable gentlemen who would drink anything at anybodys expense and drink any quantity of it and never seem to get any fuller  i was introduced to a music hall chairman once and when i said to him what is your drink he took up the list of beverages that lay before him and opening it waved his hand lightly across its entire contents from clarets past champagnes and spirits down to liqueurs  thats my drink my boy said he  there was nothing narrowminded or exclusive about his tastes  it was the chairmans duty to introduce the artists  ladies and gentlemen he would shout in a voice that united the musical characteristics of a foghorn and a steam saw miss enerietta montressor the popular seriocomic will now happear  these announcements were invariably received with great applause by the chairman himself and generally with chilling indifference by the rest of the audience  it was also the privilege of the chairman to maintain order and reprimand evildoers  this he usually did very effectively employing for the purpose language both fit and forcible  one chairman that i remember seemed however to be curiously deficient in the necessary qualities for this part of his duty  he was a mild and sleepy little man and unfortunately he had to preside over an exceptionally rowdy audience at a small hall in the southeast district  on the night that i was present there occurred a great disturbance  joss jessop the monarch of mirth a gentleman evidently high in local request was for some reason or other not forthcoming and in his place the management proposed to offer a female performer on the zithern one signorina ballatino  the little chairman made the announcement in a nervous deprecatory tone as if he were rather ashamed of it himself  ladies and gentlemen he beganthe poor are staunch sticklers for etiquette i overheard a small child explaining to her mother one night in three colts street limehouse that she could not get into the house because there was a lady on the doorstep drunksignorina ballatino the worldrenowned  here a voice from the gallery requested to know what had become of old joss and was greeted by loud cries of ear ear  the chairman ignoring the interruption continued  the worldrenowned performer on the zither  on the whoter came in tones of plaintive inquiry from the back of the hall  hon the zither retorted the chairman waxing mildly indignant he meant zithern but he called it a zither  a hinstrument wellknown to anybody as as ad any learning  this sally was received with much favour and a gentleman who claimed to be acquainted with the family history of the interrupter begged the chairman to excuse that illbred person on the ground that his mother used to get drunk with the twopence a week and never sent him to school  cheered by this breath of popularity our little president endeavoured to complete his introduction of the signorina  he again repeated that she was the worldrenowned performer on the zithern and undeterred by the audible remark of a lady in the pit to the effect that shed never eard on er added  she will now ladies and gentlemen with your kind permission give you examples of the  blow yer zither here cried out the gentleman who had started the agitation we want joss jessop  this was the signal for much cheering and shrill whistling in the midst of which a wag with a piping voice suggested as a reason for the favourites nonappearance that he had not been paid his last weeks salary  a temporary lull occurred at this point and the chairman seizing the opportunity to complete his oftimpeded speech suddenly remarked songs of the sunny south and immediately sat down and began hammering upon the table  then signora ballatino clothed in the costume of the sunny south where clothes are less essential than in these colder climes skipped airily forward and was most ungallantly greeted with a storm of groans and hisses  her beloved instrument was unfeelingly alluded to as a piedish and she was advised to take it back and get the penny on it  the chairman addressed by his christian name of jimmee was told to lie down and let her sing him to sleep  every time she attempted to start playing shouts were raised for joss  at length the chairman overcoming his evident disinclination to take any sort of hand whatever in the game rose and gently hinted at the desirability of silence  the suggestion not meeting with any support he proceeded to adopt sterner measures  he addressed himself personally to the ringleader of the rioters the man who had first championed the cause of the absent joss  this person was a brawny individual who judging from appearances followed in his business hours the calling of a coalheaver  yes sir said the chairman pointing a finger towards him where he sat in the front row of the gallery you sir in the flannel shirt  i can see you  will you allow this lady to give her entertainment  no answered he of the coalheaving profession in stentorian tones  then sir said the little chairman working himself up into a state suggestive of jove about to launch a thunderboltthen sir all i can say is that you are no gentleman  this was a little too much or rather a good deal too little for the signora ballatino  she had hitherto been standing in a meek attitude of pathetic appeal wearing a fixed smile of ineffable sweetness but she evidently felt that she could go a bit farther than that herself even if she was a lady  calling the chairman an old messer and telling him for gawds sake to shut up if that was all he could do for his living she came down to the front and took the case into her own hands  she did not waste time on the rest of the audience  she went direct for that coalheaver and thereupon ensued a slanging match the memory of which sends a trill of admiration through me even to this day  it was a battle worthy of the gods  he was a heaver of coals quick and ready beyond his kind  during many years sojourn east and south in the course of many wanderings from billingsgate to limehouse hole from petticoat lane to whitechapel road out of eelpie shop and penny gaff out of tavern and street and court and dosshouse he had gathered together slang words and terms and phrases and they came back to him now and he stood up against her manfully  but as well might the lamb stand up against the eagle when the shadow of its wings falls across the green pastures and the wind flies before its dark oncoming  at the end of two minutes he lay gasping dazed and speechless  then she began  she announced her intention of wiping down the bloomin all with him and making it respectable and metaphorically speaking that is what she did  her tongue hit him between the eyes and knocked him down and trampled on him  it curled round and round him like a whip and then it uncurled and wound the other way  it seized him by the scruff of his neck and tossed him up into the air and caught him as he descended and flung him to the ground and rolled him on it  it played around him like forked lightning and blinded him  it danced and shrieked about him like a host of whirling fiends and he tried to remember a prayer and could not  it touched him lightly on the sole of his foot and the crown of his head and his hair stood up straight and his limbs grew stiff  the people sitting near him drew away not feeling it safe to be near and left him alone surrounded by space and language  it was the most artistic piece of work of its kind that i have ever heard  every phrase she flung at him seemed to have been woven on purpose to entangle him and to embrace in its choking folds his people and his gods to strangle with its threads his every hope ambition and belief  each term she put upon him clung to him like a garment and fitted him without a crease  the last name that she called him one felt to be until one heard the next the one name that he ought to have been christened by  for five and threequarter minutes by the clock she spoke and never for one instant did she pause or falter and in the whole of that onslaught there was only one weak spot  that was when she offered to make a better man than he was out of a guy fawkes and a lump of coal  you felt that one lump of coal would not have been sufficient  at the end she gathered herself together for one supreme effort and hurled at him an insult so bitter with scorn so sharp with insight into his career and character so heavy with prophetic curse that strong men drew and held their breath while it passed over them and women hid their faces and shivered  then she folded her arms and stood silent and the house from floor to ceiling rose and cheered her until there was no more breath left in its lungs  in that one night she stepped from oblivion into success  she is now a famous artiste  but she does not call herself signora ballatino and she does not play upon the zithern  her name has a homelier sound and her speciality is the delineation of coster character     silhouettes   i fear i must be of a somewhat gruesome turn of mind  my sympathies are always with the melancholy side of life and nature  i love the chill october days when the brown leaves lie thick and sodden underneath your feet and a low sound as of stifled sobbing is heard in the damp woodsthe evenings in late autumn time when the white mist creeps across the fields making it seem as though old earth feeling the night air cold to its poor bones were drawing ghostly bedclothes round its withered limbs  i like the twilight of the long grey street sad with the wailing cry of the distant muffin man  one thinks of him as strangely mitred he glides by through the gloom jangling his harsh bell as the high priest of the pale spirit of indigestion summoning the devout to come forth and worship  i find a sweetness in the aching dreariness of sabbath afternoons in genteel suburbsin the evilladen desolateness of waste places by the river when the yellow fog is stealing inland across the ooze and mud and the black tide gurgles softly round wormeaten piles  i love the bleak moor when the thin long line of the winding road lies white on the darkening heath while overhead some belated bird vexed with itself for being out so late scurries across the dusky sky screaming angrily  i love the lonely sullen lake hidden away in mountain solitudes  i suppose it was my childhoods surroundings that instilled in me this affection for sombre hues  one of my earliest recollections is of a dreary marshland by the sea  by day the water stood there in wide shallow pools  but when one looked in the evening they were pools of blood that lay there  it was a wild dismal stretch of coast  one day i found myself there all alonei forget how it came aboutand oh how small i felt amid the sky and the sea and the sandhills  i ran and ran and ran but i never seemed to move and then i cried and screamed louder and louder and the circling seagulls screamed back mockingly at me  it was an unken spot as they say up north  in the far back days of the building of the world a long high ridge of stones had been reared up by the sea dividing the swampy grassland from the sand  some of these stonespebbles so they called them round aboutwere as big as a man and many as big as a fairsized house and when the sea was angryand very prone he was to anger by that lonely shore and very quick to wrath often have i known him sink to sleep with a peaceful smile on his rippling waves to wake in fierce fury before the night was spenthe would snatch up giant handfuls of these pebbles and fling and toss them here and there till the noise of their rolling and crashing could be heard by the watchers in the village afar off  old nicks playing at marbles tonight they would say to one another pausing to listen  and then the women would close tight their doors and try not to hear the sound  far out to sea by where the muddy mouth of the river yawned wide there rose ever a thin white line of surf and underneath those crested waves there dwelt a very fearsome thing called the bar  i grew to hate and be afraid of this mysterious bar for i heard it spoken of always with bated breath and i knew that it was very cruel to fisher folk and hurt them so sometimes that they would cry whole days and nights together with the pain or would sit with white scared faces rocking themselves to and fro  once when i was playing among the sandhills there came by a tall grey woman bending beneath a load of driftwood  she paused when nearly opposite to me and facing seaward fixed her eyes upon the breaking surf above the bar  ah how i hate the sight of your white teeth she muttered then turned and passed on  another morning walking through the village i heard a low wailing come from one of the cottages while a little farther on a group of women were gathered in the roadway talking  ay said one of them i thought the bar was looking hungry last night  so putting one and the other together i concluded that the bar must be an ogre such as a body reads of in books who lived in a coral castle deep below the rivers mouth and fed upon the fishermen as he caught them going down to the sea or coming home  from my bedroom window on moonlight nights i could watch the silvery foam marking the spot beneath where he lay hid and i would stand on tip toe peering out until at length i would come to fancy i could see his hideous form floating below the waters  then as the little whitesailed boats stole by him tremblingly i used to tremble too lest he should suddenly open his grim jaws and gulp them down and when they had all safely reached the dark soft sea beyond i would steal back to the bedside and pray to god to make the bar good so that he would give up eating the poor fishermen  another incident connected with that coast lives in my mind  it was the morning after a great stormgreat even for that stormy coastand the passionworn waters were still heaving with the memory of a fury that was dead  old nick had scattered his marbles far and wide and there were rents and fissures in the pebbly wall such as the oldest fisherman had never known before  some of the hugest stones lay tossed a hundred yards away and the waters had dug pits here and there along the ridge so deep that a tall man might stand in some of them and yet his head not reach the level of the sand  round one of these holes a small crowd was pressing eagerly while one man standing in the hollow was lifting the few remaining stones off something that lay there at the bottom  i pushed my way between the straggling legs of a big fisher lad and peered over with the rest  a ray of sunlight streamed down into the pit and the thing at the bottom gleamed white  sprawling there among the black pebbles it looked like a huge spider  one by one the last stones were lifted away and the thing was left bare and then the crowd looked at one another and shivered  wonder how he got there said a woman at length somebody must ha helped him  some foreign chap no doubt said the man who had lifted off the stones washed ashore and buried here by the sea  what six foot below the watermark wi all they stones atop of him said another  thats no foreign chap cried a grizzled old woman pressing forward whats that thats aside him  some one jumped down and took it from the stone where it lay glistening and handed it up to her and she clutched it in her skinny hand  it was a gold earring such as fishermen sometimes wear  but this was a somewhat large one and of rather unusual shape  thats young abram parsons i tell ee as lies down there cried the old creature wildly  i ought to know  i gave him the pair o these forty year ago  it may be only an idea of mine born of after brooding upon the scene  i am inclined to think it must be so for i was only a child at the time and would hardly have noticed such a thing  but it seems to my remembrance that as the old crone ceased another woman in the crowd raised her eyes slowly and fixed them on a withered ancient man who leant upon a stick and that for a moment unnoticed by the rest these two stood looking strangely at each other  from these seascented scenes my memory travels to a weary land where dead ashes lie and there is blacknessblackness everywhere  black rivers flow between black banks black stunted trees grow in black fields black withered flowers by black wayside  black roads lead from blackness past blackness to blackness and along them trudge black savagelooking men and women and by them black oldlooking children play grim unchildish games  when the sun shines on this black land it glitters black and hard and when the rain falls a black mist rises towards heaven like the hopeless prayer of a hopeless soul  by night it is less dreary for then the sky gleams with a lurid light and out of the darkness the red flames leap and high up in the air they gambol and writhethe demon spawn of that evil land they seem  visitors who came to our house would tell strange tales of this black land and some of the stories i am inclined to think were true  one man said he saw a young bulldog fly at a boy and pin him by the throat  the lad jumped about with much sprightliness and tried to knock the dog away  whereupon the boys father rushed out of the house hard by and caught his son and heir roughly by the shoulder  keep still thee young  cant ee shouted the man angrily let un taste blood  another time i heard a lady tell how she had visited a cottage during a strike to find the baby together with the other children almost dying for want of food  dear dear me she cried taking the wee wizened mite from the mothers arms but i sent you down a quart of milk yesterday  hasnt the child had it  theer weer a little coom thank ee kindly maam the father took upon himself to answer but thee see it weer only just enow for the poops  we lived in a big lonely house on the edge of a wide common  one night i remember just as i was reluctantly preparing to climb into bed there came a wild ringing at the gate followed by a hoarse shrieking cry and then a frenzied shaking of the iron bars  then hurrying footsteps sounded through the house and the swift opening and closing of doors and i slipped back hastily into my knickerbockers and ran out  the women folk were gathered on the stairs while my father stood in the hall calling to them to be quiet  and still the wild ringing of the bell continued and above it the hoarse shrieking cry  my father opened the door and went out and we could hear him striding down the gravel path and we clung to one another and waited  after what seemed an endless time we heard the heavy gate unbarred and quickly clanged to and footsteps returning on the gravel  then the door opened again and my father entered and behind him a crouching figure that felt its way with its hands as it crept along as a blind man might the figure stood up when it reached the middle of the hall and mopped its eyes with a dirty rag that it carried in its hand after which it held the rag over the umbrellastand and wrung it out as washerwomen wring out clothes and the dark drippings fell into the tray with a dull heavy splut  my father whispered something to my mother and she went out towards the back and in a little while we heard the stamping of hoofsthe angry plunge of a spurstartled horsethe rhythmic throb of the long straight gallop dying away into the distance  my mother returned and spoke some reassuring words to the servants  my father having made fast the door and extinguished all but one or two of the lights had gone into a small room on the right of the hall the crouching figure still mopping that moisture from its eyes following him  we could hear them talking there in low tones my father questioning the other voice thick and interspersed with short panting grunts  we on the stairs huddled closer together and in the darkness i felt my mothers arm steal round me and encompass me so that i was not afraid then we waited while the silence round our frightened whispers thickened and grew heavy till the weight of it seemed to hurt us  at length out of its depths there crept to our ears a faint murmur  it gathered strength like the sound of the oncoming of a wave upon a stony shore until it broke in a babel of vehement voices just outside  after a few moments the hubbub ceased and there came a furious ringingthen angry shouts demanding admittance  some of the women began to cry  my father came out into the hall closing the room door behind him and ordered them to be quiet so sternly that they were stunned into silence  the furious ringing was repeated and this time threats mingled among the hoarse shouts  my mothers arm tightened around me and i could hear the beating of her heart  the voices outside the gate sank into a low confused mumbling  soon they died away altogether and the silence flowed back  my father turned up the hall lamp and stood listening  suddenly from the back of the house rose the noise of a great crashing followed by oaths and savage laughter  my father rushed forward but was borne back and in an instant the hall was full of grim ferocious faces  my father trembling a little or else it was the shadow cast by the flickering lamp and with lips tight pressed stood confronting them while we women and children too scared to even cry shrank back up the stairs  what followed during the next few moments is in my memory only a confused tumult above which my fathers high clear tones rise every now and again entreating arguing commanding  i see nothing distinctly until one of the grimmest of the faces thrusts itself before the others and a voice which like aarons rod swallows up all its fellows says in deep determined bass coom weve had enow chatter master  thee mun give un up or thee mun get out o th way an well search th house for oursel  then a light flashed into my fathers eyes that kindled something inside me so that the fear went out of me and i struggled to free myself from my mothers arm for the desire stirred me to fling myself down upon the grimy faces below and beat and stamp upon them with my fists  springing across the hall he snatched from the wall where it hung an ancient club part of a trophy of old armour and planting his back against the door through which they would have to pass he shouted then be damned to you all hes in this room  come and fetch him out  i recollect that speech well  i puzzled over it even at that time excited though i was  i had always been told that only low wicked people ever used the word damn and i tried to reconcile things and failed  the men drew back and muttered among themselves  it was an uglylooking weapon studded with iron spikes  my father held it secured to his hand by a chain and there was an ugly look about him also now that gave his face a strange likeness to the dark faces round him  but my mother grew very white and cold and underneath her breath she kept crying oh will they never comewill they never come and a cricket somewhere about the house began to chirp  then all at once without a word my mother flew down the stairs and passed like a flash of light through the crowd of dusky figures  how she did it i could never understand for the two heavy bolts had both been drawn but the next moment the door stood wide open and a hum of voices cheery with the anticipation of a period of perfect bliss was borne in upon the cool night air  my mother was always very quick of hearing        again i see a wild crowd of grim faces and my fathers very pale amongst them  but this time the faces are very many and they come and go like faces in a dream  the ground beneath my feet is wet and sloppy and a black rain is falling  there are womens faces in the crowd wild and haggard and long skinny arms stretch out threateningly towards my father and shrill frenzied voices call out curses on him  boys faces also pass me in the grey light and on some of them there is an impish grin  i seem to be in everybodys way and to get out of it i crawl into a dark draughty corner and crouch there among cinders  around me great engines fiercely strain and pant like living things fighting beyond their strength  their gaunt arms whirl madly above me and the ground rocks with their throbbing  dark figures flit to and fro pausing from time to time to wipe the black sweat from their faces  the pale light fades and the flamelit night lies red upon the land  the flitting figures take strange shapes  i hear the hissing of wheels the furious clanking of iron chains the hoarse shouting of many voices the hurrying tread of many feet and through all the wailing and weeping and cursing that never seem to cease  i drop into a restless sleep and dream that i have broken a chapel window stonethrowing and have died and gone to hell  at length a cold hand is laid upon my shoulder and i awake  the wild faces have vanished and all is silent now and i wonder if the whole thing has been a dream  my father lifts me into the dogcart and we drive home through the chill dawn  my mother opens the door softly as we alight  she does not speak only looks her question  its all over maggie answers my father very quietly as he takes off his coat and lays it across a chair weve got to begin the world afresh  my mothers arms steal up about his neck and i feeling heavy with a trouble i do not understand creep off to bed     the lease of the cross keys   this story is about a shop many stories are  one sunday evening this bishop had to preach a sermon at st pauls cathedral  the occasion was a very special and important one and every godfearing newspaper in the kingdom sent its own special representative to report the proceedings  now of the three reporters thus commissioned one was a man of appearance so eminently respectable that no one would have thought of taking him for a journalist  people used to put him down for a county councillor or an archdeacon at the very least  as a matter of fact however he was a sinful man with a passion for gin  he lived at bow and on the sabbath in question he left his home at five oclock in the afternoon and started to walk to the scene of his labours  the road from bow to the city on a wet and chilly sunday evening is a cheerless one who can blame him if on his way he stopped once or twice to comfort himself with two of his favourite beverage  on reaching st pauls he found he had twenty minutes to sparejust time enough for one final nip  half way down a narrow court leading out of the churchyard he found a quiet little hostelry and entering the private bar whispered insinuatingly across the counter  two of gin hot if you please my dear  his voice had the selfsatisfied meekness of the successful ecclesiastic his bearing suggested rectitude tempered by desire to avoid observation the barmaid impressed by his manner and appearance drew the attention of the landlord to him  the landlord covertly took stock of so much of him as could be seen between his buttonedup coat and his drawndown hat and wondered how so bland and innocentlooking a gentleman came to know of gin  a landlords duty however is not to wonder but to serve  the gin was given to the man and the man drank it  he liked it  it was good gin he was a connoisseur and he knew  indeed so good did it seem to him that he felt it would be a waste of opportunity not to have another twopenorth  therefore he had a second go maybe a third  then he returned to the cathedral and sat himself down with his notebook on his knee and waited  as the service proceeded there stole over him that spirit of indifference to all earthly surroundings that religion and drink are alone able to bestow  he heard the good bishops text and wrote it down  then he heard the bishops sixthly and lastly and took that down and looked at his notebook and wondered in a peaceful way what had become of the firstly to fifthly inclusive  he sat there wondering until the people round him began to get up and move away whereupon it struck him swiftly and suddenly that be had been asleep and had thereby escaped the main body of the discourse  what on earth was he to do  he was representing one of the leading religious papers  a full report of the sermon was wanted that very night  seizing the robe of a passing wandsman he tremulously inquired if the bishop had yet left the cathedral  the wandsman answered that he had not but that he was just on the point of doing so  i must see him before he goes exclaimed the reporter excitedly  you cant replied the wandsman  the journalist grew frantic  tell him he cried a penitent sinner desires to speak with him about the sermon he has just delivered  tomorrow it will be too late  the wandsman was touched so was the bishop  he said he would see the poor fellow  as soon as the door was shut the man with tears in his eyes told the bishop the truthleaving out the gin  he said that he was a poor man and not in good health that he had been up half the night before and had walked all the way from bow that evening  he dwelt on the disastrous results to himself and his family should he fail to obtain a report of the sermon  the bishop felt sorry for the man  also he was anxious that his sermon should be reported  well i trust it will be a warning to you against going to sleep in church he said with an indulgent smile  luckily i have brought my notes with me and if you will promise to be very careful of them and to bring them back to me the first thing in the morning i will lend them to you  with this the bishop opened and handed to the man a neat little black leather bag inside which lay a neat little roll of manuscript  better take the bag to keep it in added the bishop  be sure and let me have them both back early tomorrow  the reporter when he examined the contents of the bag under a lamp in the cathedral vestibule could hardly believe his good fortune  the careful bishops notes were so full and clear that for all practical purposes they were equal to a report  his work was already done  he felt so pleased with himself that he determined to treat himself to another two of gin and with this intent made his way across to the little public beforementioned  its really excellent gin you sell here he said to the barmaid when he had finished i think my dear ill have just one more  at eleven the landlord gently but firmly insisted on his leaving and he went assisted as far as the end of the court by the potboy  after he was gone the landlord noticed a neat little black bag on the seat where he had been lying  examining it closely he discovered a brass plate between the handles and upon the brass plate were engraved the owners name and title  opening the bag the landlord saw a neat little roll of manuscript and across a corner of the manuscript was written the bishops name and address  the landlord blew a long low whistle and stood with his round eyes wide open gazing down at the open bag  then he put on his hat and coat and taking the bag went out down the court chuckling hugely as he walked he went straight to the house of the resident canon and rang the bell  tell mr  he said to the servant that i must see him tonight  i wouldnt disturb him at this late hour if it wasnt something very important  the landlord was ushered up  closing the door softly behind him he coughed deferentially  well mr peters i will call him peters said the canon what is it  well sir said mr peters slowly and deliberately its about that there lease o mine  i do hope you gentlemen will see your way to makin it twentyone year instead o fourteen  god bless the man cried the canon jumping up indignantly you dont mean to say youve come to me at eleven oclock on a sunday night to talk about your lease  well not entirely sir answered peters unabashed theres another little thing i wished to speak to you about and thats thissaying which he laid the bishops bag before the canon and told his story  the canon looked at mr peters and mr peters looked at the canon  there must be some mistake said the canon  theres no mistake said the landlord  i had my suspicions when i first clapped eyes on him  i seed he wasnt our usual sort and i seed how he tried to hide his face  if he werent the bishop then i dont know a bishop when i sees one thats all  besides theres his bag and theres his sermon  mr peters folded his arms and waited  the canon pondered  such things had been known to happen before in church history  why not again  does any one know of this besides yourself asked the canon  not a livin soul replied mr peters as yet  i thinki think mr peters said the canon that we may be able to extend your lease to twentyone years  thank you kindly sir said the landlord and departed  next morning the canon waited on the bishop and laid the bag before him  oh said the bishop cheerfully hes sent it back by you has he  he has sir replied the canon and thankful i am that it was to me he brought it  it is right continued the canon that i should inform your lordship that i am aware of the circumstances under which it left your hands  the canons eye was severe and the bishop laughed uneasily  i suppose it wasnt quite the thing for me to do he answered apologetically but there alls well that ends well and the bishop laughed  this stung the canon  oh sir he exclaimed with a burst of fervour in heavens namefor the sake of our church let me entreatlet me pray you never to let such a thing occur again  the bishop turned upon him angrily  why what a fuss you make about a little thing he cried then seeing the look of agony upon the others face he paused  how did you get that bag he asked  the landlord of the cross keys brought it me answered the canon you left it there last night  the bishop gave a gasp and sat down heavily  when he recovered his breath he told the canon the real history of the case and the canon is still trying to believe it
