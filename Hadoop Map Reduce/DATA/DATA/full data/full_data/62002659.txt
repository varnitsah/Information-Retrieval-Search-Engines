 yours mother with such an influx of daughtersinlaw  i suspect the daughtersinlaw think themselves more to be pitied  as too many suns in one sphere  as daughtersinlaw at all  theres a ready cure for that  eh charlie  the sight of the motherinlaw  safe up on the shelf  ha you flattering boys  well each of the three bridegrooms has severally told us that his bride was a strong likeness of the mother so she will have the advantage of three mirrors  ay and each married solely for her benefit  i wonder which is the truest  come baby charles dont you take to being cynical and satirical said the mother  it would be more to the purpose to consider of the bringing them home  let me see raymond and his cecil will be at holfords gate at 530  they must have the carriage in full state  i suppose brewer knows  trust the ringers for scenting it out  julius and rosamond by the down train at willansborough at 450 one of you must drive old snapdragon in the van for them  they will not mind when they understand but theres that poor wife of miless i wish she could have come a few days earlier  her friend mrs johnson is to drop her by the express at backsworth at 330  inconvenient woman  i

 one of you must run down by train meet her and either bring her home in a fly or wait to be picked up by raymonds train  take her miless letter  the two young men glanced at one another in dismay and the elder said wouldnt nurse do better  no no frank said the younger catching a distressed look on their mothers face ill look up miless little african  ive rather a curiosity that way  only dont let them start the bells under the impression that we are a pair of the victims  if so i shall bolt  julius must be the nearest bolting said frank  how he accomplished it passes my comprehension  i shall not believe in it till i see him  there then ill give orders  barouche for the squire van for the rector and the rattling fly for the sailors wife  so wags the course of human life chanted frank charnock as he strolled out of the room  thanks charlie whispered his mother  i am grieved for that poor young thing  i wish i could go myself  and charlie would you cast an eye round and see how things look in their rooms  you have always been my daughter  ah my vocation is gone  three in one day  i wonder which is the best of the lot  i bet upon miless cape gooseberrytired mother darling  shall i send in nurse  i must be off if i am to catch the 1230 train  he bent to kiss the face which was too delicately shaped and tinted to look old enough to be in expectation of three daughtersinlaw no prostrate as she was upon pillows mrs charnock poynsett did not look as if she had attained fifty years  she was lady of compton poynsett in her own right and had been so early married and widowed as to have been the most efficient parental influence her five sons had ever known and their beautiful young mother had been the object of their adoration from the nursery upwards so that she laughed at people who talked of the trouble and anxiety of rearing sons  they had all taken their cue from their senior who had always been more to his mother than all the world besides  for several years he being as old of his age as she was young mr and mrs charnock poynsett with scarcely eighteen years between their ages had often been taken by strangers for husband and wife rather than son and mother  and though she knew she ought to wish for his marriage she could not but be secretly relieved that there were no symptoms of any such went impending  at last during the first spring after raymond charnock poynsett esquire had been elected member for the little borough of willansborough his mother while riding with her two youngest boys met with an accident so severe that in two years she had never quitted the morningroom whither she had at first been carried she was daily lifted to a couch but she could endure no further motion though her general health had become good and her cheerfulness made her room pleasant to her sons when the rest of the house was very dreary to them  raymond always the home son would never have absented himself but for his parliamentary duties and vibrated between london and home until when his mother had settled into a condition that seemed likely to be permanent and his two youngest brothers were at home reading each for his examination the one for a government clerkship the other for the army he yielded to the general recommendation and set out for a journey on the continent  a few weeks later came the electrifying news of his engagement to his second cousin cecil charnock  it was precisely the most obvious and suitable of connections  she was the only child of the head of the family of which his father had been a cadet and there were complications of inheritance thus happily disposed of  mrs poynsett had not seen her since her earliest childhood but she was known to have been educated with elaborate care and had been taken to the continent as the completion of her education and there raymond had met her and sped so rapidly with his wooing that he had been married at venice just four weeks previously  somewhat less recent was the wedding of the second son commander miles charnock  the younger sons bore their patronymic alone his ship had been stationed at the cape and there on a hunting expedition up the country he had been detained by a severe illness at a settlers house and this had resulted in his marrying the eldest daughter anne fraser  she had spent some months at simons bay while his ship was there and when he found himself under orders for the eastern coast of africa she would fain have awaited him at glen fraser but he preferred sending her home to fulfil the mission of daughterhood to his own mother  the passage had been long and unfavourable and the consequences to her had been so serious that when she landed she could not travel until after a few days rest  the marriage of the third son had been a much greater surprise compton poynsett was not a family living but the patron hearing of julius charnock as a hardworking curate in a distant seaport wrote to offer it to him and the same letter to mrs poynsett to offer it to him and the same letter to mrs poynsett which conveyed this gratifying intelligence also informed her of his having proposed to the daughter of the commanding officer of the regiment stationed at the town where lay his present charge  her father enjoyed the barren honours of the earldom of rathforlane an unimprovable estate in a remote corner of ireland burthened with successive families of numerous daughters so that he was forced to continue in the service and the marriage had been hastened by the embarkation of the regiment for india only two days later  the rectory had however been found in such a state of dilapidation that demolition was the only cure and thus the reverend julius and lady rosamond charnock were to begin their married life in the family home  the two youngest sons francis and charles stood on the other side of a gap made by the loss of two infants and were only twentyone and nineteen  frank had passed through oxford with credit and had been promised a government office while charles was intended for the army and both had been reading with a tutor who lived at willansborough and was continually employed in cramming being reported of as the best coach in the country  charlie however had passed a week previously and was to repair to sandhurst in another fortnight  at halfpast four there was a light tap at mrs poynsetts door and charlie announced heres the first mother as he brought in a graycloaked figure and mrs poynsett took a trembling hand and bestowed a kiss on a cheek which had languor and exhaustion in the very touch  she was tired to death mother said charlie so we did not wait for the train  quite right and as the newcomer sank into the chair he offered my dear you are sadly knocked up  you were hardly fit to come  thank you i am quite well answered the fagged timid voice  hark as the crash of a peal of bells came up  dear child you will like to rest before any fresh introductions  you shall go to your room and have some tea there  thank you  charlie call susanshe is my boys old nurse now mine  only tell me you have good accounts from my boy miles  oh yes and the hand tightly clasped the closelywritten letter for which the mothers eyes felt hungry  he sent you his love and he will write to you next time  he was so busy his first lieutenant was down in fever  where was he  off zanzibarotherwise the crew was healthythe 12th of august she answered squeezing out the sentences as if constrained by the mothers anxious gaze  and he was quite well when you parted with him  quite  ah you nursed my boy and we must nurse you for him  thank you i am quite well  but she bit her lip and spoke constrainedly as if too shy and reserved to give way to the rush of emotion but the coldness pained mrs poynsett whose expansiveness was easily checked and a brief silence was followed by charlies return to report that he could not find nurse and thought she was out with the other servants watching for the arrival in another moment the approaching cheers caused him to rush out and after many more noises showing the excitement of the multitude and the advance of the bridal pair during which mrs poynsett lay with deepening colour and clasped hands her nostrils dilating with anxiety and suppressed eagerness there entered a tall dark sunburnt man bringing on his arm a little trim upright girlish figure and bending down he exclaimed there mother ive brought herheres your daughter  two little gloved hands were put into hers and a kiss exchanged while raymond anxiously inquired for his mothers health and she broke in by saying and here is annemiless anne just arrived  ah i did not see you in the dark said raymond  there cecil is a sister for youyou never had one  cecil was readier with greeting hand and cheek than was anne but at the same moment the tea equipage was brought in and cecil quite naturally and as a matter of course began to preside over the low table while raymond took his accustomed chair on the further side of his mothers sofa where he could lean over the arm and study her countenance while she fondled the hand that he had hung over the back  he was describing the welcome at the station and all through the villagethe triumphal arches and shouts  but how they did miss you mother said charlie  old gurnet wrung my hand in tears as he said yes sir tis very fine but it beats the heart out of it that madam baint here to see  good old gurnet responded raymond  they are famously loyal the j c p crowned all above all the cs and rs i was happy to see  j was for juliusnot julia said the mother  no j h c and r c had a separate device of roses all to themselves  hark is that a cheer beginning again  had we not better go into the drawingroom mother it will be so many for you all together  oh no i must see you all  the brothers hurried out with their welcome and in another minute a plump soft cheek was pressed to the mothers devouring kisses were hailed on her and a fuller sweeter tone than had yet been heard answered the welcome  thank you  so kind  heres julius  ill not be in your way  dearest mother how is it with you as her son embraced her rose has been longing to be with you  and weve all come together  how delicious cried rosamond enfolding anne in her embrace i didnt know you were comesee julius  but as julius turned a startled look came over annes face and she turned so white that rosamond exclaimed my dearwhatshes faint  and while cecil stood looking puzzled rosamond had her arm round the trembling form and disappeared with her guided and assisted by nurse susan  isnt she exclaimed julius in a voice of triumph that made all smile  full of sweet kindness said mrs poynsett but i have only seen and heard her yet my dear julius  susan will take her to her room my old one  oh thank you mother said julius but i hardly like that it seems like your giving it up  on the contrary it proves that i do not give it up since i put in temporary lodgers like younow cecil is housed as you preferred raymondin the wainscotrooms  and where have you put that poor mrs miles asked raymond  she looks quite knocked up  yes she has been very ill on the voyage and waited at southampton to gather strength for the journeyi am so grateful to your good rose juliuswhy where is the boy  vanished in her wake i declare  his venerable head is quite turned said frank  i had to get inside alone and let them drive home outside together to avoid separation  raymond repeated his question as to the quarters of miless wife  i had the old schoolroom and the bedroom adjoining newly fitted up answered mrs poynsett  jenny bowater was here yesterday and gave the finishing touches  she tells me the rooms look very nice cecil my dear you must excuse deficiencies i shall look to you in future  i hope to manage well said cecil  had i not better go up now will you show me the way raymond  the mother and her two younger sons remained  havent i brought you home a splendid article was franks exclamation  julius has got the best of it  i back my cape gooseberry returned charles  she has eyes and hair and skin that my lady cant match and is a fine figure of a woman besides  much you know of rosamonds eyes  or you either boxed up in the van  any way they have made roast meat of his reverences heart  the other two take it much more easily  shes a mere chicken said charlie  who would have thought of raymond being caught by a callow nestling  and so uncommonly cool added frank  it would take much to transform raymond interposed the mother now boys away with you i must have a little quiet to repair myself for company after dinner  charlie settled her cushions with womanly skill and followed his brother  well frank which is the white cat  ah i thought so shes yet to come  not one is fit to hold a candle to her  you saw that as plain as i did charlie eleonora beats them all  ah youre not the youngest brother remember  it was he who brought her home at last  come you need not knock me down i shall never see any one to surpass the mother and ill have no one till i do     chapter ii the population of compton poynsett   he wanted a wife his braw hoose to keep but favour wi wooin was fashous to seeklaird o cockpen  in the bright lamplight of the diningtable the new population first fully beheld one another and understood one anothers looks  there was much family resemblance between the five brothers  all were wellgrown wellmade men strong and agile the countenance pleasing rather square of mould eyebrows straight and thick nose well cut and short chin firm and resolutelooking and the complexion very dark in raymond frank and the absent miles franks eyes were soft brown rather pensive and absent in expression but raymonds were much deeper and darker and had a steadfast gravity that made him be viewed as formidable especially as he had lost all the youthful glow of colouring that mantled in his brothers olive cheek and he had a short thick curly brown beard while frank had only attained to a black moustache that might almost have been drawn on his lip with charcoal  charlie was an exceptionfair blueeyed rosy and with a soft feminine contour of visage which had often drawn on him reproaches for not being really the daughter all his mothers friends desired for her  and julius with the outlines of the others was albino with transparent skin mantling with colour that contrasted with his snowy hair eyebrows and the lashes veiling eyes of a curious coral hue really not unpleasing under their thick white fringes but most inconveniently short of sight although capable of much work in fact he was a curiously perfect pinkandwhite edition of his dark and bronzed brother the sailor  the dark eyes came from the fathers side cecil had them and very observing orbs they seemed to be travelling about from one face to another and into every corner of the room scrutinizing every picture or piece of plate and trying to see into the conservatory which had a glass door opening from one end of the room  she was the youngest of the brides and her features and form seemed hardly developed nor had she attained the air of a matron her fashionable dress of crisp white worked muslin with blue trimmings and blue ribbons in her brown hair only gave her the air of a young girl at her first party in spite of her freedom from all shyness as she sat at the head of the table in contented selfpossession her little slender figure as upright as a perfect spine could make it  very different was the bride on raymonds right hand  she was of middle height soft round and plump carrying her head a little tenderly on one side with a delightful degagee kind of ease and air of vivacious indolence  her complexion was creamy and colourless her nose rather retrousse her lips full and parting in a delicious roguish smile answering to the sleepily twinkling eyes whose irides seemed to shade so imperceptibly into the palest gray that there was no telling where the pupils ended especially as the lids were habitually half closed as if weighed down by the black length of their borders  the habit of arching up one or other of the eyebrows in surprise or interrogation gave a drollery to the otherwise nonchalant sweetness of the countenance  the mass of raven black hair was only adorned by a crimson ribbon beneath which it had been thrust into a net with a long thing that had once been a curl on the shoulder of the white tumbled bodice worn over a gray skirt which looked as if it had done solitary duty for the five weeks since the marriage and was but slightly relieved by a crimson sash  rosamond made some apology when she saw cecils dainty equipment dressed you correct little thing  you put me to shame but i had no notion which box my evening things are in and it would have been serious to irritate the whole concern  and she was some time with anne added julius  ah with my good will anne should not have been here rejoined rosamond  didnt i meet old mrs nurse at your threshold with an invitation from mrs poynsett to dine with her in her room and didnt we find the bird flown at the first stroke of the gong  oh i am very well repeated anne  yet she was far more colourless than julius for her complexion was not only faded by sickness but was naturally of the whitest blonde tint the simple coils of her hair lint white and her eyes of the lightest tint of pure blue  the features were of scottish type all the more so from being exaggerated by recent illness but they were handsome enough to show that she must have been a bonnie lassie when her good looks were unimpaired  her figure far surpassed in height that of both the other ladies and was very slender bending with languor and fatigue in spite of her strenuous attempts to straighten it  she was clad in a perfectly plain almost quakerlooking light dovecoloured silk dress fitting closely and unrelieved by any ribbon or ornament of any description so that her whole appearance suggested nothing but the words washed out  it was clear that to let her alone was merciful and there was no lack of mutual communications among the rest  frank and charlie gave their account of the condition of the game  do you let your tenants shoot rabbits exclaimed cecil as if scandalized  we never do at dunstone  it prevents an immense amount of discontent and illwill and underhand work said raymond  my father never will listen to any nonsense about rabbits proceeded cecil  if you once begin there is no end to it they are sure to encroach  he just sends them a basket of game at the beginning and end of the season  by the bye said raymond i hope ours have all been sent out as usual  i can answer for a splendid one at our wedding breakfast said rosamond  the messman who came to help was lost in admiration did you breakfast on ortolans cecil  or on nightingales tongues added charlie  you might as well say fatted dormice and snails said frank  one would think the event had been eighteen hundred years ago  poor frank hes stuffed so hard that it is bursting out at all his pores exclaimed charlie  ah you have the advantage of your elder master charles said raymond with a paternal sound of approbation  till next time said frank  now thank goodness mine is once for all  the conversation drifted away to venice and the homeward journey which raymond and cecil seemed to have spent in unremitting sight seeing  the quantities of mountains cathedrals and pictures they had inspected was quite appalling  how hard you must have worked exclaimed rosamond  had you never a days rest out of the thirty  had we cecil  i believe not said raymond  sundays gasped annes low voice at his elbow  indeed triumphantly returned cecil between english service and high mass and benediction and the public gardens and listening to the band we had not a single blank sunday  anne started and looked aghast and raymond said the opportunity was not to be wasted and cecil enjoyed everything with unwearied vigour  why what else should we have done  it would have been very dull and stupid to have stayed in together said cecil with a world of innocent wonder in her eyes  then turning to her neighbour surely julius you went about and saw things  the sea at filey bridge and the church congress at leeds he answered smiling  very shocking is it not cecil said rosamond with mock gravity but he must be forgiven for he was tired to death  i used to think for my part that lovers were a sort of mild lunatics never to be troubled or trusted with any earthly thing but thats one of the things modern times have changed  as he was to be going all the clerical staff of st awdrys must needs have their holiday and leave him to do their work indeed one was sent off here  for six weeks i never saw him except when he used to rush in to say he couldnt stay and when at last we were safe in the coupe he fairly went to sleep before we got to the first stationhush you know you did  and no wonder for he had been up two nights with some sort of infidel who was supposed to be dying  then that first week at filey he used to bring out his poetry books as the proper sort of thing and try to read them to me on the sands  but by the time he had got to the bottom of a page i used to hear the words dragging out slower and slower  whereon thelilymaidofastolat laysmilinglikeastarfishfastasleep  wherewith rosamond dropped her head and closed her eyes while the brothers shouted with mirth except frank whose countenance was of one hurt on a vulnerable side  disrespect to elaine  eh frank said charlie how many pegs has julius gone down in your estimation  frank would not commit himself but he was evidently at the era of sensitiveness on the poetical side  cecil spoke for him  how very provoking  what did you do to him rosamond  i kept off the sandflies  i cant say but i was glad of a little rest for i had been packing up for the whole family for ten days past with interludes of rushing out into the town for whatever we had not forgotten the shops had not sent home  oh what a paradise of quiet it was under the rocks at fileywasnt it julius  we will go there again next time we have a chance said julius looking blissful  i would never go again to the same place cried cecil  thats not the way to acquire new ideas  we are too old to acquire new ideas my dear drawled rosamond sleepily  what did you go to the church congress for asked charlie  i hope julius was awake by that time said frank  not if we are to have all the new ideas tried on us said raymond dryly  i went to a congress once exclaimed cecil  indeed said her husband surprised  yes  we thought we ought to encourage them  it was the congress of sundayschool managers for our archdeaconry  did you acquire any new ideas asked frank while rosamonds very eyelashes seemed to curl with suppressed diversion  oh yes  we explained our system of tickets and the archdeacon said it was a very good one and ought to be adopted everywhere  this mode of acquisition of new ideas was quite too much for julius and charlie who both exploded but frank retained composure enough to ask did you explain it in person  no  we made mr venn  the schoolmaster said julius  no  he is our clergyman and he always does as we tell him and so dunstone is quite the model parish of the archdeaconry  julius could not help making an odd little bend of the head half deferential half satirical and raymond said cecil i believe it rests with you to make the move  an ingenuous girlish blush mantled on her cheek as she looked towards rosamond and moved  the drawingroom adjoined the diningroom and likewise had a glass door leading into the conservatory but this like the other windows was concealed by the paleblue damask curtains that descended from cornices gilded like the legs of the substantial chairs and sofas  there was however no lack of modern light cane and basket seats round the fire and it looked cheery and comfortable  rosamond put an arm round annes waistpoor tired dear come and lie on the sofa  oh no i couldnt  the gentlemen will come in  all brothers  what will you only be satisfied with an easychair a charming room and a charming fire  not so nice as a library said cecil stabbing the fire with the poker as a sort of act of possession  we always sit in the library at dunstone  state rooms are horrid  this only wants to be littered down said rosamond  thats my first task in fresh quarters banishing some things and upsetting the rest and strewing our own about judiciously  there are the inevitable waxflowers  i have regular blarney about their being so lovely that it would just go to my heart to expose them to the boys  you have always been on the move said cecil who was standing by the table examining the ornaments  you may say so there are not many of her majestys garrisons that i have not had experience of except my native country that i wasnt born in  it was very mean of them never once to send us to ireland  where were you born said cecil neither of the two catching at the bull which perhaps rosamond had allowed to escape by way of trying them  at plymouth  dick and i were both born at plymouth and maurice at scutari then we were in the west indies the next two were born all up and down in jamaica and all the rest of the islandstom and terrydear boys ive got the charge of them now they are left at school  three more are canadians and little nora is the only irishborn one amongst us  i thought you said you had never been in ireland  never quartered there but on visits at rathforlane said rosamond  our ten years at home we have been up and down the world till at last you see ive ended where i beganat plymouth  oh what a lovely florentine mosaic exclaimed cecil who had taken but slight interest in this itinerary  it is just like a weight at dunstone  then opening a miniaturecase who is this mrs poynsett when she was young  most likely said rosamond  it is like her now and very like charlie  yes  charles is quite unlike the family  what family said rosamond  the charnocks of course  raymond is a perfect charnock  a vast advantage murmured rosamond  of course said cecil taking it quite seriously  no one else could be the same thing to us  papa said there was not a match in the whole world that could have gratified him so much  how old are you cecil quoth rosamond with a ripple in her voice  oh his age was no matter  i dont like young men  thats not the drawback no it is that horrid poynsett at the end of the name  you see you had better have waived your objections to youth and taken a younger son  i couldnt said this naive young person  besides there is much more of a field for me here than at dunstone since papas marriage  whatever rosamond had on the tip of her tongue was averted by the entrance of the three younger brothers  julius seated himself beside her in the cushioned fireside corner and cecil asked where raymond was  just stepped in to see my mother said frank  this room opens into hers  will you come to them  not yet said cecil  i want you to tell me about the neighbourhood  just what i want said rosamond  whenever i ask julius always says theres dr easterby  frank and charlie burst out laughing  dr easterby is one of the greatest men in the english church said julius  precisely  but what is the regiment at backsworth and as charlie named it oh what fun  thats where laurie cookson exchanged  he will be sure to send us cards for everything  at dunstone we never used to go to garrison gaieties said cecil gravely  oh  im a military pariah said rosamond hastily  who are the landowners continued cecil  there was a place i saw from the line but raymond didnt hear when i asked whose it was  close to the station i mean  that is sirenwood said charles  sir harry vivians  he is just come back there with his two daughters  i thought emily vivian was dead said julius  you dont mean that women  that woman laughed his wife  what has she done to be a that woman  offended his reverence said frank in that sort of jocose tone which betrays annoyance  a heartless mischievous woman said julius  rosamond cocked up her left eyebrow with an ineffably droll look which encouraged charlie to say such fierceness can only be prompted by personal experience  look out rosamond  come fess julius said she merrily  fess and make it up  ii have nothing to confess said julius seriously  hasnt he indeed said she looking at the brothers  oh dont ask us said charlie  his youthful indiscretions were over long before our eyes had risen above the horizon  do you mean that they have really come home to live here demanded julius with singular indifference to the personal insinuations  i am sorry it is so painful to you said i frank somewhat ironically but sir harry thinks it right to return and end his days among his own people  is he ill then  i cant gratify you so far returned frank he is a fine old fellow of sixtyfive  just what humbugging papers call a regular specimen of an old english gentleman he added to cecil  humbugging indeed i should hope muttered julius  the old english gentleman has reason to complain  theres the charity of the clergy exclaimed frank  no forgiveness for a man who has spent a little in his youth  as an essential of the old english gentleman asked julius  at any rate the poor old fellow has been punished enough said charlie  but what is it  tell me all about it said cecil  i am sure my father would not wish me to associate with dissipated people  ah  cecil said rosamond  youll have to take refuge with the military after all  it is just this said charlie  sir harry and his only son were always extravagant one as bad as the otherwerent they julius phil bowater told me all about it and how tom vivian lost fifteen thousand pounds one derby day and was found dead in his chambers the next morning they said from an overdose of chloroform for neuralgia  then the estate was so dipped that sir harry had to give up the estate to his creditors and live on an allowance abroad or at wateringplaces till now when he has managed to come home  that is to say the house is really leased to lady tyrrell and he is in a measure her guestvery queer it must be for him in his own house  is lady tyrrell that woman asked rosamond  i conclude so said charlie  she was the eldest daughter and married lord tyrrell who died about two years ago  she has no children so she has taken the family in charge patches up sir harrys affairs with her jointure and chaperons her sister  what is she like  ask frank said charlie slyly  no said frank with dignity  i shall say no more i only excite prejudice  you are right frank said julius who had evidently recovered from the shock  it is not fair to judge people now from what they were eleven years ago  they have had some terrible lessons and may be much changed  ay said frank and they have been living in an atmosphere congenial to you at rockpier and are hand and glove with all the st chrysostom folk there  what do you say to that julius  i can tell you they are enchanted with your curate  they are not in this parish  no but they turn up herethe ladies at leastat all the services at odd times that bindon has begun with  ah by the bye is herbert bowater come  yes the whole family came over to his installation in mrs hornblowers lodgings  i saw him this morning poor old herbs added frank looking uncommonly as if he felt himself in a strait waistcoat  what are there two curates demanded cecil in a tone of reprobation  julius made a gesture of assent with a certain humorous air of deprecation which however was lost upon her  we never let mr venn have one continued cecil except one winter when he was ill and then not a young one  papa says idle young clergymen are not to be encouraged  i am entirely of mr charnocks opinion  but if i have exceeded the dunstone standard it was not willingly  herbert bowater is the son of some old friends of my mothers who wanted to keep their son near home and made it their request that i would give him a title  and the bowaters are the great feature in the neighbourhood added frank  herbert tells me there are wonderful designs for entertaining the brides  what do they consist of asked rosamond  all the component parts of a family said frank  the eldest daughter is a sort of sheetanchor to my mother as well as her own the eldest son is at home now  he is in the army  in the light dragoons asked rosamond  oh then i knew him at edinburgh  a man with yellow whiskers and the next thing to a stutter  i declare julius she is as good as any army list exclaimed charlie  theres praise cried frank  the army list is his one book what a piece of luck to have you to coach him up in it  i dare say rosamond can tell me lots of wrinkles for my outfit said charles  i should hope so having rigged out dick for the line and maurice for the artillery  charlie came and leant on the mantelshelf and commenced a conversation sotto voce on the subject nearest his heart while cecil continued her catechism  are the bowaters intellectual  jenny is very well read said julius a very sensible person  yes said frank she was the only person here that so much as tried to read browning  but if cecil wants intellect she had better take to the duncombes the queerest firm i ever fell in with he makes the turf a regular profession actually gets a livelihood out of his bettingbook and she is in the strongminded line womans rights and all the rest of it  we never had such people at dunstone said cecil  papa always said that the evil of being in parliament was the having to be civil to everybody  just then raymond came back with intelligence that his mother was about to go to bed and to call his wife to wish her good night all went in succession to do the same  my dear she said to anne i hoped you were in bed  i thought i would wait for family worship  i am afraid we dont have prayers at night my dear  we must resume them in the morning now raymond and julius are come  poor anne looked all the whiter and only mumbled out a few answers to the kind counsels lavished upon her  mrs poynsett was left to think over her daughtersinlaw  lady rosamond did not occupy her much  there was evidently plenty of good strong love between her and her husband and though her training might not have been the best for a clergymans wife there was substance enough in both to shake down together in time  but it was raymond who made her uneasyraymond who ever since his fathers death had been more than all her other sons to her  she had armed herself against the pang of not being first with him and now she was full of vague anxiety at the sense that she still held her old position  had he not sat all the evening in his own place by her sofa as if it were the very kernel of home and of repose and whenever a sense of duty prompted her to suggest fetching his wife had he not lingered and gone on talking  it was indeed of cecil but how would she have liked his father at the honeymoons end to prefer talking of her to talking with her  she has been most carefully brought up and is very intelligent and industrious said raymond  his mother could not help wondering whether a roman son might not thus have described a highly accomplished greek slave just brought home for his mothers use     chapter iii parish explorations      a cry more tuneable was never hollad to nor cheerd with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly judge when you hearbut soft what nymphs are these midsummer nights dream  it was quite true that cecil charnock poynsett was a very intelligent industrious creature very carefully brought upnay if possible a little too much so  a little wholesome neglect had been lacking  the only child of her parents who had lived to see a second birthday was sure to be the centre of solicitude  she had not been spoilt in the usual acceptation of the word for she had no liberty fewer indulgences and luxuries than many children and never was permitted to be naughty but then she was quite aware that each dainty or each pleasure was granted or withheld from a careful consideration of her welfare and that nothing came by chance with her  and on her rare ebullitions of selfwill mamma governess nurse nay even papa were all in sorrowful commotion till their princess had been brought to a sense of the enormity of her fault  she lost her mother at fourteen but the same anxious training was carried on by her father and after three years he married her mothers most intimate friend avowedly that the perfect system might be continued  cecils gaieties as a comeout young lady were selected on the same judicious principles as her childish diversions and if ever the dunstone family favoured an entertainment not to their taste it was after a debate on the need of condescension and goodnature  she had however never had a season in londona place her father hated but she was taken abroad as soon as she was deemed old enough thoroughly to appreciate what she was to see there and in switzerland her cousin raymond who had at different times visited dunstone overtook the party and ere long made his proposals  he was the very man to whom two or three centuries ago mr charnock would have betrothed the heiress in her infancy and cecil had never liked any one so well feeling that her destiny came to a proper culmination in bestowing her hand on the most eligible charnock an mp and just a step above her father in rank and influence  her stepmother was under orders to spend the winter in italy and the wedding had therefore taken place in venice so that cecil might finish her journey as a wife  she had been very happy and fully occupied raymond being younger and stronger than her parents was more competent to escort her to every height or depth to which she wished to go hunted up information for her and was her most obedient servant only resisting any prolongation of the journey beyond the legitimate four weeks nor indeed had cecil been desirous of deferring her introduction to her new sphere  there she stood her hair and pretty parisian winter dress arranged to perfection contemplating with approval the sittingroom that had been appropriated to her the october sunshine lighting up the many tinted trees around the smoothshaven dewy lawn and a bright fire on the hearth shelves and chiffoniers awaiting her property and piles of parcels suggestive of wedding presents awaiting her hand she was standing at the table turning out her travellingbag with the comfortable sensation that it was not to be immediately re packed and had just disinterred a whole library of notebooks when her husband opened the door  i believe jenkins is waiting for your appearance to bring in the urn my dear  im coming but surely there ought to be a bell or gong to assemble the family  it might disturb my mother  what sleep she gets is in the morning i never go to her till eleven oclock unless i am going out for the day  and what will she want me to do for her asked cecil glancing at her empty shelves  a womans tact will soon find out  all i wish is that she should be your first object  it was a much larger all than could be realized by the son whose happiest moments had been spent in devotion to her and who thought the motherless girl must rejoice doubly in such a mother  but i am free till eleven said cecil  free always i hope he returned with a shade of vexation therewith they descended the broad stairs into the panelled hall where a great fire was blazing on the hearth and rosamond and the two young brothers were standing chatting merrily before it  julius she said had his primary sermon heavy on his mind and had risen before day to attack it and she sped away to summon him from mrs poynsetts beautiful old dressingroom where he sat writing amid all the old associations  anne was discovered hanging over the diningroom fire looking whiter and more exhausted than the night before having indeed been the first to come downstairs  she was rebuked for fatiguing herself and again murmured something about family worship  we must begin tomorrow said raymond  we have got a chaplain now  julius however on entering excused himself saying that after sunday he should be at matins at nine oclock whereupon anne looked at him in mute astonishment  raymond feeling that he ought to cultivate the solitary sisterin law began asking about miles but unlike the typical colonist she was very silent and her replies were monosyllabic till rosamond created a diversion by talking to frank and then raymond elicited that glen fraser was far up the countryking williamstown nearer than any other town  they had sent thither for a doctor for miles and he stayed one night but said that mothers treatment was quite right and as it was thirty miles off he did not come again  thirty miles what sort of roads  not bad for wagons  it only took two days to get there if the river was not in flood  had she not been married there  yes they all rode in thither for the purpose  was it the nearest church then  there was one only nine miles off to which papa went when there was serviceone sunday in three for he is an episcopalian you know  and not your mother asked cecil  i dont think she was at home said anne  then had you a presbyterian kirk asked cecil remembering that in scotland gentle blood and anglicanism did not go together as uniformly as she believed them to do in england  there was one at schneyders kloof but that was dutch  then did you go nowhere asked cecil  there was mr pilgrims  a clergyman  no a settler  he used to pray and expound every sunday  what does he call himself said cecil growing more severe  i dont know said anne  he gathers together a little flock of all denominations who only care to hear the word  such a voice in the wilderness as often does good service said julius with a perception that the side with which he least agreed best deserved support  he and rosamond were bent on a tour of parochial inspection as were raymond and cecil on a more domestic one beginning with the gardens  cecil was the first lady downstairs all in claret colour trimmed with gray fur with a little fur and velvet cap upon her head  there it is a clear morning and you can see the view said raymond opening the hall door  very prettily undulating ground she said standing on the steps and looking over a somewhat rapid slope scattered with trees to the opposite side of the valley where a park with a red mansion in the midst gleamed out among woods of green red orange and brown tints  how you are shut in  that great spanish chestnut must be a perfect block when its leaves are out  my father would never let it stand so near the house  it is too near but it was planted at the birth of my mothers brother  who died  yes at seven years old  it was her first grief  then it would vex her if you cut it  raymond laughed  it is hers not mine  i forgot  there was a good deal in the tone but she added what is that place opposite  sirenwood  it belongs to sir harry vivian but he does not live there  yes he does said cecil  your brothers say he has come back with his two daughters  there is only one unmarried  there is a widow come to keep house for himlady tyrrell  very likely said raymond my mother only writes with difficulty so i hear little when i am from home  is it true that they are horrid people very dissipated and not fit for me to associate with  that is putting it strongly said raymond quietly  they are not likely to be very desirable acquaintances for you but there is no reason you should not associate with them on ordinary terms of courtesy  ah  i understandas members wife  i dont see what that has to do with it said raymond  ah rosamond as she came down in a galway cloak over her black velveteen on the way to view your domain  yes and yours she said nodding to cecil  you appreciate such english applepie order  it looks as if you never suffered a stray leaf to dance without an old woman to hunt it down  and whats that red house smiling across the valley  sirenwood repeated raymond then to julius he said did you know it was inhabited again  frank said so answered julius without further remark giving his arm to his wife who clasped both hands on it while the other couple looked on as if doubtful whether this were a trying duty incumbent on them  what is it all about said rosamond as they walked down the avenue of walnuts leading to the iron gates in the opposite direction from sirenwood  which of you was that womans victim was it a sailor love of miless  i hope not  that poor little african might not stand a gay ghost cropping up again  miles is far removed from the conventional sailor  then it is reduced to the grave raymond  i wish i had betrayed nothing  now you may as well proceed to betray the rest instead of leaving me to exercise my fancy  it is no secret only such things are best not brought up again camilla vivian was poor raymonds grande passion and you may imagine what a grief that was to my mother especially as the poor brother was then livingone of the most fascinating dangerous men i ever saw and the whole tone of the place was ultra gay and thoughtless the most reckless extravagance  however he was set upon it and my mother was forced to consent to the engagement  she seemed equally devoted to him till she met lord tyrrell at some country house and then a quarrel was picked either by her mother or herself about my mother retaining the headship of her own house it was a palpable excuse but it served to break the affair off and raymond was cruelly cut up  my mother made herself everything to him from that moment gave up all her former habits to be with him sent the little boys to school and fairly dragged him through the trouble  how long ago was it  ten yearsyes ten years  so far as ceasing to care a straw for a heartless woman like that he has got over it no doubt but it has made a graver man of him for life and i doubt whether but for my mothers accident he ever would have married  did you marry for your mothers sake julius or only tell her so  for shame my lady mischief  and do you think the fair camilla returned with plans that she finds disconcerted  how can i tell  i have not seen her since i was a lad of eighteenah how dye do betty in a tone of relief youve not seen my wife  this was the first of a long series of introductions  compton poynsett was a straggling village with the church schools and rectory ten minutes walk from the park gates  it had not been neglected so that julius had not the doubtful satisfaction of coming like a missionary or reformer  the church though not exactly as with his present lights he would have made it was in respectable order and contained hardly anything obnoxious to his taste the schools were well built properly officered and the children under such discipline that rosamond declared she could no more meddle with them than with her fathers regiment  the rectory was at that moment level with the ground and julius explaining the plans when up came the senior curate  mr bindon whom she as well as julius greeted as an old friend was the typical modern priest full of his work and caring for nothing besides except a swiss mountain once a year a slight spare small sallow man but with an enormous power of untiring energy  scarcely had rosamond shaken hands with him standing where her drawingroom rug was to be in future days when a merry whistle came near and over the wall from the churchyard leapt first a black retriever secondly a skye terrier thirdly a bull ditto fourthly a young man or rather an enormous boy who for a moment stood amazed and disconcerted at the unexpectedly worshipful society into which he had jumped  ha  herbert is that you laughed julius  i beg your pardon he breathlessly exclaimed  i was just taking the short cut  i had no ideahere mungo you ruffian as the skye was investigating lady rosamonds boot  oh i like him of all things  i am glad to welcome you to our future house as she held out her hand to the reverend herbert bowater the junior curate a deacon of a fortnights standing whose round open happy blue eyes ruddy cheeks merry lips and curly light hair did not seem in keeping with the rigidly straight collar and waistcoat and the long black coat at present plentifully streaked with green treemoss while his boots and trousers looked as if they had partaken of the mudbath which his dogs had evidently been wallowing in  off off were his words as he shook hands with his rectoress get away rollo with an energetic shove of the foot to the big dog who was about to shake his dripping coat for the ladies special benefit  i saw you arrive last evening he said in the conversational tone of a gentlemanly schoolboy didnt you find it very cold  not very  i did not see you though  he was organizing the cheers said mr bindon  you shone in that bowater  they kept such good time  you were very good to cheer us at all said julius coming in the wake of the squire as we did  the best of it was said the junior that charlie was so awfully afraid that he and poor miless wife would be taken for the squire that he dashed in on his way to warn me to choke them off  if she hadnt been ill i must have set the boys on for a lark  how is she though he asked in a really kind tone  she looks very ill poor thing said julius  here the bull terrier became assiduous in his attentions to rosamond and between his masters calls and apologies and her caresses and excuses not much more was heard till julius asked with mock gravity and are these all youve brought over herbert  yes all id half a mind to bring the two greyhounds but my father thought they would get into trouble in the preserves and there isnt room at mrs hornblowers place he answered with apologetic simplicity  what a pity durham has been reduced said mr bindon dryly  it would have been the right preferment for bowater  the bishop was obliged by statute to keep a pack of hounds  but sir expostulated the deacon turning to the rector colouring all over his honest rosy face you dont object  you know of course ive given up sport he added ruefully but only just as companionsaint you rollo he added almost with tears in his eyes and a hand on the smooth black head belonging to such a wise benignant face that rosamond was tempted to pronounce the dog the more clerical looking of the two  you are very welcome said julius laughing provided you can manage with the old womens cats  i should find such companions rather awkward in pastoral visits  ill teach them sir  you may depend on it  we did have a little flareup yesterday but i showed them the sense of it  you might teach those dogs anythingha what then tartar  halloo mungo rats rats rats  a prodigious scratching and snorting was audible in what had been a cellar of the quondam rectory and rollo becoming excited dashed up to the scene of action with a deep bass warcry while to rosamonds great amusement rats was no less a peal to rector and senior and for the next quarter of an hour the three clergymen moved bricks poked with their sticks and cheered on the chase till the church clock struck one the masons began to return from dinner and the sounds of the bell at the hall recalled the party to order  there rose  our first day said julius aghast  youd better come to lunch at my rooms said the young curate eagerly  do  mother has brought the jolliest hamper  gamepie and preserved magnumbonums and pears off the old jargonelle come lady rosamond docome along bindon  theres such a dish of damsoncheese  do  that do between insinuation and heartiness was so boyish that it was quite irresistible to the lady who consented eagerly while julius wrote a word or two on a card which he despatched to the hall by the first child he encountered  in a few minutes they reached the nice clean baywindowed room over the village shop comically like an undergraduates in spite of the mothers and sisters recent touches  there ensued a resolute quieting of the dogs and a vigorous exertion of hospitality necessitating some striding up and down stairs and much shouting to mrs hornblower and her little niece who rejoiced in the peculiar name of dilemma while rosamond petted tartar upon her lap and the two elder clergymen each with an elbow against the windowframe and a knee on the seat held council based on the rectors old knowledge of the territory and the curates recent observations during his five weeks sojourn  the plans to be put in force next week were arranged during the meal and the junior observed that he would walk home tonight and back on saturday evening since after that he should be tied pretty fast  and he started with julius and rosamond on their further progress soon however tumbling over another stone wall with all his dogs and being only heard hallooing to them as they yelped after the larks  that is a delicious boy said rosamond laughing merrily  a nice fellowbut we mustnt make it a custom to be always going in to partake of his hampers or we shall prey inordinately on mrs bowaters preserves  he was just like the hero of  oh i have a plumcake and a rare feast ill make  i do like a boy with a sweet tooth  like him  of course i do  the bowaters are like ones own kindred  i only hope i shall not spoil him  hasnt his mother done that for you  i wish he had spent a year or two at cuddesdon  i ought to have seen him before consenting to give him a title at once but his father and jenny wished it so much  ah come in here  bindon said lucy martin was a case for a lady  rosamonds hearty goodnature was much more at ease among ailing old women than prim schoolchildren and she gave great satisfaction in the cottages  julius did not of course come as a stranger and had a general impression as to names and families but he had been absent except on short visits for five years so that rosamond declared that this was a staple of his conversation  then it was tom deaneno it was john deane that married blakes sonno it was blakes daughter that died who is living in the next house  they finished with a long and miry lane lying along the valley and leading to the cottages of a little clan the chief of whom seemed to be a largeboned livelyeyed old dame who after minute inquiries after the lady poynsett went on and be it true master julius as that young gentleman of squire bowaters is one of your passons  julius admitted the fact  and be ye going to put he up in the pulpit to preach to we  pon my word of honour says i to sally when her telled i we shall have little dick out of the infantschool next  were all young betty  cant you put up with any one that is not older than yourself  im afraid he would hardly be able to get up the pulpit stair  the rectors reply delighted betty but she returned to the charge no no sir i be coming to hear ye next sunday  sally have turned my black bonnet a purpose  it be one of the lady poynsetts as her gave i when my old gentleman was took two years after the squire when bonnets was bonnets you know maam  now tell me true be ye to preach morning or arternoon sir  in the morning i hope betty  then ill be there master julius to the third seat from the front but it aint becoming for a woman of my age seventynine come christmas to sit under a slip of a lad as hasnt got the taste of the birch off his back  thats too bad betty broke in rosamond speaking out of conviction  mr bowater isnt so young as he looks and he was too good a boy ever to need the birch  all the wuss for he retorted the undaunted betty  spare the rod and spile the child  the village wit was left triumphant and julius proposed to return by a crossroad leading into the plantations  suddenly a scud of rain mixed with whirling yellow leaves sent them hurrying into a cartshed where with a sudden start they found themselves rushing in on some one  who was it  a girla young lady  that was evident as rosamond panted out i beg your pardon and the next moment there was the exclamation mr julius charnock  you dont remember me  eleonora vivian  miss vivian you have the advantage of me said julius a little stiffly  let me introduce my wife  the hands met and rosamond perceived in the failing light a very finelooking maiden with a superbly carried head and neck simply dressed in gray cloth  are you sheltering here or are you sketching she asked seeing some paper and drawing materials  i was giving a lesson  see exhibiting some bold outlines on large paper  does not my pupil do me credit  very spirited said rosamond  where is she  he is gone to fetch me his grandmothers umbrella  he is the little gurth of these parts  of whom you are making a giotto asked julius thawing a little  exactly i found him drawing on a barndoor with such zeal and spirit that i could not help offering him some lessons  only see does he not get on  i wish i could get him to the school of design  may i ask what becomes of his pigs demanded julius  dont you hear as sundry grunts and squeals of those eminently conversational animals were audible through the walls  they are driven home to this rickyard so here i meet the boy  who is he asked the rector  i only know that he answers to the name of joe  and here he comes as a boy about ten years old came lumbering up in big boots with a heavy plaid shawl on one arm and an immense green umbrella in the other  thank you joe  make your bow to the lady and gentleman  this was a pull of the flaxen forelock for joe was a slender pretty fair boy of that delicatelycomplexioned english type which is not roughened till after many years of exposure  thats right my man said julius kindly  what is your name  please sir joshua reynolds  instinct whispered rosamond  or influence of a name returned miss vivian  are you one of dan reynoldss boys or tims proceeded  no i bides with granny  julius made no further attempt at disentangling the pedigree but inquired about his employments  did he go to school  when there aint nothing to be done  and what can be done by such a mite asked rosamond  tell the lady said the rector what work can you do  birdstarving  well  and stoonpicking and cowherding and odd jobs up at farmer lights but they wont take i on for a carterboy not yet cause i beant not so lusty as some on em  have you learnt to read  oh yes very nicely interposed miss vivian  did you teach him said rosamond  no  he could read well before i came to the place  i have only been at home six weeks you know and i did not know i was poaching on your manor she added sotto voce to julius who could not but answer with warm thanks  it was discovered that the rain had set in for the night and an amicable contest ensued between the ladies as to shawl and umbrella each declaring her dress unspoilable till it ended in eleonora having the shawl and both agreeing to share the umbrella as far as the sirenwood lodge  however the umbrella refused to open and had to be given to the boy who set his teeth into an extraordinary grin and so dealt with the brazen gear as to expand a magnificent green vault with a lesser leathern arctic zone round the pole but when he had handed it to miss vivian and she had linked her arm in lady rosamonds it proved too mighty for her tugged like a restive horse and would fairly have run away with her but for rosamonds holding her fast  lost they cried  two ladies carried away by an umbrella  here julius no one can grapple with it but you called rosamond  i really think its alive panted eleonora drawn up to her tip toes before she could hand it to julius who with both clinging to his arm conducted them at last to the lodge where julius could only come in as far as it would let him since it could neither be let down nor left to itself to fly to unknown regions  a keeper with a more manageable article undertook to convey miss vivian home across the park and with a pleasant farewell husband and wife plodded their way home along paths the mud of which could not be seen only heard and felt and when rosamond in the light of the hall discovered the extent of the splashes she had to leave julius still contending with the umbrella and when in spite of the united efforts of the butler and footman it still refused to come down it was consigned to an empty coachhouse with orders that little joe should have a shilling to bring it down and fetch it home in the morning     chapter iv shades in sunshine   my friends would be angered    my minnie be madscots song  whom do you think we met mother said julius coming into her room so soon as he had made his evening toilette and finding there only his two younger brothers  no other than miss vivian  ah then broke in charlie you saw what jenkins calls the perfect picture of a woman  she is very handsome soberly returned julius  rose is quite delighted with her  do you know anything of her  jenny bowater was very fond of poor emily rejoined the mother i believe that she had a very good governess but i wish she were in better hands now  i cannot think why there should be a universal prejudice for the sake of one early offence exclaimed frank  oh indeed said julius amazed at such a tone to his mother  i only meantmother i beg your pardonbut you are only going by hearsay answered frank in some confusion  then you have not seen her said julius  i  im the last person she is likely to seek if you mean camilla  she inquired a great deal after you mother interposed frank and said she longed to call only she did not know if you could see her  i do hope you will when she calls on cecil  i am sure you would think differently  promise me mother  if she asks for me i will my boy said mrs poynsett but let me look  you arent dressed for dinner  what will mistress cecil say to you  ah it is time you had ladies about the house again  the two youths retreated and julius remained looking anxiously and expressively at his mother  i am afraid so she said but i had almost rather he were honestly smitten with the young one than that he believed in camilla  i should think no one could long do that said julius  i dont know  he met them when he was nursing that poor young scotsman at rockpier and got fascinated  he has never been quite the same since that time said the mother anxiously  i dont blame him poor fellow she added eagerly or mean that he has been a bit less satisfactoryoh no  indeed it may be my fault for expressing my objection too plainly he has always been reserved with me since and i never lost the confidence of one of my boys before  that julius knew full well for heas the next eldest at homehad been the recipient of all his mothers perplexities at the time of raymonds courtship  mrs poynsett had not been a woman of intimate female friends  her sons had served the purpose and this was perhaps one great element in her almost unbounded influence with them  julius was deeply concerned to see her eyes glistening with tears as she spoke of the cloud that had risen between her and frank  there is great hope that this younger one may be worthy he said she has had a very different bringing up from her sister and i did not tell you what i found her doing  she was teaching a little pig herd boy to draw  ah  i heard lady tyrrell was taking to the education of the people line  i want to know who the boy is said julius  he called himself reynolds and said he lived with granny but was not a son of daniels or timothys  he seemed about ten years old  reynolds  then i know who he must be  dont you remember a prettylooking girl we had in the nursery in charlies time  his fanfan he used to call her  ah yes i remember she was a reynolds for both the little boys could be excited to fury if we assumed that she was a fox  you dont mean that she went wrong  not till after she had left us and seemed to be doing well in another place but unfortunately she was allowed to have a holiday in the race week and a day at the course seems to have done the mischief  susan can tell you all about it if you want to know she was as brokenhearted as if fanny had been her own childmuch more than the old mother herself i fear  what has become of the girl  gone from bad to worse  alas  i heard a report that she had been seen with some of the people who appear on the racecourse with those gambling shootinggalleries or something of that sort  ah those miserable races  they are the bane of the country  i wish no one would go near them  they are a very pleasant county gathering  to you mother and such as you but you could have your county meeting without doing quite so much harm  if raymond would only withdraw his subscription  it would be as much as his seat is worth  those races are the one great event of wilsbro and backsworth the harvest of all the tradespeople  besides you know what is said of their expedience as far as horses are concerned  i would sacrifice the breed of horses to prevent the evils said julius  you would butmy boy i suppose this is the right view for a clergyman but it will never do to force it here  you will lose all influence if you are overstrained  was st chrysostom overstrained about the hippodrome said julius thoughtfully  mrs poynsett looked at him as he leant upon the chimneypiece here was another son gone in a different way beyond her reach she had seen comparatively little of him since his university days and though always a good and conscientious person there had been nothing to draw her out of secular modes of thought nor had she any connection with the clerical world so that she had not as it were gone along with the tone of mind that she had perceived in him  he did not return to the subject and they were soon joined by his elder brother  at the first opportunity after dinner frank got rosamond up into a corner with a wouldbe indifferent so you met miss vivian  what did you think of her  rosamonds intuition saw what she was required to think and being experienced in raving brothers she praised the fine face and figure so as to find the way to his heart  i am so glad you met her in that way  even julius must be convinced  was not he delighted  i think she grew upon him  and now neither of you will be warped  it is so very strange in my mother generally the kindest most openhearted woman in the world to distrust and bear a grudge against them all for the sons dissipationjust as if that affected the ladies of a family  i did not think it was entirely on his account said rosamond  old stories of flirtation said frank scornfully but what are they to be cast up against a woman in her widowhood  it is so utterly unlike mother i cant understand it  would not the natural conclusion be that she knew more and had her reasons  i tell you rosamond i know them infinitely better than she does she never saw them since lady tyrrells marriage when eleonora was a mere child now i saw a great deal of them at rockpier last year there was poor jamie armstrong sent down to spend the winter on the south coast and as none of his own people could be with him we his oxford friends i meantook turns to come to him and as i had just gone up for my degree i had the most time  the vivians had been living there ever since they went on poor emilys account they did not like to leave the place where she died you see and lady tyrrell had joined them after her husbands death  such a pleasant house no regular gaieties of course but a few friends in a quiet waymusic and charades and so forth  every one knew everybody there not a bit of our stiff county ways but meeting all day long in the most sociable manner  oh yes i know the style of place  one gets better acquainted in a week than one does in seven years in a place like this proceeded frank  and you may tell julius to ask any of the clerics if lenore was not a perfect darling with the vicar and his wife and her sister too and rockpier is a regular tiptop place for church you know  im sure it was enough to make a fellow good for life just to see eleonora walking up the aisle with that sweet face of hers looking more like heaven than earth  rosamond made reply enough to set him off again  lady tyrrell would have been content to stay there for ever she told me but she thought it too confined a range for eleonora there was no formation of character though i dont see how it could have formed better but lady tyrrell is a thoroughly careful motherly sister and thought it right she should see a little of the world  so they broke up from rockpier and spent a year abroad and now lady tyrrell is making great sacrifices to enable her father to come and live at home again  i must say it would be more neighbourly to welcome them a little more kindly  i should think such agreeable people were sure to win their way  ah you dont know how impervious our style of old squire and squiress can be  if even mother is not superior to the old prejudice who will be  and it is very hard on a fellow for three parts of my time is taken up by this eternal crammingi should have no heart for it but for herand i cant be going over to sirenwood as i used to go to rockpier while my mother vexes herself about it in her state  if she were up and about i should not mind or she would know better but what can theylenore i meanthink of me but that i am as bad as the rest  do you mean that anything has passed between you  no not with lenore  her sister spoke to me and said it was not right when she had seen nothing but rockpier but she as good as promised to stand my friend  and when i get to the office in two years i shall have quite enough to begin upon with what my mother allows us  then you hope she will wait for that  i feel sure of itthat is if she is not annoyed by this abominable usage from my family  oh rosamond you will help us when you get into your own house and you will get julius to see it in a proper light  mother trusts to him almost as much as to raymond but it is our misfortune to be so much younger that she cant believe us grown up  o frank said charlie coming in heres price come up about the puppieswhat rosamond has he got hold of you  what a blessing for me but i pity you  frank and charlie went off together and julius was in the act of begging cecil to illuminate a notice of the services to be framed and put into the church porch when raymond came in from the other room to make up a whisttable for his mother  rosamond gladly responded but there was a slight accent of contempt in cecils voice as she replied i never played a game at cards in my life  they are a great resource to my mother said raymond  anne you are too tired to playno julius the pack is not there look in the drawer of the chiffonier  julius handed the list he had been jotting down to cecil and followed his brother with his hands full of cards unconscious of the expression of dismay almost horror with which anne was gazing after him  oh let us be resolute she cried as soon as the door was shut do not let us touch the evil thing  cards said cecil  if mrs poynsett cannot be amused without them i suppose we shall have to learn  i always heard she was such an intellectual woman  but we ought to resist sin however painful it may be said anne gathering strength nay even if a minister sets the example of defection  you think it wicked said cecil  oh no it is stupid and silly and an absurd waste of time but no more  yes it is said anne  cards are the bane of thousands  oh yes gambling and all that but to play in the evening to amuse an invalid can have no harm in it  an invalid and aged woman ought to have her mind set upon better things said anne  i shall not withdraw my testimony and i hope you will not  i dont know said cecil  you see i am expected to attend to mrs poynsett and i have seen whist at dunstone when any dull old person came there  what a troublesome crooked hand julius writes just like greek  whats all this  so many servicesfour on sunday two every day three on wednesdays and fridays  we never had anything like this at dunstone  it is very superstitious said anne  very superfluous i should say amended cecil  i am sure my father would consent to nothing of the kind  i shall speak to raymond about it  yes said anne it does seem terrible that a minister should try to make up for worldly amusements by a quantity of vain ceremonies  i wish you would not call him a minister it sounds like a dissenter  i think ministers their best name except pastors  both are horrid alike said cecil  i shall teach all the people to call julius the rector  thats better than mr charnockwhat raymond ought to be  anne was struck dumb at this fearful display of worldliness and cecil betook herself to the piano but the moment her husband appeared she showed him the list  he has cut out plenty of work said raymond but three of them must want a field for their energies  it is preposterous  i want you to speak to him about it  you are not expected to go to them all raymond made answer  then theres no sense in having them responded cecil  evening services are very bad for the people bringing them out late  you ought to tell him so  he is rector and i am not said raymond  mr venn did nothing without papas consent exclaimed  my dear cecil dont let your loyalty make a harry the eighth of your father said raymond the clergyman ought to be a free agent  you dont approve  i dont approve or disapprove  it is not a matter i know anything about  but i assure you it has been all thought over at dunstone  come my mother wants to go to bed and you are keeping her waiting  cecil was silenced for the moment but not daunted for was it not the foremost duty of the lady of the manor to keep the clergyman in order more especially when he was her own husbands younger brother so she met her brotherinlaw with julius when i undertook that notice i had no notion you were going to have so many services  is there more than you have time to paint  then bindon can do it or jenny bowater  no it is not time or trouble but i do not think such a number of services desirable  indeed said he looking amused  yes  an over number of services frequented by no one only brings the church into contempt  i heard papa say so  we only had regular sunday and saints day services and i am sure dunstone was quite as religious a place as there is any need to be  i am glad to hear it said julius an odd look flickering about his face but as i am afraid compton is not as religious a place as there is need to be i must try by your leave all means of making it so  good night  he was gone and cecil was not sure that he had not presumed to laugh at her    chapter v a sunday of excitement   strangers in court do take her for the queenshakespeare  the first sunday of julius charnocks ministry was spent in an unexpected manner  in the darkness of the autumn morning there was a knock at the door and a low hurried call in annes voice at the bedroom door  rosamond  julius pray look out  isnt there a great fire somewhere  fire  here cried rosamond springing up  no not here  a great way off  you could beat it back  rosamond had by this time rushed to the window which looked out the wrong way found her dressinggown and scrambled into it in the dark ere joining anne in the gallery from the end window of which the lurid light in the sky with an occasional flame leaping up was plainly visible  when julius joined them he declared it to be at willansborough and set off to call up the coachman and despatch the fireengine his wife calling after him to send for the soldiers at backsworth  frank and charlie came rushing down in gratified excitement declaring that it was tremendousthe church at leastand exulting in the attainment of their lifelong ambition the riding out on the fireengine  servants bustled about exclaiming tramping or whisking on the stairs and raymond presently appeared to ask whether his mother were ill and when reassured on that score hurrying to ascertain whether she were alarmed before he started for the scene of action  let me come and stay with her said rosamond a striking figure in a scarlet dressinggown with a thick plait of black hair hanging down to her waist on either side  thank you it will be very kind said raymond running down before her and meeting susan waddling out in a fringe of curlpapers for some mysterious instinct or echo had conveyed to her and her mistress that there was fire somewhereperhaps at home  mrs poynsett was not a nervous woman and from the time she saw her eldest son come in all fright was over and she could have borne to hear that the house over her head was burning in the perfect trust that he would save her from all peril nor had he any difficulty in committing her to rosamond when he hurried away to finish dressing and repair to the spot  nothing could be seen from her room but the little anteroom between it and the drawingroom had an excellent view as the ground fell away from it and there was an opening among the trees  we must get you there exclaimed rosamond in her excitement helping her into some garments and then running out as she heard a stephere julius help me and without more ado the mother was transported between them to the broad low couch under the window and there bestowed in a nest of pillows shawls and rugs that seemed to grow up under rosamonds touch  then following julius out into the hall as he met his brother rosamond clung to him entreating please please dont run into any dangerous places  never fear dearest i am not likely  dont let him pray she said turning to raymond  make him remember how blind he is  ill take good care of him rosamond said the elder brother kindly im used to it  and send for the th she added  there is nothing like soldiers at a fire  the glare must have given notice said julius but well send if needful  let go you foolish girl im not leading a forlorn hope  did raymond as he mounted his horse turning from the contact of the white and black heads admire the reasonableness of the cecil who had never shown any fears for his safety nor any tendency to run about the passages in her robe de chambre though she was now dressing with all speed  the womenfolk had to depend on their own eyes for intelligence for every male not only of the household but of the village between the ages of five and seventy started for wilsbro and a good many females followed their example including the cook and her suite  however susan remained to find her mistress flown and in her fright give lady rosamond as round a scolding as if she had been charlie for her rashness in attempting a transit which dr hayter had pronounced to be as much as her mistresss life was worth having thus relieved her mind and finding that mrs poynsett was really very comfortable or else too eager and anxious to find out if she was not the good woman applied herself to the making of coffee  anne and cecil had found their way to the leads and were thence summoned to partake of this hasty meal after which they proposed going to look from the brow of the hill and mrs poynsett insisted that rosamond should not stay behind on her account and glad to appease the restlessness of anxiety out went the ladies to find the best view of the townusually a white object in the distance but now blurred by smoke thick and black in the daylight and now and then reddened by bursts of flame  anne had been reassured as to the need of beating out the fire and trampling down a place to isolate it as in the bushfires of her experience and rosamond related the achievements of the regiment in quenching many a conflagration in inflammable colonial cities  it occurred to her that the best place whence to see it was the tower of the church which placed upon a little knoll was standing out in full relief against the lurid light  she found the key at the sextons and led the way up the broken stone stair to the trap door where they emerged on the leads and in spite of the cold wind and furious flapping of the flag above their heads stood absorbed in the interest of the sight  there was a black mass in the open space whence rose fitful clouds of smoke the remnants of the fire which had there done its worst and beyond was a smoky undefined outline with tongues of flame darting up then volumes of dense white smoke denoting a rush of water from the engines  black beings flitted about like ants round a disturbed nest rosamond hoped she detected some scarlet among them and cecil lamented over not having brought her operaglass even without this it was possible to make out two long lines of men between the fire and the river and at times they fancied they heard the shouting but the wind generally carried it away  the cold was bitter and they had to hold together and keep a tight grip upon their garments against the gusts that seemed to rock the tower but they could not bear to turn away though the clock beneath pealed out hour after hour for still as the flames were subdued in one place they broke out in another but gradually smoke became predominant and then grew thinner and as some of the black specks began to straggle into the road as if returning to compton the desire to hear became more pressing than that to see and the three ladies began to descenda slow and weary process cutting them off from the view and lasting so long that the road was no longer deserted when they finally emerged into the churchyard  young mr bowater grimed dusty hatless and his hair on end and rollo following with his feathery tail singed hurried up at once im not fit to touch lady rosamond as he showed a black hand and bowed to the others  wheres juwheres my husband exclaimed rosamond  just behind riding home with raymond and the rest of them  wasnt it a magnificent flareup  but there was no loss of life and this dog was of as much use as two mencarried whatever i told him  good old man  youve suffered too said rosamond  pah youre like a singed horse but never mind youre a hero  and where is mr charnock poynsett said cecil retreating from the dog which her sistersinlaw were vehemently patting  he was arranging with the mayor  church papermills and town hall got the worst of it  it was well he came down old briggs the mayor lost his head and fuller never had one  every one gave contrary orders till he came down and then didnt we work  the curate stretched his stalwart limbs as if they were becoming sensible of the strain they had undergone  did you say the church was burnt asked cecil  yes and a very good thing too  hideous place where you couldnt do right if you died for it  the fire began therestoves no doubt and there it would have stopped if any one had had any sense but there they would run and gape and the more i tried to get them to form a chain and drench the warehouses the more they wouldnt do it  and when the flame once got hold of the paperdid you see it it was not a thing to forget  i verily believe the whole town would have gone if the charnocks hadnt come and got a little discipline into the asses  it was just life and death work fighting the fire to hinder it from getting across water lane and then it would have been all up with high street  the tongues broke out like live things ready to lick up everything and it was like killing dragons to go at them with the hose and buckets  i declare my arms are fit to drop out of their sockets  and the rector devoted himself to carrying out bedridden old women  i forgot to tell you lady rosamond he has broken histhere now i never meant to frighten youbroken his spectacles  you did it on purpose she said laughing at her own start  no indeed i did not  and is it quite out now  yes when the backsworth engines and the soldiers came up it was like the prussians at waterloo  oh then it was done said rosamond  take care my grandfather was in the light division  and my uncle in the guards said the curate  but before the waterloo controversy could be pursued four or five figures on horseback came round the knoll and raymond and julius sprang off their horses introducing the three officers who followed their example  one was rosamonds old acquaintance the colonel a friend of her father but she had little attention to spare for them till she had surveyed her husband who looked nothing worse than exceedingly dusty and at fault without his spectacles  inquiries were made for frank and charlie  they were walking home they had worked gallantly  the flames were extinguished but the engines must go on playing on them for some time longer  no lives lost and very few casualties but the papermills were entirely destroyed and about twenty tenements so that great distress was to be apprehended  such intelligence was being communicated as the party stood together in a group when there was a light tinkling of bells and two ladies in a light open carriage drawn by two spirited ponies dashed round the knoll and at the moment something must have gone wrong with them for there was a start a pull a call of raymond  raymond  throwing his bridle to herbert bowater he sprang to the horses heads  mr poynsett  thank you  i beg your pardon said the lady recovering herself and rosamond instantly perceived that she must be lady tyrrell for she was younglooking very handsome and in slight mourning and her companion was miss vivian  julius holding his surviving glass to his eye likewise stepped forward  thank you it was so stupid the lady ran on  is not there something wrong with the traces  i dont know how they got themselves harnessed but there was no keeping at home  i think all is right said raymond gravely making the examination over to a servant  let me introduce my wife lady tyrrell  the lady held out her hand  i hope we shall be excellent neighboursmy sisteryou remember little lena she added to the brothers  she stole a march on us i find  i heard of your encounter on friday  it was too bad of you not to come in and let us send you home i hope you did not get very wet lady rosamond ah  mr strangeways i did not know you were there she proceeded as the youngest of the officers accosted her come over and see us youre better provided now but come to luncheon any day  i am sure to be at home at halfpast one and i want so much to hear of your mother and sisters  and with a universal bow and smile she nourished her whip her ponies jangled their bells and the ladies vanished  stunning pair that was young strangeways exclamation  most beautiful murmured cecil in a low voice as if she was quite dazzled  you never said she was like that she added reproachfully to julius  our encounter was in the dark he answered  oh i did not mean the young one but lady tyrrell  she is just like a gem we saw at firenzewhich was it  where said raymond bewildered  firenzeflorence she said deigning to translate and finding her own reply  ah yes the medusa then as more than one exclaimed in indignant dismay she said no not the gorgon but the beautiful winged head with only two serpents on the brow and one coiled round the neck and the pensive melancholy face  i know said julius shortly while the other gentlemen entered into an argument some defending the beauty of the younger sister some of the elder and it lasted till they entered the park where all were glad to partake of their wellearned meal most of the gentlemen having been at work since dawn without sustenance except a pull at the beer served out to the firemen  cecil was not at all shy and was pleased to take her place as representative lady of the house but somehow though every one was civil and attentive to her she found herself effaced by the more fullblown rosamond accustomed to the same world as the guests and she could not help feeling the same sense of depression as when she had to yield the head of her fathers table to her stepmother  nor could she have that going to church for the first time in state with her bridegroom she had professed to dread but had really anticipated with complacency for though julius had bidden the bells to be rung for afternoon service raymond was obliged to go back to wilsbro to make arrangements for the burntout families and she had to go as lonely as anne herself  lady tyrrell and her sister were both at compton church and overtook the three sistersinlaw as they were waiting to be joined by the rector  we shall have to take shelter with you said lady tyrrell poor burntout beings that we are  do you belong to wilsbro said rosamond  yes st nicholas is an immense straggling parish going four miles along the river  i dont know how we shall ever be able to go back again to poor old mr fuller  youll never get rid of us from compton  i suppose they will set about rebuilding the church at once said cecil  of course they will form a committee and put my husband on it  in the chair no doubt said lady tyrrell in a tone that sounded to rosamond sarcastic but which evidently gratified cecil  but we will have a committee of our own and you will have to preside and patronize our bazaar  of course you know all about them  oh yes said cecil eagerly  we have one every year for the infirmary only my father did not approve of my selling at a stall  ah quite right then but you are a married woman now and that is quite a different thing  the stall of the three brides  what an attraction  i shall come and talk about it when i make my call in full form  goodbye again  cecils balance was more than restored by this entire recognition to be prime ladypatroness of everything  to add to her satisfaction when her husband came home to dinner bringing with him both the curates she found there was to be a meeting on tuesday in the assemblyroom of both sexes to consider of the relief of the work people and that he would be glad to take her to it  moreover as it was to be strictly local rosamond was not needed there though raymond was not equally clear as to the rector since he believed that the st nicholas parishioners meant to ask the loan of compton poynsett church for one service on a sunday  then i shall keep out of the way said julius  i do not want to have the request made to me in public  you do not mean to refuse said cecil with a sort of self identification with her constituents  the people are welcome to attend as many of our services as they like but there is no hour that i could give the church up to mr fuller on a sunday  nor would the use of st nicholas be very edifying for our people added mr bindon  his junior clenched it by saying with a laugh i should think not fancy old fullers rusty black gown up in our pulpit  i rejoice to say that is burnt rejoined mr bindon  what bet will you take that a new one will be the first thing subscribed for said the deacon bringing a certain grave look on the faces of both the elder clergy and a horrorstricken one upon annes while cecil pronounced her inevitable dictum that at dunstone mr venn always preached in a gown and we should never let him think of anything nonsensical  rosamond was provoked into a display of her solitary bit of ecclesiastical knowledgea friars gown the most popish vestment in the church  cecil thoroughly angered flushed up to the eyes and bit her lips unable to find a reply while all the gentlemen laughed  frank asked if it were really so and mr bindon made the wellknown explanation that the geneva gown was neither more nor less than the monks frock  i shall write and ask mr venn gasped cecil but her husband stifled the sound by saying i saw little pettitt julius this afternoon overwhelmed with gratitude to you for all the care you took of his old mother and all his waxen busts  ah by the bye said charlie i did meet the rector staggering out with the fascinating lady with the long eyelashes in one arm and the moustached hero in the other  there was no pacifying the old lady without said julius  i had just coaxed her to the door when she fell to wringing her hands ah those lovely models that were worth thirty shillings each with natural hairthat they should be destroyed  if the heat or the water did but come near them adolphus would never get over it  i could only pacify her by promising to go back for these idols of his heart as soon as she was safe and after all i had to dash at them through the glass and that was the end of my spectacles  where was pettitt himself  well employed poor little fellow saving the people in those three cottages of his  no one supposed his shop in danger but the fire took a sudden freak and came down long street and though the house is standing it had to be emptied and deluged with water to save it i never knew pettitt had a mother till i found her mounting guard like one distracted over her sons bottles of perfumery  and dyes murmured raymond under his breath but frank caught the sound and said ah julius dont i remember his inveigling you into coming out with scarlet hair  i dont think ive seen him since said julius laughing  i believe he couldnt resist such an opportunity of practising his art  and for my part i must say for myself that it was in our first holidays and raymond and miles had been black and blue the whole halfyear from having fought my battles whenever i was called either bunny or grandfather  so when he assured me he could turn my hair to as sweet a ravenblack as master poynsetts i thought it would be pleasing to all forgetting that he could not dye my eyes and that their effect would have been some degrees more comical  for shame julius said rosamond  dont you know that one afternoon when nora had cried for forty minutes over her sum she declared that she wanted to make her eyes as beautiful as mr charnocks  well what was the effect  startling said raymond  he came down in shades of every kind of crimson and scarlet  a fearful object with his pinkandwhite face glowing under it  and what i had to undergo from susan added julius  she washed me and soaped me and rubbed me till i felt as if all the threshingmachines in the county were about my head lecturing me all the time on the profanity of flying against scripture by trying to alter ones hair from what providence had made it  nothing would do her soap only turned it into shades of lemon and primrose  i was fain to let her shave my head as if i had a brain fever and i was so horribly ashamed for years after that i dont think i have set foot in long street since till today  pettitt is a queer little fellow said herbert  the most truculent little radical to hear him talk and yet staunch in his votes for he cant go against those whose hair he has cut off from time immemorial  i hope he has not lost much said julius  his tenements are down but they were insured and as to his stock he says he owes its safety entirely to you julius  i think he would present you with both his models as a testimonial if you could only take them said raymond  cecil had neither spoken nor laughed through all this  she was nursing her wrath and after marching out of the diningroom lay in wait to intercept her husband and when she had claimed his attention began rosamond ought not to be allowed to say such things  what things  speaking in that improper way about a gown  she seems to have said what was the fact  it cant be  it is preposterous  i never heard it before  nor i but bindon evidently is up in those matters  it was only to support rosamond and i am quite sure she said it out of mere opposition to me  you ought to speak to julius  about what said raymond  her laughing whenever i mention dunstone and tell them the proper way of doing things  there may be different opinions about the proper way of doing things  then as she opened her eyes in wonder and rebuke he continued in his elderbrotherly tone of kindness you know i told you already that you had better not interfere in matters concerning his church and parish  we always managed things at dunstone  hang dunstone was with some difficulty suppressed but in an extra gentle voice raymond said your father did what he thought his duty but i do not think it mine nor yours to direct julius in clerical matters  it can only lead to disputes and i will not have them  it is rosamond  im sure i dont dispute  listen cecil he said  i can see that your position may be trying in these close quarters with a younger brothers wife with more age and rank than yourself  that is nothing  an irish earl and a charnock of dunstone  dunstone will be more respected if you keep it in the background he said holding in stronger words with great difficulty  once for all you have your own place and duties and rosamond has hers  if you meddle in them nothing but annoyance can come of it and remember i cannot be appealed to in questions between you and her julius and i have gone on these nineandtwenty years without a cloud between us and im sure you would not wish to bring one now  wherewith he left her bewildered  she did not perceive that he was too impartial for a lover but she had a general sense that she had come into a rebellious world where dunstone and dunstones daughter were of no account and her most cherished notions disputed  what was the lady of the manor to do but to superintend the church parsonage and parish generally  not her duty  she had never heard of such a thing nor did she credit it  papa would come home make these degenerate charnocks hear reason and set all to rights     chapter vi wedding visits   young mrs charnock poynsett had plenty of elasticity and her rebuffs were less present to her mind in the morning than to that of her husband who had been really concerned to have to inflict an expostulation and he was doubly kind almost deferential giving the admiration and attention he felt incumbent on him to the tasteful arrangements of her wedding presents in her own sitting room  and this clock i am going to have in the drawingroom and these salviati glasses  then when i have moved out the piano i shall put the sofa in its place and my own little table with my pretty florentine ornaments  raymond again looked annoyed  have you spoken to my mother he said  no she never goes there  not now but if ever she can bear any move it will be her first change and i should not like to interfere with her arrangements  she could never have been a musician to let the piano stand against the wall  i shall never be able to play  perhaps that might be contrived said raymond kindly  here you know is your own domain where you can do as you please  yes but i am expected to play in the evening  look at all those things  i had kept the choicest for the drawingroom and it is such a pity to hide them all up here  raymond felt for the mortification and was unwilling to cross her again so he said i will ask whether my mother would object to having the piano moved  this morning  after eleven oclocki never disturb her sooner but you shall hear before i go to backsworth  an hour lost thought cecil but she was too well bred to grumble and she had her great work to carry on of copying and illustrating her journal  mrs poynsett readily consented  oh yes my dear let her do whatever she likes  dont let me be a bugbear  a girl is never at home till she has had her will of the furniture  i think she will find that moving out the piano betrays the fading of the rest of the paper but that is her affair  she is free to do just as she likes i dare say the place does look antediluvian to young eyes  so raymond was the bearer of his mothers full permission and cecil presided with great energy over the alterations which she carried out by the aid of the younger servants to the great disgust of their seniors  she expected the acclamations of her contemporaries but it happened that the first of them to cross the room was julius on his way to his mothers room after luncheon and he having on a pair of makeshift glasses till the right kind could be procured from london was unprepared for obstacles in familiar regions stumbled over an ottoman and upset a table with the breakage of a vase  he apologized with much regret but the younger brothers made an outcry  what has come to the place  heres the table all over everything  and where are the bronzes  and the hummingbirds  miless birds that he brought home after his first voyage  and the clock with the two jolly little cupids  dont you remember miles and will bowater dressing them up for menofwars men mother could not bring herself to have them undressed for a year and all the time the clock struck nohow  this is an anatomical study instead of a clock lamented frank i say cecil do you like your friends to sit in their bones like sydney smith  i never saw such a stupid old set of conservatives broke in rosamond feeling for cecils mortification  in an unprejudiced eye the room looks infinitely better quite revivified  you ought to be much obliged to cecil for letting you see all her beautiful things  why dont you favour us with yours said charlie  i know better  mine arent fit to wipe the shoes of cecils  when i get into the rectory youll see how hideous they are said rosamond with the merriest complacency  couvrepieds to set your teeth on edge from the noncommissioned officers wives and the awfullest bannerscreen you ever saw worked by the drummajors own hands with her majestys arms on one side and the de courcy ones on the other and glass eyes like stuffed birds to the lion and unicorn  we nearly expired from suppressed laughter under the presentation  then she went round extorting from the lads admiration for cecils really beautiful properties and winning gratitude for her own cordial praise though it was not the artistic appreciation they deserved  indeed cecil yielded to the general vote for the restoration of the hummingbirds allowing that though she did not like stuffed birds in a drawingroom she would not have banished them if she had known their history  this lasted till charlie spied a carriage coming up the drive which could be seen a long way off so that there was the opportunity for a general sauve qui peut  cecil represented that rosamond ought to stay and receive her bridal visits but she was unpersuadable  oh no  i leave all that for you  my time will come when i get into the rectory  we are going in the dogcart to the other end of the parishwhats its namesquattlesea marsh julius  squattlesford said charlie  if julius means to drive you look out for your neck  no its the other way im going to drive juliuscome along or we shall be caught  cecil stood her ground as did anne who was too weary and indifferent to retreat and frank who had taken another view of the carriage as it came nearer  i must apologize for having brought nothing but my fathers card said lady tyrrell entering with her sister and shaking hands theres no such thing as dragging him out for a morning call  and mr charnock poynsett is not at home replied cecil  he found so much county business waiting for him that he had to go to backsworth  it is the better opportunity for a little private caucus with you returned lady tyrrell before the meeting tomorrow  i rather fancy the gentlemen have one of their own  some are to dine here tonight said cecil  we ladies had better be prepared with our proposals said lady tyrrell  at the same time frank drew near miss vivian with a large book saying these are the photographs you wished to see  he placed the book on the ottoman and would thus have secured a sort of teteatete but eleonora did not choose to leave mrs miles charnock out and handed her each photograph in turn but could only elicit a cold languid thank you  to annes untrained eye these triumphs of architecture were only so many dull representations of roman catholic churches and she would much rather have listened to the charitable plans of the other two ladies for the houseless factory women of wilsbro  the bazaar lady tyrrell said must be first started by the members wife and there should be an innermost committee of not more than three to dispose of stalls and make arrangements  you must be one said cecil  i know no one yet  you will long before it comes off  in fact i am as great a stranger as yourself  ah theres an opportunity as the bell pealed  the bowaters very likely i saw their noahs ark as i passed the poynsett arms with the horses taken out  i wonder how many are comingworthy folks  which evidently meant insufferable bores  is there not a daughter asked cecil  you need not use the singular though by the bye most of them are married  oh pray stay entreated cecil as there were signs of leave taking  i should do you no good  youll soon learn that i am a sort of loki among the asagotter  cecil laughed but had time to resume her somewhat prim dignity before the lengthened disembarkation was over and after all produced only four persons but then none were smallmrs bowater was a harsh matron mr bowater a big comely squire the daughters both tall one with an honest open face much like herberts only with rather less youth and more intelligence the other a bright dark glowing gipsyfaced young girl  eleonora vivian hitherto gravely stiff and reserved to poor franks evident chagrin at once flashed into animation and met the elder miss bowater with outstretched hands receiving a warm kiss at the same time mr bowater despatched frank to see whether his mother could admit a visitor and lady tyrrell observed ah  i was about to make the same petition but i will cede to older friends for so i suppose i must call you mr bowaterthough my acquaintance is of long standing enough  and she put on a most charming smile which mr bowater received with something inarticulate that might be regarded as a polite form of fudge which made cecil think him a horribly rude old man and evidently discomposed his wife very much  frank brought back his mothers welcome to the squire but by this time eleonora and miss bowater had drawn together into a window in so close and earnest a conversation that he could not break into it and with almost visible reluctance began to talk to the younger sister who on her side was desirous of joining in the bazaar discussion which had been started again in full force until there was a fresh influx of visitors when lady tyrrell decidedly took leave with her sister and frank escorted them to their carriage and returned no more  in the new shuffling of partners the elder miss bowater found herself close to anne and at once inquired warmly for miles with knowledge and interest in naval affairs derived from a sailor brother miless chief friend and messmate in his training and earlier voyages  there was something in joanna bowaters manner that always unlocked hearts and anne was soon speaking without her fence of repellant stiffness and reserve  certainly miles was loved by his mother and brothers more than he could be by an old playfellow and sisterly friend and yet there was something in joannas tone that gave anne a sense of fellowfeeling as if she had met a countrywoman in this land of strangers and she even told how miles had thought it right to send her home thinking that she might be a comfort to his mother  and not knowing all that was going to happen said poor anne with an irrepressible sigh both for her own blighted hopes and for the whirl into which her sore heart had fallen  i think you will be said joanna brightly though it must be strange coming on so many  dear mrs poynsett is so kind  yes said anne coldly  ah you dont know her yet  and lady rosamond  she is delightful  have you seen her  we met them just now in the village but my brother is enchanted and do you know what was juliuss first introduction to her  it was at a great schoolfeast where they had the regimental children as well as the town ones  a poor little boy went off in an epileptic fit and julius found her holding him with her own hand in his mouth to hinder the locking of the teeth  he said her fingers were bitten almost to the bone but she made quite light of it  that was nice said anne but then with a startled glance and in an undertone she added are they christians  joanna bowater paused for a moment between dismay and desire for consideration and in that moment her father called to her jenny do you remember the dimensions of those cottages in quecketts lane and she had to come and serve for his memory while he was indoctrinating a younger squire with the duties of a landlord  meanwhile mrs bowater was for the tenth time consulting her old friend upon mrs hornblowers capabilities of taking care of herbert and betraying a little disappointment that his first sermon had not yet been heard and when his voice was complimented she hoped julius would spare ittoo much exertion could not be good for so young a man and though dear herbert looked so strong no one would believe how much sleep he required  then she observed we found camilla vivianlady tyrrell i meancalling  have you seen her  no  well she really seems improved  mr bowater has been telling me she is handsomer than ever  oh yes  thats all gentlemen think of but i meant in other ways she seems full of the rebuilding of st nicholas and to be making great friends with your new daughter  you dont think lowering her voice that raymond would have any objection to meeting her  certainly not  i did not suppose he would but i thought i would just ask you  it would be rather marked not to invite him for the 3rd you know and jenny was always so fond of poor emily kept up a correspondence with her to the last  it was the first time she had met the little one since they came back  not that she is little now she is very tall and quite handsome even by the side of edith  we just saw lady rosamonda sweet faceand herbert perfectly raves about her  she is a most unselfish warmhearted creature said mrs poynsett  i am so glad  and miless wife i hope she will come  poor thing she looks very poorly  yes i am very anxious about her  if she is not better in a day or two i shall insist on her having advice  poor dear i dont wonder  but she had better come to strawyers jenny will cheer her if any one can and we shall have a nice lively party i hope  she will only mope the more if she never goes out  i am afraid she is hardly equal to it besides poor child added mrs poynsett she seems to have been strictly brought up and to think our ways rather shocking and miles wrote to me not to press her to go into society till he comes home  ah well i call that a mistake puffed out goodhumoured mrs bowater  very bad for the poor girls spirits  by the bye i hope julius does not object to herberts dancingnot at a public ball you know but at homefor if he did i would try to arrange something else it would be so hard for the poor boy to have to look on  i dont know i dont think he could said the mother considering  you see we thought of a dinnerparty for as many as possible frank and charlie wont mind dining in the schoolroom i know and having the rest for a dance in the evening but if julius did think it unclericaljenny says he wont and papa laughs and says poh poh  julius is no fool but people are so much more particular than they used to be and i would not get the dear boy into a scrape for the world  mrs poynsett undertook to ascertain his opinions on this knotty point and to let her know if they were adverse and then she begged for a visit from jenny whose brother had no accommodation for her in his lodgings  she could not be spared till after the entertainment on the 3rd nor till a visit from her married sister was over but afterwards her mother was delighted that she should come and look after herbert who seemed as much on the maternal mind as if he had not batted his way through eton and boated it through oxford  mrs poynsett obtained her word with julius in good time that evening  he laughed a little  poor herbs when will people understand that it is the spirit of the thing the pursuit not the individual chance participation in any particular amusement that is unclerical as they are pleased to call it  what do you think of herbert  a boy and a very nice boy but if he doesnt get his healthful play somehow he will burst out like a closed boiler some day  a muscular christian on your hands  not theoretically for he has been well taught but its a great animal that needs to work off its steam and if i had known it i would not have undertaken the problem of letting him do that without setting up bad habits or scandalizing the parish and bindonwho is young the other way and has no toleration  we had this mornings service in a state of siege from all the dogs herbert thought he had shut them safely up but they were all at his heels in the churchyard and though he rated them home and shut all the doors we heard them whining and scratching at each in turn  i thought i should have died of it said rosamond entering  his face grew red enough to set his surplice on fire and mr bindon glared at him and he missed his verse in the psalm for there was the bull terrier crouching and looking abject at the vestrydoor just restrained by his eye from coming further  what shall you do about it julius asked his mother much amused  oh that will remedy itself  all dogs learn to understand the bell  and then the others began to drop in and were told of the invitation that was coming  i say rosamond cried charlie can brothers and sistersinlaw dance together  that depends on how the brothersinlaw dance returned rosamond some one for pitys sake play a waltzcome along charlie the hall is a sweet place for itwhistle juliusfrank whistle  and away she whirled  frank holding out his hands was to his surprise accepted by cecil and disappeared with her into the hall julius stood by the mantelpiece with the first shadow on his brow his mother had seen since his arrival  presently he spoke in a defensive apologetic tone  she has always been used to this style of thing  most naturally said the mother  not that they ever did more than their position required and lady rathforlane is a truly careful mother  of course some things might startle you stayathome people but in all essentials  i see what you mean  and what seems like rattle is habit  simple gaiete de coeur  so it is better to acquiesce till it subsides of itself  you see it is hard after such a life of change and variety to settle down into a country parsonage  what are you saying there said rosamond tripping in out of breath  that i dont know how you are to put up with a pinkeyed parson and a humdrum life said julius holding out a caressing hand  now thats hard pleaded she only because i took a frolic with baby charles  i say julius shall we give it up altogether and stay at home like good children  i believe that is what would suit the told rabbit much better than his kid glovesand her sweet face looked up at him with a meek candid gaze  no he said that would not do  the bowaters are our oldest friends  but rosie as you are a clergymans wife could you not give up round dances  oh no no  thats too bad  id rather never go to a dance at all than sit still or be elbowed about in the square dances  you never told me you expected thatand her tones were of a child petulant at injustice  suppose he said as a delightful solution you only gratified frank and charlie by waltzing with them  she burst into a ringing laugh  my brothersinlaw  how very ridiculous  suppose you included the curates  you know what i mean he said gravely  oh bother the parsons wife  havent i seen them figuring away by scores  did we ever have a regimental ball that they were not the keenest after  so they get themselves talked of said julius as annes quiet entrance broke up the dialogue  mrs poynsett had listened glad there was no appeal to her conscious that she did not understand the merits of the case and while she doubted whether her eldest son had love enough somewhat afraid lest his brother had not rather too much for the good of his lawful supremacy     chapter vii unfruitful suggestions   raymond  can you spare me a moment before you go into your mothers room  it was rosamond who to his surprise as he was about to go down stairs met him and drew him into her apartmenthis mothers own dressingroom which he had not entered since the accident  is anything the matter he said thinking that julius might have spared him from complaints of cecil  oh no only one never can speak to you and julius told me that you could tell me about mrs poynsett  i cant help thinking she could be moved more than she is  then as he was beginning to speak do you know that the morning of the fire i carried her with only one of the maids to the couch under the tentroom window  susan was frightened out of her wits but she was not a bit the worse for it  ah that was excitement  but if it did not hurt her then why should it hurt her again theres old general mkinnon my fathers old friend who runs about everywhere in a wheeledchair with a legrest and i cant think why she should not do the same  raymond smiled kindly on her but rather sadly perhaps he was recollecting his mornings talk about the occupancy of the drawing room  you know it is her spine he said  so it is with him  his horse rolled over him at sebastopol and he has never walked since  i wanted to write to mary mkinnon but julius said i had better talk to you because he was only at home for a fortnight when she was at the worst and you knew more about it  yes said raymond understanding more than the irish tongue fully expressed  i never saw a woman sit better than she did and she looked as young and light in the saddle as you could till that day when after the rains the bank where the bridlepath to squattles end was built up gave way with the horses feet and down she went twenty feet and was under the horse when miles and i got down to her  we brought her on a mattress to that room not knowing whether she were alive and she has never moved out of it  it was agony to her to be touched  yes but it cant be that now  was not that three years ago  not so much  two and a half  we had hayter down to see her and he said perfect rest was the only chance for her  and has not he seen her lately  he died last winter and old worth who comes in once a week to look at her is not fit for more than a little watching and attention  i dare say we all have learnt to acquiesce too much in her present state and that more might be done  you see she has never had a ladys care except now and then jenny bowaters  i do feel sure she could bear more now said rosamond eagerly it would be such a thing if she could only be moved about that downstairs floor  and be with us at meals and in the evening said raymond his face lightening up  thank you rosamond  ill write to mary mkinnon tomorrow to ask about the chair cried rosamond and raymond hearing the doorbell hurried down to find his wife standing alone over the drawingroom fire not very complacent  where have you been raymond  i was talking to rosamond  she has seen a chair on which it might be possible to move my mother about on this floor  i thought cecil flushed  she was on the point of saying she thought rosamond was not to interfere in her department any more than she in rosamonds but she kept it back and changed it into surely the doctor and nurses must know best  a fresh eye often makes a difference said raymond  to have her among us again but he was cut short by the announcement of mr and miss fuller  poor mr fuller as every one called him was the incumbent of st nicholas willansborough a college living always passed by the knowing old bachelor fellows and as regularly proving a delusion to the first junior in haste for a wife  twentyfive years ago mr fuller had married upon this which as mr bindon said was rather a reason for not marryinga town with few gentry and a petty unthriving manufacture needing an enormous amount of energy to work it properly and gettingmr fuller with force yearly decreasing under the pressure of a sickly wife illeducated unsatisfactory sons and unhealthy aimless daughters  of late some assistance had been obtained but only from mr driver the coach or cramming tutor who was directing the studies of frank and half a dozen more youths and his aid was strictly limited to a share in the sunday services  the eldest daughter accompanied the vicar  her mother had not health or perhaps clothes for a dinnerparty and it was the first time she had ever been in the house  very shy and in much awe she was  cecil viewed her as a constituent and was elaborately civil and patronizing doing the honours of all the photographs and illustrations on which she could lay hands and only eliciting alternately very nice and how sweet  a little more was made of the alarms of the fire and the preparations for clearing the house and there was a further thaw about the bazaar  it would be such a relief from plain work and she could get some lovely patterns from her cousin who had a missionary basket but as to the burntout families the little knowledge or interest she seemed to have about them was rather astounding unless as rosamond suspected she thought it shop and uninteresting to the great ladies of compton poynsett hall  meanwhile her father made the apprehended request for the loan of compton church during the intervals of services and when the rector explained how brief those intervals would be looked astonished and dryly complimented him on his energy and his staff somewhat as if the new broom were at the bottom of these congratulations  the schools were to be used for services until a temporary iron church could be obtained for which julius to make up for his churlishness in withholding his own church made the handsomer donation and held out hopes of buying it afterwards for the use of squattles end  then having mr fullers ear to himself he ventured to say though cautiously as to one who had been a clergyman before he was born i wish it were possible to dispense with this bazaar  mr fuller shrugged his shoulders  if every one subscribed in the style of this family  they would be more likely to do so without the appeal to secondary motives  try them said the elder man  exactly what i want to do  i would put up the four walls begin with what you get from the insurance a weekly offertory and add improvements as means came in  this is not visionary  i have seen proof of its success  it may serve in newfashioned city missions but in an old established place like this it would create nothing but offence when you have been in orders as long as i have you will find that there is nothing for it but to let people do what they will not what one thinks best  mr fuller said julius eagerly will you try an experiment drop this bazaar and i promise you our collection every sunday evening for the year giving notice of it to my people and to such of yours as may be present  i do not despise your offer said mr fuller laying his hand upon his arm  you mean it kindly and if i were in your place or had only my own feelings to consider i might attempt it  but it would be only mischievous to interfere with the bazaar  lady tyrrellall the ladies in facthave set their minds on it and if i objected there would instantly be a party cry against me and that is the one thing i have always avoided  his tone of superior wisdom meek and depressed as he always was tried the rectors patience enough to make his forehead burn and bring out his white eyebrows in strong relief  how about a blessing on the work he asked suppressing so much that he hardly knew this was spoken aloud  again mr fuller smiled  he had been a bit of a humorist when he was an oxford don  speak of that to briggs he said and he would answer cash for me and the blessing may take care of itself  as to the ladieswhy they deafen you about blessings on their humble efforts and the widows mite  simply meaning that they want their amusement a little  buttered over said mr fuller supplying the word  though you are hard on them charnocki dont know about the fine ladies but there are quiet folk who will work their fingers to the bone and can do nothing else  thats true said julius and one would gladly find a safe outlet for their diligence  you do not trust to it for bringing the blessing said mr fuller in a tone that julius liked even less than the mere hopeless faint heartedness for in it there was sarcasm on faith in aught but pounds s d  the two brothers held another discussion on this matter later that night on the stairs as they were on their way to their rooms  wont you come to this meeting tomorrow julius asked raymond  i dont see that i should be of any use unless  unless what  unless you would make what seems to me the right proposal and i could be any support in it  whats that  to use the insurance to put up the mere shells and plain indispensable fittings of the church and townhall then make the drainage of water lane and hall street the first object for the rates while the church is done by subscription and voluntary effort  you put the drainage firsteven before the church said raymond smiling with an elder brothers satisfaction in such an amount of common sense  of course i do said julius  an altar and four walls and chairs are all that ought to be sought for  little good can be done to peoples souls while their bodies are in the feverish discomfort of foul air and water  this is an opportunity not to be wasted while all the houses are down townhall and all  the very thing i told briggs and the others this morning said raymond but i could not get a hearing they said there never had been any illness worth mentioning and in fact scouted the whole matter as people always do  yes they take it as a personal insult when you mention the odorousor odious savours sweet said julius  i heard a good deal of that when we had the spell of cholera at st awdrys  i shall work on at it and i trust to get it done in time said raymond but it will not be at once  the subject is too new to them and the irritation it produces must subside before they will hear reason  besides the first thing is to employ and feed these papermakers  of course  that will pretty well absorb this first meeting  the ladies will manage that i think and when this is provided for i will try what i can do at the committee but there is no good in bringing it forward at this great public affair when every ass can put in his word  everything depends on whom they choose for the new mayor  if whitlock comes in there is some chance of sense and reason being heard  good night  as raymond said the more immediate object of the meeting fixed for the ensuing day was to provide for the employment of the numerous women thrown out of employment by the destruction of the paper mills  a subscription was in hand but not adequate to the need and moreover it was far more expedient to let them maintain themselves  how this was to be done was the question  cecil told her husband that at dunstone they made the women knit stockings and he replied by recommending the suppression of dunstone  how strange it was that what she had been used to consider as the source of honour should be here held in what seemed to her disesteem  lady tyrrells ponies were tinkling up to the door of the hotel where the meeting was to be held and her gracious smile recalled cecils goodhumour raymond saw them to their seats and then had to go and take the chair himself on the platformfirst however introducing his wife to such of the ladies present as he recollected  she thought he wanted her to sit between melancholy white faced mrs fuller and a bony spinster in a pokebonnet whom he called miss slater but cecil concluding that this last could have no vote and that the vicarage was secure felt free to indulge herself by getting back to lady tyrrell who had scarcely welcomed her before exclaiming mrs duncombe i did not know you were returned  i came back on the first news of your flareup said the newcomer i only came down this morning  i would not have missed this meeting for anything  it is a true womans question  a fair muster i see looking round with her eyeglass and bowing to several on the platform especially to raymond who returned the bow rather stiffly  ah let me introduce you said lady tyrrell  mrs raymond charnock poynsett  i am very glad to see you embarked in the cause said the lady frankly holding out her hand  may we often meet in the same manner though i honestly tell you im not of your party i should go dead against your husband if we only had a chance  come you need not be so aggressive laughed lady tyrrell you havent a vote yet  you are frightening mrs poynsett  it was true  even cecil charnock was born too late to be one of the young ladies who in the first decades of the reformed parliament used to look on a liberal as a lusus naturae whom they hardly believed to be a gentleman  but a lady who would openly accost the members bride with a protest against his politics was a being beyond her experience and the contemplation fairly distracted her from her husbands oratory  she would have taken miss slater for the strongminded female far rather than this small slim person with the complexion going with the yellower species of red hair and chignon not unlike a gold pheasants while the thin aquiline nose made cecil think of queen elizabeth  the dress was a tightfitting black silk with a gorgeous manycoloured goldembroidered oriental mantle thrown loosely over it and a tyrolean hat about as large as the pheasants comb tipped over her forehead with cords and tassels of gold and she made little restless movements and whispered remarks during the speeches  there was to be a rate to renew the townhall  the rebuilding of the papermills and dwellinghouses was fairly covered by the insurance but the vicar in his diffident apologetic voice stated that the church had been insufficiently insured and moreover that many more sittings were needed than the former building had contained  he then read the list of subscriptions already promised expressed hopes of more coming in invited ladies to take collecting cards and added that he was happy to announce that the ladies of the congregation had come forward with all the beneficence of their sex and raised a sum to supply a new set of robes  here the chairman glanced at his wife but she was absorbed in watching mrs duncombes restless hands and the look was intercepted by lady tyrrells eyes which flashed back sympathetic amusement with just such a glance as used to pass between them in old times but the effect was to make the members face grave and impassive and his eyes fix on the papers before him  the next moment cecil was ardently gazing at mr fuller as he proceeded to his hopes of the bazaar to be held under the most distinguished patronage and of which he spoke as if it were the subject of anticipations as sanguine as any the poor man could ever appear to indulge in  and there was in fact the greatest stamping and cheering there had yet been perhaps in compliment to the mps young brideat least so lady tyrrell whispered adding that everybody was trying to see her  then mr charnock poynsett himself took up the exposition of the third branch of the subject the support of the poor families thrown out of work at the beginning of winter  there could be no employment at the papermills till they were repaired and after the heavy losses they could not attempt to keep their people together by any payment  it had been suggested that the readiest way of meeting the difficulty would be to employ the subscriptions already promised in laying in a stock of material to be made up into garments and then dispose of them out to the women at their homes and appointing a day once a week when the work should be received the pay given and fresh material supplied by a party of volunteer ladies  this was in fact what he had been instructed to propose by the kindly souls who ordinarily formed the st nicholas bureau de charite who had instructed him to be their mouthpiece  there was due applause as the mayor seconded his resolution but in the midst a clear rather highpitched voice rose up close to cecil saying mr chairman allow me to ask what sale is anticipated for these garments  i am told that there is a demand for them among the poor themselves said raymond judiciously concealing how much he was taken aback by this female interference  allow me to differ  a permanent work society numbering a few women otherwise unemployed may find a sufficient sale in the neighbourhood under the patronage of charitable ladies but when you throw in ninetyfive or one hundred pair of hands depending on their work for their livelihood the supply must necessarily soon go beyond any demand even fictitious  it will not do to think of these women like fancy knitters or embroiderers whose work is skilled  most of them can hardly mend their own clothes and the utmost that can be expected of them is the roughest slop work  do you wish any expedient to be proposed asked the chairman in a sort of aside  yes i have one  i spent yesterday in collecting information  will captain duncombe move it suggested raymond  oh no he is not here  no it is no use to instruct anybody i will do it myself if you please  and before the astonished eyes of the meeting the goldpheasant hopped upon the platform and with as much ease as if she had been queen bess dragooning her parliament she gave what even the astounded gentlemen felt to be a sensible practical exposition of ways and means  she had obtained the address of a warehouse ready to give such rough work as the women could be expected to do but as they were unaccustomed to work at home and were at present much crowded from the loss of so many houses and could besides be little depended on for working well enough without superintendence her plan was to hire a room collect the women and divide the superintendence between the ladies who should give out the work see that it was properly done keep order and the like  she finished off in full order by moving a resolution to this effect  there was a pause and a little consultation among the gentlemen ending by raymonds absolutely telling mr fuller that it was a very sensible practical arrangement and that it must be seconded which the vicar accordingly did and it was carried without opposition as in truth nothing so good had been thought of and the next thing was to name a committee of ladies a treasurer and auditor of accounts  there would be no work on saturdays so if the ladies would each undertake half a day once a fortnight the superintendence need not be a burthen  mrs duncombe and miss slater undertook the first start and preliminary arrangements then each would take her half day in rotation  lady tyrrell and her sister undertook two cecil two more and others were found to fill up the vacant space  the chairman moved a vote of thanks to the lady for her suggestion which she acknowledged by a gracious bow not without triumph and the meeting broke up  some one asked after captain duncombe as she descended into private life  theres a wonderful filly that absorbs all his attention all wilsbro might burn as long as dark hag thrives  when do i expect him  i dont know it depends on dark hag she said in a tone of superior goodnatured irony then gathered up the radiant mantle and tripped off along the central street of the little old fashioned country town with gravelled not paved sidewalks  isnt she very superior said cecil when her husband had put her on horseback  i suppose she is very clever  and she spoke capitally  if she were to speak  what would your father think of her  but for the first time cecils allegiance had experienced a certain shock  some sort of pedestal had hitherto been needful to her existence she was learning that dunstone was an unrecognized elevation in this new country and she had seen a woman attain to a pinnacle that almost dazzled her by sheer resource and good sense  all the discussion she afterwards heard did not tend to shake her opinion raymond recounted the adventure at his mothers kettle drum telling of his own astonishment at the little ladys assurance  i do not see why she should be censured said cecil  you were all at a loss without her  she should have got her husband to speak for her said mrs poynsett  he was not there  then she should have instructed some other gentleman said mrs poynsett  a woman spoils all the effect of her doings by putting herself out of her proper place  perfectly disgusting said julius  cecil had decidedly not been disgusted except by the present strong language and not being ready at repartee she was pleased when rosamond exclaimed ah thats just what men like to get instructed in private by us poor women and then gain all the credit for originality  it is the right way said the mother  the woman has much power of working usefully and gaining information but the one thing that is not required of her is to come forward in public  very convenient for the man laughed rosamond  and scarcely fair said cecil  quite fair said rosamond turning round so that cecil only now perceived that she had been speaking in jest  any woman who is worth a sixpence had rather help her husband to shine than shine herself  besides said mrs poynsett the delicate edges of true womanhood ought not to be frayed off by exposure in public  yes said raymond  the gain of an inferior power of man in public would be far from compensated by the loss in private of that which man can never supply  granted said rosamond slyly though sleepily that it always is an inferior power of man which it does not seem to have been in the actual case  it was a point on which she had special knowledge and information said mrs poynsett  and you were forced to thank her said cecil  yes in common civility said raymond but it was as much as i could do to get it done the position was a false one altogether  in fact you were all jealous said rosamond  at which everybody laughed which was her sole intention but cecil who had said so much less really thought what rosamond said in mere play  those extorted thanks seemed to her a victory of her sex in a field she had never thought of and though she had no desire to emulate the lady and felt that a daughter of dunstone must remember noblesse oblige the focus of her enthusiasm was in an odd state of shifting     chapter viii unsatisfactory   on the evening of the party at strawyers mrs poynsett lay on her sofa thinking with a trying recurrence of that unfortunate and excellent german dauphine who was pronounced by the duchess of orleans to have died of her own stupidity  after a fortnight had brought no improvement but rather the reverse to poor annes wan looks and feeble languid deportment mrs poynsett had insisted on her seeing the doctor and had been assured by him that there was nothing amiss and that if mrs miles charnock could only be roused and occupied she would be perfectly well but that her pining and depression might so lower her tone as to have a serious effect on her health  there was no hope of her husbands return for at least a year likely eighteen months  what was to be done with her  what could be a more unpropitious fate than for a colonial girl used to an active life of exertion and usefulness and trained to all domestic arts to be set down in a great english household where there was really nothing for her to do and usefulness or superintendence would have been interfering besides as miles had thoughts of settling at the cape english experience would serve her little  she had not cultivation enough for any pursuit to interest her  she was not musical could not draw and when mrs poynsett had by way of experiment asked her to read aloud an hour a day and selected the lives of the lindsays as an unexceptionable and improving book full of scottish history and even with african interest she dutifully did her task as an attention to her invalid motherinlaw but in a droning husky tone finding it apparently as severe a penance as it was to her auditor  the doctors chief prescription was horse exercise but what would a constitutional canter be to one accustomed to free rides through the bush  and she would generally be alone for even if charlie her nearest approach to an ally had not been going away from home in a few weeks it could not be expected that he could often ride with her  it was plain that every one of the whole family was giving continual shocks to mr pilgrims disciple even when they felt most innocent and though the mother was sometimes disposed to be angry sometimes to laugh at the little shudder and compression of the lips she began to know she perceived what an addition this must be to the unhappiness of the poor lonely stranger  she must be set to some good work thought mrs poynsett julius might let her go to his old women  she might get on with them better than with the old women here  and theres cecils working affair it would be just the thing to give her an object  i think i can get through this evening  ive made susan bring my desk with all miless letters from his first voyage  shall i suppress the ball  therewith cecil made her entrance in glossy white satin and deep lace beautiful to behold set off with rainbow glistening opals she made a quiet complacent show of herself as one not vain of fine clothes but used to an affectionate family appreciation of her best attire and it was the most friendly childlike bit of intimacy that had yet been attained between her and mrs poynsett  and when she sat down to wait for the others mrs poynsett ventured on telling her the prescription and her own perplexity hoping for a voluntary offer to employ anne at willansborough but cecil only pitied her for having no resources and when mrs poynsett ventured to suggest finding a niche for her in the workroom the answer wasour days are all disposed of  you have two i think  true but it would never do for me to give up one of my times  if i seemed to slacken every one else would  what will you do when the session begins  i shall make some arrangement  i do not think anne could ever take my place she would have no authority  anne herself here entered took her knitting and sat down apparently unaware of the little pluming gesture by which cecil unconsciously demanded attention to her bridal satin  one white gloved gentleman after another dropped in but none presumed on a remark jenkins announced the carriages but rosamond had not appeared and after an excursion upstairs julius returned declaring that the first carriage must not wait for her they would come afterwards in the van for there was something amiss in the dress she had not had it on since the wedding  and she came in so late said cecil  that was my fault he said  we came through the village to leave a message at the doctors and he then insisted that the other pair should set off taking frank and charlie and prevent dinner from being kept waiting at which the boys made faces and declared that it was a dodge of his to join jennys party in the schoolroom instead of the solemn dinner but they were obliged to submit and it was not till twenty minutes later that in glided something white with blue cashmere and swansdown over it moving as usual with languid grace  poor julius smiled rosamond with her dawdling dignity  every single thing turned out a misfit  as it is theres a monstrous hole in my glove which demands the benevolent fiction of my having torn it by the way  there one second for the effectgoodbye dear mrs poynsettgoodbye anne  come you monument of patience and resignation  for one moment she had slipped back her little mantle then drawn it on as taking her husbands arm she left the room but that moment had set annes cheeks aflame and left mrs poynsett in a startled state of uncertainty hoping her glance had been mistaken wondering what could have been more amiss and feeling incapable of entering on the subject with that severe young judge of narrow experience  never had her eldest son failed to come and bid her good night on his way to his own room  it was the great break in her long sleepless hours and she used to call it a reversal of the relations of those days when he used to watch for her kiss on her way to bed nor did he fail her now but came and stood over her with his fragmentary tidings  an immense partyoh yes there was he persuading them not to wait mr bowater took rosamond in to dinner cecil went with sir harry vivian  yes lady tyrrell was there wonderfully handsome but her expression strikes me as altered there is the sort of pathetic look that as cecil said is like the melancholy medusai wonder if it is genuine  she seems greatly disposed to cultivate cecili wonder what she does it for  is cecil attracted  i fancied she was  yes a good deal and i fear the wilsbro business will throw them together  it is unlucky on franks account likewise  i see we shall have it all over again there  i have great hope in his office taking him away  how was it with them tonight  what i should call arrant coquetry such as even camilla never indulged in  the girl kept out of his waywas absolutely chill and repelling half the eveningthrowing herself at the officers from backsworth till at last frank obtained a waltz and after that they were perfectly inseparable  if she coquets she will soon disgust him  did cecil enjoy herself  oh yes  phil bowater opened the ball with her and she dances very nicelyso quietly mrs bowater remarked it  as to rosamond she was in her native elementis indeed for she would not hear of coming away when we did  and julius  standing in a doorway with others of his kind absently talking and watching rosamond out of the tail of his eye  i say mother lowering his voice cant you give rosamond a hint about her dress cecil says she cant go out with her again like that  ah as he heard a sigh i should not have worried you at night  no you have not  tell cecil i will see about it  rosamond will take it best from an old woman like me  mrs poynsett was quite conscious that cecil had more high breeding and refinement than rosamond who was essentially the irish colonels daughter and that the cold temperament of the one irritated the warm nature of the other  more than one flash had revealed rosamonds contempt for cecils assumptions and intolerance for her precisionbesides she was five years older and had not an ideal in dunstone  after revolving what form of remonstrance would be least offensive during half the night and day mrs poynsett was not prepared for the appearance about noon of her son julius when coming to what she termed the confidential side of her couch he asked hesitatingly and colouring mother i want you to tell me was there anything amiss in roses dress last night  you did not perceive  im not used to the style of thing  is it not the way with what you call full dress  to a certain degree she began  he caught her up  and here has cecil been putting my poor rose into a perfect agony  it is only womans censorious nonsense isnt it mother  mere folly to think otherwise  i knew you would set my mind at rest and if you would tell cecil that you will not have rosamond insulted it would be as well  stay julius as he was walking off complacently i grieve but i must confess that i was going to speak to rosamond myself  he looked very blank  mind i am certain that it is only an innocent following of what she has been brought up to and as he signed a sort of hurt acquiescence as if trying to swallow the offence she added when do you go out again  not till monday when we dine at colonel rosss  he is an old friend of lord rathforlane  then i am inclined to let it cool  sometimes advice that has been resented does its work  you dont think the interference justifiable  not from that quarter  and can it be needful to attend to it  my dear julius it is not a style of dress i could ever have worn nor have let my daughters have worn if i had had any  conclusive that said julius getting up more really angered with his mother than he had been since his childhood  however he conquered himself by the time he had reached the door and came back to say i beg your pardon mother i know you would not say so without need  thank you my boy and he saw tears in her eyes the first time he was conscious of having brought them  as he bent down to kiss her she rallied and cheerfully said i have no doubt it will all come rightrosamond is too nice not to feel it at once  no such thing rosamond was still furious  if he disapproved she would submit to him but he had seen nothing wrong had he  my dear rose i told you i was no judge  you forget what my eyes are and my mother  you have been to your mother  my dear what could i do  and you think i am going to insult my own mother and sisters to please any womans finical prudish notions  pray what did mrs poynsett say  the excuse of custom pleaded by mrs poynsett only made rosamond fiercer  she wished she had never come where she was to hear that her own mother was no judge of propriety and her husband could not trust her but must needs run about asking everybody if she were fit to be seen  such a tempest julius had never seen outside a back street in the garrison town  there seemed to be nothing she would not say and his attempts at soothing only added to her violence indeed there was only one thing which would have satisfied her and that was that she had been perfectly right and the whole world barbarously wrong and she was wild with passion at perceiving that he had a confidence in his own mother which he could not feel in hers  nor would he insist that raymond should force cecil to apologize my dear he said dont you know there are things easier to ask than to obtain  to which rosamond replied in another gust that she would never again sit down to table with cecil until she had apologized for the insult not to herself she did not care about that but to the mother who had seen her dresses tried on  julius must tell raymond so or take her away to any cottage at once  she would not stay where people blamed mamma and poisoned his mind against her  she believed he cared for them more than for her  julius had sympathized far longer with her offended feeling than another could have done but he was driven to assert himself nonsense rose you know better he said in a voice of displeasure but she pouted forth i dont know it  you believe every one against me and you wont take my part against that nasty little spiteful prig  cecil has behaved very ill to you said julius granting her rather over much but she is a foolish conceited child who does not deserve that raymond should be worried about her  i foresee plenty of grievances from her but rosie we must and will not let her come between us and raymond  you dont know what a brother he has been to mei hardly think i could have got through my first year at school but for him and i dont think my sweet rose could wish to do me such an ill turn as to stir up a feud with such a brother because his wife is provoking  the luncheonbell began to sound and she sobbed out there then go down leave me alone  go to them since you are so fond of them all  i dont think you could come down as you are said julius gravely i will bring you something  it would choke mechoke me she sobbed out  julius knew enough of the de lancy temperament to be aware that words carried them a long way and he thought solitude would be so beneficial that he summoned resolution to leave her but he had not the face to appear alone nor offer fictions to excuse her absence so he took refuge in his dressingroom until he had seen cecil and anne ride away from the hall door together  for the two sistersinlaw had held a little indignation meeting and rosamonds misdemeanour had so far drawn them together that cecil had offered to take anne to see the working party and let her assist thereat  the coast being clear julius went down encountering nothing worse than the old butler who came in while he was cutting cold beef and to whom he said lady rosamond is rather knocked up i am going to take her something upstairs  jenkins received this as the result of a dance but much wanted to fetch a tray which julius refused and set off with an aleglass in one hand and in the other the plates with the beef and appliances jenkins watching in jealous expectation of a catastrophe having no opinion of mr juliuss powers as a waiter  he was disappointed the downfall was deferred till the goal was reached and was then most salutary for rosamond sprang to pick up the knife and fork laughed at his awkwardness refused to partake without him produced implements from her travellingbag and was as merry as she had been miserable  not a word on the feud was uttered and the pair walked down to the village where she was exemplary going into all those more distasteful parts of her duties there which she sometimes shirked  and on her return finding her longexpected letter from miss mkinnon awaiting her she forgot all offences in her ardour to indoctrinate everybody with the hopes it gave of affording mrs poynsett a change of room if not even greater variety unfortunately this eagerness was not met with a corresponding fervour  there was in the household the acquiescence with long established invalidism that sometimes settles down and makes a newcomers innovations unwelcome  raymond had spoken to the old doctor who had been timid and discouraging susan resented the implication that the utmost had not been done for her dear mistress and mrs poynsett herself though warmly grateful for rosamonds affection was not only nervously unwilling to try experiments but had an instinctive perception that there was one daughterinlaw to whom her increased locomotion would scarcely be welcome and by no means wished to make this distaste evident to raymond  cecil would not have been so strong against the risk and imprudence if her wishes had been the other way  moreover she had been warned off from interference with the rectors wife in the village and she did not relish rosamonds making suggestions as to her province as she considered the houseabove all when she viewed that lady as in a state of disgrace  it was nothing less than effrontery and cecil became stiffer and colder than ever  she demanded of her motherin law whether there had been any promise of amendment  oh  julius will see to all that said mrs poynsett  it is a womans question returned cecil  not entirely  fancy a clergymans wife  it mrs venn had appeared in that way at dunstone  you would have left it to mr venn  my dear the less said the sooner mended  cecil was silenced but shocked for she was far too young and inexperienced to understand that indecorous customs complied with as a matter of course do not necessarily denote lack of innate modestyfar less how they could be confounded with home allegiance and as to anne poor rosamond was in her eyes only too like the ladies who impeded christiana on her outset  so her ladyship retreated into languid sleepy dignity towards both her sistersinlaw and on monday evening showed herself for a moment more decolletee if possible than before  mrs poynsett feared lest julius were weak in this matter but at night she had a visit from him  mother he said it will not happen again  say no more  i am only too thankful  what do you think settled it  no less than lady tyrrells admiration  what could she have said  i cant make out  rose was far too indignant to be comprehensible when she told me on the way home but there was something about adopting the becoming and a repetition ofof some insolent praise  and his mother felt his quiver of suppressed wrath  if rose had been what that woman took her for she would have been delighted he continued but  it was horrible to her said his mother  and to you  yes i knew it would right itself and i am glad nothing passed about it between us  so am i she quite separates you from cecil and anne and indeed all her anger is with lady tyrrell  she will have it there was malice in inciting her to shock old friends and annoy youa sort of attempt to sympathize her into opposition  which had a contrary effect upon a generous nature  exactly  she thinks nothing too bad for that woman and declares she is a serpent  thats dear rosamonds anger but i imagine that when i occur to camillas mind it is as the obstructive old hag who once stood in her way and so without any formed designs whatever she says of me is coloured by that view  quite possible and i am afraid the sister is just such another she seems quite to belong to mrs duncombes set  i sat next her at dinner and tried to talk to her but she would only listen to that young strangeways  strangeways  i wonder if that is susan lorimers son  probably for his christian name is lorimer  i knew her rather well as a girl  she was old lord lorimers youngest daughter and we used to walk in the square gardens together but i did not see much of her after i married and after a good while she married a man who had made a great fortune by mining  i wonder what her son is like  he must be the man for he is said to be the millionaire of the regiment  just the match that lady tyrrell would like  ah thats well said mrs poynsett  from your point of view said julius smiling  if he will only speak out before it has had time to go deep with frank     chapter ix cold heart   at that very moment the two sisters in question were driving home in the opposite corners of the carriage in the dark  really lenore was lady tyrrell saying you are a very impracticable girl  there was a little low laugh in answer  what blast has come and frozen you up into ice the elder sister added caressingly but as she felt for eleonoras hand in the dark she obtained nothing but the cold handle of a fan  thats just it she said laughing hard ivory instead of flesh and blood  i cant help it was the answer  but why not  im sure you had admiration enough to turn any girls head  no answer  lady tyrrell renewed her address still more tenderlylenore darling it is quite needful that you should understand your position  i am afraid i understand it only too well came in a smothered voice  it may be very painful but it ought to be made clear before you how you stand  you know that my father was ruinedtheres no word for it but ruined  yes  he had to give up the property to the creditors and live on an allowance  i know that  and of course i cant bear speaking of it but the house is really let to me  i have taken it as i might any other house to let  yes again assented eleonora  and do you know why  you said it was for the sake of the old home and my father said the girl with a bitter emphasis on the said  so it was  it was to give you the chance of redeeming it and keeping it in the family  it is to be sold you know as soon as you are of age and can give your consent  i cant buy it  mine is only a jointure a life income and you know that you might as well think of mary buying golconda but youyouwith such beauty as yoursmight easily make a connection that would save it  there was only a choked sound  i know you feel the situation painfully after having been mistress so long  camilla you know it is not that  ah my dear i can see farther than you avow  you cant marry till you are twentyone you know but you might be very soon engaged and then we should see our way  it only depends on yourself plenty of means and no land to tie him down ready to purchase and to settle down  it would be the very thing and i see you are a thoroughly sensible girl lena  indeed  i am not even sensible enough to know who is to be this purchaser  come lena dont be affected  why he was the only poor creature you were moderately gracious to  i what do you mean  lady tyrrell laughed again  oh in a tone of relief i can explain all that to you  all the strangeways family were at rockpier the winter before you came and i made great friends with margaret strangeways the eldest sister i wanted very much to hear about her for she has had a great deal of illness and trouble and i had not ventured to write to her  oh was that the girl young debenham gave up because her mother worried him so incessantly and who went into a sisterhood  it was she who broke it off  she found he had been forced into it by his family and was really attached elsewhere  i never knew the rights of it till i saw the brother tonight  very praiseworthy family confidence  camilla you know i object to that tone  so do most young ladies my dearat least by word  and once for all you need have no fancies about mr lorimer strangeways  i am civil to him of course for margarets sake and lady susan was very kind to me but if there were nothing else against him he is entirely out of the question for i know he runs horses and bets on them  so does everybody more or less  and you you camilla after what the turf has cost us can wish me to encourage a man connected with it  my dear lena i know you had a great shock which made the more impression because you were such a child but you might almost as well forswear riding as men who have run a few horses or staked a few thousands  every young man of fortune has done so in his turn just by way of experimentas a social duty as often as not  let them said eleonora as long as i have nothing to do with them  what was that pretty french novelsybille was itwhere the child wanted to ride on nothing but swans  you will be like her and have to condescend to ordinary mortals  she did not  she died  and camilla i would far rather die than marry a betting man  a betting man who regularly went in for it  you little goose to think that i would ask you to do that  as you say we have had enough of that  but to renounce every man who has set foot on a course or staked a pair of gloves is to renounce nine out of ten of the world one lives in  i do renounce them  camilla remember that my mind is made up for ever and that nothing shall ever induce me to marry a man who meddles with the evils of races  meddles with the evils  i understand my dear lena  a man who makes a bet repeated eleonora  we shall see was her ladyships light answer in contrast to the grave tones no rules are without exceptions and i only ask for one  i shall make none  i confess i thought you were coming to your senses you have been acting so wisely and sensibly ever since you came home about that young frank charnock  lady tyrrell heard a little rustle but could not see that it was the clasping of two hands over a throbbing heart  i am very glad you are reasonable enough to keep him at a distance  poor boy it was all very well to be friendly with him when we met him in a place like rockpier and you were both children but you are quite right not to let it go on  it would be mere madness  for him yes murmured the girl  and even more so for you  why if he had any property worth speaking of it would be a wretched thing to marry into that family i am sure i pity those three poor girls  miless wife looks perfectly miserable poor thing and the other two cant conceal the state of things  she is just the sort of woman who cannot endure a daughterinlaw  i thought i heard lady rosamond talking very affectionately of her  very excitedly as one who felt it her duty to stand up for her outofdoors whatever she may do indoors  i saw victory in those plump white shoulders which must have cost a battle but whatever lady rosamond gains will make it all the worse for the others  no eleonora i have known mrs poynsetts rancour for many years and i would wish no one a worse lot than to be her sons fiancee except to be his wife  she did not seem to object to these marriages  the sons took her by surprise  besides raymonds was the very parti mothers seek out for their sons  depend upon it she sent him off with her blessing to court the unexceptionable cousin with the family property  poor raymond he is a dutiful son and he has done the deed but if i am not much mistaken the little lady is made of something neither mother nor son is prepared for and he has not love enough to tame her with  that may be seen at a glance  he cant help it poor fellow he would have had it if he could like anything else that is proper  there was a moments silence then the exclamation just look there  one of the hats was nodding on the box in a perilous manner  it is only james said lady tyrrell as long as it is not the coachman it matters the less  theres no danger  you will not keep him though  i dont know  he is much the best looking and handiest of the men and your page master joshua is no great acquisition yet  i wish you would not call him mine i wish you would send him back to his grandmother  i cant bear his being among those men  very complimentary to my household  they are not a bit worse than the company he came from  you dont believe in rural simplicity eh  i believe that taking that boy from his home makes us responsible  and do i hinder you from catechizing him to your hearts content or sending him to the school of design  again eleonora was silent  perhaps the balancing of the footmans head occupied her mind  at any rate no more was said till the sisters had reached their home  then at the last moment when there was no time left for a reply eleonora cleared and steadied her voice and said camilla understand two things for truths sake  first i mean what i say  nothing shall ever induce me to marry a man who bets  next i never have forgotten frank charnock for one moment  if i have been cold and distant to him it is because i will not draw him near me to be cruelly scorned and disappointed  i dont mind the why if the effect is the same were lady tyrrells last words as the door opened  eleonoras little white feet sped quickly up the steps and with a hasty good night she sped across the hall but paused at the door papa must not be disappointed she whispered to herself and dashed her hand over her eyes and at the moment the lock turned and a gray head appeared with a mighty odour of smoke  ah  i thought my little lena would not pass me by  have you had a pleasant party my dear  was young strangeways there  she had nestled in his arms and hoped to avoid notice by keeping her head bent against him as she hastily responded to his questions but he detected something  eh  camilla been lecturing  is that it  youve not been crying little one  it is all right you know  you and i were jolly enough at rockpier but it was time we were taken in hand or you would have grown into a regular little nun among all those black coats  i wish i were  nonsense  you dont know life  youll tell another story one of these days and hark childie when youve married and saved the old place youll keep the old room for the old man and well have our own way again  she could but kiss him and hide her agitation in caresses ere hurrying up the stairs she reached her own rooms a single bed chamber opening into a more spacious sittingroom now partially lighted by the candles on the toilettetable within  she flung herself down on a chair beyond the line of light and panted out half aloud oh  i am in the toils  oh for help  oh for advice  oh if i knew the right  am i unfair am i cold and hard and proud  is she telling me true  no i know she is notnot the whole truth and i dont know what is left out or what is false  and im as badmaking them think i give in and discard frank  oh is that my prideor that it is too bad to encourage him now i know more  hell soon scorn me and leave offwhatever he ever thought of me  she has taken me from all my friendsand she will take him away  no one is left me but papa and though she cant hurt his love she has got his confidence away and made him join against me  but that one thing ill never never do  she started up and opened a locked purple photographalbum with in memoriam inscribed on ither hands trembling so that she could hardly turn the key  she turned to the likeness of a young mana painful likeness of a handsome face where the hard verities of sun painting had refused to veil the haggard trace of early dissipation though the eyes had still the fascinating smile that had made her brother tom with his flashes of fitful goodnature the idol of his little sisters girlhood  the deadly shock of his sudden death had been her first sorrow and those ghastly whispers which she had heard from the servants in the nursery and had never forgotten because of the hushed and mysterious manner had but lately started into full force and meaning on the tongues of the plainspoken poor  she gazed and thought of the wrecked life that might have been so rich in joys nay her tenderness for her father could not hide from her how unlike his old age was from that of mr bowater or of any men who had done their service to their generation in all noble exertion  he had always indeed been her darling her charge but she had never known what it was to look up to him with the fervent belief and enthusiasm she had seen in other girls  to have him amused loitering from readingroom to parade or billiardroom had been all that she aspired to and only lately had she unwillingly awakened to the sense how and why this wasand why the family were aliens in their ancestral home  and camilla who knew allknew and lived through the full force of the blight and miserywould persuade me that it all means nothing and is a mere amusing trifle  trifle indeed that breaks hearts and leads to despair and selfdestruction and dishonour  no no nonothing shall lead me to a gamester though frank may be lost to me  he will be he will be  we deserve that he should be i deserve itif family sins fall on individualsi deserve it  it is better for himbetterbetter  and yet can he forgetany more than ithat sunny day  oh was she luring him on false pretences  what shall i do  how will it be  where is my counsellor  emily emily why did you die  emilys portraitcalm sweet wasted with grave trustful eyeswas in the next page  the lonely girl turned to it and gazed and drank in the soothing influence of the countenance that had never failed to reply with motherly aid and counsel  it rested the throbbing heart and presently with hands clasped and head bent eleonora vivian knelt in the little light closet she had fitted as an oratory and there poured out her perplexities and sorrows     chapter x a truant   since for your pleasure you came here    you shall go back for minecowper  how like dunstone you have made this room said raymond entering his wifes apartment with a compliment that he knew would be appreciated  cecil turned round from her piano to smile and say i wish papa could see it  i hope he will next spring but he will hardly bring mrs charnock home this winter  i am afraid you are a good deal alone here cecil  is there no one you would like to ask  the venns suggested cecil only we do not like them to leave home when we are away but perhaps they would come  raymond could not look as if the proposal were a very pleasing one have you no younglady friends he asked  we never thought it expedient to have intimacies in the neighbourhood said cecil  well we shall have jenny bowater here in a week or two  i thought she was your mothers friend  so she is  she is quite young enough to be yours  i do not see anything remarkable about her  no i suppose there is not but she is a very sensible superior person  indeed  in that commonplace family  poor jenny has had an episode that removes her from the commonplace  did you ever hear of poor archie douglas  was not he a goodfornothing relation of your mother  not that exactly  he was the son of a goodfornothing i grant whom a favourite cousin had unfortunately married but he was an excellent fellow himself and when his father died she had mrs douglas to live in that cottage by the rectory and sent the boy to school with us then she got him into proudfoots officethe solicitor at backsworth agent for everybodys estates hereabouts well there arose an attachment between him and jenny the bowaters did not much like it of course but they are kindhearted and good natured and gave consent provided archie got on in his profession it was just at the time when poor tom vivian was exercising a great deal more influence than was good among the young men in the neighbourhood and george proudfoot was rather a joke for imitating him in every respectfrom the colour of his dogcart to the curl of his dogs tail  i remember his laying a wager and winning it too that if he rode a donkey with his face to the tail proudfoot would do the same but then vivian did everything with a grace and originality  like his sister  and doubly dangerous  every one liked him and we were all more together than was prudent  at last two thousand pounds of my mothers money which was passing through the proudfoots hands disappeared and at the same time poor archie fled  no one who knew him could have any reasonable doubt that he did but bear the blame of some one elses guilt most likely that of george proudfoot but he died a year or two back without a word and no proof has ever been found and alas the week after archie sailed we saw his name in the list of sufferers in a vessel that was burnt  his mother happily had died before all this but there were plenty to grieve bitterly for him and poor jenny has been the more like one of ourselves in consequence  he had left a note for jenny and she always trusted him and we all of us believe that he was innocent  i cant think how a person can go about as usual or ever get over such a thing as that  perhaps she hasnt said raymond with a little colour on his brown cheek  but im afraid i cant make those visits with you to day  i am wanted to see the plans for the new townhall at wilsbro  will you pick me up there  there would be sure to be a dreadful long waiting so i will luncheon at sirenwood instead lady tyrrell asked me to come over any day  alone  i think you had better wait for me  i can take frank  i should prefer a regular invitation to us both  she did not mean to make a formal affair  forms are a protection and i do not wish for an intimacy there especially on franks account  it would be an excellent match for frank  indeed no the estate is terribly involved and there are three daughters besides which the family would despise a younger son an attachment could only lead to unhappiness now besides the positive harm of unsettling him  his tutor tells me that as it is he is very uneasy about his examinationhis mind is evidently preoccupied  no no cecil dont make the intercourse unnecessarily close  the vivians have not behaved well to my mother and it is not desirable to begin a renewal  but you shall not lose your ride cecil ill ask one of the boys to go with you to the beeches and perhaps i shall meet you there  he talks of my lonely life said cecil to herself and yet he wants to keep me from the only person who really understands me all for some rancorous old prejudice of mrs poynsetts  it is very hard  theres no one in the house to make a friend ofrosamond a mere garrison belle and anne bornee and half a dissenter and as soon as i try to make a friend i am tyrannized over and this miss bowater thrust on me  she was pounding these sentiments into a sonata with great energy when her door reopened and raymond again appeared  i am looking for two books of mudies  do you know where they can be  i cant make up the number  they are here said cecil lanfreys vie de napoleon but i have not finished them  the box should have gone ten days ago  my mother has nothing to read and has been waiting all this time for the next part of middlemarch said raymond  she said there was no hurry murmured cecil  no doubt she did but we must not take advantage of her consideration  reading is her one great resource and we must so contrive that your studies shall not interfere with it  he waited for some word of regret but none came and he was obliged to add i must deprive you of the books for the present for she must not be kept waiting any longer but i will see about getting them for you in some other way  i must take the box to the station in the dogcart  he went without a word from her  it was an entirely new light to her that her selfimprovement could possibly be otherwise than the first object with everyone  at home father and mother told one another complacently what cecil was reading and never dreamt of obstructing the virtuous action  were her studies to be sacrificed to an old womans taste for novels  cecil had that pertinacity of nature that is stimulated to resistance by opposition and she thought of the egyptian campaign and her desire to understand the siege of acre  then she recollected that miss vivian had spoken of reading the book and this decided her  ill go to sirenwood look at it and order it no one can expect me to submit to have no friends abroad nor books at home  besides it is all some foolish old family feud and what a noble thing it will be for my resolution and independence to force the two parties to heal the breach and bridge it over by giving miss vivian to frank  in this mood she rang the bell and ordered her horses not however till she had reason to believe the dogcart on the way down the avenue  as she came down in her habit she was met by frank returning from his tutor  have i made a mistake cecil  i thought we were to go out together this afternoon  yes but raymond was wanted at willansborough and i am going to lunch at sirenwood  i want to borrow a book  oh very well ill come if you dont mind  sir harry asked me to drop in and look at his dogs  this was irresistible and frank decided on riding the grooms horse and leaving him to conduct anne to the rendezvous in the afternoonfor charlie had been at sandhurst for the last week running in first to impart the change of scheme to her as she was performing her daily task of reading to his mother  he did so thus  i say anne cecil wants to go to sirenwood first to get a book so lee will bring you to meet us at the beeches at 230  are you going to luncheon at sirenwood asked mrs poynsett  yes cecil wants to go said the dutiful younger brother  i wish you would ask cecil to come in  raymond put himself into such a state of mind at finding me reading madame de sevigne that i am afraid he carried off her books summarily though i told him i was glad of a little space for my old favourites  cecil was however mounted by the time frank came out and they cantered away together reaching the portico of sirenwood in about twenty minutes  cecil had never been in the house before having only left her card though she had often met the sisters  she found herself in a carpeted hall like a supplementary sittingroom where two gentlemen had been leaning over the wide hearth  one a handsome benignantlooking old man with a ruddy face and abundant white whiskers came forward with a hearty greeting  ah young mrs poynsett  delighted to see youfrank charnock youre come in good time we are just going down to see the puppies before luncheon  only ill take mrs poynsett to the ladies first duncombe you dont know mrs raymond poynsettone must not say senior bride but the seniors bride  is that right  no papa said a bright voice from the stairs you havent it at all right mrs charnock poynsett if you pleaseisnt it  i believe so replied cecil  charnock always seems my right name  and you have all the right to retain it that mrs poynsett had to keep hers said lady tyrrell as they went upstairs to her bedroom  how is she  as usual thank you always on the sofa  but managing everything from it  oh yes  never was there such a set of devoted sons models for the neighbourhood  cecil felt a sense of something chiming in with her sources of vexation but she only answered they are passionately fond of her  talk of despotism  commend me to an invalid  ah how delightfully you contrive to keep your hair in order  i am always scolding lenore for coming in dishevelled and you look so fresh and compact here is my sanctum  youll find mrs duncombe there  she drove over in the drag with her husband on their way to backsworth  i am so glad you came there is so much to talk over  if our gentlemen will give us time said mrs duncombe but i am afraid your senator will not be as much absorbed in the dogs as my captain  i did not come with my husband said cecil he is gone to willansborough to meet the architect  ah about the new buildings  i do hope and trust the opportunity will not be wasted and that the drainage will be provided for  you are longing to have a voice there said lady tyrrell laughing  i am  it is preeminently a womans question and this is a great opportunity  i shall talk to every one  little pettitt the hair dresser has some ground there and he is the most intelligent of the tradesmen  i gave him one of those excellent little handbills put forth by the social science committee on sanitary arrangements i thought of asking you to join us in ordering some down and never letting a woman leave our workroom without one  you couldnt do better i am sure said lady tyrrell only whats the use of preaching to the poor creatures to live in good houses when their landlords wont build them and they must live somewhere  make them coerce the landlords said mrs duncombe thats the only way  upheave the masses from beneath  but thats an earthquake said cecil  earthquakes are sometimes wholesome  but the process is not so agreeable that we had not rather avert it said lady tyrrell  all ours at dunstone are model cottages said cecil it is my fathers great hobby  squires hobbies are generally like the silver trough the lady gave her sow said mrs duncombe they come before the poor are prepared and with a spice of the autocrat  come i wont have you shock mrs charnock poynsett said lady tyrrell  you illogical woman  the poor are to demand better houses and the squires are not to build them  the poor are to be fitly housed as a matter of right and from their own sense of selfrespect returned mrs duncombe not a few favourites who will endure dictation picked out for the model cottage  it is the hobby system against which i protest  without quite knowing what was conveyed by it in this instance said lady tyrrell  i am sure there is nothing i wish more than that we had any power of improvement of the cottages here but influence is our only weapon  by the bye mrs poynsett continued mrs duncombe will you give a hint to mrs miles charnock that it will never do to preach to the women at the workingroom  i dont mean holding forth she added seeing cecils look of amazement but improving the occasion talking piously giving tracts and so forth  i thought you gave sanitary tracts said lady tyrrell  that is quite different  i doubt whether the women would see the distinction  a little book is a tract to them  i would abstain rather than let our work get a goody reputation for indoctrinating sectarianism  it would be all up with us we might as well keep a charity school  i dont think the women dislike it said cecil  most likely they think it the correct thing the grain which they must swallow with our benefits but for that very reason it injures the whole tone and prevents them learning independence  put it in that light i know you can  i dont think anne would understand said cecil somewhat flattered  i doubt whether there are three women in the neighbourhood who would said lady tyrrell  people always think charityhow i hate the worda means of forcing their own tenets down the throats of the poor said mrs duncombe  and certainly this neighbourhood is as narrow as any i ever saw  nobody but you andshall i say the present companyhas any ideas  i wonder how they will receive clio tallboys and her husband  ah you have not heard about them said lady tyrrell  most delightful people whom mrs duncombe met on the righi  he is a cambridge professor  tailleboisi dont remember the name said cecil and we know a great many cambridge men  we went to a commencement there  oh not cambridge on the cam the american cambridge said mrs duncombe  he is a quiet inoffensive man great on political economy but his wife is the character  wonderfully brilliant and original and such a lecturer  ladies lectures would startle the natives said lady tyrrell  besides the townhall is lacking said mrs duncombe but when the tallboys come we might arrange a succession of soirees where she might gather her audience  but where said lady tyrrell  it would be great fun and you might reckon on me but where else  mrs charnock poynsett has to think of la belle mere  she has given up the management of all matters of society to me said cecil with dignity you may reckon on me  no hope of the bowaters of course said mrs duncombe  miss bowater is coming to stay with us volunteered cecil  to be near that unlucky life guardsman manque said mrs duncombe  come ill not have honest herbert abused said the other lady he is the only one of the bowaters who has any go in him  mores the pity if he cant use it  is his sister coming to help the reverend julius to drill him  on mrs poynsetts account too i fancy said lady tyrrell jenny bowater is her amateur companion  indeed i believe it was no slight disappointment that her sons appreciation did not quite reach the pitch of the mothers  indeed asked mrs duncombe i thought there had been a foolish affair with poor young douglas  cela nempeche pas  by the bye have you finished fleurange  oh you are quite welcome to it  it is quite as goody as an english tale in one volume  this opened the way to cecils desire to borrow lanfrey not concealing the reason why and she was gratified by the full sympathy of both ladies who invited her in selfdefence to join in their subscription to rolandi to which she eagerly agreed and would have paid her subscription at once if there had not been a term to be finished off first  the gong summoned them to luncheon and likewise brought down miss vivian who shook hands rather stiffly and wore a cold grave manner that did not sit badly on her handsome classical features the countenance was very fine but of the style to which early youth is less favourable than a more mature development and she was less universally admired than was her sister  her dress was a dark maroon merino hanging in simple long straight folds and there was as little distortion in her coiffure as the most moderate compliance with fashion permitted and this with a highbred distinguished deportment gave an air almost of stern severity this deepened rather than relaxed at the greeting from frankwho poor fellow had an uncontrollably wistful eager look in his face a sort of shy entreaty and was under an incapacity of keeping up a conversation with anybody else while trying to catch the least word of hers  she however seemed to have more eyes and ears for her father than for any one else and he evidently viewed her as the darling and treasure of his life  his first question after performing the duties of a host was well my little lenore what have you been doing  the old story papa raising her clear sweet voice to reach his rather deaf ears  got on with your drawingthe child is competing with a club you must know  not exactly papa  it is only a little society that was set on foot at rockpier to help us to improve ourselves  what is your subject this month frank asked  a branch of blackberries she answered briefly  ah said lady tyrrell i saw your pupil bringing in a delicious festoonall black and red fruit and crimson and purple leaves  he is really a boy of taste i think he will do you credit  the new joshua reynolds said frank glad of an excuse to turn towards eleonora  rosamond mentioned her discovery  you might have seen him just now figuring as buttons said lady tyrrell  degradation of art is it not  but it was the only way to save it  lenore is teaching him and if his talent prove worth it we may do something with him  any way the produce of native genius will be grand material for the bazaar  cardboard prettinesses said mrs duncombe you spoil him with them but that youll do any waymake him fit for nothing but a flunkey  unappreciated zeal said lady tyrrell glancing at her sister who flushed a little and looked the more grave  eh lenore said her father wasnt it to please you that camilla made me take your pet to make havoc of my glasses  you meant it so dear papa said eleonora calling up a smile that satisfied the old gentleman  it was very kind in you  fresh subjects were started and on all the talk was lively and pleasant and fascinated cecil not from any reminiscence of dunstonefor indeed nothing could be more unlike the tone that prevailed there  but because it was so different from that of compton poynsett drifting on so unrestrainedly and touching so lightly on all topics  by the close of the meal rain had set in evidently for the afternoon  frank offered to ride home and send the carriage for cecil but the duncombes proposed to take her and drop her at home and to this she consented rather to franks dismay as he thought of their coach appearing at his mothers door  lady tyrrell took her up to resume her hat and on the way moved by distaste to her double surname and drawn on by a fresh access of intimacy she begged to be called cecila privilege of which she had been chary even in her maiden days but the caressing manner had won her heart and spirit of opposition to the discouragement at home did the rest  the request was reciprocated with that pensive look which was so touching  i used to be camilla to all the neighbourhood and here i find myselfmilesno leagues further offbanished to siberia  how unjust and unkind cried cecil  my dear you have yet to learn the gentle uncharitableness of prejudice  it is the prevailing notion that my married life was a career of dissipation  ah if they only knew  the drag is round said mrs duncombes voice at the door in all its decisive abruptness making both start  just ready called lady tyrrell adding in a lower tone ah she is startling but she is genuine  and one must take new friends when the old are chilly  she is the only one  cecils kiss was more hearty than any she had given at compton and she descended but just as she came to the door and was only delaying while frank and captain duncombe were discussing the merits of the four horses the compton carriage appeared in the approach and raymonds head within  lady tyrrell looked at cecil and saw it was safe to make a little gesture with the white skin of her fair brow expressing unutterable things  mrs duncombe lost no time in asking if any steps were being taken for improving the drainage to which raymond replied no that was not the business in hand  this was the architecture of the town hall  splendour of municipality above and fever festering below said mrs duncombe  wilsborough is not unhealthy said raymond  she laughed ironically  the corporation have been told that they have an opportunity said raymond but it takes long to prepare peoples minds to believe in the expedience of such measures  if whitlock could be elected mayor there would be some chance but i am afraid they are sure to take truelove and as things are at wilsborough we must move all at once or not at all  individual attempts would do more harm than good  ah you fear for your seat said the plainspoken lady  raymond only chose to answer by a laugh and would not pursue the subject so treated  he was politeness itself to all but he withstood lady tyrrells earnest entreaties to come in and see some florentine photographs growing stiffer and graver each moment while his wife waxed more wrathful at the treatment which she knew was wounding her friend and began almost to glory in having incurred his displeasure herself  indeed this feeling caused the exchange of another kiss between the ladies before sir harry handed cecil into the carriage and raymond took the yellow paper books that were held out to her  looking at the title as they drove off he said quietly i did not mean to deprive you cecil i had ordered lanfrey from bennet for you  she was somewhat abashed but was excited enough to answer thank you  i am going to join lady tyrrell and mrs duncombe in a subscription to rolandis  he started and after a pause of a few moments said gently are you sure that mr and mrs charnock would like to trust your choice of foreign books to mrs duncombe  taking no notice of the point of this question she replied if it is an object to exchange books at home faster than i can read them properly i must look for a supply elsewhere  you had better subscribe alone he replied still without manifest provocation  that would be uncivil now  i take that upon myself  wherewith there came a silence while cecil swelled as she thought of the prejudice against her friend and raymond revolved all he had ever heard about creatures he knew so little as women to enable him to guess how to deal with this one  how reprove so as not to make it worse  ought not his silent displeasure to suffice  and in such musings the carriage reached home  it had been an untoward day  he had been striving hard against the stream at willansborough  the drainage was not only scouted as an absurd unreasonable and expensive fancy but the architect whom he had recommended in the hope that he would insist on groundwork which might bring on the improvement had been rejected in favour of a kinsman of mr briggs the outgoing mayor a youth of the lower walk of the professionnot the scholar and gentleman he had desired for the tradesman intellect fancied such a person would be expensive and unmanageable  twin plans for church and townhall had been produced which to raymonds taste savoured of the gimcrack style but which infinitely delighted all the corporation and where he was the only cultivated gentleman except the timid vicar his reasonings were all in vain the plan was accepted for the townhall and the specifications were ordered to be made out for competition and a rate decided on  the church was to wait for subscription and bazaar the drains for reason in wilsbro or for the hope of the mayoralty of mr whitlock a very intelligent and superior linendraper     chapter xi rosamonds apologue   pray sir do you laugh at metitle of old caricature  was cecils allegiance to dunstone or was it to the heiress of dunstone  tests of allegiance consist in very small matters and it is not always easy to see the turningpoint  now cecil had always stood on a pinnacle at dunstone and she had found neither its claims nor her own recognized at compton  one kind of allegiance would have remained on the level and retained the same standard whether accepted or not  another would climb on any pinnacle that any one would erect for the purpose and become alienated from whatever interfered with such eminence  so as nobody seemed so willing to own cecils claims to county supremacy as lady tyrrell her bias was all towards sirenwood and whereas such practices as prevailed at dunstone evidently were viewed as obsolete and narrow by these new friends cecil was willing to prove herself superior to them and was far more irritated than convinced when her husband appealed to her former habits  the separation of the welfare of body and soul had never occurred to the beneficence of dunstone and it cost cecil a qualm to accept it but she could not be a goody in the eyes of sirenwood and besides she was reading some contemporary literature which made it plain that any religious instruction was a most unjustifiable interference with the great law am i my brothers keeper and so when she met anne with a handful of texts neatly written out in printing letters she administered her warning  cecil and anne had become allies to a certain extent chiefly through their joint disapproval of rosamond not to say of julius and the order was so amazing that anne did not at first take it in and when she understood that all mention of religion was forbidden she said i do not think i ought to yield in this  surely said cecil there is no connection between piety and cutting out  i dont know said anne but it does not seem to me to be right to go on with a work where my masters name is forbidden  religion ought never to be obtruded said cecil  the word ought to flavour everything in season or out of season said anne thoughtfully  oh thats impossible  its your narrow view  if you thrust preaching into everything we can never work together  oh then said anne quickly i must give it up  and she turned away with a rapid step to carry her texts back to her room  anne called cecil i did not mean that  anne paused for a moment looked over the baluster and repeated firmly no cecil it would be denying christ to work where his name is forbidden  perhaps there was something in the elevation and the carved rail that gave the idea of a pulpit for cecil felt as if she was being preached at and turned her back indignant and vexed at what she had by no means intended to incurthe loss of such a useful assistant as she found in anne  such nonsense she said to herself as she crossed the hall alone there meeting with rosamond equipped for the village  is not anne going today she said as she saw the ponycarriage at the door  no  it is so vexatious  she is so determined upon preaching to the women that i have been obliged to put a stop to it  indeed  i should not have thought it of poor anne but no one can tell what those semidissenters think right  when she declared she ought to do it in season or out of season what was one to do said cecil  i thought that was for clergymen said rosamond hitting the right nail on the head in her ignorance as so often happened  she sees no difference said cecil  shall i drive you down she added graciously according to the fashion of uniting with one sisterinlaw against the other and rosamond not only accepted but asked to be taken on to willansborough to buy a birthday present for her brother terry get stamps for an indian letter and perform a dozen more commissions that seemed to arise in her mind with the opportunity  her two brothers were to spend the christmas holidays with her and she was in high spirits and so communicative about them that she hardly observed how little interest cecil took in terrys achievements  who is that she presently asked with those redhaired children it looked like miss vivians figure  i believe it was  julius and i often see her walking about the lanes but she passes likelike a fireflaught whatever that is just bows and hardly ever speaks  she is a strange girl said cecil  lady tyrrell says she cannot draw her into any of her interests but she will go her own way  like poor anne  no not out of mere moping and want of intellect like anne  but lady tyrrell says she feels for her she was brought a great deal too forward and was made quite mistress of the house at rockpier being her fathers darling and all and now it is trying to her though it is quite wholesome to be in her proper place  it is a pity she is so bitter over it and flies off her own way  that boy said rosamond i hope she does something for his good  she teaches him i believe but theres another instance of her strange ways  she was absolutely vexed when lady tyrrell took him into the house though he was her protege only because it was not done in her way  it is a great trial to camilla  i could fancy a reason for that said rosamond  julius does not like the tone of the household at all  but she added hastily who could those children be  they did not look quite like poor children  ah she is always taking up with some odd person in her own away said cecil  but here we are  will you drive on to the hotel or get out here  when at the end of two hours the sistersinlaw met at the work room and rosamond had taken a survey of the row of needlewomen coming up one by one to give their work be paid and dismissed there was a look of weariness and vexation on cecils face  she had found it less easy to keep order and hinder gossip and had hardly known how to answer when that kind lady mrs miles charnock had been asked after but she would have scorned to allow that she had missed her assistant and only politely asked how rosamond had sped  oh excellently  people were so well advised as to be out so i paid off all my calls  you did not return your calls without julius  theres nothing he hates so much  i would not have dragged him with me on any account  i think it is due to ones self  ah but then i dont care what is due to myself  i saw a friend of yours cecil  who  mrs duncombe said rosamond  i went to pettittsthe little perfumer you know that julius did so much for at the fire and there she was leaning on the counter haranguing him confidentially upon setting an example with sanatory measures  sanitary corrected cecil sanitas is health sano to cure people never know the difference  certainly i dont said rosamond  it must be microscopic  only it shows the difference between culture and the reverse said cecil  well you know im the reverse said rosamond leaning sleepily back and becoming silent but cecil was too anxious for intelligence to let her rest and asked on what mrs duncombe was saying  i am not quite sureshe was stirring up his public spirit i think about the drainage and they were both of them deploring the slackness and insensibility of the corporation and canvassing for mr whitlock as i believe  it struck me as a funny subject for a lady but i believe she does not stick at trifles  no real work can be carried out by those who do said cecil  oh added rosamond i met mrs and miss bowater and they desired me to say that jenny cant come till the dinnerparty on the 20th and then they will leave her  how cool to send a message instead of writing  oh she has always been like one of themselves like a sister to them all  i cant bear that sort of people  what sort  who worm themselves in  miss bowater could have no occasion for worming  they must be quite on equal terms  at any rate she was only engaged to their poor relation  what poor relation  tell me  who told you  raymond  it was a young attorneya kind of cousin of the poynsett side named douglas  what  theres a cross in the churchyard to elizabeth douglas daughter of francis poynsett and wife of james douglas and at the bottom another inscription to archibald douglas her son lost in the hippolyta  yes that must be the man  he was flying from england having been suspected of some embezzlement  indeed  and was jenny engaged to him  julius told me that mrs douglas had been his mothers dearest friend and that this archie had been brought up with them but he did not say any more  perhaps he did not like having had a cousin in an attorneys office  i am sure i had no notion of such a thing  rosamond laughed till she was exhausted at the notion of juliuss sharing the fastidious objections she heard in cecils voice and then struck by the sadness of the story she cried and that makes them all so fond of miss bowater  poor girl what must she not have gone through  and yet how cheerful she does look  people say proceeded cecil unable to resist the impulse to acquire a partaker in her halfjealous aversion that it was a great disappointment that mrs poynsett could not make her sons like her as much as she did herself  oh cried rosamond how little peace we should have if we always heeded what people say  people that know persisted cecil  not very wise or very kind people to say so quoth rosamond though by the bye the intended sting is happily lost considering that it lies among five  why should you assume a sting  because i see you are stung and want to sting me said rosamond in so merry a tone that the earnestness was disguised  i  im not stung  what mrs poynsett or miss bowater may have schemed is nothing to me said cecil with all her childish dignity  people talk of irish imagination said rosamond in her lazy meditative tone  well demanded cecil sharply  only it is not my irish imagination that has devised this dreadful picture of the artful jenny and mrs poynsett spinning their toils to entrap the whole five brothers  come cecil take my advice and put it out of your head  suppose it were true small blame to mrs poynsett  what do you mean said cecil in a voice of hurt dignity  i may mean myself  and rosamonds peal of merry laughter was most amazing and inexplicable to her companion who was not sure that she was not presuming to laugh at her  there was a silence broken at last by rosamond  cecil i have been tumbled about the world a good deal more than you have and i never found that one got any good by disregarding the warnings of the natives  theres an immense deal in the cat and the cock  i do not understand said cecil  whereupon rosamond in a voice as if she were telling the story to a small child began  once upon a time there was a wee bit mousiekie that lived in giberatie othat trotted out of her hole upon an exploring expedition  by and by she came scuttling back in a state of great trepidationin fact horribly nervous  mother mother said the little mouse ive seen a hideous monster with a red face and a voice like a trumpet and a pair of spurs  of course i know that broke in cecil  ah you havent heard all  i should have died of terror said the little mouse only that i saw a dear sweet graceful creature with a lovely soft voice and a smooth coat and the most beautiful eyes and the most exquisite pathetic expression in her smile and she held out her velvet paw to me and said dear little mousiekie pousie youre the loveliest creature i ever met quite unappreciated in these parts  that horrid old cock is terribly vulgar and commonplace and never you believe your mother if she tells you he is better worth cultivating than one who has such a deep genuine love and appreciation of all the excellences of all mice and of you in particular with your dun fur  rosamond could not for her very life help putting in that word dun and cecil who had been driving straight on with her eyes fixed on her ponys ears and rather a sullen expression of forced endurance faced about  what you mean by all this i dont know but if you think it applies to me or my friends you are much mistaken  i told you said rosamond with the same languor looking out under her halfshut eyes that i apply things to myself  ive met both sorts in my time  and silence reigned for the rest of the way  cecil had read many more books knew much more and was altogether a far more cultivated personage than the lady rosamond but she was not half so ready in catching the import of spoken words and all this time she was by no means certain whether all this meant warning or meant mockery though either was equally impertinent and must be met with the same ladylike indifference which cecil trusted that she had never transgressed  neither of them nor indeed any other living creature knew of a little episode which had occurred about eighteen months previously when joanna bowater had been taking care of mrs poynsett during raymonds first absence from home after her accident  of course he took her back to strawyers as soon as he arrived and about half way after a prolonged and unusual silence he said jenny i believe we know one anothers histories pretty well  it would be a great happiness and blessing if you could bring yourself to sink the past so far as to take me and become indeed my mothers daughter do not answer me in haste  think it over and tell me if it is possible  jenny let him drive on more than a mile before she spoke and when she did the tears stood on her cheek and it was quite an effort that her voice was made steady  no raymond i am very sorry but it will not do  two griefs will not make one joy  yes they would to my mother  ah there it lies  indeed raymond i do feel for you all so much especially your dear mother that i would bring myself to it if i could but the very thought brings archie up so vividly before me that i cannot  he has almost seemed to be sitting by me all this time  it seems as though beginning again would kill my right to think of him foremost of all  i could bear with that and trust to time said raymond  think it over jenny  i will be candid with you  the old delusion was too strong for any repetition of that kind as you may see by the lame performance i am making now  jenny gave a little agitated laugh and ejaculated dear raymond then added it is not on your account but mine  but he added my marriage is becoming a necessity if only for my mothers sake and you stand far before any other woman with me if that would but satisfy you  i verily believe that in a short time we should be just as comfortable together as if we could start with more romance  i dare say we should dear raymond said jenny but i cannot feel that it is the right thing while i have not that feeling for you which overpowers everything else it seems to me that i ought not to give up my place at home  papa depends on me a good deal and they both will want me more and more  less than my mother  i dont know and they are my first duty  i can always come to your mother when i am wanted and i know in your secret soul you prefer me on those terms  he made no answer only when passing the lodge he said will you consider it a little longer jenny  but this only resulted in a note  dear raymondconsidering only shows me that i must be archie douglass now and for ever  i cant help it  it is better for you for you can find some young girl who can wake your heart again as never could be done by your still affectionate j b  raymond and jenny had met so often since that the matter was entirely past and no one ever guessed it  at any rate rosamond the most ready to plunge into counsel to cecil was the least likely to have it accepted rosamond had foibles of her own that cecil knew of and censured freely enough within herself  that neverending question whether what became the colonels daughter became the clergymans wife would crop up under endless forms  rosamond in all opinions was goodnatured and easy and always for pardon and toleration to an extent that the compton code could not understand  she could not bear that anybody should be punished or shut out of anything while there was no denying that now the first novelty was passing she was very lazy as to her parochial work and that where her feelings were not stirred she was of little use  julius seemed shamefully tolerant of her omissions and likewise of her eagerness for all gaieties  he would not go himself would not accept a dinner invitation for any of the three busy nights of the week and refused all those to dances and balls for himself though he never hindered rosamonds going  she used absolutely to cry with passionate entreaties that he would relent and come with her declaring that he was very unkind he knew it took away all her pleasurehe was a tyrant and wanted her not to go  and then he smiled and owned that he hoped some day she would be tired of it whereat she raged and begged him to forbid her if he really thought her whole life had been so shocking declaring in the same breath that she would never disown her family or cast a slur on her mother and sisters  it always ended in her going and though never again offending as by her bridal gown she seldom failed to scandalize cecil by an excess of talking and of waltzing such as even raymond regretted and which disabled her for a whole day after from all but sofa sleep novels and yawns  was this the person whose advice the discreet heiress of dunstone was likely to follow  it may be mentioned here among other elements of difficulty that cecils maid grindstone was a thorough dunstonite who kept herself to herself was perfectly irreproachable lived on terms of distant civility with the rest of the household never complained but constantly led her young mistress to understand that she was enduring much for her sake  cecil was too well trained and so was she for a word of gossip or censure to pass between them but the influence was not the less strong     chapter xii pastoral visiting   a fingers breadth at hand may mar a world of light in heaven afar a mote eclipse a glorious star    an eyelid hide the skykeble  the dinner was over and cecil was favouring the audience with a severely classical piece of music when under cover thereof a low voice said to julius now really and truly tell me how he is getting on  really and truly jenny  well not as you would tell mamma for instance but as you think in your secret soul  i am sorry you think me so duplex  come you understand how anxious i am about the boy  exactly  and they both laughed  is that all said joanna bowater  really and truly it is  rose can manage him much better than i can  he is very fond of her but does heis heis his heart in his work asked the sister looking with her honest eyes earnestly at julius her contemporary and playfellow as a child and afterwards the companion with whom she had worked out many a deep problem rendering mutual assistance that made each enter in no common degree into the inner thoughts of the other  julius smiled  i doubt whether he has come to his heart yet  why should he be so young  think what you were at twentythree  i never had herberts physique and that makes an immense difference  i had no taste or capacity for what is a great privation to a fine young fellow like him  dont look startled  he attempts nothing unfitting he is too good and dutiful but  yes i know what that but means  nothing to be unhappy about  you know how blameless he has always been at eton and oxford and though he may view his work rather in a schoolboy aspect and me as a taskmaster as long as he is doing right the growth is going on  dont be unhappy jenny  his great clear young voice is delightful to hear he is capital at choral practices and is a hero to all the old women and boys the more so for the qualities that earnestness cannot give but rather detracts from  you mean that he is not in earnest  dont pervert all i say  he is not past the time of life when all appointed work seems a task and any sort of excuse a valid cause against it but he is conscientious and always goodhumoured under a scoldingand rosamond does not spare him he added laughing  then you dont think there has been a mistake about him said jenny in a low voice of alarm  i have little doubt that when anything develops his inner life so as to overcome the great strong animal that demands play and exercise he will be a most useful clergyman  perhaps he is too young though i dont see how it could be helped papa always intended it because of the living and herbert never wished anything else  i thought he really desired it but now i dont know whether he did not only take it as a matter of course  obedience is no unwholesome motive  as things stood to delay his ordination would have been a stigma he did not deserve and though he might have spent a year with advantage in a theological college pupilage might only have prolonged his boyhood  it must be experience not simply years of study that deepens him  ah those studies  to tell the truth thats what i am most uneasy about  i take care he should have two hours every forenoon and three evenings every week free but when a man is in his own neighbourhood and so popular i am afraid he does not get many evenings at home and i cant hinder bindon from admonishing him  no said the sister nothing will stir him till the examination is imminent but i will try what i can do with him for the present here he comes the dear old idle fellow  joanie here you are at last in conclave with the rector  lady rose wants me to sing and you must accompany me  no one is so jolly for picking one up  picking one up was apt to be needed by herbert who had a good ear and voice but had always regarded it as bosh to cultivate them except for the immediately practical purposes that had of late been forced on him  the choral society had improved him but jenny was taken aback by being called on to accompany him in mrs browns luggage and his father made his way up to him saying eh herbert is that the last clerical fashion  tis my rectoress who sets me on sir was herberts merry answer looking at her  now lady rose youll keep me in countenance  my father has never heard you sing coming through the rye  no no herbert my singing is only to amuse little boys  heres the higher order of art  for cecil was leading a young lady to the piano and looking as if she by no means approved of such folly though everybody had listened to the poor old cockatoo laughed and applauded heartily and the ensuing performance seemed to be unappreciated by any one except raymond and cecil themselves  anne was sitting in a corner of the sofa with a straight back and weary face having been driven out into the throng by the old friends who came to sit with mrs poynsett but she brightened as miss bowater took a seat beside her and accepted her inquiries for captain charnock far more graciously than the many which had preceded them  was not her likeness in his album  and had he not spoken of her as one whom anne would like  soon joanna had led her to tell not only of miless last letter but of those from glen fraser of which she had spoken to no one under the impression that nobody cared  she even spoke of the excellent farm and homestead which mr van dorp wanted to sell before going to the free state and which her father thought would exactly suit miles  does he mean to settle there  oh yes he promised me to leave the navy and take me home as soon as this voyage is over said anne eagerly  if the salamanca only puts in for long enough he might run up to glen fraser and see bocksfeld stoop and settle it all at once  i am sure he would be delighted with it and it is only two miles from mr pilgrims  im afraid you can never feel this like home said jenny  miles wanted me to know his family and thought i should be useful to his mother said anne but she does not want anything i could do for her  if she has raymond she seems to need nobody else  and have you nothing to do  i have letters to write to miles and to them all at home and i am making a whole set of shirts and stockings for papa and the boysit will spare mamma and jeanie and i have plenty of time  too much i am afraid  but herbert said you were very useful at the work society at wilsbro  not now  indeed  no in the old cold dry tone  but while jenny was doubting whether to inquire further innate sympathy conquered and anne added i wonder whether i did wrong  as how asked joanna kindly  they saidshe lowered her voicei must never speak on religious subjects  how do you mean  what had you done  one day i found a woman crying because her husband had gone away to seek work so i told her my husband was further away and repeated the texts i like  she was so much comforted that i printed them on a card for her  was that all  no there was another poor dear that was unhappy about her baby and when i bade her pray for it she did not know how so i had to tell her a little  there is one who does know her saviour and i did love to have a few words of peace with her  and was that what was objected to  yes they said it would change the whole character of the institution  who did  cecilmrs charnock poynsett  i think lady tyrrell and mrs duncombe desired her  i thought it was no place for me where i might not speak one word for christ and i said so but since i have wondered whether the old adam did not speak in me and i ought to have gone on  my wonder said jenny indignantly would be what right they had to stop you  this was private interference not from the vicar or the committee  but i am not a real visiting lady  i only go to help cecil  i see but why didnt you ask julius what was right  he would have told you  oh no i could not  why not  it would seem like a complaint of cecil  besides  besides  i dont think julius is a christian  the startling announcement was made in so humble and mournful a voice as almost to disarm jennys resentment and before she had recovered enough for a reply she was called to take leave of her parents  her brother was the professed object of her visit and she was only at the hall because there was no accommodation at his lodgings so that she had no scruple in joining the early breakfast spread for the rector and his wife so as to have the morning free for him but she found julius alone saying that his wife was tired after the party and to jennys offer to take her class he replied thank you it will be a great kindness if you will teach but rose has no regular class  teaching is not much in her line and it is a pity she should have to do it but we have to make the most of the single hour they allow us for godliness  dont you utilize mrs charnock or is she not strong enough for early hours  poor anne  the truth is i am afraid of her  i fancy all her doctrine comes out of the westminster catechism  could calvinism be put in at seven years old  would not it be a pouring of stiff glue into a narrownecked phial  resultnil  a few pure drops might got inand you could give her books  it had struck me that it might be wholesome work for her but the childrens good must stand first  and timid and reserved as she seems she insisted on preaching at the workroom so that cecil had to put a stop to it  are you certain about that preaching  rose heard of it from cecil herself  did she ask what it amounted to  i dont know perhaps i had better find out  i remember it came after that ride to sirenwood  by the bye jenny i wish cecil could be hindered from throwing herself into that oak of broceliande  are not you so suspicious that you see the waving arms and magic circles everywhere  a friendship with any one here is so unnatural that i cant but think it a waving of hands boding no good  and there is worse than friendship in that quarter too  oh but lenore is quite different  a vivienne still said julius bitterly  if she costs poor frank nothing more than his appointment it will be well  i dont understand  she caught him in her toils two years ago at rockpier and now she is playing fast and loose with himwithdrawing as i believe and at any rate keeping the poor foolish boy in such an agitation that he cant or wont settle to his reading and driver thinks he will break down  i cant think it of lenoreoh good morning raymond  good morning  may i come to breakfast number one  i have to go to backsworth  yes said jenny we told papa it was too bad to put you on the prison committee  what does your wife say  my wife has so many occupations that she is very sufficient for herself said raymond  i hope you will get on with her jenny if she could only be got to think you intellectual  me  o raymond youve not been telling her so exclaimed jenny laughing heartily  a very superior coach in divinity c said julius in a tone half banter half earnest  but jenny exclaimed in distress no no no say nothing about that  it would never do for herbert to have it known  dont let him guess that you know  quite right jenny never fear said julius though it is tempting to ask you to take frank in hand at the same time  have you seen anything of the vivians asked raymond  very little  i hoped to see something of eleonora from hence  i cant understand that young lady said julius  she was very friendly when first we met her but now she seems absolutely repellant  tant mieux raymond  they seem inclined to take up all the good works in hand said jenny  by the bye what is all this story about raymond affronting wilsbro by stirring up their gutters  papa has been quite in a state of mind for fear they should take offence and bring in mr moy  julius only thinks i have not stirred the gutters enough said raymond  and after all it is not i but whitlock  i was in hopes that matters might have been properly looked after if whitlock had been chosen mayor this year but somehow a cry was got up that he was going to bring down a sanitary commission and put the town to great expense and actually this towncouncil have been elected because they are opposed to drainage  and truelove the grocer is mayor  yes one of the most impracticable men i ever encountered  one cant get him so much as to understand anything  now briggs does understand only he goes by pounds s d  posterity has done nothing for me and i will do nothing for posterity is his principle said julius  moreover he is a baptist  no chance for the church in his time said jenny  theres the less harm in that said raymond that the plan is intolerable  briggss nephew took the plan of what he calls a german rathouse for the townhall made in gilt gingerbread and then adapted the church to a beautiful similarity  if that could be staved off by waiting for the bazaar or by any other means there might be a chance of something better  so poor fuller thinks though he is not man enough to speak out at once  then the bazaar is really fixed  so far as the resolution goes of the lady population though julius is sanguine and hopes to avert it  after all i believe the greatest obstructive to improvement is moy  old mr proudfoots soninlaw said jenny  i know he has blossomed out in great splendour on our side of the county and his daughter is the general wonder  papa is always declaring he will set up in opposition to you  not much fear of that said raymond  but the man provokes me he has so much apparent seriousness  even to the persecution of dr easterby put in julius  and yet he is the great supporter of that abominable publichouse in water lane the three pigeonswhich unluckily escaped the fire  he owns it and all those miserable tenements beyond it and nothing will move him an inch towards doing any good there  i remember said jenny papa came home very angry on the licensing day the police had complained of the three pigeons and the magistrates would have taken away the license but that mr moy made such a personal matter of it  you dont mean that he is a magistrate exclaimed julius  yes said raymond  he got the ear of the lordlieutenant  and since he has lived at the lawn they have all quite set up for county people or anything you please said jenny a little bitterly  mrs moy drives about with the most stylish pair of ponies and as to miss gussie she is making herself into a proverb i cant bear them  well done jenny exclaimed julius  perhaps it is wrong said jenny in a low voice  i dare say i am not just  you know i always did think mr moy could have cleared archie if he would she added with a slightly trembling tone  so did i said raymond  i gave him the opportunity after george proudfoots death but when the choice lay between two memories one could hardly wonder if he preferred to shield his brotherinlaw  or himself said jenny under her breath  come jenny said julius feeling that the moment for interruption had come it is time we should be off  methinks there are sounds as if the whole canine establishment at mrs hornblowers were prancing up to meet us  so it proved and jenny had to run the gauntlet through the ecstasies of all the dogs whose ecclesiastical propriety was quite overthrown for they danced about her to the very threshold of the church and had to have the door shut on their very noses  that drop of bitterness which her sad brief story could not fail to have left in poor joannas heart either passed out of mind in what followed or was turned into the prayer and to turn their hearts and she was her bright self again for her promised assistance at the school  then herberts address was come joan i promised to take you to see the reevess pheasant at the outwood lodge  such a jolly old woman  the pheasant  no the keepers mother  tail a yard long  i dont see why we shouldnt turn them out at home  if father wont take it up i shall write to phil  thank you herbs  hadnt you better secure a little reading first i could wait ive got to write to will  the post doesnt go till five  but i want to get it done  the mail goes tomorrow  youll do it much better after a walk  i cant understand anything after the fumes of the school unless i do a bit of visiting first and that pheasant is a real stunner  it really is parish work jenny  look here this is what im reading her  learn to die said jenny laughing heartily  nothing could be more appropriate only you should have begun before october  you choose to make fun of everything answered herbert gruffly and jenny deciding that she would see a specimen day made her peace by consenting to share in the pastoral visit whether to pheasant or peasant  indeed a walk with herbert was one of the prime pleasures of her lifeand this was delightful along broad gravelled drives through the autumnal woods with tinted beechleaves above and brackens of all shades of brown green and yellow beneath  and it was charming to see herberts ways with the old womana dainty old dame such as is grown in the upper ranks of service whom he treated with a hearty bantering coaxing manner which she evidently enjoyed extremely  his reading for he did come to more serious matters was very goodin a voice that without effort reached deaf ears and with feeling about it that did a great deal to reassure his sister that there was something behind the big bright boy  but by the time he had done the honours of all the pheasants and all the dogs and all the ferrets and all the stuffed birds and all the eggs for the keeper was a bit of a naturalist and had discussed mr franks last days shooting it was so late that jenny had only just time to walk back to the hall at her best pace to see mrs poynsett for a few minutes before luncheon and her reception was is that herberts step  call him in my dearyou must make the most of your sister herbert  come in to all meals while she is here  he heard with gratitudehis sister with consternation  if forenoon pastoral visits were to be on that scale and he dined out whenever he was not at school or at church how would his books fare and yet she could not grudge his pleasure  she could not help looking half foolish half sad when she met the rectors eye  julius thought so much of her advice as to knock at cecils sittingroom door and beg to ask her a question and as she liked to be consulted she welcomed him hospitably into that temple sacred to culture and to dunstonefull of drawings books and china  i was thinking he said of offering anne some parish work  i wanted to know if you saw any objection  certainly not i have not been able to make acquaintance yet with all our tenants but they seem quite to understand the difference in our positions said cecil with due deliberation  julius choked his amusement and waived that point  but did you not feel obliged to decline her services at the wilsbro work room  that was quite another thing  what was most undesirable in such an institution would be all very well for your old women  what kind of thing  talking piously giving away texts and so on just the way to make the women think we intended to impose religious instruction and give a sectarian character defeating our own object  was there any flaw in what she said  i cant tell what she said  it was just a little murmur over the work  not preaching  not in that sense said cecil with a little compunction  i am glad to hear it it makes a great difference  you see said the lady our institution is merely intended to support these women in the time of want and if we were to couple our assistance with religion we should just sink into a mothers meeting and make the women think  think that you prize the soul more than the body said julius as she halted in search of a word  i understand cecil you would not be in the prevailing fashion  i dont want to argue that point only to understand about anne  so saying he went at once to annes abode the old schoolroom which like everything else belonging to mrs miles charnock had a sadcoloured aspect although it had been fitted up very prettily the light was sombre and all the brighter pictures and ornaments seemed to have been effaced by a whole gallery of amateur photographs in which the glories of the african bush were represented by brown masses of shade variegated by blotches of white  even in miless own portrait on the table the gold seemed overwhelmed by the dark blue and even as julius entered she shut it up in its brown case as too sacred for even his brothers eyes  however a flush of pleasure came to her pale face at the invitation to take a class and to read to a good old woman whom in his secret soul he thought so nearly a dissenter that she could not be made more so  she promised her help with some eagerness for as long as she should remain in england and accepted the books he gave her without protest  nay that same evening she took jenny off into her gray abode to consult her whether since she must now join the early breakfast she could go to daily service without becoming formal  she even recurred to her question whether julius was a christian without nearly as much negation in her tones as before and jenny taking it as it was meant vouched for his piety so as might render it a little more comprehensible to one matured on scottish calvinism and english methodism diluted in devout undogmatic minds with no principle more developed than horror of popery and of worldliness turned loose in solitude reserve and sadness on her husbands family who did nothing but shock her with manifestations of the latter she could hardly turn even to the clerical portion of it while julius as well as his curates bore all the tokens by which she had been taught to know a papist  daily intercourse was perhaps drawing her a little towards her brotherinlaw but herbert bowater united these obnoxious externals to a careless tongue and joyous easygoing manner and taste for amusement which so horrified anne that she once condoled with his sister and proposed to unite in prayer for his conversion but this was more than joanna could bear and she cried i only wish i were as good a christian as dear herbert  for indeed the sisters heart intensely esteemed his sweetness honesty and simplicity even while she found it an uphill task to coax him to steady work  after that first morning he was indeed ashamed to let her see the proportion between his pastoral visits and his theological reading but the newspapers he had two or three weekly ones had a curious facility of expansion and there was a perilous sound in ill just see where the meet isnot that he had the most distant idea of repairing thither it was pure filial interest in learning where his father and edith would be  jenny could not tell whether her presence conduced to diligence or to chatter but he minded her more than any one else and always stuck close to her insisting on her admiring all his proteges there was one with whom he was certainly doing a work which as julius truly said no one more clerical could have done so well namely the son of his landlady a youth who held a small clerkship in an office at willansborough and who had fallen this year under the attraction of the backsworth races so as to get into serious difficulties with his master and narrowly escape dismissal for the sake of his mother  the exceeding goodnature and muscular christian side of the lodgers character was having a most happy effect on the lad  he had set up a regular heroworship which herbert encouraged by always calling for him when going to the choral practices getting him into the choir lending him books and inviting him to read in his room in the evening  how much they played with the dogs was not known but at any rate harry hornblower was out of mischief and his mother was so grateful to mr bowater that she even went the length of preferring his sermons to those of both his seniors  the discovery that most vexed jenny was that sirenwood had so much of his time  he seemed to be asked to come to dinner whenever sir harry saw him or a chair was left vacant at a party and though his rector was inexorable as to releasing him on casual notice from the parish avocations of three nights in the week the effect was grumbling as savage as was possible from so goodhumoured a being and now and then a regular absence without leave and a double growl at the consequent displeasure  it was true that in ten minutes he was as hearty and friendly as ever to his colleagues but that might be only a proof of his disregard of their reproofs and their small effect  eleonora vivian was not the attraction  no herbert thought her a proud silent disagreeable girl and could see no beauty in her but he had a boys passion for the matured splendour of her sisters beauty and she was so kind to him  what could jenny mean by looking glum about it  she was stunningly good and all that  she had done no end of good with clubs and mothers meetings at her married home and it was no end of a pity she was not in compton parish instead of under poor wretched old fuller whom you could not stirno not if you tied a firebrand to his tail     chapter xiii withered leaves and fresh buds   lady rosamond and joanna bowater could not fail to be good friends herbert was a great bond of union and so was mrs poynsett rosamond found it hard to recover from the rejection of her scheme of the wheeledchair and begged jenny to become its advocate but mrs poynsett listened with a smile of the unpromising kindyou too jenny  why not dear mrs poynsett  how nice it would be to see you in your own corner again  i dont think my own corner remains  oh but it could be restored at once  do you think so  no no jenny my dear cracked china is better left on the shelf out of the way even if it could bear the move which it cant  then jenny understood and advised rosamond to bide her time and wait till the session of parliament when the house would be quieter and rosamond nodded and held her peace  the only person who held aloof was cecil who would not rise to the bait when raymond tried to exhibit miss bowater as a superior intellectual woman  unluckily too jenny observed one evening at the five oclock tea i hear that mrs duncombe has picked up some very funny peoplea lady lecturer who is coming to set us all to rights  a wonderful pair i hear said frank  mrs clio tallboys she calls herself and a poor little husband whom she carries about to show the superiority of her sex  a cambridge professor and a great political economist observed cecil in a low but indignant voice  the yankee cambridge quoth frank  the american cambridge is a distinguished university returned cecil  cecil is right master frank laughed his mother cam and isis are not the only streams of learning in the world  i never heard of him said jenny he is a mere satellite to the great luminary  they are worth seeing added frank she is one of those regular american beauties one would pay to get a sight of  where did you get all this information asked cecil  from duncombe himself  they met on the righi and nothing is more comical than to near him describe the ladies fraternization over female doctors and lawyers till they rushed into each others arms and the clio promised to come down on a crusade and convert you all  there are two ways of telling a story said cecil  no wonder the gentlemen quake said mrs poynsett  i dont said frank boyishly  because youve no wife to take you in hand retorted jenny  for my part said mrs poynsett i cant see what women want  i have always had as many rights as i could exercise  ah but we are not all ladies of the manor said jenny nor do we all drive coaches  i observe said cecil with dignity that there is supposed to be a license to laugh at mrs duncombe and whatever she does  she would do better to mind her children said frank  children  has she children broke in anne and rosamond both at once  didnt you know it said jenny  no indeed  i didnt think her the sort of woman said rosamond what does she do with them  drops them in the gutter said frank  literally as i came home i heard a squeak and found a child flat in a little watercourse  i picked it out and the elder one told me it was ducky duncombe or some such word  its little boots had holes in them mother its legs were purple and there was a fine smart foreign woman flirting round the corner with young hornblower  boys with long red hair and highland dresses exclaimed rosamond yes the same we saw with miss vivian  exactly said frank eagerly  she is quite a mother to those poor little wretches they watch for her at the sirenwood gate and she walks with them  the boys cry was not for mother or nurse but for lena  pray did she come at his call  no but when i carried the brat home poor duncombe told me almost with tears how good she is to them  i fancy he feels their mothers neglect of them  im sure i gave her credit for having none said rosamond  ah said jenny you should have heard her condolences with my sister mary on her last infliction  fancy marys face  no doubt it was to stem a torrent of nursery discussions said cecil  such bad taste  which murmured rosamond under her breath with an arched eyebrow  plain enough said frank  if a woman is a woman the bad taste is to be ashamed of it  yes said cecil that is the way with men they would fain keep us down to the level of the nursery  i thought nurseries were usually at the top of the house  perhaps said mrs poynsett disregarding this mischievous suggestion they mean that organization like charity should begin at home  you say that meaningly said rosamond  i have heard very odd stories of domestic affairs at aucuba villa and that she cant get a servant to stay there  that man alexander has always been there said frank  yes but he has occasionally to do all the work of the house  yes i cant help it cecil susan will regale me with cookstories sometimes and i have heard of the whole establishment turning out on being required to eat funguses  i shall beware of dining there said rosamond  dont they dine here tomorrow asked frank  no they are engaged to the moys said cecil  but the vivians come  oh yes  every one knew that already but frank could not help having it repeated  it was a mere formal necessity to ask them and had been accepted as such but there was some amazement when cecil brought home lady tyrrell and miss vivian to lunch and spend the afternoon it might be intended as one of her demonstrations for though it was understood that any of the inmates were free to bring home friends to luncheon it was not doneexcept with a casual gentleman without notice to the mistress of the house  cecil however comported herself entirely as in that position explaining that lady tyrrell was come to give her advice upon an intended fernery and would perform her toilette here so as to have plenty of time frank little knowing what was passing was working the whole day at his tutors for the closely imminent examination julius and raymond were gravely polite eleonora very silent and as soon as the meal was over rosamond declared that she should not come out to stand planning in the cold and though herbert would have liked nothing better in that company his rector carried him off to arrange an advent service in a distant hamlet annes horse came to the door and only joanna remained to accompany the gardening party except that raymond came out with them to mark the limits of permissible alteration  how unchanged exclaimed lady tyrrell  time stands still here only where is the grand old magnolia  how sweet it used to be  killed by the frost said raymond shortly not choosing to undergo a course of reminiscences and chafing his wife by his repressive manner towards her guest  when he had pointed out the bed of americans that were to be her boundary he excused himself as having letters to finish and as he went away cecil gave vent to her distaste to the old shrubs and borders now of course at their worstthe azaleas mere dead branches the roses with a few yellow nightcapped buds still lingering and fuchsias with a scanty bell or two  jenny fought for their spring beauty all the more because lady tyrrell was encouraging the wife to criticize the very things she had tried to sentimentalize over with the husband but seeing that she was only doing harm she proposed a brisk walk to eleonora who gladly assented though her sister made a protest about damp and her being a bad walker  the last things they heard was cecils sigh it is all so shut in wherever there is level ground that the bazaar would be impossible  i should hope so muttered jenny  what do you mean to do about this bazaar asked eleonora as they sped away  i dont know  those things so often go off in smoke that i dont make up my mind till they become imminent  i am afraid this will go on said eleonora  camilla means it and she always carries out her plans i wish i saw the right line  about that  about everything  it seems to me that there never was any one so cut off from help and advice as i am then as joanna made some mute sign of sympathy i knew you would understand i have been longing to be with you for there has been no one to whom i could speak freely since i left rockpier  and i have been longing to have you  mamma would have asked you to stay with us before only we had the house full  cant you come now  you will see that i shall not be allowed  it is of no use to think about it said the girl with a sigh  here let us get out of this broad path or she may yet come after uspersuade mrs charnock poynsett it is too cold to stand aboutanything to break up a teteatete  jenny saw she really was in absolute fear of pursuit but hardly yet understood the nervous haste to turn into a not very inviting side path veiled by the trees whose wet leaves were falling  do you mind the damp asked the girl anxiously  no not at all but  you dont know what it is never to feel free but be like a french girl always watchedat least whenever i am with any one i care to speak to  are you quite sure it is not imagination  o joanna dont be like all the rest blinded by her  you knew her always  only from below  i am four years younger you know dear emily was my contemporary  dear emily  i miss her more now than even at rockpier  but you who were her friend and knew camilla of old i know you can help me as no one else can  jenny returned a caress and eleonora spoke on  you know i was only eight years old when camilla married and i had scarcely seen her till she came to us at rockpier on lord tyrrells death and then she was most delightful  i thought her like mother and sister both in one even more tender than dear emily  how could i have thought so for a moment  but she enchanted everybody  clergy ladies and all came under the spell and i cant get advice from any of themeven from miss colesyou remember her  your governess  how nice she was  emily and i owed everything to her  she was as near being a mother to us as any one could be and camilla could not say enough of gratitude or show esteem enough and fascinated her like all the rest of us but she never rested till she had got her off to a situation in russia  i did not perceive the game at the time but i see now how all the proposals for situations within reach of me were quashed  but you write to her  yes but as soon as i showed any of my troubles she reproved me for selfwill and wanting to judge for myself and not submit to my sister  thats the way with all at rockpier  camilla has gone about pitying me to them for having to give way to my married sister but saying it was quite time that she took charge of us and on that notion they all wrote to me  then she persuaded papa to go abroad and i was delighted little thinking she never meant me to go back again  did she not  listen  ive heard her praise rockpier and its church to the skies to one personsay mr bindon  to another such as our own vicar she says it was much too ultra and she likes moderation she tells your father that she wants to see papa among his old friends and to mrs duncombe ive heard her go as near the truth as is possible to her and call it a wearisome place with an atmosphere of incense curates and old maids from whom she had carried me off before i grew fit for nothing else  i dare say all these are true in turn or seem so to her or she would not say them before you  she has left off trying to gloss it over with me except so far as it is part of her nature  she did at first but she knows it is of no use now  really lenore you must be going too far  i have shocked you but you cant conceive what it is to live with perpetual falsity  no i cant use any other word  i am always mistrusting and being angered and my senses of right and wrong get so confused that it is like groping in a maze  her eyes were full of tears but she exclaimed tell me joanna was there ever anything between camilla and mr poynsett  why bring that up again now  why did it go off insisted lenore  because mrs poynsett could not give up and turn into a dowager as if she were not the mistress herself  was that all  so it was said  i want to get to the bottom of it  it was not because lord tyrrell came in the way  i am afraid they thought so here  then said eleonora in a hard dry way i know the reason of our being brought back here and of a good deal besides  my dear lena i am very sorry for you but i think you had better keep this out of your mind or you will fall into a hard bitter suspicious mood  that is the very thing  i am in a hard bitter suspicious mood and i cant see how to keep out of it i dont know when opposition is right and firm and when it is only my own selfwill  would it not be a good thing to talk to julius charnock  you would not be betraying anything  no  i cant seem to make up to the good clergyman  certainly not besides ive heard camilla talking to his wife  talking  admiring that dress which she had been sneering at to your mother dont you remember  it was one of her honeycups with venom below only happily lady rosamond saw through the flattery  im ashamed whenever i see her  i dont think that need cut you off from julius  tell me truly again broke in lenore what mrs poynsett really is  she is a standing proverb with us for tyranny over her sons not with camilla alone but with papa  see how they love her cried jenny hotly  camilla thinks that abject but i cant forget how frank talked of her in those happy rockpier days  when you first knew him said jenny  they must have come at length to the real point for eleonora began at onceyes he was with his sick friend and we were so happy and now he is being shamefully used and i dont know what to do  indeed lenore said jenny in her downright way i do not understand  you do not seem to care for him  of course i am wrong said the poor girl but i hoped i was doing the best thing for him  then as jenny made an indignant sound see jenny when he came to rockpier camilla had been a widow about three months  she never had been very sad for lord tyrrell had been quite imbecile for a year poor man  and when frank came she could not make enough of him and he and i both thought the two families had been devotedly fond of each other and that she was only too glad to meet one of them  i suppose that was true  so do i as things stood then  she meant frank to be a sort of connecting link against the time when she could come back here but we poor children never thought of that and went on together not exactly saying anything but quite understanding how much we cared indeed i know camilla impressed on him that for his mothers sake it must go no farther then while he was still so young and next came our journey on the continent ending in our coming back here last july  jenny remembered that raymonds engagement had not been made known till august and frank had only returned from a grouseshooting holiday a week or two before the arrival of the brides  now added eleonora camilla has made me understand that nothing will induce her to let papa consent and though i know he would if he were left to himself i also see how all this family must hate and loathe the connection  may i ask has frank ever spoken  oh no  i think he implied it all to camilla when she bade him wait till our return fancying i suppose that one could forget the other  but why does she seem so friendly with him  it is her way she cant be other than smooth and caressing and likes to have young men about and i try to be grave and distant becausethe sooner he is cured of me the better for him she uttered with a sob but when he is there and i see those grieved eyes of his i cant keep it up  and papa does like him  oh if camilla would but leave us alone  see here jenny and she showed on her watchchain a bit of ruddy polished pebble  is it wrong to keep this  he and i found the stone in two halves on the beach the last day we were together and had them set pretending to one another it was only play  sometimes i think i ought to send mine back i know he has his he let me see it one day  do you think i ought to give it up  why should you  because then he would know that it must be all over  but is it all over  within i mean  jenny you know better  then lenore if so and it is only your sister who objects not your father himself ought you to torment poor frank by acting indifference when you do not feel it  am i untrue  i never thought of that  i thought i should be sacrificing myself for his good  his good  o lenore i believe it is the worst wrong a woman can do a man to let him think he has wasted his heart upon her and that she is trifling with him  you dont know what a bad effect this is having even on his prospects  he cannot get his brain or spirits free to work for his examination  how hard it is to know what is right  here have i been thinking that what made me so miserable must be the best for him and would it not make it all the worse to relax and let him see  i do not think so returned jenny  his spirits would not be worn by doubt of youthe worst doubt of all  and he would feel that he had something to strive for  eleonora walked on for some steps in silence then exclaimed yes but theres his family  it would only stir up trouble for them there  they cant approve of me  they dont know you  when they do they will  now they only see what looks likeforgive me lenacaprice and coquetry they will know you in earnest if you will let them  you dont mean that they know anything about it exclaimed eleonora  jenny almost laughed  not know where poor franks heart is  you dont guess how those sons live with their mother  i suppose i have forgotten what sincerity and openness are said eleonora sadly  but is not she very much vexed  she was vexed to find it had gone so deep with him said jenny but i know that you can earn her affection and trust by being staunch and true yourselfand it is worth having lena  for jenny knew eleonora of old through emilys letters and had no doubt of her rectitude constancy and deep principle though she was at the present time petrified by constant antagonism to such untruthfulness as where it cannot corrupt almost always hardens those who come in contact with it  and this cruel idea of self sacrifice was no doubt completing the indurating process  jenny knew the terrible responsibility of giving such advice  she had not done it lightly  she had been feeling for years past that tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all and she knew that uncertainty of the right to love and trust would have been a pang beyond all she had suffered  to give poor eleonora situated as she now was admission to the free wholesome atmosphere of the charnock family was to her kind heart irresistible and it was pleasant to feel the poor girl clinging to her as people do to those who have given the very counsel the heart craved for  it was twilight when the walk was over and the drawingroom was empty but anne came to invite them to mrs poynsetts tea saying that cecil had lady tyrrell in her own sittingroom  perhaps mrs poynsett had not realized who was jennys companion for she seemed startled at their entrance and jenny said you remember lenore vivian  i must have seen you as a child said mrs poynsett courteously you are very like your sister  this though usually a great compliment disappointed eleonora as she answered rather frigidly so people say  have you walked far  to the outwood lodge  today  was it not very damp in the woods  oh no delightful  lena and i are old friends said jenny too glad to meet to heed the damp  here raymond entered with the air of a man who had just locked up a heavy postbag at the last possible moment and he too was amazed though he covered it by asking why the party was so small  rosamond has gone to meet her husband and cecil has her guest in her own domains  then jenny asked after his days worka county matter interesting to all the magistracy and their womankind in their degree and eleonora listened in silence watching with quiet heedfulness franks mother and brother  when frank himself came in his face was a perfect study and the colour mantled in her cheeks so that jenny trusted that both were touched by the wonderful beauty that a little softness and timidity brought out on the features usually so resolutely on guard  but when in the later evening jenny crept in to her old friend hoping to find that the impression had been favourable she only heard exactly like her sister who always had the making of a fine countenance  the maskyes but lena has the spirit behind the mask  poor girl she is not at all happy in the atmosphere her sister has brought home  then i wish they would marry her  wont you believe how truly nice and good she is  that will not make up for the connection  my heart sank jenny from the time i heard that those vivians were coming back  i kept frank away as long as i couldbut theres no help for it  it seems the fate of my boys to be the prey of those sirens  well then dear mrs poynsett do pray believe on my word that eleonora is a different creature  is there no hope of averting it  i thought camilla wouldpoor frank is such insignificant game  and when it does come dont be set against her please dear mrs poynsett  be as kind to heras you were to me whispered jenny nestling up and hiding her face  my dear but i knew you  you were no such case  except that you all were horribly vexed with us because we couldnt help liking each other said jenny  ah my poor child  i only wish you could have liked any one else  do you said jenny looking up  oh no you dont  you would not have me for your supplementary child if i had she added playfully then very lowit is because the thought of dear archie even ending as it did is my very hearts joy that i want you to let them have theirs  and then came a break which ended the pleading and jenny was obliged to leave compton without much notion as to the effect of her advice audacious as she knew it to have been     chapter xiv neither land nor water   a light that never was on sea or landwordsworth  nothing could be prettier than rosamonds happiness in welcoming her schoolboy brothers and her gratitude to mrs poynsett for inviting them declaring that she liked boys  her sons however dreaded the inroad of two wild irish lads and held council what covers and what horses could most safely be victimized to them disregarding all testimony in their favour from interested parties  when therefore terence and thomas de lancey made their appearance and were walked in for exhibition by their proud and happy sister there was some surprise at the sight of two peculiarly refined quiet boys with colourless complexions soft sleepy longlashed liquid brown eyes the lowest of full voices and the gentlest of manners as if nothing short of an explosion could rouse them  and it was presently manifest that their sister had said rather too little than too much of terrys abilities  not only had he brought home a huge pile of prizes but no sooner was the seance after dinner broken up than he detained julius saying in a very meek and modest tone rose says you know all the books in the library  rose undertakes a great deal for me  what is this the prelude to  i wanted to ask if i might just look at any book about the physical geography of italy or the history of venice or the phoenicians  why terry  it is for the prize essay explained the boy the subject is the effect of the physical configuration of a country upon the character of a nation  julius drew a long breath astounded at the march of intellect since his time  they dont expect such things of fellows like you he said  only of the sixth but the fifth may go in for it and i want to get up to the doctor himself i thought as i was coming to such a jolly library i might try and if i do pretty well i shall be put up if any more fellows leave  do you think i may use the books im librarian so i know how to take care of them  you can be trusted for that you bookworm said julius heres the library but i fear i dont know much about those modern histories  my mother is a great reader and will direct us  let us come to her  quiet as terry was he was neither awkward nor shy and when julius had explained his wishes and mrs poynsett had asked a few good natured questions she was charmed as well as surprised at the gentle yet eager modesty with which the lowpitched tones detailed the ideas already garnered up and inquired for authorities in which to trace them out without the least notion of the remarkable powers he was evincing  she was delighted with the boy julius guided his researches and he went off to bed as happy as a king with his hands full of little dark tarnished french duodecimos and with a ravenous appetite for the pasture ground he saw before him lower canada had taught him french and the stores he found were revelry to him  cecils feelings may be better guessed than described when the return of mudies box was hastened that he might have motleys dutch republic  she thought this studiousness mere affectation but it was indisputable that terrys soul was in books and that he never was so happy as when turned loose into the library dipping here and there or with an elbow planted on either side of a folio  offers of gun or horse merely tormented him and only his sister could drag him out by specious pleas of need to help in those christmas works where she had much better assistance in anne and the curatesthe one for clubs and coals the other for decorations  mrs poynsett was terrys best friend  he used to come to her in the evening and discuss what he had been reading till she was almost as keen about his success as franks  he talked over his ambition of getting a scholarship becoming a fellow and living for ever among the books for which the scanty supply in his wandering boyhood had but whetted his fervour  he even confided to her what no one else knew but his sister aileen his epic in twentyfour books on brian boromhe and the battle of clontarf and she was mother enough not to predict its inevitable fate nor audibly to detect the unconscious plagiarisms but to be a better listener than even aileen who never could be withheld from unfeeling laughter at the touching fate of the wounded warriors who were tied to stakes that they might die fighting  tom was a more ordinary youth even more lazy and quiet in the house though out of it he amazed frank and charlie by his dash fire and daring and witched all the stableworld with noble horsemanship  hunting was prevented however by a frost which filled every one with excitement as to the practicability of skating  the most available water was a lake between sirenwood and compton and here like eagles to the slaughter gathered by a sort of instinct the entire skating population of the neighbourhood on the first day that the ice was hard enough  rosamond was there of course with both her brothers whom she averred by a bold figure of speech to have skated in canada before they could walk  anne was there studying the new phenomena of ice and snow under good natured charlies protection learning the art with unexpected courage and dexterity  cecil was there but not shining so much for her father had been always so nervous about his darling venturing on the ice that she had no skill in the art and as raymond had been summoned to some political meeting she had no special squire as her young brotherinlaw eluded the being enlisted in her service and she began to decide that skating was irrational and unwomanly although lady tyrrell had just arrived and was having her skates put on and eleonora was only holding back because she was taking care of the two purplelegged purplefaced and purplehaired little duncombes whom she kept sliding in a corner where they could hardly damage themselves or the ice  cecil had just thanked colonel ross for pushing her in a chair and on his leaving her was deliberating whether to walk home with her dignity or watch for some other cavalier when the drag drew up on the road close by and from it came captain and mrs duncombe with two strangers who were introduced to her as mrs tallboys and the professor just fetched from the station  the former was exquisitely dressed in blue velvet and sealskin and had the transparent complexion and delicate features of an american with brilliant eyes and a look of much cleverness her husband small sallow and dark and apparently out of health  are you leaving off skating cecil asked mrs duncombe goodness me i could go on into next year  but if you are wasting your privileges bestow them on mrs tallboys for pitys sake  we came in hopes some good creature had a spare pair of skates  gussie moy offered but hers were yards too long  i hope mine are not too small said cecil not quite crediting that an american foot could be as small as that of a charnock but she found herself mistaken they were a perfect fit and as they were tried there came a loud laugh and she saw a tall girl standing by her whom in her round felt hat and thick rough coat with metal buttons she had really taken for one of the captains male friends  i wouldnt have such small feet she said i shouldnt feel secure of my understanding  mrs tallboys would not change with you gussie said captain duncombe  id back her any day  what odds will you take captain  but mrs duncombe broke in  bless me if there arent those little dogs of mine  lena vivian does spoil them  send them home for pitys sake bob  poor little kids they are doing no harm  we shall have them tumbling in and no end of a row  i cant stand a swarm of children after me and they are making a perfect victim of lena  send them home bob or i shall have to do it  the captain obeyed somewhat ruefully  come my lads bessie says you must go home and leave miss vivian in peace  o bob please let us stay lena is taking care of us  indeed i like nothing so well protested lenore but the captain murmured something about higher powers and cheerfully saying he would give the boys a run took each by an unwilling hand and raced them into a state of frightened jollity by a short cut by which he was able to dispose of them in the drag  the professor meanwhile devoted himself to mrs charnock poynsett took her chair for a whirl on the ice described american sleighing parties talked of his tour in europe  he was really a clever observant man and cecil had not had any one to talk italy to her for a long time past and responded with all her full precision the professor might speak a little through his nose but she had seldom met any one more polite and accomplished  meantime a quadrille was being got up  such a performance and such partners had never been seen in light that shone on water or on land being coupled by their dexterity in the art  they were led off by mrs duncombe and the reverend james bindon  mrs tallboys paired with terry de lancey lady tyrrell with herbert bowater lady rosamond with one of the officers  tom was pounced on by the great gussy moy who declared to his bitter wrath that she preferred little boys turning her back on mr strangeways and two or three more officers as she saw them first solicitous to engage eleonora vivianwho however was to skate with charlie  a few wistful glances were cast towards the wilsbro road for frank had been obliged by the cruel exigencies of the office to devote this magnificent frosty day to the last agonies of cram this however had gone on better for the last fortnightowing perhaps to some relaxation of eleonoras stern guard over her countenance in their few meetings since jennys departure  and after all as charlie said with the cheeriness of one who has passed his own ordeal a man who had taken such a degree as frank could not depend on a few weeks of mere cramming  frank did come speedily up the road just as the quadrille was in full force and perhaps the hindrance had stood him in good stead for when the performance ceased in the twilight and voices were eagerly talking of renewing it as a fackeltanz in the later evening and only yielding at the recollection of dinner engagements it was not charlie who was taking off eleonoras skates and when after fixing grand plans for the morrow lady tyrrell mounted her ponycarriage and looked for her sister she heard that miss vivian was walking home  yes miss vivian was walking home and there was a companion by her side feeling as if that dark hard gravelled road were the pebbly beach of rockpier  when do you go to london she asked  tomorrow afternoon  wish me well through lenore  indeed i do  say it again lenore  give me the elixir that will give me power to conquer everything  dont say such exaggerated things  do you think it is possible to me to exaggerate what a word from you is to me said frank in a low voice of intense feeling  o frank it is wiser not to say such things  wise what is that to me  it is true and you have known itand why will you not allow that you do as in those happy old days  thats what makes me fear  it would be so much better for you if all this had never begun  it has begun then murmured frank with joy and triumph in the sound  as long as you allow that it is enough for me  i must  it is true and truth must be somewhere was whispered in a strange low resolute whisper  true true that you can feel one particle of the intensityoh what words can i find to make you understand the glow and tenderness the very thought of you has been  hush hushpray frank  now if i do own it  itwhat  let me hear  im very stupid you know said frank in a voice of exulting comprehension belying his alleged stupidity  what you have been to me  have beeneh said this cruel crossexaminer  do not let us waste time said eleonora in a trembling voice you know very well  do i  now frank  if you only knew what it would be worth to me to hear you say it  im afraid it would be only worth pain and grief to you and anger from every one said she in a low dejected voice far more than i am worth  you  trust me to judge of that lenore  would not you be worth all and more than all that flesh or spirit could feel  i could face it all for one look from you said frank with fervour from his heart of hearts  you make me more and more afraid  it is all too wretched to lead any one into  since i knew the whole truth i have tried to spare you from it  that is why you have been so cold and held so cruelly aloof all this time so that if i had not caught one ray now and then you would have broken my heart lenore as it is ive been wretched beyond description hardly able to sleep by night or speak rationally by day  how had you the heart to serve me so like a stony greek statue  i thought it must be right  it seemed to break my own heart too  thats the womans way of showing a thing is right but why i cant see  if you did hate me it might be all very well to throw me over but if not why torture two as well as one  are you afraid of my people  ill manage them  you little know  know what  all that made it cruel in camilla to throw us together  cruel when it was the crowning joy of my past life and is to be the crowning joy of the future  how can it  frank you must know the causes your mother has for abhorring any connection with our unhappy family  my mother has too much sense to think a little extravagance among the men of a family can affect the daughters  i know the outer world is afraid of her but she is the tenderest and most indulgent of mothers to us  no fear of her  ah but thats not all  you mean that she has not taken much to your sister  i know and im very sorry but bring them together and it would soon be got over  besides it is not your sister but you  what do you mean rather disconcerted  then you really did not know of the old engagement between camilla and your eldest brother  oh oh  so she consented once  then she will do so again  listen  camilla broke it off because your mother could not resign her position to her  he gave a whistle of dismay then recovering himself with a laugh said fourth sons dont have such expectations founded on them dont fear dearest that cant be all the story though no doubt it was part of it  my mother would rather go into a hermitage than stand in the way of raymonds happiness  some one must have made mischief  it was not all said the girl it was lord tyrrells coming in the way  yes my father told me so he held it up to me as an example of what one ought to do for ones family  then she was coerced  i dont know but such a marriage for me with some one who would redeem the property is their scheme for me  even if your mother and brother could tolerate the thought of one of us my poor dear father will never dare to consent as long as she is with him  nay lenore have i not often heard her say she prefers happiness to ambition  whatever she may have done she has come to think differently  she has wellnigh told me so  yes at rockpier sighed eleonora  hark  the sound of the ponies bells and hoofs was heard lenore put her hand on his arm and drew him aside on the grass behind a clump of trees hushing him by a silent pressure as he tried to remonstrate  he clasped her hand and felt her trembling till the tinkling and tramp were gone by  you frightened darling were his first words when she let him speak  who would have thought you would be so shy  but well have it out and  it is not that interrupted lenore not maidenly shyness  thats for girls who are happy and secure  no but i dont want to have it all overthrown at oncethe first sweetness  it cant be overthrown he said holding arm and hand in the intense grasp  not really never but there is no use in attempting anything till i am of agenext autumn the 7th of november  say nothing till then exclaimed frank in some consternation  we are only where we were before  we are sure of each other now it will be only vexation and harass said she with the instinct of a persecuted creature  i couldnt said frank  i could not keep it in with mother  it would not be right if i could nor should i feel as if i were acting fairly by your father  you are right frank  forgive me  you dont know what it is to have to be always saving ones truth only by silence  speak when you think right  and i believe we shall find it far easier than you think  im not quite a beggarexcept for you my lena  i should like to go home this minute and tell mother and charlie and rose that imim treading on air but i should only be fallen upon for thinking of anything but my taskwork  so ill take a leaf out of your book you cautious lenore and wait till i come down victorious happy and gloriousand i shall now  i feel as if you had given me power to scale olympus now i know i may carry your heart with me  do you remember this lena  he guided her hand to the smooth pebble on his chain  she responded by putting her own into his  my talisman he said  it has been my talisman of success many a time  i have laid my hand on it and thought i was working for you mine mine mine  waters cannot quench lovenever fear  hush as the light of the opening hall door was seen and lady tyrrells voice was heard saying i thought we passed her i am sure she was near  eleonora withdrew her arm patted frank back waved him into silence and went forward saying here i am camilla i walked home  her voice was calm and selfcontained as everthe unassailable dignity just as usual  the hall was full of officers standing about the fire and drinking tea and eleonoras wellworn armour was instantly on as her sister asked where she had been since others had walked home and had not overtaken her  i came by the lower road said she  indeed  i never saw you  i saw you passor rather heard you  and did not let me pick you up  did you hide yourself  it was much warmer to walk  so you seem to have found it to judge by your cheeks said lady tyrrell  and mr strangeways and one or two others could not restrain a murmured exclamation on the exceeding loveliness of that deepened colour and brightened eye but lenore only knew that an equally bright and keen eye was watching her heedfully and knew that she was suspected if not read through and through  she mingled in the discussion of the skating with those outward societysenses that she learnt to put on and escaped as soon as possible to her own room  again she almost fell on the ground in her own little oratory chamber in a tumult of gladness that was almost agony and fear that was almost joy  she wanted to give thanks that frank had become so wholly and avowedly hers and for that deep intense affection that had gone on unfed uncherished for years but the overflow of delight was checked with forebodingthere was the instinctive terror of a basilisk eye gazing into her paradise of joythe thanksgiving ran into a halfdespairing deprecation  and she knew that frank was under camillas spell and admired and trusted her still nor had she been able to utter a word of caution to undeceive him  should she have the power on the morrow  camilla really loved skating and surrounded as she was sure to be there was hope of escaping her vigilant eye once more  tomorrow there would be another meeting with frank perhaps another walk with him  that anticipation was soothing enough to bring back the power of joyful gratitude and therewith of hopeful prayer     chapter xv plot and counterplot   a lady a party of pleasure made    and she planned her scheme full well and day and night the party filled    the head of the demoisellefaber  though frank had no reason to expect that the tidings of his success would be hailed with much satisfaction at home yet his habit of turning to his mother for sympathy would have been too much for his prudence but for the fact that terry de lancey had dragged into her room a massive volume of prints from the uffizi gallery and was looking it over with her with a zest she had not seen since the days when her father gloried in his collection  his victory could only be confided to charlie who might laugh but fully appreciated the repose of mind with which he could now encounter the examiners and promised to do his part to cover the meetings of the lovers the next day  but even then the chances of another performance on the lake or of a walk among the icicles afterwards were departing  thaw was setting in and by breakfast time there was a downpouring rain  frank lingered about cecil in hopes of a message to serve as an excuse for a rush to sirenwood but she proved to be going to drive to the workingroom and then to lunch at mrs duncombes to meet the americans and the ladies from sirenwood according to a note sent over in early morning at first sight of the wet  thereupon frank found he had a last reference to make to his tutor and begged for a lift  a touch of warmth in cecil would have opened the floodgates of his confidence but she was exercised about a mistake in the accounts and claimed his aid in tracking a defective sevenpence  when she heard him utter the monstrous statement that a hundred and five farthings were almost nine shillings she looked at him with withering compassion as sure to fail and a small loss to her majesty nor would she listen to any of his hints that he was very curious to see her workingroom  his question to the tutor judiciously lasted till twelve when he dropped in to consult captain duncombe about horsehire in london and that gentleman who had been undergoing a course of political economy all the morning eagerly pounced on him for a tour of his stables which lasted till luncheon was due and he could casually enter the diningroom where lady tyrrell held out her hand good naturedly to him laughing at the blankness he could not entirely conceal  only me she said  it cant be helped  poor lenore caught such a dreadful sore throat last night that i have shut her up in her room with a mustard poultice  indeed  i am very sorry  you may well look horrified  you were the guilty party i suspect taking her all across the park under those dank trees  he coloured up to the eyes little expecting to be thus convicted but mrs duncombe came to his aid  my impartiality would impute the damage to her standing about with those wretched little dogs of mine  it is your climate said mrs tallboys  in our dry atmosphere there would be no risk with a far lower temperature  i hope it is nothing serious said frank anxiously  i hope so too said lady tyrrell looking archly into his face which had not learnt such impenetrability as poor lenores  no but really he said in anxiety that would not be rallied away  this is the way said lady tyrrell  young gentlemen persuade young ladies to do the most imprudent thingssaunter about in the cold after skating and dawdle under trees and then wonder when they catch colddo they do such things in your country mrs tallboys and expect the mammas and elder sisters to be gratified  mammas and elder sisters are at a discount with you are not they said mrs duncombe  our young women are sufficient to protect themselves without our showing tacit distrust and encumbering them with guardianship returned the professor  mr charnock wishes we had reached that point said lady tyrrell  she had put him completely out of countenance  he had not supposed her aware of his having been lenores companion and was not certain whether her sister had not after all confided in her or if he himself had not been an unconscious victim  the public banter jarred upon him and while cecil was making inquiries into the extent of the young ladies privileges in america he was mentally calculating the possibilities of rushing up to sirenwood trying to see lenore in spite of her throat and ascertaining her position before his train was due but he was forced to resign the notion for raymond had made an appointment for him in london which must not be missed and before luncheon was over the dogcart according to agreement with charlie called for him  goodbye mr frank said mrs duncombe will you have an old shoe thrown after you for luck  the time is not come for that yet said cecil gravely  tending in that direction  eh charnock said the captain heres to your successnow and in whats to come  thank you captain said frank shaking his hand liking the hearty voice  lady tyrrell wont you give me your good wishes he asked half diffidently  for the examinationyes certainly she replied  it is safer not to look too far into your wishingwell  andand will you give mymy best regards to leto miss vivian and say i grieve for her cold and trust to herto her good wishes  he uttered quick and fast holding her hand all the time  yes yes she said quickly but last messages wont do when trains are due  not due yet said frank but i must go home  ive not seen my mother today and i shall not have a momentgoodbye cecil have you any commands for raymond  no thank you said cecil gravely and with a bow to the americans he was gone  that is one of your products of the highest english refinement said mrs tallboys whom in his preoccupation he had scarcely noticed  how does he strike you said cecil  he is my brotherinlaw but never mind that  he looks fitted for the hero of a vapid english novel  i long to force him to rough it and to rub off that exquisite donothing air it irritates me  frank charnock has done a good deal of hard work and is not to lead the life of an idle man said captain duncombe  i know i should not like to be in his shoes if he succeedsgrinding away in an office ten months out of the twelve  in an office  i should like to set him to work with an axe  well those daintylooking curled darlings dont do badly in the backwoods said lady tyrrell  ah  i understand  you stand up for him because theres a little tendresse for your sister said the plainspoken american  poor fellow  i am afraid he is far gone  it is an impossible thing though and the sooner he can be cured of it the better said lady tyrrell  i am sorry that walk took place yesterdaydid he mention it at home cecil  you are a very inconsistent woman lady tyrrell broke in mrs duncombe in her abrupt way  here you are come to uphold the emancipation of woman and yet when we come to your own sister taking one poor walk  i beg your pardon bessie said lady tyrrell with her most courteous manner  i never said i was come to uphold the emancipation of woman only to subject myself to mrs tallboys influenceshe has to make a convert of me  for of course lady tyrrell was only drawn into the controversy as a matter of amusement and possibly as something specially distasteful to the house of charnock poynsett and cecil was a good deal influenced by the fascination of her example as well as by the eagerness of mrs duncombe and the charms of the americans and above all they conspired in making her feel herself important and assuming that she must be foremost in all that was done  she did not controvert the doctrines of dunstone so entirely as to embrace the doctrines of emancipation but she thought that free ventilation was due to every subject most especially when the members wife was the leading lady in bringing about such discussion  the opposition made in the town to mrs duncombes sanitary plans and the contempt with which they had been treated as ladies fancies had given a positive field of battle with that admixture of right and wrong on either side which is essential to championship  and in truth cecil was so much more under the influence of camilla tyrrell and bessie duncombe than under that of any other person that she was ready to espouse any cause that they did  how to arrange for the intended instruction was the difficulty since wilsbro was without a townhall and moreover the inhabitants were averse to all varieties of change either as to the claims of women the inequality of social laws the improvement of education or the comprehension of social sciencethe regular course which mrs clio w tallboys was wont to lecture  the matter could only be managed by arranging a series of soirees at different houses  mrs duncombes rooms were far too small but if some person of more notesome swell as she saidwould make the beginning there would be no difficulty in bringing others to follow suit  you must do it lady tyrrell said mrs duncombe  i  if theres nobody else but it would come much better from another quarter nodding at cecil  dont you wish you may get it muttered the slangloving bessie  thats one point in which we leave you far behind said mrs tallboys  we issue our invitations quite independently of the other members of the household  each has a separate visiting list  there need be no difficulty said cecil all matters of visiting are in my hands  it is necessary in our position and if lady tyrrell thinks it proper that i should give the first party i will do so  bravo what fun cried mrs duncombe clapping her hands  you wont get into a jolly row though she added anxiously  i am perfectly sure of my ground said cecil with the dignity of one to whom a row was unheard of  it is the simple duty of a member to come forward in promoting free discussion of opinions  you are a publicspirited woman cecil said lady tyrrell  when you have made the first move ill follow  then whom shall we ask next  mrs moy said bessie  she is a nonentity herself but if gussie were to be strongly bitten she could do more than any one else and make her father reform that nest of horrors in water lane  im afraid the freedom side will bite her more than the sanitary side said lady tyrrell  she is capital fun though and a great ally of ours said mrs duncombe and the rooms at proudfoot lawn are worth anything  other details were fixed even to the day of cecils opening party which must take place on the first practicable day but there was none to be found till the wednesday week the day before raymond would return home  cecil did not recollect this till the day had been unanimously agreed on and it was with a little alarm but after what she had asserted about her freedom of action she could not retract before the eyes of the american lady and as she said to herself she could receive her own ladies party without interfering with any one else in the library so that no one had a right to object  however she had a certain anticipation of opposition which caused her to act before announcing her intention and thus it was that rosamond found her dropping a number of notes through the slit in the lid of the postbox  another dinner was the question  no this is a soiree in the library entirely for ladies mrs tallboys is to explain her views in the evenings at the principal houses in the neighbourhood  she will begin here on wednesday week  why thats before raymond comes back  this is entirely for women  women womens rights  how have you got mrs poynsett to consent  i have carte blanche in these matters  do you mean that you have not consulted her  does raymond know oh  yes i see i have no right to ask but cecil for your own sake i entreat you to consider what you are about before running into such a frightful scrape and rosamond impulsively caught the hand that was still putting in a letter but cecil stood still not withdrawing or moving a muscle perfectly impassive  rosamond went on more eagerly oh yes i know you dont like meim only a poor battered soldiers daughter quite an unworthy associate for a charnock of the charnocks but i cant help begging you to consider the consequences of sending out invitations to hear this strange woman hold forth in mrs poynsetts own house in your husbands absence  thank you for your solicitude said cecil dropping in her envelope the instant the obstructive hand was removed and going on her way with dignified selfpossession while rosamond in a tumult of indignation which made her scarcely comprehensible rushed up to her husband at his writing and poured out her story  clio advocating female supremacy in mrs poynsetts own house without notice to her  should she be warned in time to stop the letters  should raymond be written to  rosamond was for both julius for neither  he said that either way would begin a system that could never be forgiven and that they had better consider themselves as practically at the rectory and not interfere  how can you be so coldblooded cried she  i do not want to do worse harm  my mother will learn what is to happen sooner or later and then she can put a stop to it in any way she chooses  i wish she would send in mrs crabtree with her tawse said rosamond  but is it right by raymond to let his wife bring this yankee muse to talk her nonsense in his very rooms  you have argued with her  or with a blocka stocka stone raved rosamond  then depend upon it to inform against her would be far worse than letting any amount of absurdity be talked  i should like to know how you would get over being so served  dont make comparisons sir  poor things they would not be the worse for a little of our foolishness  things settled themselves according to juliuss prediction for mr bowater coming up with his son herbert to see his old friend said what grand doings are you having here  what is raymonds wife up to  ladies conversazionethats a new thing in these parts  i gave such matters up to her said mrs poynsett  young people like a little freedom of action and there are changes in the neighbourhood since i was laid up  it was a temporizing speech to avoid showing her total ignorance  mr bowater cleared his throat  young folk may like freedom of action but it dont always follow that it is good for them  i hope she wont get raymond into a scrape thats allcommitting him and herself to a course of lectures by that yankee woman on womans rights  it does not commit him it is before he comes home on wednesday said herbert  never mind that what a woman does her husband does  look here mrs poynsett i brought over jennys note in my pocket see here are twoone to accept and one to refuse just as you choose  oh accept by all means cried mrs poynsett dont leave the wrong one  then she changed the conversation so decidedly that mr bowater could not resume his warning but after taking leave of her he met rosamond in the avenue and could not help saying pray was my old friend aware of mrs raymonds doings  have you told her  oh i am so glad  then it is as you said herbert  mrs raymond had left her in ignorance  the impudent baggage  thats what the world is coming to  but what regular game mrs poynsett was said herbert  you could not make out in the least that she had been left in the lurch and im sure she has a plan by the way in which she desired jenny and edie to come  only make her understand that the wilsbro folks are in a ticklish state said mr bowater they are sulking already because they say the ladies have been stirring him up to put them to expense about the drains  wilsbro isnt sweet said herbert  theres been nothing amiss in my time returned his father perfectly healthy in all reason  ay you may laugh young folks but i never heard of any receipt to hinder people from dying and let well alone is a safe maxim  if it be well said rosamond  however raymond says whatever is done must be by general consent and that small private attempts do more harm than good  he had better take care what he says  if they fancy he is in league with that ridiculous duncombe woman against their pockets moy is on the watch to take advantage of it and all the old family interest will not save his seat  when rosamond reached home she found anne beside her motherinlaw provided with a quire of notepaper and pile of envelopes  my dear i want your help she said  till my accident i always had a childrens party at christmas and now i have so many young people to manage it for me i think we might try again and combine it with cecils ladies party on wednesday  hurrah cried rosamond  you mean that we should have plenty of funand in fact drum out the rights of woman  at any rate present a counter attraction  you and charlie and your brothers with the bowaters might do something  trust me cried rosamond  oh i am so thankful to mr bowater julius and i had our blood boiling and i said as much or more to cecil than woman could but she minded me no more than the old white cockatoo and julius said our telling would only make more mischief  he was quite right said his mother  let there not be one word of opposition you know only swamp it  you could get up some charades and have something going on all the evening  trust me for that  oh if my darling aileen were but here  but tom is the very model of an actor and terry is grand if only we can keep him out of the high tragedy line  king lear is the mildest thing he condescends to  could you manage a christmastree  the taking up a room beforehand is inconvenient but i should like to offer some little substantial bait even to the grownup and her eyes twinkled merrily  i know a better thing said rosamond an enchanted grove with a beneficent witch  we did it at st awdrys with bonbons and trumpery in a little conservatory hardly large enough to turn round in  if i may have the key of the conservatory ill manage  you shall have what you please and perhaps you would kindly go and choose the things at backsworth  there is a very good fancy shop there  thank you thank you  how sweetnow anne you will see what you shall see  is there to be dancing asked anne humbly yet resolutely  there shall not be my dear if it will spoil the evening for you said mrs poynsett  i promised said anne  at that moment the servants came in with the preparations for the afternoon tea closely followed by the ever punctual cecil  mrs poynsett asked her whether she would require the barouche on the morrow since rosamond and anne would want it to go to backsworth to obtain requisites for a childrens entertainment to take place on wednesday  some friends of mine are coming on wednesday said cecil  indeed  in raymonds absence  this is not a dinner but a ladies party  then it will combine the better  certainly not replied cecil  mine is simply intellectualonly a few intelligent women to meet mrs tallboys in the library  it will be quite apart from any amusements rosamond may like to have for the children in the drawingroom  pray will they require nothing but this feast of reason and flow of soulfor the housekeeper will need warning  they will have dined  nothing but coffee will be wanted  for how many  about twelve or fourteen thank you  excuse mei have something to finish in my own room  they were very glad to excuse her and the following note was concocted to serve both for those she might have invited and those she might not and it was copied by the two daughters for all the acquaintance who had young folks in their houses  an appearance of want of unanimity was carefully avoided and it stood thus  i am desired by mrs poynsett to say that the ladies party already proposed for the 3rd is to undergo a little expansion and that she much hopes to see you and  at 7 pm disposed for a few christmas amusements     chapter xvi the drive to backsworth   she was betrothed to one now dead or worse who had dishonoured fledscott  the party set out for backsworth early in the day  it included julius who had asked for a seat in the carriage in order to be able to go on to rood house where lived dr easterby whom he had not seen since he had been at compton  the great light of the english church said rosamond gaily while anne shuddered a little for miss slater had told her that he was the great fountainhead of all that distressed her in julius and his curates  but julius merely said i am very glad of the opportunity and the subject dropped in the eager discussion of the intended pastimes which lasted beyond the wellknown wilsbro bounds when again julius startled a anne by observing no dancing that is a pity  there anne exclaimed rosamond  it was out of kindness to me said anne  and then with a wonderful advance of confidence she added please tell me how you a minister can regret it  because i think it would be easier to prevent mischief than when there has to be a continual invention of something original  there is more danger of offence and uncharitableness to speak plainly  and you think that worse than dancing said anne thoughtfully  why is dancing bad at all anne asked rosamond  anne answered at once it is worldly  not half so worldly as driving in a carriage with fine horses and liveries and arms and servants and all said rosamond from her comfortable corner nestling under miless racoonskin rug i wonder you can do that  the carriage is not mine said anne  the worldliness would be in sacrificing a duty to the luxury and ostentation of keeping one said julius  for instance if i considered it due to my lady in the corner there to come out in this style and put down a curate and a few such trifles with that object  to my mind balls stand on the same ground they are innocent as long as nothing right is given up for them  you would not dance said anne  wouldnt he said rosamond  ive seen him  it was at st awdrys at a christmas party in our courting days  no it wasnt with me  oh no  that was the cruel cut  it was with little miss marks whose father had just risen from the ranks  such a figure she was enough to set your teeth on edge when behold this reverend minister extracts her from the wallflowers and goes through the lancers with her in firstrate style i assure you  it had such an effect do you know that what does my father do but go and ask her next and i heard an old lady remarking that there were only two gentlemen in the room mr charnock and lord rathforlane so you see it was all worldliness after all anne  i suppose it was goodnature said anne  indignation i fancy said julius  now was he very wicked for it anne  nno if dancing be not wrong  but why should it  all the bad people danced in the bible  miriamking david eh  that was part of their religious service  the welcome to the prodigal son further suggested julius  does not this prove that the exercise is not sinful in itself  but you would not do it again repeated anne  i certainly should not make a practice of it nor go to balls any more than i would be a sportsman or a cricketer because i am bound to apply my whole self to the more direct service but this does not show that there is evil necessarily connected with these amusements or that they may not safely be enjoyed by those who have time and who need an outlet for their spirits or by those who wish to guard these pleasures by presiding over them  dont persuade me exclaimed anne  i gave my word to mr pilgrim that nothing should induce me to dance or play at cards  mr pilgrim had no right began rosamond but julius hushed her saying no one wishes to persuade you anne  your retirement during miless absence is very suitable and becoming  till we live in the bush out of the way of it all said anne  i wish you could have seen one of our real old christmas parties but those can never be again without mother herself or mrs douglas  do tell me about those douglases said rosamond  cecil hinted at some romance but seemed to think you had suppressed the connection because he was an attorney  not exactly said julius smiling but it is a sad story though we have no doubt he bore the guilt of others  something about two thousand pounds  yes  it was the year that my mother and raymond were abroad  she had been buying some property near and sent home an order from vevay  it did not come and was inquired for but as it was an order not a draft it was not stopped at the bank and in about a fortnight more it was presented by a stranger and paid without hesitation as it was endorsed proudfoot and moy  old proudfoot was away at harrogate and came home to investigate young proudfoot denied all knowledge of it and so did his brotherinlaw moy but raymond working at the other end found that the waiter at the hotel at vevay had forgotten to post the letter for more than a week and it was traced through the post to wilsbro where the postman remembered delivering a foreignlooking letter to archie douglas at the door of the office  it came alone by the afternoon post  his account was this  they were all taking it rather easy in old proudfoots absence and when a sudden summons came to take the old farmers instructions for his will archie as the junior was told off to do it  he left george proudfoot and moy in a private room at the office with tom vivian leaning over the fire talking as he had a habit of doing in old proudfoots absence  as he opened the office door the postman put the letter into his hand and recognizing the writing he ran back and gave it in triumph to george proudfoot exclaiming that there it was at last but he was in danger of being late for the train and did not wait to see it opened and when he came back he was told that it had been merely a letter of inquiry with nothing in it and destroyed at once  that was his account but proudfoot moy and vivian all denied any knowledge of this return of his or of the letter  the night of this inquiry he was missing  jenny bowater who was with an aunt in london heard that a gentleman had called to see her while she was out for a couple of days and a week later we saw his name among the passengers lost in the hippolyta off falmouth  poor jenny  was she engaged to him  on sufferance  on her deathbed mrs douglas had wrung from mr bowater a promise that if archie did well and ever had means enough he would not refuse consent but he always distrusted poor archie because of his father and i believe he sent jenny away to be out of his reach  if any of us had only been near i think we could have persuaded him to face it out and trust to his innocence but raymond was abroad miles at sea i at oxford and nothing like a counsellor was near  if jenny had but seen him  and has nothing happened to clear him  no  raymond hurried home and did his best but all in vain george proudfoot was indeed known to have been in debt to vivian but moy his brotherinlaw an older man was viewed as a person whose word was above all question and they both declared the signature at the back of the order not to be genuine  archies flight you see made further investigation impossible and there was no putting on oath no crossexamination  then you think those three had it  we can think nothing else knowing archie as we did  raymond showed his suspicions so strongly that old proudfoot threw up all agencies for our property and there has been a kind of hostility ever since  poor vivian as you know came to his sad end the next year but he had destroyed all his papers and george proudfoot has been dead four or five years but without making any sign  moy has almost risen above the business andsee theres proudfoot lawn where he lives with the old man  he claims to compete with the county families and would like to contest wilsbro with raymond  and jenny asked anne  did she bear it as a christian  i know she would  she did indeedmost nobly most patiently  poor girl at her own home she knew she stood alone in her faith in archies innocence but they were kind and forbearing and kept silence and the knowledge of our trust in him has bound her very close to us  was that call when she did not see him all she ever heard of him  all except that he left a fragment of paper with the servant with the one pencil scrawl a dieua capital d to mark the full meaning  she once showed it to mefolded so as to fit into the back of a locket with his photograph  dear jenny  and had you traced him on board this ship  no but his name was in the list and we knew he had strong fancy for south africa whither the hippolyta was bound  in fact he ought to have been a sailor and only yielded to his mothers wishes  we knew a mr archibald douglas once said anne he came and outspanned by us when he was going north after elephants  he stayed a fortnight because his wagon had to be mended  o julius if we could but find him for her again cried rosamond  i am afraid archibald douglas is not much more individual a name than john smith said julius sadly  that tells as much against the hippolyta man said rosamond  poor archie would not be difficult to identify said julius for his hair was like mine though his eyes were blue and not short sighted  that is all right then cried anne for we had a dispute whether he were young or old and i remember mamma saying he had a look about him as if his hair might have turned white in a single night  julius  now wont you believe cried rosamond  had he a scotch accent said julius  no i recollect papas telling him he never should have guessed him to be a scot by his tongue and he said he must confess that he had never seen scotland  now julius pleaded rosamond with clasped hands as if jennys fate hung on his opinion  how long ago was this asked he  four years said anne with a little consideration  he came both in going and returning and alick was wild to join him if he ever passed our way again  my father liked him so much that he was almost ready to consent but he never came again  ivory hunters go more from natal now  you will trace him  theres a dear anne exclaimed rosamond  i will write to them at home alick knows a good many hunters and could put miles into the way of making inquiries if he touches at natal on his way home  miles will do all he can said julius he was almost broken hearted when he found how archie had gone  i think he was even more his hero than raymond when we were boys because he was more enterprising and my mother always thought archies baffled passion for the sea reacted upon miles  he will do it  he will find him if he is the miles i take him for  how old was hearchie i mean  a year older than raymond but he always seemed much younger he was so full of life and animationso unguarded poor fellow  he used to play tricks with imitating handwriting and these of course were brought up against him  thirtyfour  not a bit too old for the other end of the romance  take care rosie  dont say a word to jenny till we know more she must not be unsettled only to be disappointed  do you think she would thank you for that you coldblooded animal  i dont know but i think the suspense would be far more trying than the quiet resigned calm that has settled down on her  besides you must remember that even if archie were found the mystery has never been cleared up  you dont think that would make any difference to jenny  it makes all the difference to her father and jenny will never be a disobedient daughter  oh but it willit must be cleared  i know it will  it is faithless to think that injustice is not always set right  not always here said julius sadly  see theres the backsworth raceground the great focus of the evil  were racing debts thought to have any part in the disaster  that i cant tell but it was those races that brought george proudfoot under the vivian influence and in the absence of all of us poor archie when left to himself after his mothers death had become enough mixed up in their amusements to give a handle to those who thought him unsteady  as if any one must be unsteady who goes to the races cried rosamond  you were so liberal about balls i did expect one little good word for races instead of which you are declaring a poor wretch who goes to them capable of embezzling two thousand pounds and i dare say anne agrees with you  now did i ever say so anne  you looked at the course with pious horror and said it justified the suspicion persisted rosamond  thats better said julius though i never even said it justified the suspicion any more than i said that balls might not easily be overdone especially by some people  but you dont defend races said anne  no i think the mischief they do is more extensive and has less mitigation than is the case with any other public amusement  hm said rosamond  many a merry day have i had on the top of the regimental drag so perhaps theres nothing of which you would not suspect me  ill tell you what i more than suspect you of said julius of wearing a gay bonnet to be a bait and a sanction to crowds of young girls to whom the place was one of temptation though not to you  oh there would be no end to it if one thought of such things  or the young men who  well broke in rosamond it was always said that our young officers got into much less mischief than where there was a straightlaced colonel who didnt go along with them to give them a tone  that i quite believe  i remember too the intense and breathless sense of excitement in the hush and suspense of the multitude and the sweeping by of the animals  then youve been cried his wife  as a boy yes  not since you were old enough to think it over said anne eagerly  no  it seemed to me that the amount of genuine interest in the sport and the animals was infinitesimal compared with the fictitious excitement worked up by betting  and whats the harm of betting when youve got the money  and when you havent  thats another question  do you approve it at the best  its a mans own concern  thats arguing against your better sense  cant be helped with two such solemn companions  there would be no bearing you if i didnt take you down sometimes when you get so didactic and talk of fictitious excitement indeed  and now you are going to rood house what will you be coming back  rood house stood about two miles on the further side of backsworth it was an ancient almshouse of which the mastership had been wisely given to dr easterby one of the deepest theological scholars holiest men and bravest champions of the church although he was too frail in health to do much save with his pen and in council with the numerous individuals who resorted to him from far and wide and felt the beautiful old fragment of a monastic building where he dwelt a true court of peace and refreshment whence they came forth aided by prayer and counsel for their own share of the combat  julius charnock had happily for himself found his way thither when his character and opinions were in process of formation and had ever since looked to rood house for guidance and sympathy  to be only fourteen miles distant had seemed to him one great perfection of compton poynsett but of course he had found visits there a far more possible thing to an unoccupied holiday son of the great house than to a busy parish priest so that this opportunity was very valuable to him  and so it proved not so much for the details as for the spirit in which he was aided in looking at everything from the mighty questions which prove the life of the church by the vehement emotion they occasion down to the difficulties of theory and practice that harassed himselfnot named perhaps but still greatly unravelled  those perpetual questions that have to be worked out again and again by each generation were before him in dealing with his parish and among them stood in his case the deeper aspects of the question that had come forward on the drive namely the lawfulness and expedience of amusement  granting the necessity of pastimes and recreation for most persons specially the young there opened the doubtful because ever varying question of the kind and the quantity to be promoted or sanctioned lest restraint should lead to reaction and lest abstinence should change from purity and spirituality to moroseness or hypocrisy  and if julius found one end of the scale represented by his wife and his junior curate his sisterinlaw and his senior curate were at the other  yet the old recluse was far more inclined to toleration than he had been in principle himself though the spur of the occasion had led him to relaxations towards others in the individual cases brought before him when he had thought opposition would do more harm than the indulgence  his conscience had been uneasy at this divergence till he could discuss the subject  the higher the aspiration of the soul the less of course would be the craving for diversion the greater the shrinking from those evil accompaniments that soon mar the most innocent delights  some spirits are austere in their purity like anne some so fervent in zeal as to heed nothing by the way like mr bindon but most are in an advanced stage of childhood and need play and pleasure almost as much as air or food and these instincts require wholesome gratification under such approval as may make the enjoyment bright and innocent and yet there should be such subduing of their excess such training in discipline as shall save them from frivolity and from passing the line of evil prevent the craving from growing to a passion and where it has so grown tone it back to the limits of obedience and safety  alas perhaps there lay the domestic difficulty of which julius could not speak yet as if answering the thought dr easterby said after all charity is the true selfacting balance to many a sweet untaught nature  selfdenials which spring out of love are a great safeguard because they are almost sure to be both humble and unconscious  and julius went away cheered as he thought of his rosamonds wells of unselfish affection confident that all the cravings for variety and excitement which early habit had rendered second nature would be absorbed by the deeper and keener feelings within and that these would mount higher as time went on under lifes great training  pleasant it was to see the triumphant delight of the two sisters over their purchases  such a days english shopping was quite a new experience to anne and she had not been cautioned against it so her enjoyment was as fresh and vivid as a childs and they both chattered all the way home with a merriment in which julius fully shared almost surprised to see anne so eager and lively andas her cheeks glowed and her eyes brightenedbeginning to understand what had attracted miles  mrs poynsett had not had quite so pleasant a day for cecil knocked at her door soon after luncheon with an announcement that lady tyrrell wished for admission  expecting an exposition of the clio scheme she resigned herself looking with some curiosity at the beautiful contour of face and drooping pensive loveliness that had rather gained than lost in grace since the days when she had deemed them so formidable  this is kind dear mrs poynsett said the soft voice while the hand insisted on a pressure  i have often wished to come and see you but i could not venture without an excuse  thank you was the cold reply  i have more than an excusea reason and i think we shall be fully agreed but first you must let me have the pleasure of one look to recall old times  it is such a treat to see you so unchanged  i hope you do not still suffer  no thank you  and are you always a prisoner here  ah  i know your patience  what was the matter on which you wanted to speak to me said mrs poynsett fretted beyond endurance by the soft caressing tone  as i said i should hardly venture if i did not know we agreed though perhaps not for the same reasons  we do agree in our love and high opinion of your dear frank  well repressing a shudder at the dear  i am afraid we likewise agree that under all circumstances our two young people are very unfortunately attached and that we must be hardhearted and let it go no further  you mean your sister  my dear lena  i cannot wonder  i blame myself excessively for it was all through my own imprudence  you see when dear frank came to rockpier it was so delightful to renew old times and they both seemed such children that i candidly confess i was off my guard but as soon as i had any suspicion i took care to separate them knowing that in the state of my poor fathers affairs it would be most unjustifiable to let so mere a youth be drawn into an attachment  frank is no prize said his mother with some irony  i knew you would say that dear mrs poynsett  pecuniarily speaking of course he is not though as to all qualities of the heart and head he is a prize in the true sense of the word  but alas it is a sort of necessity that poor lena if she marry at all should marry to liberal means  i tell you candidly that she has not been brought up as she ought to have been considering her expectations or no expectations  what could you expect of my poor father with his habits and two mere girls  i dont know whether the governess could have done anything but i know that it was quite time i appeared  i tell you in confidence dear mrs poynsett there was a heavy pull on my own purse before i could take them away from rockpier and without blaming a mere child like poor dear lena you can see what sort of preparation she has had for a small income  it is hard to say which tried mrs poynsetts patience most the dears or the candour and the spirit of opposition probably prompted her to say frank has his share like his brothers  i understand and for many girls the provision would be ample but poor lena has no notion of economizinghow should she  i am afraid there is no blinking it that dear children as they both are nothing but wretchedness could result from their corning together and thus i have been extremely sorry to find that the affair has been renewed  it was not an unnatural result of their meeting again  ah there i was to blame again but no one can judge whether an attachment be real between such children  i thought too that frank would be gone out into the world and i confess i did not expect to find that he had absolutely addressed her and kept it secret  that is what my poor father feels so much  eleonora is his special darling and he says he could have overlooked anything but the concealment  maternal affection assumed the defensive and though the idea of concealment on the part of one of her sons was a shock mrs poynsett made no betrayal of herself merely asking how did it come to light  i extorted the confession  i think i was justified standing in a mothers position as i do  i knew my vigilance had been eluded and that your son had walked home with her after the skating and you know very well how transparent young things are  the skating  the mother at once understood that frank was only postponing the explanation till after his examination and besides she had never been ignorant of his attachment and could not regard any display thereof more or less as deception towards herself  the very fact that lady tyrrell was trying to prejudice her beforehand so as to deprive him of the grace of taking the initiative towards his own mother enlisted her feelings in his defence so she coldly answered i am sorry if sir harry vivian thinks himself unfairly treated but i should have thought my sons feelings had been as well known in the one family as in the other  but dear mrs poynsett exclaimed lady tyrrell i am sure you never encouraged them  i am quite enough awarewhatever i may once have beenof the unfortunate contrast between our respective families  certainly there was no connection mrs poynsett less wished to encourage yet she could not endure to play into camilla hands and made reply there are many matters in which young men must judge for themselves  i have only once see miss vivian and have no means of estimating my sons chance of happiness with her  her impenetrability ruffled lady tyrrell but the answer was softer than ever  dear mrs poynsett what a happy mother you are to be able so freely to allow your sons to follow their inclinations well since you do not object my conscience is easy on that score but it was more than i durst hope  to have ones approval thus stolen was out of the question and mrs poynsett said regret is one thing opposition another  sir harry vivian need not doubt that when my sons position is once fixed he will speak openly and formally and it will then be time to judge  only said lady tyrrell rising let this be impressed on your son  eleonora cannot marry till she is of age and my father cannot sanction any previous entanglement  indeed it is most unfortunate if her affections have been tampered with for me who have outgrown romance and know that in her position a wealthy match is a necessity  i have spoken candidly she repeated for i like frank too well to bear that he should be trifled with and disappointed  thank you  the ladies parted liking one another if possible less than before  mrs poynsetts instinct of defence had made her profess much less distaste to the marriage than she really felt she was much concerned that another son should be undergoing raymonds sad experiences but she had no fear that lady tyrrell would ever allow it to come to a marriage and she did not think franks poetical enthusiasm and admiration for beauty betokened a nature that would suffer such an enduring wound as raymonds had done  so she awaited his return without too much uneasiness for amusement in rosamonds preparations  one opening into the conservatory was through her room so that every skilful device or gay ornament could be exhibited to her and she much enjoyed the mirth that went on between the queen of the revels and her fellowworkers  cecil did not interfere being indeed generally with her friends at sirenwood aucuba villa or the workingroom in all of which she had the pleasure of being treated as a person of great consideration far superior to all her natural surroundings and on whom hinged all the plans for the amelioration of willansborough  sometimes however it happens that the other side of a question is presented and thus it was on the day before the entertainment when rosamond had taken her brother tom to have his hair cut and to choose some false moustaches and the like requisites for their charades  they went first to pettitts the little hairdresser where tom was marvellously taken with the two penates and could hardly be dragged into the innermost recesses where in the middle of a sheet with a peignoir on his shoulders he submitted to the clipping of his ravenblack locks as mr pettitt called them on the condition of his sister looking on  presently they heard some feet enter the outer shop and mrs duncombes voice asking for mr pettitt while his mother replied that he would wait on her immediately but that he was just now engaged with the honourable mr de lancey  could she show them anything  oh no thank you well wait  dont let us keep you mrs pettitt it is only on business  ay said the other voicefemale and entirely untamed  hes your great ally about your gutters and drains isnt he  the only landowner in wilsbro who has a particle of public spirit said mrs duncombe  whereat goodnatured lady rosamond could not but smile congratulation to the haircutter who looked meekly elevated while tom whispered proverb contradicted  but the other voice replied of coursehes a perfumer learned in smells  youd better drop it bessie youll never make anything of it  ill never drop what the health and life of hundreds of my fellow creatures depend on  i wish i could make you understand gussie  youll never do anything with my governor if thats your hopeyou should hear him and the mum talking  its all nonsense he says im not going to annoy my tenants and make myself unpopular just to gratify a fashionable cry  well says mumsey it is not what was thought the thing for ladies in my time but you see if gussie goes along with it she will have the key to all the best county society  bother the county society says i  bessie duncombes jolly enoughbut such a stuckup set as they all are at compton ill not run after behaving so ill to the governor too  however  theres a proverb about listeners said rosamond emerging when she felt as if she ought to hearken no longer and finding mrs duncombe leaning with her back to the counter and a tall girl a few degrees from beauty in a ridinghabit sitting upon it  they both laughed and the girl added if you had waited a moment lady rosamond you would have heard that you were the only jolly one of all the biling  ah we shall see where you are at the end of mrs tallboys lectures said mrs duncombe  on what asked rosamond  womans rights or sanitary measures for i cant in the least understand why they should be coupled up together  nor i said miss moy  i dont see why we shouldnt have our own way just as well as the men but what that has to do with drains and gutters i cant guess  im the other way said rosamond  i think houses and streets ought to be made clean and healthy but as for womans rule i fancy we get more of it now than we should the other way  as an instance said mrs duncombe woman is set on cleansing wilsbro  man will not stir  will it ever be done till woman has her way  perhaps if woman would be patient man would do it in the right way instead of the wrong quoth rosamond  patient  no indeed  nothing is to be done by that  let every woman strive her utmost to get the work done as far as her powers go and the crusade will be accomplished for very shame  just then tom looking highly amused emerged followed by mr pettitt the only enlightened landlord on whom mrs duncombe had been able to produce the slightest impression  he had owned a few small tenements in water lane which he was about to rebuild and which were evidently the pivot of operations  at the door they met cecil and rosamond detained her a moment in the street to say my dear cecil is that miss moy coming on wednesday  of course she is  we greatly want to move her father  he has the chief house property there  it is too late now said rosamond but do you think it can be pleasant to jenny bowater to meet her  i know nothing of the old countrified animosities and gossipings which you have so heartily adopted replied cecil proudly firstly i ignore them as beneath me secondly i sacrifice them all to a great cause  if miss bowater does not like my guests let her stay away  here mrs duncombe stood on the step crying out well cecil how have you sped with mrs bungay  horrid woman and no more was heard as cecil entered mr pettitts establishment  that might be echoed said tom who was boiling over at the speech to his sister  i knew that ape was an intolerable little prig of a peacock but i didnt think she could be such a brute to you rosie is she often like that and does your parson stand such treatment of you  nonsense tom said rosamond it doesnt often happen and breaks no bones when it does  its only the ignorance of the woman and small blame to heras mrs mkinnon said when corporal simss wife threw the red herrings tail at her  but does julius stand it repeated tom fiercely as if hesitating whether to call out julius or mrs charnock poynsett  dont be so ridiculous tom  id rather stand a whole shower of red herrings tails at once than bother julius about his brothers wife  how would you and terry like it if your wives took to squabbling and setting you together by the ears  i was demented enough to try it once but i soon saw it was worse than anything  what  he took her part  no such thing  hold your tongue tommy and dont talk of married folk till youre one yourself  papa never meant it repeated the indignant tom  ive a great mind to write and tell him how you are served  now tom cried rosamond stopping short if you do that i solemnly declare ill never have you here again  what could papa do  do you think he could cure raymonds wife of being a ridiculous little prig  and if he couldwhy before your letter got to meerut she will be gone up to london and by the time she comes back well be safe in our own rectory  here come in and get our string and basket at mrs bungays  ill pay her out muttered tom as he followed his sister into mrs bungays shop one of much smaller pretensions for the sale of baskets brushes mats c  the mistress a stout redfaced woman looked as if she had been speaking a bit of her mind and was at first very gruff and ungracious until she found they were real customers and moreover toms bland irish courtesy perfectly disarmed her when rosamond having fixed her mind on a box in the very topmost pigeonhole they not only apologized for the trouble they were giving but tom offered to climb up and bring it down when she was calling for the errandboy in vain  its no trouble sir thank you id think nothing of that for you my lady nor for mr charnockwhich im sure ill never forget all he did for us at the fire leading my little alferd out like a lamb i beg your ladyships pardon maam if i seemed a bit hasty but ive been so put aboutand i thought at first youd come in on the same matter which im sure a lady like you wouldnt ever doabout the drains and such like which isnt fit for no lady to speak of as if water lane werent as sweet and clean as it has any call to be and as if we didnt know what was right by our tenants which are a bad lot and dont merit no money to be laid out on them  so you have houses in water lane mrs bungay  i didnt even know it  yes lady rosamond  my husband and i thought there was no better investment than to buy a bit of land when the waste was inclosed and run em up cheap  houses always lets here you see and the fire did no damage to that side  but of course you didnt know lady rosamond a real lady like you wouldnt go prying into what shes no call to like that fine deckedout body duncombes wife which had best mind her own children which it is a shame to see stravaging about the place  i know its her doing which i told young mrs charnock poynsett just now which im right sorry to see led along by the like of her and so are more of us and we all wish some friend would give her a hint which she is but youngand tis doing harm to mr charnock poynsett lady rosamond which all of us have a regard for as is but right having been a good customer and friend to the town and all before him but we cant have ladies coming in with their fads and calling us names for not laying out on whats no good to nobody just to satisfy them  as if wilsbro hadnt been always healthy  tom was wicked enough to put in a good many notes of sympathy at the intervals of the conjunctive whiches and to end by declaring quite right mrs bungay  you see how much better weve brought up my sister  i saywhats the price of that little dolls broom  what do you want of it tom  never you mind  no mischief i hope     chapter xvii the enchantments   it seems a shame the walrus said    to play them such a trick after weve brought them out so far    and made them trot so quick the carpenter said nothing but    the butters spread too thicklewis carroll  a telegram arrived from frank in the midst of the preparations on wednesday announcing that he was all right and should be at hazlitts gate at 810 pm  at 630 children of all sizes with manes of all colours were arriving and were regaled in the diningroom by anne assisted by jenny and charlie  anne had a pretty pink colour in her cheeks her flaxen locks were bound with green ribbons and green adorned her white dress in which she had a gracious lilylike look of unworldly purity  she thoroughly loved children was quite equal to the occasion and indeed enjoyed it as much as the recent christmas tree in the village school  such of cecils guests as were mothers for the most part came with their children but lady tyrrell her sister and others who were unattached arrived later and were shown to the library where she entertained them on the specified refreshment biscuits and coffee and enthroned mrs tallboys in the large armchair where she looked most beautiful and gorgeous in a robe of some astonishing sheeny skyblue edged with paly gold while on her head was a coronal of sapphire and gold with a marvellous little plume  the cost must have been enormous and her delicate and spirituelle beauty was shown to the greatest advantage but as the audience was far too scanty to be worth beginning upon cecil with a sigh at the folly of maternal idolatry went to hunt up her ladies from gazing at the babyish amusements of their offspring and miss moy in spite of her remonstrance jumped up to follow her while mrs duncombe the only good mother in this new sense remained keeping guard lest curiosity and the echo of piano music which now began to be heard should attract away any more of the ladies  cecil was by no means prepared for the scene  the drawingroom was crowdedchiefly indeed with ladies and children but there was a fair sprinkling of gentlemenand all had their faces turned towards the great glass doors opening into the conservatory which was brilliantly lighted and echoing with music and laughter  cecil tried to summon some of the ladies of her own inviting announcing that mrs tallboys was arrived but this appeared to have no effect yes thank you was all she heard  penetrating a little farther mrs tallboys is ready  thank you ill come but my little people are so anxious to have me with themmrs tallboys is waiting to the next who really did not hear but only responded did you ever see anything more charming  by this time cecil could see over the heads of the front rank of children  she hardly knew the conservatory  all the veteran camellia and orangetrees and a good many bay and laurel boughs besides were ranged along the central alley gorgeous with fairy lamps and jewels while strains of soft music proceeded from some unseen quarter  very pretty said cecil hastily trying another of her intended guests with her intelligence  reallyyes presently thank you was the absent answer  there is some delightful mystery in there  cecil found her attempts were vain and was next asked as one of the household what delicious secret was going on there and as it hurt her feelings to be left out she pressed into the conservatory with some vague intention of ordering anne if not rosamond to release her grownup audience and confine their entertainment to the children but she found herself at once caught by the hand by a turbaned figure like a prince in the arabian nights who with a low salaam waved her on  no thank you  im looking for  but retreat was impossible for many were crowding up in eager curiosity moreover a muslin bandage descendedon her eyes dont she expostulated im not at playim but her words were lost  hush the peris cave is near no one enters scatheless here lightly tread and lowly bend win the peri for your friend  sung a voice to the mysterious piano accompaniment and cecil found both hands taken and was forced to move on as she guessed the length of the conservatory amid sounds of suppressed laughter that exceedingly annoyed her till there was a pause and repetition of the two last lines with an attempt to make her obey them  she was too impatient and angry to perceive that it would have been much better taste to enter into the humour of the thing and she only said with all her peculiar cold petulance just like sleet let me go if you please i am engaged  i am waited for  peri gracious shes contumacious behold every hair shall bristle when she hears the magic whistle  and a whistle sharp long and loud sounded behind her amid peals of merriment  she turned sharply round but still the whistle was behind her and rang out again and again till she was half deafened and wholly irate while the repetition of  bend bend lowly bend win the peri for your friend  forced on her the conviction that on no other condition should she be set free though the recognition of terrys voice made the command doubly unpalatable and as she made the stiffest and most reluctant of courtesies a voice said  homage done you may be of this merry company  and with a last blast of the whistle the bandage was removed and she found herself in the midst of a half circle of laughing children and grown people in front of her a large opening like a cavern hung with tiny lamps of various colours in the midst of which stood the peri in a persian pink robe white turban and wide white trousers with two oriental genies attendant upon her  a string was thrust into cecils hand apparently fastened to her and accounting for some sharp pulls she had felt during the whistling  she drew it in front in sharp haste to be rid of the obnoxious instrument but instead of a whistle she found in her hand a little dustpan and brush fit for a babyhouse drawn through a ring while the children eagerly cried what have you got  what have you got  some nonsense  i do not approve of practical jokes began cecil but the song only replied  away away in the cave no longer stay others come to share our play  and one of the genies drew her aside while another blindfolded victim was being introduced with the same rites only fare more willingly  the only way open to here was that which led to the window of the diningroom where she found anne with the children who had had their share and were admiring their prizes  anne tried to soothe her by saying you see every one is served alike  they thought it would be newer than a tree  did you mean to give me this asked a little girl in whose hands cecil had thrust her dustpan without a glance at it  oh the ring said anne  you must keep that mrs poynsett thought you would like it  it is a gemsome greek goddess i think  is this her arrangement asked cecil pointing to the dustpan  oh no she knew nothing about that nor i but you see every one has something droll  see what mr bowater has  and herbert bowater showed that decidedly uncomplimentary penwiper where the asss head declares there are two of us while every child had some absurdity to show and miss moys shrieks of delight were already audible at a tortoiseshell penholder disguised as a huntingwhip  i must go to my friends said cecil vouchsafing no admiration of the ring though she had seen enough to perceive that it was a beautifully engraved ruby and she hurried back to the library but only to find all her birds flown and the room empty  pursuing them to the drawingroom she saw only the backs of a few in the rearmost rank of the eager candidates for admission to the magic cave  lady tyrrell alone saw her and turned back from the eager multitude to say in her low modulated voice beaten my dear able strategy on la belle meres part  wheres mrs tallboys  dont you see her blue feather eagerly expectant  just after you were gone edith bowater came in and begged us to come and see the conservatory lighted up and then came a rush of the brenden children after their aunt exclaiming wildly it was delicious lights and a fairy and a secret and every one got something if they were ever so old  of course after that there was nothing but to follow the stream  it is a regular plot for outwitting us  rosamond is dressed up for the fairy  they are all in league  well we must put a good face on it for the present said lady tyrrell  dont on any account look as if you were not in perfect accordance  you can show your sentiments afterwards you know  cecil saw she must acquiesce for mrs tallboys was full in the midst  with an infinitely better grace than her hostess she yielded herself to the sports bowed charmingly to the peri whirled like a fairy at the whistling and was rewarded with a little enamel padlock as a brooch and two keys as earrings indeed she professed with evident sincerity that she was delighted with these sports of the old country and thought the two genies exquisite specimens of the fair useless gentle english male aristocracy  mrs duncombe too accepted the inevitable with considerable spirit and goodhumour though she had a little passageatarms with julius when showing him the ivory cardcase that had fallen to her lot she said so this is the bribe  society stops the mouth of truth  that is as you choose to take it he said  exactly  when we want to go deep into eternal verities you silence us with frivolous din and dainty playthings for fear of losing your slaves  i dont grant that  then why hinder an earnest discussion by all this hubbub  because this was not the right place or time  it never is the right time for the tyrants to let their slaves confer or to hear hometruths  on the contrary my curiosity is excited  i want to hear mrs tallboys views  then when will you dine with us  next wednesday  thank you  wednesday has an evening service  ah  i told you it was never the right time  then thursday  and youll trust your wife with us  oh yes certainly  it is a bargain then  seven oclock or there will be no time  juliuss attention suddenly wandered  was not a whisper pervading the room of a railway accident  was not frank due by that nights train  there were still so many eager to visit the magic cave that julius trusted his wife would remain there sheltered from the report jenny bowater was behind a stand of trees acting orchestra but when terry came to the outskirts of the forest in search of other knights of the whistle julius laid a hand on him and gave instructions in case any rumour should reach rosamond to let her know how vague it was tell her that he was going to ascertain the truth and beg her to keep up the game and cause no alarm  next encountering anne he begged her to go to his mother and guard her from any alarm until there was some certainty  cant we send all these people away she asked  not yet  we had better make no unnecessary disturbance  there will be time enough if anything be amiss  i am going down to hazlitts gate  anne was too late  charlie had not outgrown the instinct of rushing to his mother with his troubles and he was despairingly telling the report he had heard of a direful catastrophe fatal to an unknown quantity of passengers while she strong and composed because he gave way was trying to sift his intelligence  no sooner did he hear from anne that julius was going to the station than he started up to accompany himthe best thing he could do in his present state  hardly however had he closed the door before he returned with fresh tears in his eyes leading in eleonora vivian whom he had found leaning against the wall outside white and still scarce drawing her breath  come he said and before she knew what he was doing she was at mrs poynsetts side  here mother he said take her  and he was gone  mrs poynsett stretched out her arms  the hearts of the two women who loved frank could not help meeting  eleonora sank on her knees hiding her face on the mothers breast with two tender arms clasped round her  anne was kneeling too but she was no longer the meek shy stranger now in the hour of trouble she poured forth in a voice fervent and sweet a prayer for protection and support for their beloved one so that it might be well with him whatever might be his heavenly fathers will  as she paused mrs poynsett in a choked voice said thank you dear child when there were steps in the hall  anne started up lenore buried her face on mrs poynsetts bosom the mother clasped her hands over her convulsively then beheld as the door opened a tall figure with a dark bright face full of ineffable softness and joy  frank himself safe and sound with his two brothers behind him  they stayed not to speak but hastened to spread the glad tidings while he flung himself down including both his mother and lenore in one rapturous embrace and carrying his kiss from one to the otherconscious if no one else was that this first seal of his love was given in his mothers arms  lenore did indeed extricate herself and stand up as rosy red as she had been pale but she had no room for any thought beyond his mothers trembling not hurt my dear  not hurt  not a scratch  thank god  oh thank god answered frank quivering all over with thankfulness though probably far more at the present joy than the past peril  yesoh thanks for his mercy echoed anne giving fervent hand and tearful cheek to the eager salutation which probably would have been as energetic to clio or old betty at that moment  but theres blood on your wristband cried the mother  you are hurt  no its not mine  i didnt know it  it is from the poor fellow i helped to carry into the publichouse at knoll just this side backsworth a good deal hurt im afraid  something had got on the lines i believe  i was half asleep and knew nothing till i found ourselves all crushed up together in the dark upsidedown my feet above my head  there was but one man in my carriage and we didnt get foul of one another and found we were all right when we scrambled out of the window  so we helped out the others and found that besides the engineer and stokerwho i dont suppose can live poor fellowsthere was only this man much damaged  then when there seemed no more to be done i took my bag and walked across country to reach home before you heard  but oh this is worth anything  he had to bend down for another embrace from his mother whose heart was very full as she held his bright young healthful face between her hands though all she said was you have walked eleven miles and more  you must be half starvedanne my dear pray let him have something  he can eat it here  ill see said anne hastening away  oh dont go lenore cried frank springing up  stay ive not seen youmother how sweet of you  but i forgot  you dont know i was only waiting till i was through  i understand my dear boy  but how  how did you find out  was it only that you knew she was the precious darling of my heart and now you see and own why cries frank almost beside himself with excitement and delight  it was lady tyrrell who told me said mrs poynsett sympathizing too much with the lovers to perceive that her standpoint of resistance was gone from her  yes said lenore  she knew of our walk and questioned me so closely that i could not conceal anything without falsehood  after she met me at aucuba villa asked frank  yes  did you tell her anything  i thought she knew more than i found afterwards that she did said frank but theres no harm done  it is all coming now  she told my father said eleonora sadly and he cannot understand our delay  he is grieved and displeased and thinks i have not been open with him  oh that will be all right tomorrow said frank  ill have it out with a free heart now theres no fear but that i have passed and ive got the dearest of mothers  i feel as if i could meet him if he were a dozen examiners rolled into one instead of the good old benevolent parent that he is  ha  annesusanjenkinsthank youthats splendid  may i have it here  superexcellent  only heres half the claypit sticking to me  let me just run up and make myself decent  only dont let her run away  perhaps clio would have scorned the instinct that made a charnock unable to enjoy a muchneeded meal in the presence of mother and of love till the traces of the accident and the long walk had been removed  his old nurse hurried afterostensibly to see that his linen was at hand but really to have her share of the petting and congratulation and lenore stood a little embarrassed till mrs poynsett held out her arms with the words my dear child and again she dropped on her knee by the couch and nestled close in thankful joy  presently however she raised herself and said sadly almost coldly i am afraid you have been surprised into this  i must love one who so loves my boy was the ardent answer  i couldnt help it said the maiden again abandoning herself to the tenderness  oh it is so good of you  my dear dear daughter  only please give me one mothers kiss  i have so longed for one  poor motherless child  my sweet daughter  then after a pause eleonora said indeed ill try to deserve better but oh pray forgive me if i cost him much more pain and patience than i am worth  he thinks you well worth anything and perhaps i do said mrs poynsett who was conquered won over delighted more than by either of the former brides in spite of all antecedents  then will you always trust me said eleonora with clasped hands and a wondrous look of earnest sincerity on her grave open brow and beautiful pensive dark blue eyes  i must my dear  and indeed i dont think i could help holding to him because he seems my one stay and hope here and now i know it is all right with you indeed it is such happiness as i never knew  she laid her head down again in subdued joy and rest  but the pause was broken by franks return and a moment after in darted the peri in her pink cashmere costume with a glow transforming her usually colourless face  dear dear frank im so glad she cried bestowing her kiss while he cried in amazement is it rose  is there a fancy ball  only aladdins cave  im just out of it and while jenny is keeping up games and edith is getting up a charade i could dash in to see that frank was all there and more too  the exam is safe eh  i trust so said frank the list will not come just yet but i am told i am certain of a passindeed that i stand high as to numbers  thats noblenow mrs poynsett turn him out as soon as he has eaten his dinner  we want any one who can keep up a respectable kind of a row  i say will you two do ferdinand and miranda playing at chess  you look just like it  must we go asked frank reluctantly and there was something in the expression of his face a little paler than usual that reminded his mother that the young man had for the first time seen sudden and violent death that day and that though his present gladness was so great yet that he had gone through too much in body and mind for the revels of the evening not either to jar or to produce a vehement reaction if he were driven into them  so she answered by pleading the eleven miles walk and the queen of the sports was merciful adding but i must be gone or terry will be getting up his favourite tableau of the wounded men of clontarf or rothesay or the black bulls head or some equally pleasing little incident  is it going on well asked mrs poynsett  sweetly  couldnt be better  they have all amalgamated and are in the midst of the old family coach with captain duncombe telling the story  he is quite up to the trick and enjoys turning the tables on his ladies  and camilla asked lenore in a hesitating anxious tone  oh shes gone in for it  i think she is the springs  i heard her ask where you were and charley told her so you need not be afraid to stay in peace if you have a turn that way  goodbye youd laugh to see how delighted people are to be let off the lecture and she bent over lenore with a parting kiss full of significance of congratulation  she returned after changing her dress to find a pretty fairy tableau contrived by the bowater sisters in full progress and delighting the children and the mothers  lady vivian contrived to get a word with her as she returned  beautifully managed lady rosamond  i tell cecil she should enjoy a defeat by such strategy  it is mrs poynsetts regular christmas party said rosamond not deigning any other reply  i congratulate her on her skilful representatives said lady tyrrell  may i ask if we are to see the hero of the day  no what you would say better employed  poor children we must let them alone tonight for their illusion though i am sorry it should be deepened it will be only the more pain by and by  i dont see that said rosamond stoutly  ah  lady rosamond you are a happy young bride untaught what is limpossible  rosamond could not help thinking that no one understood it better than she as the eldest of a large family with more rank and far more desires than means but she disliked lady tyrrell far too much for even her open nature to indulge in confidences and she made a successful effort to escape from her neighbourhood by putting two pale female fullers into the place of honour in front of the folding doors into the small drawingroom which served as a stage and herself hovered about the rear wishing she could find some means of silencing miss moys voice which was growing louder and more boisterous than ever  the charade which rosamond had expected was the inoffensive if commonplace inspector and the window she beheld when the curtain drew up was she supposed the bar of an inn  but no on the board were two heads ideals of male and female beauty one with a waxed moustache the other with a huge chignon vividly recalling mr pettitts penates  presently came by a dapper professor in blue spectacles and a college cap who stood contemplating and indulging in a harangue on entities and molecules spirit and matter affinities and development while the soft deep brown eyes of the chignoned head languished and the blue ones of the moustached one rolled and the muscles twitched and the heads turned till by a strong process of will explained by the professor they bent their necks erected themselves and finally started into life and the curtain fell on them with clasped hands  it rose to show the newlyanimated pair junius brutus and barberina his wife at the breakfast table with a boars head of brawn before them while the lady barberina boldly asserted her claims to the headship of the house  had she not lately been all head  the pathetic reply was would it were so still my dear  all head and no tongue like our present meal  the lady heaved up the boars head to throw at him and the scene closed  next brutus was seen awkwardly cleaning his accoutrements having enlisted as he soliloquized to escape from woman  enter a sergeant with a rich irish brogue and other recruits forming the awkward squad  the drill was performed with immense spirit but only one of the soldiers showed any dexterity but while the sergeant was upholding him as the very moral of a patthern to the rest poor brutus was seized with agonizing horror at the recognition of barberina in this disguise  why not she argued  why should not woman learn to use the arms of which man has hitherto usurped the use  poor brutus stretched out his arms in despair and called loudly for the professor to restore him to his original state of silent felicity in the barbers window  ye neednt do that me boy quoth the sergeant with infinite scorn  be ye where ye will yell never be aught but a blockhead  therewith carriages were being announced to the heads of families and with compliments and eager thanks and assurances that nothing could have been more delightful the party broke up  captain duncombe while muffling his boys declared that he never saw a cleverer hit in his life and that those two de lancey brothers ought to be on the stage while miss moy loudly demanded whether he did not feel it personal and mrs tallboys gracefully shaking hands with anne and rosamond declared it a grand challenge where the truth had been unconsciously hit off  cecil was nowhere to be seen     chapter xviii demonstrations   nursing her wrath to keep it warmburns  the hours of the soiree had been early but the breakfast was so irregular and undecided as to time that no one took much notice of an intimation which jenkins had received from the grim mrs grindstone that mrs charnock poynsett would take breakfast in her own room  indeed they all felt glad that her views of etiquette did not bind them to their places for frank was burning to be off to sirenwood forgetting that it was far easier to be too early than too late for sir harry vivian who was wont to smoke till long after midnight and was never visible till the midday repast  and thus it was lady tyrrell who came to frank alone  early afoot she said you foolish impatient fellow  you will outrun my best advice  ah but im armed  i always told you we might trust to my mother and it is all right  she loves lenore with all her heart and consents freely and gladly  indeed  well the dear child has made her conquest  i always knew she would when once reserve was broken down  did you get up the alarm on purpose  really one would think i had done so  one such moment was worth years of ordinary meetings  half the battle is won  have you seen your mother this morning  no but she knew i was coming  then you do not know what her feelings are on cooler reflection  my mother would never retract what she has once assured me of said frank haughtily  forgive meof what has she assured you  that she regards eleonora as a dear daughter and that implies doing the same for me as for my brothers  if sir harry would but be so good as to come and see her  stay frank you have not come that length  you forget that if you have as you say gained half the battle there is another half and that my father very reasonably feels hurt at being the last to be favoured with the intelligence  dear lady tyrrell you can see how it was  there was no helping it when once i could speak to lenore and then no one would have let me utter a word till i had gone through the examination  we never meant to go on a system of concealment but you know how every one would have raved and stormed if i had betrayed a thought beyond old driver and yet it was only being at rest about lenore that carried me through without breaking down  cant you see  you special pleader  may you win over my father but you must remember that we are a fallen house unable to do all we wish  if i might see sir harry  i must make him forgive me  i will see whether he is ready  could franks eyes have penetrated the walls he would have seen lady tyrrell received with the words well my dear i hope you have got rid of the young manpoor fellow  i am afraid that cannot be done without your seeing him yourself  hang it  i hate it  i cant abide it camilla  hes a nice lad though he is his mothers son and lenores heart is set on him and i cant bear vexing the child  lena cares for him only because she met him before she knew what life is like  after one season she will understand what five hundred a year means  well you ought to know your sister best but if the lad has spoken to her lena is not the girl to stand his getting his conge so decidedly  exactly it would only lead to heroics and deepen the mischief  hang it  then what do you want me to say  stand up for your rights and reduce him to submission by displeasure at not having been consulted  then explain how there can be no engagement at once put him on his honour to leave her free till after her birthday in november  what have him dangling after her  thats no way to make her forget him  she never will under direct oppositionshe is too highspirited for that but if we leave it alone and they are unpledged there is a fair chance of her seeing the folly both for her and for him  i dont know that  lena may be highflown but things go deep with the childdeeper than they did with you camilla  perhaps this was a stab for there was bitterness in the answer you mean that she is less willing to give up a fancy for the family good  remember it is doubly imperative that lena should marry a man whose means are in his own power so that he could advance something  this would be simply ruinthrowing up the whole thing after all i have done to retrieve our position  after all camilla i am growing an old man and poor tom is gone i dont know that the position is worth so much to me as the happiness to her poor child said sir harry wistfully  happiness was the scornful answer  if you said her own way it would be nearer the truth  a back street in londongoing about in a caband occasional holidays on sufferance from mrs poynsett  however little happiness either father or daughter had derived from their chosen ways this idea was abhorrent to both and lady tyrrell pressed her advantage  if we keep him waiting much longer he will be rushing after lena and if you show the least sign of relenting he will insist on dragging you to an interview with his mother  the threat was effectual for sir harry had had passagesat arms enough with mrs poynsett to make him dread her curt dry civility far more than either dun or bailiff and he was at once roused to the determination to be explicit  frank met him with crimson face and prepared speech  good morning sir harry  i am afraid you may think that you have reason to complain of my not having spoken to you sooner but i trusted to your previous knowledge of my feelings and i was anxious to ascertain my position before laying it before you though i dont believe i should have succeeded unless my mind had been set at rest  softhearted sir harry muttered i understand but  the pause at that but was so long that frank ventured on going on i have not had an official communication but i know privately that i have passed well and stand favourably for promotion so that my income will go on increasing and my mother will make over to me five thousand pounds as she has done to miles and julius so that it can be settled on eleonora at once  there there thats enough said sir harry coerced by his daughters glances theres plenty of time before coming to all that  you see my dear boy i always liked you and had an immense respect for youryour family but you see eleonora is young and under the circumstances she ought not to engage herself  she cant any way marry before coming of age andconsidering all thingsi should much prefer that this should go no further  you ought both to be free said lady tyrrell  that i can never be  nor do you think that she canonly it sounds presumptuous smiled lady tyrrell  who can say  but things have to be proved and considering what young untried hearts are it is safer and happier for both that there should be perfect freedom so that no harm should be done if you found that you had not known your own minds  it will make no difference to me  oh yes we know that laughed sir harry  only suppose you changed your mind we could not be angry with you  you dont think i could  no no said lady tyrrell we think no such thing  dont you see if we did not trust your honour we could not leave this in suspense  all we desire is that these matters may be left till it is possible to see our way when the affairs of the estate are wound up for we cant tell what the poor child will have  come dont repeat that it will make no difference  it may not to you but it must to us and to your mother  my mother expects nothing said frank eagerly but it was a false step  sir harry bristled up saying sir my daughter shall go into no family thatthat has not a proper appreciation ofand expectations befitting her position  dear papa exclaimed lady tyrrell he means no such thing  he is only crediting his mother with his own romantic ardour and disinterestednesshark there actually is the gong  come and have some luncheon and contain yourself you foolish boy  i am sorry i said anything that seemed unfitting said frank meekly  you know i could not mean it  yes yes yes i bear no malice only one does not like to see ones own child courted without a voice in the matter and to hear she is to be taken as a favour expecting nothing  but there well say no more  i like you frank charnock and only wish you had ten thousand a year or were any one else but you seeyou see well lets eat our luncheon  does she know this decision asked frank aside as he held open the door for lady tyrrell  yes she knows it can go no further though we are too merciful to deny you the beatific vision provided you are good and abstain from any more little tendresses for the presentahenter cecil i thought we should see you today my dear  yes i am on my way to meet my husband at the station said cecil meeting her in the hall and returning her kiss  is raymond coming home today said frank as he too exchanged greetings  ah  i remember i did not see you at breakfast this morning  no and there was signification in the voice but frank did not heed it for coming downstairs was eleonora her face full of a blushing sweetness which gave it all the beauty it had ever lacked  he could do no more than look and speak before all the rest the carriage was ordered for the sisters to go out together and he lingered in vain for a few words in private for sir harry kept him talking about captain duncombes wonderful colt till cecil had driven off one way and their two hostesses the other and he could only ride home to tell his mother how he had sped  better than rosamond better even than charlie was his mother as a confidante and though she had been surprised into her affectionate acceptance of eleonora it was an indescribable delight to mother and son to find themselves once more in full sympathy while he poured out all that had been pent up ever since his winter at rockpier  she almost made common cause with him in the question what would raymond say  and it proved to be news to her that her eldest son was to be immediately expected at home  cecil had not come to see her and had sent her no message but ungracious inattention was not so uncommon as to excite much remark from one who never wished to take heed to it and it was soon forgotten in the praise of eleonora  cecil meanwhile was receiving raymond at the station  he was pleased to see her there in her ponycarriage but a little startled by the brief coldness of her reply to his inquiry after his mother and the tight compression of her lips all the time they were making their way through the town where as usual he was hailed every two or three minutes by persons wanting a word with him  when at last there was a free space she began  raymond i wish to know whether you mean me to be set at naught and my friends deliberately insulted  what  a gentleman here hurried up with ill not detain you a minute  he did however keep them for what seemed a great many to the chafing spirit which thought a husband should have no ears save for his wifes wrongs so she made her preface even more startling raymond i cannot remain in the house any longer with lady rosamond charnock and those intolerable brothers of hers  perhaps you will explain yourself said raymond almost relieved by the evident exaggeration of the expressions  there has been a conspiracy to thwart and insult mea regular conspiracy  cecil let me understand you  what can have happened  when i arranged an evening for my friends to meet mrs tallboys i did not expect to have it swamped by a pack of children and noisy nonsensical games nor that both she and i should be insulted by practical jokes and a personal charade  a party to meet mrs tallboys  a ladies party a conversazione  whatby my mothers wish  i was given to understand that i had carte blanche in visiting matters  you did not ask her consent  i saw no occasion  you did not  no  then cecil i must say that whatever you may have to complain of you have committed a grave act of disrespect  i was told that i was free to arrange these things  free said raymond thoroughly roused free to write notes and order the carriage and play lady of the house but did you think that made you free to bring an american mountebank of a woman to hold forth absurd trash in my mothers own drawingroom as soon as my back was turned  i should have done the same had you been there  indeed ironically i did not know how far you had graduated in the rights of women  so you invited these people  then the whole host of children was poured in on us and everything imaginable done to interrupt and render everything rational impossible  i know it was rosamonds contrivance she looked so triumphant dressed in an absurd fancy dress and her whole train doing nothing but turning me into ridicule and mrs tallboys too whatever you choose to call her you cannot approve of a stranger and foreigner being insulted here  it is that about which i care not myself i have seen none of them since nor shall i do so until a full apology has been made to my guest and to myself  you have not told me the offence  in the first place there was an absurd form of christmastree to which one was dragged blindfold and sedulously made ridiculous and ii had a dustpan and brush  yes i had in mockery of our endeavours to purify that unhappy street  i should have taken it as a little harmless fun said raymond depend on it it was so intended  what when mrs tallboys had a padlock and key  i see you are determined to laugh at it all  most likely they consulted you beforehand  cecil i cannot have you talk such nonsense  is this all you have to complain of  no  there was a charade on the word blockhead where your brother charles and the two de lanceys caricatured what they supposed to be mrs tallboys doctrines  how did she receive it  most goodhumouredly but that made it no better on their part  are you sure it was not a mere ordinary piece of pleasantry with perhaps a spice of personality but nothing worth resenting  you did not see it  or perhaps you think no indignity towards me worth resentment  i do not answer that cecil you will think better of those words another time said raymond sternly  but when you want your cause taken up you have to remember that whatever the annoyance you brought it upon yourself and her by your own extraordinary proceeding towards my motheri will not say towards myself  i will try to smooth matters  i think the de lanceys must have acted foolishly but the first step ought to be an expression of regret for such conduct towards my mother  i cannot express regret  i ought to have been told if there were things forbidden  must i forbid your playing punch and judy or dancing on the tight rope cried raymond exasperated  cecil bit her lip and treated the exclamation with the silent dignity of a deeply injured female and thus they reached home when raymond said come to your senses cecil and apologize to my mother  you can explain that you did not know the extent of your powers  certainly not  they all plotted against me and i am the person to whom apology is due  wherewith she marched upstairs leaving raymond horribly perplexed to repair at once to his mothers room where frank still was but after replying about his success in the examination the younger brother retreated preferring that his story should be told by his mother but she had not so much as entered on it when raymond demanded what had so much disturbed cecil  i was afraid she would be vexed said mrs poynsett but we were in a difficulty  we thought she hardly knew what she had been led into and that as she had invited her ladies it would do less harm to change the character of the party than to try to get it given up  i have no doubt you did the best you could said raymond speaking with more like censure of his mother than he had ever done since the hot days of his love for camilla vivian and you could have had nothing to do with the personalities that seem to have been the sting  mrs poynsett true boylover that she was had been informed of the success of toms naughtinessnot indeed till after it was over when there was nothing to be done but to shake her head and laugh and now she explained so that her son came to a better understanding of what had happened  as to the extinguishing womens rights in childs play he saw that it had been a wise manoeuvre of his mother to spare any appearance of dissension while preventing what she disapproved and what might have injured his interests but he was much annoyed with the de lanceys for having clogged the measure with their own folly and judging of cause by effect he would hear of no excuse for rosamond or her brothers and went away resolved that though nothing should induce him to quarrel with julius yet he should tell him plainly that he must restrain his wife and her brothers from annoying cecil by their practical jokes  he was as usual perfectly gentle to his mother and thanked her for her arrangement  it was not her fault that it had not turned out better he said and he did not seem to hear her exoneration of rosamond  he had scarcely gone when rosamond came in from the village asking whether he had arrived as she had seen his hat in the hall  yes rosamond  you did not tell me of cecils vexation  cecil  have i seen her since  no i remember now  but is she angry  was it the dustpan  oh tom tom  that and the blockhead  did tom say anything very cutting  why it was an old stock charade they acted two years ago  i had better tell her so  if you would it would be an immense relief my dear  raymond is very much annoyed she says she will speak to nobody till she has had an apology  then she can be as great a goose as i  why the yankee muse and mrs duncombe took all in good part but cecil has not atom of fun in her  dont you think that was the gift the fairies left out at the christening of the allendowed princess  mrs poynsett laughed but anxiously  my dear if you can make peace it will be a family blessing  i  ill eat any dirt in the world and make tom eat it too rather than you should be vexed or make discord in the house cried rosamond kissing her and speeding away to cecils door  it was raymond who opened it looking perturbed and heated but a good deal amazed at seeing his intended scapegoat coming thus boldly to present herself  let me in she breathlessly said  i am come to tell cecil how sorry i am she was so much vexed i really did not know it before  i am ready to accept any proper apology that is offered me said cecil with cold dignity but i cannot understand your profession that you did not know i was vexed  you could have intended nothing else  but cecil you misunderstood began rosamond  i never misunderstand  no human creature can say that interposed raymond immensely thankful to rosamondwhatever her offencefor her overtures and anxious they should be accepted  i could not continued cecil misunderstand the impertinent insults offered to my friends and to myself though if lady rosamond is willing to acknowledge the impropriety i will overlook it  raymonds face and neck crimsoned but raymonds presence helped her to rein in her temper and she thought of julius and refrained from more than a very well  it was meant as a harmless joke andand if youyou did not take it so i am very sorry  raymond saw the effort and looked at his wife for softening but as he saw none he met the advance by saying kindly i am sure it was so meant though the moment was unfortunate  indeed it was so cried rosamond feeling it much easier to speak to him and too generous to profess her own innocence and give up tom  it was just a moments idle fancyjust as weve chaffed one another a hundred times and for the blockhead it is the boys pet old stock charade that theyve acted scores of times  it was mere thoughtlessness and ill do or say anything cecil pleases if only she wont bother julius or mrs poynsett about our foolishness and the mist of tears shone in the dark lashes as she held out her hand  i cannot suppose it mere thoughtlessness began cecil but raymond cut her short with angry displeasure of which she had not supposed him capable  this is not the way to receive so kind an apology  take rosamonds hand and respond properly  to respond properly was as little in cecils power as her will but she had not been an obedient daughter for so large a proportion of her life without having an instinct for the voice of real authority and she did not refuse her hand with the words if you express regret i will say no more about it  and rosamond thinking of julius and his mother swallowed the ungraciousness and saying thank you turned to go away  thank you most heartily for this my dear rosamond said raymond holding out his hand as he opened the door for her i esteem it a very great kindness  rosamond as she felt the strong pressure of his hand looked up in his face with a curious arch compassion in her great gray eyes  he shut the door behind her and saw cecil pouting by the mantelpiece vexed at being forced into a reconciliation even while she knew she could not persist in sending all the family except frank to coventry  he was thoroughly angry at the dogged way in which she had received this free and generous peacemaking and he could not but show it  well he said i never saw an apology made with a better grace nor received with a worse one  cecil made no reply  he stood for a minute looking at her with eyes of wondering displeasure then with a little gesture of amazement left the room  cecil felt like the drowning woman when she gave the last scissor like gesture with her fingers  she was ready to fall into a chair and cry  a sense of desolateness was very strong on her and that look in his dark eyes had seemed to blast her  but pride came to her aid  grindstone was moving about ready to dress her for dinner  no one should see that she was wounded or that she took home displeasure which she did not merit  so she held up her head and was chilling and dignified all dinnertime after which she repaired to lady tyrrells conversazione     chapter xix the monstrous regiment of women   descend my muse  raymond had been invited by one of his fellowguests to make a visit at his house and this was backed up on the morning after his return by a letter containing a full invitation to both himself and his wife  he never liked what he called doing nothing in other peoples houses but he thought any sacrifice needful that might break up cecils present intimacies and change the current of her ideas and his mother fully agreed in thinking that it would be well to being a round of visits to last until the session of parliament should have begin  by the time it was over julius and rosamond would be in their own house and it might be easier to make a new beginning  the friends whom he could reckon on as sure to welcome him and his bride were political acquaintances of mark far above the dunstone range and cecil could not but be gratified even while mrs duncombe and her friend declared that they were going to try to demoralize her by the seductions of the aristocracy  after all cecil was too much of an ingrained charnock to be very deeply imbued with womens rights  all that she wanted was her own way and opposition  lady tyrrell had fascinated her and secured her affection and she followed her lead which was rather that of calm curiosity and desire to hear the subject ventilated than actual partisanship for which her ladyship was far too clever as well as too secure in her natural supremacy  they had only seemed on that side because other people were so utterly alien to it and because of their friendship with the really zealous mrs duncombe  the sanitary cause which had become mixed with it was however brought strongly before their minds by mrs tallboys final lecture at which she impressed on the ladies minds with great vehemence that here they might lead the way  if men would not act as a body the ladies should set the example and shame them by each doing her very utmost in the cleansing of the nests of disease that reeked in the wornout civilization of the cities of the old country  the ladies listened  lady tyrrell with a certain interest in such an eager flow of eloquence eleonora with thoughts far away  bessie duncombe expressed a bold practical determination to get one fragment at least of the work done since she knew pettitt the hairdresser was publicspirited enough to allow her to carry out her ideas on his property and cecil with her ample allowance as yet uncalled for in the abundance of her trousseau promised to supply what the hairdresser could not advance as a tangible proof of her sincerity  she held a little council with mrs duncombe at the working society when she resigned her day into that ladys hands on going away  i shall ask mrs miles charnock said that lady  you dont object  oh no only dont ask her till im gone and you know she will only come on condition of being allowed to expound  we must have somebody and now the thing has gone on so long and will end in three months the goody element will not do much harm and unluckily most women will not act without it  you have been trying to train miss moy  i shall try still but i cant get her to take interest in anything but the boisterous side of emancipation  i cant bear the girl said cecil i am sure she comes only for the sake of the horses  im afraid so but she amuses bob and theres always a hope of moving her father through her though she declares that the three pigeons is his tenderest point and that he had as soon meddle with it as with the apple of his eye  i suppose he gets a great rent from that gadley  do you really think you shall do anything with her said cecil who might uphold her at home but whose taste was outraged by her  i hope so  at any rate she is not conventional  why when i was set free from my school at paris and married bob three months later i hadnt three ideas in my head beyond horses and balls and soldiers  it has all come with life and reading my dear  and a very odd all it was so far but there was this difference between bessie duncombe and cecil charnock poynsett that the gospel of progress was to the one the first she had ever really known and became a reaching forward to a newlyperceived standard of benevolence and nobleness  to the other it was simply retrograding and that less from conviction than from the spirit of rivalry and opposition  lady tyrrell with her father and sister were likewise going to leave home to stay among friends with whom sir harry could hunt until the london campaign when eleonora was to see the world  thus the bazaar was postponed until the return of the ladies in the summer when the preparations would be more complete and the season more suitable  the church must wait for it for nothing like a sufficient amount of subscription had been as yet promised  there was still however to come that select dinnerparty at mrs duncombes to which julius moved by her zeal and honesty as well as by curiosity had promised his presence with rosamond at his peril as she said  they were kept so long at the door of aucuba villa that they had begun to doubt if they had not mistaken the day until the sirenwood carriage crashed up behind them and after the third pull at the bell they were admitted by an erect alert figurea remnant of captain duncombes military life  he marshalled them into the drawingroom where by dim firelight they could just discern the professor and a certain goodnatured horsey friend of the captains who sprang up from easychairs on the opposite sides of the fire to greet them while the man hastily stirred up the fire lighted the gas dashed at the table shutting up an open blottingbook that lay on it closing an inkbottle and gathering up some torn fragments or paper which he would have thrown into the scrapbasket but that it was full of little books on the hundred ways of dressing a pumpkin  then he gave a wistful look at the ami de la maison as if commending the guests to him and receiving a nod in return retired  i fear we are too early said lady tyrrell  fact is said the familiar whose name julius was trying to remember theres been a catastrophe cook forgot to order the turkey went to bed last night in hysterics and blew out the gas instead of turning it off  no noas the guests expecting fatal consequences looked as if they thought they had better remove themselves  she came round and duncombe has driven over to backsworth to bring home the dinner  hell soon be back  this not appearing greatly to reassure the visitors the professor added no no ladies  mrs duncombe charged me to say that she will be perfectly fixed in a short time and i flatter myself that my wife is equal to any emergency  it is very kind in her said lady tyrrell  i confess said professor tallboys that i am not sorry that such an occasion should occur of showing an american ladys domestic powers  i flatter myself they do not discredit her cause  just then were heard the wheels of the drag and in rushed one of the boys grasping eleonoras skirts and proclaiming weve got the grub  oysters and a pie  oh my  satisfactory said the friend  but let go ducky you are rumpling miss vivian  shes coming to see the quarion  you promised lena  heres a jolly crayfish  hell pinch  there was a small conservatory or glazed niche on one side of the room into which the boy dragged lenore and julius followed dimly sensible of what the quarion might be and hoping for a word with the young lady while he trusted to his wife to occupy her sister  the place contained two desolate camellias with leaves in the same proportion as those on trees in the earlier ages of illumination and one scraggy leafless geranium besides a green and stagnant tank where a goldfish moved about flapping and gasping as the boy disturbed it in his search for the crayfish  he absorbed all the conversation so that julius could only look back into the room where an attempt at artistic effect was still dimly visible through accumulated litter  the venus of milo stood on a bracket with a ridingwhip in her arms and a bundle of working society tickets behind her and her visavis the faun of praxiteles was capped by a glove with one finger pointing upwards and had a ball of worsted tangled about his legs but further observation was hindered by the manservants voice at the outer door master ducky where are you your ma says you are to go to bed directly  no no ill put myself to bed  come sir please do like a good boymaster pinney wont go without you and i must put him to bed while they are dishing up come sir ive got a mincepie for you  and some oystersbobby said i should have some oysters  yes yes come along sir  and master ducky submitted to his fate while julius looked his wonder and asked is he nurserymaid  just now since the bonne went said lenore  he is a most faithful attached servant who will do anything for them  she does attach people deeply when the first shock is over  i am coming to believe so he answered  there seem to me to be excellent elements  i am so glad said lenore she is so thorough so true and frank and much of this oddness is really an inconsistent struggle to keep out of debt  well at any rate i am thankful to her for this opportunity of seeing you said julius  we have both been longing to speak our welcome to you  thank you  it is so kind she fervently whispered all the kinder for the state of things that is insisted onthough you know that it can make no real difference she added apparently addressing the goldfish  frank knows it said julius in a low voice  i trust he does though i cannot see him to assure himyou will she added looking up at him with a shy brightness in her eye and a flush on her cheek  yes indeed he said laying his hand on hers for a moment  i fear you may both have much to pull through but i think you are of a steadfast nature  i hope soi think i am for none of my feelings seem to me ever to change except that i get harder and i am afraid bitterer  i can understand your feeling that form of trial  oh if you could and would help me  as a brother if i may  again she laid a hand on his saying i have longed to talk openly to you ever since we met in the cowshed but i could not make any advance to any of you because she whispered in haste i thought it my duty to hold back from frank  and now till we go away camilla watches me and occupies me every minute will not even let me ride out with papa  i wonder she lets me talk to you now  we know each other said julius shortly  it was so  once in the plainspoken days of childhood miles and julius had detected camilla vivian in some flagrant cheating at a game and had roundly expressed their opinion  in the subsequent period of raymonds courtship miles had succumbed to the fascination but julius had given one such foil that she had never again attempted to cajole him  i have seen that you did from the first said lenore  and it would make it much easier to talk to you than to any outsider who would never understand even if it were possible for me to explain how hard it is to see which way my duty liesespecially filial  do you mean in general or in this special matter  both  you see in her hands he is so different from what he was before she came home that i dont feel as if i was obeying him only her and i dont think i am bound to do that  not in the great matter i am clear  nobody can meddle with my real sincere pledge of myself to frank nobody she spoke as if there was iron in her lips  but as far as overt acts go they have a right to forbid me till i am of age at least and we must bear it  yes you are right there  but there are thousands of other little cases of right and wrong and altogether i have come to such a spirit of opposition that i find it easier to resist than to do anything with a good grace  you cannot always tell when resistance is principle and when temper or distaste  theres distaste enough always said poor lenore  to gaieties he said amazed as one habituated to his wifes ravenous appetite for any sort of society or amusement  of course she answered sadly  a great deal of trouble just for a little empty babble  often not one word worth remembering and a general sense of having been full of bad feelings  no enjoyment he asked in surprise  only by the merest chance and exception she answered surprised at his surprise what is there to enjoy  the peculiarlooking clergyman might have seemed more likely to ask such a question than the beautiful girl but he looked at her anxiously and said dont nourish morbid dislike and contempt my dear lena it is not a safeguard  there are such things as perilous reactions  try to weigh justly and be grateful for kindness and to like what is likeable  at that moment after what had been an interval of weary famine to all but these two host and hostess appeared the lady as usual picturesque though in the old black silk with a roman sash tied transversely and holly in her hair and gaily shaking hands thats right lady rosamond so you are trusted here  your husband hasnt sent you to represent him  im afraid his confidence in me did not go so far said rosamond  ah  i seelady tyrrell how dye doyouve brought lena  well rector are you prepared  that depends on what you expect of me  have you the convinceable spot in your mind  we must find it  it is very uncommon and indurates very soon so we had better make the most of our opportunity said the american lady who had entered as resplendent as before though in so different a style that rosamond wondered how such a wardrobe could be carried about the world and the sporting friend muttered stunning she has been making kickshaws all day and looks as if she came out of a bandbox  if all women were like that it might pay  it was true  mrs tallboys was one of those women of resource whose practical powers may well inspire the sense of superiority and with the ease and confidence of her country  the meal was a real success  that some portion had been procured ready dressed at backsworth was evident but all that had been done at home had a certain piquant transatlantic flavour in which the american muse could be detected and both she and her husband were polished lively and very agreeable in spite of the twang in their voices  miss moy the captain and his friend talked horses at one end of the table and rosamond faltered her womans horror for the rights of her sex increased by this supposed instance  when the ladies rose at dessert mrs duncombe summoned him  come rectorcome professor youre not to sit over your wine  we rise so far above the ordinary level of manhood said julius obediently rising  once for all mr charnock said mrs duncombe turning on him with flashing eyes and her elizabethan majesty if you come prepared to scoff we can have nothing to do with you  rosamonds eyes looked mischievous and her brow cocked but julius answered in earnest really i assure you i have not come in a spirit of sarcasm i am honestly desirous of hearing your arguments  shall i stay in your stead added miss moy  theyll be much more amusing here  come gussie youre on your good behaviour said mrs duncombe bob kept you to learn the right way of making a sensation  as they entered the drawingroom two more guests arrived namely joanna bowater and herbert who walked in with a kind of grim submission till he saw lady tyrrell when he lighted up and on a little gracious gesture with her hand he sat down on the sofa beside her and was there solaced by an occasional remark in an undertone for indeed the boy was always in a trance wherever she was and she had a fair amount of byplay wherewith to entertain herself and him during the discussion  you are just in time jenny said rosamond the great question is going to be started  and it is  the equality of the sexes pronounced mrs duncombe  ex cathedra said julius as the graceful muse seated herself in a large red armchair  this scene is not an easy one in which to dispute it  you see bessie said mrs tallboys that men are so much afraid of the discussion that they try to elude it with empty compliment under which is couched a covert sneer  perhaps returned julius we might complain that we cant open our lips without compliments and sneers being detected when we were innocent of both  were you demanded mrs tallboys  honestly i was looking round and thinking the specimens before us would tell in your favour  what a gallant parson cried miss moy  but a perfect clamour broke out from others  julius thats too bad when you know  mr charnock you are quite mistaken  bob is much cleverer than i in his own line  quite true rector affirmed herbert joan has more brains than all the rest of usfor a woman i mean  for a woman repeated mrs tallboys  let a human being do or be what she will it is disposed of in a moment by that one verdict very well for a woman  how is it with the decision of posterity said jenny  can you show any work of woman of equal honour and permanence with that of men  because her training has been sedulously inferior  not always said jenny not in italy in the cinque cento nor in england under elizabeth  yes and there were names  names yes but that is all  the ladys name is remembered for the curiosity of her having equalled the ordinary poet or artist of her time but her performances either are lost or only known to curious scholars  they have not the quality which makes things permanent  what do you say to sappho  there is nothing of her but a name and fragments that curious scholars read  worse luck to her if she invented sapphics added herbert  one of womankinds torments for mankind eh said his neighbour  and there are plenty more such asserted mrs duncombe boldly for these were asides  it is only that one cant recollectand the men have suppressed them  i think men praised them said jenny and that we remember the praise not the works  for instance roswitha or olympia morata or vittoria colonna  vittorias sonnets are extant but we only value them as being hers more for what she was than for their intrinsic merit  and added eleonora men did not suppress hannah more or joanna baillie  you know scott thought miss baillies dramas would rank with shakespeares  mrs tallboys was better read in logic and mathematics than in history and did not follow jenny but she turned her adversarys argument to her own advantage by exclaiming are the gentlemen present familiar with these bright lights  i confess my ignorance of some of them said julius  but my youngest brother knows all that said rosamond at a brave venture  macaulays schoolboy murmured lady tyrrell softly  let us return to the main point said mrs tallboys a little annoyed  it is of the present and future that i would speak not of the past  does not the past give the only data on which to form a conclusion said julius  certainly not  the proposition is not what a woman or two in her downtrodden state may have exceptionally effected but her natural equality and in fact superiority in all but the physical strength which has imposed an unjust bondage on the higher nature  i hardly know where to meet you if you reject all arguments from proved facts said julius  and the bible  why dont you say the bible exclaimed his wife in an undertone but mrs tallboys took it up and said the precepts of scripture are founded on a state of society passed away  you may find arguments for slavery there  i doubt that said julius  there are practical directions for an existing state of things which have been distorted into sanction for its continuance  the actual precepts are broad principles which are for all times and apply to the hired servant as well as to the slave  so again with the relations of man and wife i can nowhere find a command so adapted to the seclusion and depression of the eastern woman as to be inapplicable to the christian matron and the typical virtuous woman the valiant woman is one of the noblest figures anywhere depicted  i know said mrs tallboys who had evidently been waiting impatiently again to declaim that men even ministers of religion from paul if you like downwards have been willing enough to exalt woman so long as they claim to sit above her  the higher the oppressed so much higher the selfexaltation of the oppressor paul and peter exalt their virtuous woman but only as their own appendage adorning themselves and while society with religious ministers at the head of it call on woman to submit and degrade the sex we shall continue to hear of such disgraces to england as i see in your police reportsbrutal mechanics beating their wives  i fear while physical force is on the side of the brute said julius no abstract recognition of equality would save her  society would take up her cause and protect her  so it is willing to do now if she asks for protection  yes broke in rosamond but nothing would induce a woman worth sixpence to take the law against her husband  there i think lady rosamond has at once demonstrated the higher nature of the woman said mrs tallboys  what man would be capable of such generosity  no one denies said julius that generous forbearance patience fortitude and selfrenunciation belong almost naturally to the true wife and mother and are her great glory but would she not be stripped of them by selfassertion as the peer in power  turning our flank again with a compliment said mrs duncombe these fine qualities are very convenient to yourselves and so you praise them up  not so returned julius because they are really the higher virtues  patience at once exclaimed the american and english emancipators with some scorn  yes said julius in a low tone of thorough earnest  the patience of strength and love is the culmination of virtue  jenny knew what was in his mind but mrs tallboys with a curious tone half pique half triumph said you acknowledge this which you call the higher nature in womanthat is to say all the passive qualitiesand you are willing to allow her a finer spiritual essence and yet you do not agree to her equal rights  this is the injustice of the prejudice which has depressed her all these centuries  stay broke in jenny evidently not to the ladys satisfaction that does not state the question  nobody denies that woman is often of a higher and finer essence as you say than man and has some noble qualities in a higher degree than any but the most perfect men but that is not the question  it is whether she have more force and capacity than man is in fact actually able to be on an equality  and i say returned mrs tallboys that man has used brute force to cramp womans intellect and energy so long that she has learnt to acquiesce in her position and to abstain from exerting herself so that it is only where she is partially emancipated as in my own country that any idea of her powers can be gained  i am afraid said julius that more may be lost to the world than is gained  no i am not speaking from the tyrant point of view  i am thinking whether free friction with the world way not lessen that sweetness and tender innocence and purity that make a mans home an ideal and a sanctuaryhis best earthly influence  this is only sentiment  innocence is worthless if it cannot stand alone and protect itself said mrs tallboys  i do not mean innocence unable to stand alone  it should be strong and trustworthy but should have the bloom on it still not rubbed off by contact or knowledge of evil  desire of shielding that bloom from the slightest breath of contamination is no small motive for selfrestraint and therefore a great preservative to most men  women purify the atmosphere wherever they go said the lady  many women do returned julius but will they retain that power universally if they succeed in obtaining a position where there will be less consideration for them and they must be exposed to a certain hardening and roughening process  if so exclaimed mrs tallboys if men are so base we would soon assert ourselves  we are no frail morning glories for you to guard and worship with restraint lest forsooth your natural breath should wither us away  as she spoke the door opened and with a strong reek of tobacco in came the two other gentlemen  well rector have you given in asked the captain  is lady rosamond to mount the pulpit henceforth  ah wouldnt i preach you a sermon returned rosamond  to resume said mrs tallboys sitting very upright  you still go on the old assumption that woman was made for you  it is all the same story  one man says she is for his pleasure another for his servant and you forfor his refinement  you would all have us adjectives  now i defy you to prove that woman is not a substantive created for herself  if you said growed mrs tallboys it would be more consistent said jenny  her creation and her purpose in the world stand upon precisely the same authority  i wonder at you miss bowater said mrs tallboys  i cannot understand a woman trying to depreciate her sex  no thrust in gussie moy i want to know why a woman cant go about without a dowager waddling after her thank you breathed lady tyrrell into herberts ear nor go to a club  there was such a club proposed in london said captain duncombe and do you know gussie the name of it  no  the middlesex club  there it is just as mrs tallboys said you will do nothing but laugh at us or else talk sentiment about our refining you  now i want to be free to amuse myself  i dont think those trifling considerations will be great impediments in your way said lady tyrrell in her blandest tone is that actually the carriage  thank you mrs tallboys  this is goodbye i believe  i am sorry there has not been more time for a fuller exposition tonight  there would have been but i never was so interrupted said mrs tallboys in an undertone with a displeased look at jenny at the other end of the room  declamation was evidently more the muses forte than argument but her aside was an aside and that of the jockey friend was not  so you waited for us to give your part of the lecture miss moy  of course  whats the use of talking to a set of women and parsons who are just the same  poor herberts indignant flush infinitely amused the party who were cloaking in the hall  poor gussie her tongue runs fast said mrs duncombe  emancipated said jenny  goodbye mrs duncombe  please let us be educated up to our privileges before we get them  a parthian shot jenny said julius as they gave her a homeward lift in the carriage  you proved yourself the fittest memberess for the future parliament tonight  to be elected by the women and parsons said jenny with little chuckle of fun  poor herbert  i only wish that girl was a man that i might horsewhip her the clerical sentiment growled out from herberts corner of the carriage  degradation of her sex  shes a standing one     chapter xx vivienne   of all the old women that ever i saw sweet bad luck to my mother in lawirish song  the parliamentary session had reached the stage that is ended by no power save that of grouse and the streets were full of vans fantastically decorated with baths chairs bedsteads and nursery gear  cecil could see two before different housedoors as she sat behind her muslin curtains looking as fresh and healthful as ever and scarcely more matronly except that her air of selfassertion had become more easy and less aggressive now that she was undisputed mistress of the house in london  there was no concern on her part that she was not the mother of either of the two latest scions of the house of charnock  certainly she did not like to be outdone by rosamond but then it was only a girl and she could afford to wait for the son and heir indeed she did not yet desire him at the cost of all the distinguished and intellectual society the concerts soirees and lectures that his nonarrival left her free to enjoy  the other son and heir interested her nearly for he was her halfbrother  there had been something almost ludicrous in the apologies to her  his mother seemed to feel like a traitor to her and mr charnock could hardly reconcile his darlings deposition with his pride in the newcomer both she and raymond had honestly rejoiced in their happiness and the continuance of the direct line of dunstone and had completed the rejoicing of the parents by thorough sympathy when the party with this unlookedfor addition had returned home in the spring mrs charnock had insisted on endowing his daughter as largely as he justly could to compensate for this change in her expectations and was in doubt between swanmore an estate on the backsworth side of willansborough and sirenwood itself to purchase and settle on her raymond would greatly have preferred sirenwood both from its adjoining the compton property and as it would be buying out the vivians but there were doubts about the involvements and nothing could be done till eleonoras majority  mr charnock preferred swanmore as an investment and raymond could of course not press his wishes  a short visit had been made at dunstone to join in the festivities in honour of the little heir but cecil had not been at compton since christmas though raymond had several times gone home for a sunday when she had other companionship  charlie had been with them preparing his outfit for india whither he had been gone about a month and frank though living in lodgings was the more frequently at his sisterinlaws service because wherever she was the vivian sisters might be looked for  no sooner had raymond taken the house in  square than lady tyrrell had engaged the opposite one so that one household could enjoy evening views of the others interior and cecil had chiefly gone into society under her friends auspices  her presentation at court had indeed been by the marchioness she had been staying with an old friend of mrs poynsetts quite prepared to be intimate with raymond poynsetts wife if only cecil would have taken to her  but that ladys acceptance of any one recommended in this manner was not to be thought of and besides the family were lively merry people and cecil was one of those who dislike and distrust laughter lest it should be at themselves  so she remained on coldly civil terms with that pleasant party and though to a certain degree following her husbands lead as to her engagements all her ways were moulded by her friends influence  nor was the effect otherwise than becoming  nothing could be in better taste than all in mrs charnock poynsetts establishment and london and lady tyrrell together had greatly improved her manners  all her entertainments went off well and she filled her place in the world with grace and skill just as she had always figured herself doing  yet there was a sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction which increased upon her as the time drew nearer for returning to be again only a guest in her married home  it was a tangible grievance on which her mind could fix itself  surely it was hard on her that her husband should require it of her and yet she perceived that he could not avoid it since his mother was mistress  she knew too that he was unfailingly kind attentive and indulgent except on that one occasion when he had sharply reproved her for her behaviour in the tallboys matter and strange to say a much stronger feeling towards him had been setting in ever since that one time when she had seen him thoroughly angry  she longed and craved to stir that even gentle courtesy to frowns or smiles and yet there was a perversity in her nature that seem to render it impossible to her to attempt to win a smile from him far more so to lay aside any device or desire of her own to gratify him  all she did know was that to be all that her ambition had sought a charnock by marriage as well as birth and with a kind considerate husband was not enough to hinder a heartsickness she had never known or supposed possible  presently through the flowers in her balcony cecil saw the opening and closing of the opposite housedoor and a white parasol unfurled and she had only time to finish and address her letter to mrs duncombe before lady tyrrell was announced  here i am after a hard mornings work winding up accounts c  you go tomorrow  yes trusting that you will soon follow though you might be a cockney born your bloom is townproof  we follow as soon as the division on the education question is over and that will not be for ten days  you are come to look at my stores for the bazaar but first what are you going to do this afternoon  what are your plans  i must leave cards at halfadozen peoples at the other end of the park  will you come with me  where is lenore  she is gone to take leave of the strangeways party lady susan insisted on having her for this last day  poor frank  i confess impartially that it does not look well for him  poor frank repeated cecil he does look very forlorn when he hears where she is  when after all if the silly boy could only see it it is the most fortunate thing that could happen to him and the only chance of keeping his head above water  i have made lady susan promise me two of her daughters for the bazaar  they thoroughly know how to make themselves useful  oh how pretty  for cecil was producing from the shelves of various pieces of furniture a large stock of fancy articlesswiss carvings spa toys genevese ornaments and japanese curiosities which as lady tyrrell said rivalled her own accumulation and would serve to carry off the housewives and penwipers on which all the old maids of wilsbro were employed  we must put out our programmes cecil added people will not work in earnest till the day is fixed and they know the sellers  yes the lady patronesses are most important said lady tyrrell writing them down  mrs raymond charnock poynsett lady rosamond eh  oh no julius wont hear of it  and opposition is sweet  so we lose her romantic name and the stall of the three brides  mrs miles charnock is too much out of the world to be worth asking  then myselfmrs duncombe mrs fuller as a matter of necessity mrs moy  oh  needful my dear to propitiate that set  also that mayoress mrs truelove isnt she  six  well fill up with country people  six more distinguished names were soon supplied of ladies who would give their patronage provided neither toil nor care was required of them and still consulting the two friends took their seats in the carriage  the time of the bazaar was to be fixed by the opening of the townhall which was to take place on the 12th of septembera thursday the week before the races and the most propitious days appeared to be the tuesday and wednesday before the great backsworth cup day since the world would then be in an excited pleasure seeking state favourable to their designs  i shall have a party in the house said lady tyrrell  shall you be able  i cant tell you know it does not depend on me and i certainly shall not ask it as a favour  camilla did i tell you that i tried to make my father understand the state of things and speak to raymond  but he would only say that while i am so young and inexperienced it is a great advantage for me to live with mrs poynsett and that i must be the greatest comfort to her  papa is an intense believer in mrs poynsett and when he once has taken up a notion nothing will convince him  you cant even make capital of this purchase of a house of your own  i dont like to do that  my dear i see your delicacy and forbearance and i would not urge you if i did not see how deeply your happiness is concerned  of course i dont mean merely the authority over the wirthschaft though somehow the cares of it are an ingredient in female contentment but forgive me cecil i am certain that you will never take your right placewhere you care for it moretill you have a home of your own  ah  the responsive sound burst from the very depths of cecils heart penetrated as they had never been before but pride and reserve at once sprang up and she answered coldly i have no reason to complain  right my dear cecil i like you the better and she pressed her hand  it is quite true said cecil withdrawing hers  quite absolutely true  he would die rather than give you any reason for the slightest murmur but cecil dearest that very heedfulness shows there is something he cannot give you  i dont know why you should say so answered a proud but choked voice  i say so replied the clear tones firmly though with a touch of pity because i see it  cecil poor child they married you very young  i missed nothing exclaimed cecil but she felt that she could only say so in the past and her eyes burnt with unshed tears  no my dear you were still a girl and your deeper womans heart had not grown to perceive that it was not met  he chose me she faintly said  his mother needed a daughter  it was proper for him to marry and you were the most eligible party  i will answer for it that he warned you how little he could give  he did cried cecil  he did tell me that he could not begin in freshness and warmth like a young man but i thought it only meant that we were too sensible to care about nonsense and liked him for it  he always must have been staid and reservedhe could never have been different camilla  dont smile in that way  tell me what you mean  my dear cecil i knew raymond poynsett a good many years before you did  andwell  then he had a first love said cecil in a voice schooled into quiet  was he different then  was he as desperate as poor frank is now  frank is a very mild copy of him at that age  he overbore every one wrung consent from all and did everything but overcome his mothers calm hostility and selfassertion  did that stop it  she died of course said cecil  she could not have left off loving him  she did not die but her family were wearied out by the continual objections to their overtures and the supercilious way of treating them  they thought it a struggle of influence and that he was too entirely dominated for a daughterinlaw to be happy with her  so they broke it off  and she cecil looked up with searching eyes  she had acutely felt the offence the weakness the dutifulness whatever you may choose to call it and in the rebound she married  who is she gasped cecil  it is not fair to tell you was the gentle answer with a shade of rebuke  you need not look for her  she is not in the county  i hope i shall never see her  you need not dread doing so if you can only have fair play and establish the power that belongs rightly to you  she would have no chance with you even if he had forgiven her  has not he  never  and he used up all his heart said cecil in a low musing tone  all but what his mother absorbed  she was a comparatively young and brilliant woman and she knew her power  it is a great ascendancy and only a mans honest blindness could suppose that any woman would be content under it  cecils tongue refused to utter what oppressed her heartthose evenings beside the sofa those eager home expeditions for sunday the uniform maintenance of his mothers supremacy  and you think absence from her would lessen her influence  i am sure of it  there might be a struggle but if i know mr charnock poynsett rightly he is too upright not to be conscious of what is due to you and be grieved not to be able to give you more that is when his mother is not holding him in her grasp  nor can there be any valid objection since mrs miles charnock is always at her service  she will return to africa  i dont know why she and rosamond have been always so much more acceptable  they are not her rivals besides they have not your strength  she is a woman who tries to break whatever she cannot bend and the instant her son began to slip from her grasp the contest necessarily began  you had much better have it over once and for ever and have him on your side  insist on a house of your own and when you have made your husband happy in it then thenah  good morningsir george  she had meant to say then you win his heart but the words would not come and a loathing hatred of the coldhearted child who had a property in raymond so mastered her that she welcomed the interruption and did not return to the subject  she knew when she had said enough and feared to betray herself nor could cecil bear to resume the talk stunned and sore as she was at the revelation though with no suspicion that the speaker had been the object of her husbands affection  she thought it must have been the other sister now in india and that this gave the key to many allusions she had heard and which she marvelled at herself for not having understood  the equivocation had entirely deceived her and she little thought she had been taking counsel with the rival who was secretly triumphing in raymonds involuntary constancy and sowing seeds of vengeance against an ancient enemy  she could not settle to anything when she came home  life had taken a new aspect  hitherto she had viewed herself as born to all attention and deference and had taken it as a right and now she found herself the victim of a mariage de convenance to a man of exhausted affections who meant her only to be the attendant of his domineering mother  the love that was dawning in her heart did but add poignancy to the bitterness of the revelation and fervour to her resolve to win the mastery over the heart which was her lawful possession  she was restless till his return  she was going to an evening party and though usually passive as to dress she was so changeable and difficult to satisfy that grindstone grew cross and showed it by stern rigid obedience  and cecil well knew that grindstone who was in authority in the present house hated the return to be merely the visitor of alston and jenkins  in the drawingroom cecil fluttered from book to window window to piano again throwing down her occupation at every sound and taking up another and when at last raymond came in his presence at first made her musings seem mere fancies  indeed it would have been hard to define what was wanting in his manner  he lamented his unavoidable delay and entertained her with all the political and parliamentary gossip he had brought home and which she always much enjoyed as a tribute to her wisdom so much that it had been an entire though insensible cure for the rights of woman  moreover he was going with her to this drum though he would greatly have preferred the debate and was to be summoned in case of a division  she knew enough of the world to be aware that such an attentive and courteous husband was not the rule  but what was courtesy to one who longed for unity  is frank to be there this evening he asked  yes i believe so  i thought he was to have gone with us  he told me not to depend on him  he had made an engagement to ride into the country with sir harry vivian  and she added though the proud spirit so hated what seemed to her like making an advance that it sounded like a complaint so you cant avoid going with me  i should any way have gone with you but i may have to leave you to frank to see you away he said  and i had rather have frank here than with that set  breaking up one of our few teteatete evenings and they are becoming few enough  this murmur gratified him and he said we shall be more alone together now  the rectory is almost ready and julius means to move in another week and i suppose miles will carry anne off before the year is over  yes we are the only ones with no home  rather we hold fast to the old home  not my old home  does not mine become yours  not while  she paused and started afresh  raymond could we not live at swanslea if it is bought for us  swanslea  five miles off  impossible  cecil was silent  my dear cecil he said after a few moments consideration i can understand that you felt unfortunately crowded last year but all that is over and you must see that we are necessary to my mother and that all my duties require me to live at home  you could attend to the property from swanslea  the property indeed  i meant my mother  she has anne  anne will soon be in africaeven if she were more of a companion i am sorry it is a trial to you for my proper place is clearly with my mother the more in her helpless state and with my brothers gone out into the world  now that the numbers are smaller you will find it much easier to take the part that i most earnestly wish should be yours  i cannot get on with her  do not say so  do not think so  to have rosamond there with her irish ease and her reserve kept you in the background before i say it but i could not help it and now there will be no hindrance to your drawing together  there is nothing i so desire  if the carriage had not stopped as he spoke cecil would not have uttered the thought that smote her namely that his desire was on behalf not of his wife but of his mother to whom he was ready to sacrifice her happiness without a pang  she did not see that he could imagine no greater happiness for her than a thorough love of his mother  they certainly were not the happiest couple present as they walked upstairs looking like a model husband and wife with their name echoing from landing to landing  if any expression savouring of slang could possibly be applied to raymond he might be said to be struck all of a heap by his wifes proposition  he had never even thought of the possibility of making a home anywhere but at compton poynsett or of his wife wishing that he should do so and proverbial sayings about the incompatability of relativesinlaw suddenly assumed a reasonableness that he could not bear to remember  but his courtesy and sense of protection trained by a woman of the old school would not suffer him to relax his attention to his wife though he was very anxious to get back to the house he would not quit her neighbourhood till he had found frank and intrusted her to him  he was not happy about frank  the youth was naturally of an intellectual and poetical temperament and had only cared for horses and fieldsports as any healthy lad growing up in a country house must enjoy them and raymond had seen him introduced to the style of men whom he thought would be thoroughly congenial to him and not unlikely to lead him on to make a mark in the world  but that unfortunate vivian attachment stood in the way sir harry and his elder daughter ignored it entirely but did not forbid frank the house though lady tyrrell took care as only she could do that eleonora should never have ten minutes private conversation with him either at home or abroad  even in a crowd a ball or garden party the vigilant sister had her means of breaking into any kind of confidence and frank was continually tantalized by the pursuit it could not but unsettle him and draw him into much more gaiety than was compatible with the higher pursuits his mother had expected of him and what was worse it threw him into sir harry vivians set veteran roues and younger men who looked up to their knowingness and listened to their good stories  what amount of harm it was doing raymond could not guess  he had known it all himself and had escaped unscathed but he did not fear the less for his younger brother and he only hoped that the inducement to mingle with such society would be at an end before frank had formed a taste for the habits that there prevailed  eleonora vivian had been much admired at first but her cold manner kept every one at a distance and her reserve was hardly ever seen to relax  however her one friendship with the strangeways family gave raymond hopes that her constancy was not proof against the flattering affection backed by wealth that seemed to await her there  the best he could wish for frank was that the infatuation might be over as soon as possible though he pitied the poor fellow sincerely when he saw him as he did tonight waiting with scarcely concealed anxiety while miss vivian stood listening to a long discourse about yachting from an eager pair of chattering girls  then some break occurred and frank moved up to her  your last evening  how little i have seen of you  little indeed  i called but you were at the strangeways  they are very kind to me  when is your holiday  not till spring but i may get a few days in the autumn  you will be at home  as far as i know  if i thought for a moment you cared to see me but you have shown few signs of wishing it of late  frankif i could make you understand  they were walking towards a recess when lady tyrrell fastened upon raymond  pray find my sister she forgets that we have to be at lady granbysoh are you there lenore  will you see her down mr poynsett  well frank did you get as far as you intended  and she went down on his arm her last words being take care of yourself till we meet at home  for this one year i call sirenwood homethen  raymond and lenore said no more to one another  the ladies were put into the carriage  the elder brother bade frank take care of cecil and started for westminster with the poor lads blank and disappointed face still before his eyes hoping at least it was well for him but little in love with life or what it had to offer      chapter xxi awfully jolly   when life becomes a spasm    and history a whiz if that is not sensation    i dont know what it islewis carroll  is lady rosamond at home  no maam  nor mrs charnock  no maam they are both gone down to the rectory  would you ask whether mrs poynsett would like to see me  ill inquire maam if you will walk in said mr jenkins moved by the wearied and heated looks of miss vivian who had evidently come on foot at the unseasonable visiting hour of 1115 am  the drawingroom was empty but with windows open on the shady side was most inviting to one who had just become unpleasantly aware that her walking capacity had diminished under the stress of a london season and that a very hampering one  she was glad of the rest but it lasted long enough to be lost in the uncomfortable consciousness that hers was too truly a morning call and she would have risen and escaped had not that been worse  at last the door of communication opened and to her amazement mrs poynsett was pushed into the room by her maid in a wheeled chair yes my dear she said in reply to eleonoras exclamation of surprise and congratulation this is my dear daughters achievement rosamond planned and anne contrived and they both coaxed my lazy bones  i am so very glad  i had no notion i should see you out of your room  such is ones selfimportance  i thought the fame would have reached you at least  ah you dont know how little i see of any one i can hear from and now i am afraid i have disturbed you too early  oh no my dear it was very good and kind and i am only grieved that you had so long to wait but we will make the most of each other now  you will stay to luncheon  thank you indeed i am afraid i must not  papa would not like it for no one knows where i am  you have taken this long walk in the heat and are going back  i dont like it my dear you look fagged  london has not agreed with you  mrs poynsett rang her little handbell and ordered in biscuits and wine and would have ordered the carriage but for lenores urgent entreaties to the contrary amounting to an admission that she wished her visit to be unnoticed at home  this was hardly settled before there was a knock at the door announcing babys daily visit and miss julia was exhibited by her grandmamma with great satisfaction until another interruption came in a call from the doctor who only looked in occasionally and had fallen on this unfortunate morning  most unlucky said mrs poynsett  i am afraid you will doubt about coming again and i have not had one word about our frankie  he is very well  i saw him at a party the night before we left town  goodbye dear mrs poynsett  you will come again  if i can but the house is to be full of visitors  if i dont you will know it is because i cant  i shall be thankful for whatever you can give me  i wish i could save you that hot walk in the sun  but as mrs poynsett was wheeled into her own room some compensation befell eleonora for she met julius in the hall and he offered to drive her to the gates of sirenwood in what he called our new plaything the pony carriage on his way to a clerical meeting  you are still here she said  till tuesday when we go to the rectory to receive the two de lancey boys for the holidays  how mrs poynsett will miss you  anne is a very efficient companion said julius speaking to her like one of the family the pity is that she will be so entirely lost to us when miles claims her  then they still mean to settle in africa  her heart has always been there and her father is in treaty for a farm for him so i fear there is little hope of keeping them  i cant think what the parish will do without her  by the bye how does joe reynolds get on with his drawings  i must show them to you  he is really very clever  we sent him to the school of art twice a week and he has got on wonderfully  i begin to believe in my academician  so you dont repent  i think not  as far as i can judge he is a good boy still  i make him my escort to church so that i am sure of him there  renville would have taken him for a boy about his studio and i think he will go there eventually but camilla thinks he may be an attraction at the bazaar and is making him draw for it  i was in hopes that the bazaar would have blown over but the bishop has been demanding of fuller and his churchwardens how soon they mean to put the building in hand and this seems to be their only notion of raising money  i am very glad of this opportunity of asking what you think i had better do about it  your wife takes no part in it  certainly not but i doubt whether that need be a precedent for you  i am answerable for her and you could hardly keep out of it without making a divided household  i see the difference and perhaps i have made myself quite unpleasant enough already  as the opposition  and camilla has been very kind in giving me much more freedom than i expected and pacifying papa  she let me go every friday evening to help lady susan strangeways at her mothers meeting  lady susan strangeways  i have heard of her  she has been my comforter and help all this time  she is all kindness and heartinesselbowdeep in everything good  she got up at five oclock to finish the decorations at st maurices and to day she is taking five hundred schoolchildren to windsor forest  is she the mother of the young man at backsworth  yes said eleonora in rather a different tone  perhaps she goes rather far and he has flown into the opposite extreme though they say he is improving and has given up the turf and all that sort of thing  was he at home  i heard he was on leave  he was said to be at home but i hardly ever saw him  he was always out with his own friends when i was there  i should not suppose lady susans pursuits were much in his line is not one of the daughters a sister  yes at st faiths  she was my great friend  the younger ones are nice girls but have not much in them  camilla is going to have them down for the bazaar  what do they patronize bazaars  everything that is doing they patronize  i have known them be everywhere from the drawingroom to a guildmeeting in a back slum and all with equal appetite  that is one reason why i fear i shall not see much of your mother they are never tired and i shall never get out alone  the house is to be full of people and we are to be very gay  she spoke with a tone that betrayed how little pleasure she expected though it strove to be uncomplaining and julius who had learnt something of poor franks state of jealous misery heartily wished the strangeways family further regarding the intimacy as a manoeuvre of lady tyrrells and doubting how far all eleonoras evident struggles would keep her out of the net and though while talking to her he had not the slightest doubt of her sincerity he had not long set her down at the lodge before he remembered that she was a vivian  meantime rosamond carrying some medicament to old betty reynolds found the whole clan in excitement at the appearance of joe in all his buttons looking quite as honest and innocent though a good deal more civilized than when he was first discovered among the swine  only to think said his greatgrandmother that up in london all they could gie to he was a bad penny  it is the bronze medal my lady said joshua with a blush the second prize for crayons in our section  indeed cried rosamond  you are a genius joe worthy of your namesake  there are many that would be proud to have the grandson you have betty  tubby sure added an auntinlaw tis cheap come by  such things to make a young lad draught  they ought to be ashamed of themselves they did oughter  shut it up josh dont be showing it to the ladytis nothing but the bare back of a sweep  my lady and miss vivian have seen it said joshua blushing tis torso my lady from a cast from the museum  a blacklooking draught repeated the grandmother  i tells joe if he drawed like king geaarges head up at wilsbro on the sign with cheeks like apples and a gould crown atop hed arn his bread  all in good time betty  he cant colour till he can draw  im glad to see him looking so well  yes my lady he do have his health torrablish though he lives in a underground sort of a place and they fine servants puts upon he shameful  granny muttered joshua in expostulation  hes a brave boy and does not mind roughing it so he can get on said rosamond  and the ladies are very good to me said the boy  show lady rosamond the draught you did of miss vivian like a hangel suggested the aunt  the rising artist coloured saying please my lady dont name it to no one  i would not have shown it but little bess she pulled down all my things on the floor when i was not looking  it is from memory my lady as she looks when shes doing anything for sir harry  it was a very lovely sketchimperfect but full of genius and wonderfully catching the tender wistful look which was often on eleonoras face as she waited on her father  rosamond longed that frank should see it but the page was very shy about it and his grandmother contrasted it with the performances of the painter who had draughted all the farmers wives in gould frames for five pound a head but satin gownds and gold chains was extry  but joe had brought her a pound of tea and an image for her mantelpiece which quite satisfied her though the image being a parian angel of thorwaldsens better suited his taste than its surroundings  the whole scene served rosamond for a narrative in her most lively style for mrs poynsetts amusement that evening  there was the further excitement of a letter from miles and the assurance that he would be at home in november  anne had become far less chary of communications from his letters than she had at first been but of this one she kept back so large a portion in public that the instant mrs poynsett had bidden them good night and been wheeled away rosamond put a hand on each shoulder and looking into her face said now anne let us hear  miles has found archie douglas  it is no use pretending  fie mrs anne why cant you tell me  i was not to tell any one but julius  well im julius  besides wasnt i at the very bottom of the tracing him out  havent i the best right to know whether it is bad or good  not bad i am sure said julius quickly and anxiously  oh no not bad answered anne  he has seen himhad him on board for a night  where  off durban  but this whole sheet about it is marked privateonly for julius so i could say nothing about it before your mother  i have hardly glanced at it myself as yet but i think he says mr douglas made him promise not to tell her or joanna bowater  not tell jenny cried rosamond  and you said it was not bad  he must have gone and married  i do not think that is it said anne but you shall hear  miles saysi have at last seen our poor cousin archie  i told you i was following up your brother sandies hint about the agents for the hunters and at last i fell in with a merchant who on my inquiry showed me an invoice that i could have sworn to as in archies hand and described his white hair  it seems he has been acting as manager on an ostrich farm for the last three years far up the country  so i lost no time in sending up a note to him telling him if he had not forgotten old times to come down and see me while i was lying off durban bay  i heard no more for ten days and had got in the stores and was to sail the next day thinking he had given us all up when a boat hailed us just come over the bar  i saw archies white head and in ten minutes i had him on deck  for heavens sakeam i cleared miles was the first thing he said and when i could not say that he was it went to my heart to see how the eager look sank away and he was like a worndown man of fifty poor fellow i found he had ridden two hundred miles with the hope that i had brought him news that his innocence was proved and the revulsion was almost more than he could bear  you see he had no notion that we thought him dead and so he took the entire absence of any effort to trace him as acquiescence in his guilt and when he found out how it was he laid me under the strongest injunctions to disclose to no one that he is livingnot that he fears any results but that he says it would only disturb every one and make them wretched  he must have gone and married  the wretch broke in rosamond  no oh no cried anne  only hear the rest  i told him that i could not see that at all and that there was a very warm and tender remembrance of him among us all and he nearly broke down and said for heavens sake then miles let them rest in that  theres more peace for them so  i suppose i lookedi am sure i did not speak as though i were a little staggered as to whether he were ashamed to be known for he drew himself up in the old way i should have known anywhere and told me there was no reason i should fear to shake hands with him however his name might be blasted at home he had done nothing to make himself unworthy of his mother and jennyand there was a sob again  so i let him know that up to my last letters from home jenny was unmarried  i even remembered those descriptive words of yours nannie living in patient peacefulness and cheerfulness on his memory  i was called on deck just then so i gave him my home photograph book and left him with it  i found him crying like a child over it when i came back i was obliged to strip it of all my best for him for i could not move him  we went through the whole of the old story to see if there were any hope and when he found that tom vivian was dead and george proudfoot too without a word about him he seemed to think it hopeless  he believes that proudfoot at least if not moy was deeply in debt to vivian though not to that extent and that vivian probably incited them to borrow from my mothers letter  he was very likely to undertake to get the draft cashed for them and not to account for the difference  it may have helped to hasten his catastrophe  moy i never should have suspected archie says he should once have done so as little but he was a plausible fellow and would do things on the sly while all along appearing to old proudfoot as a mentor to george  archie seemed to feel his prosperity the bitterest pill of allreigning like one of the squirearchy at proudfoot lawna magistrate forsooth with his daughter figuring as an heiress  one thing worth notearchie says that when it was too late he remembered that the underclerk gadley might not have gone home and might have heard him explain that the letter had turned up  gadley  why thats the landlord of the three pigeons exclaimed rosamond  it is mr moys house and he supports him through thick and thin  yes said julius the magistrates have been on the point of taking away his license but moy always stands up for him  there is something suspicious in that  i heard miss moy with my own ears tell mrs duncombe that he was the apple of her fathers eye cried rosamond  hes bribed hes bribed  oh i see it all  well go on anne if archie isnt at home before he is a year older  anne went on  he allowed that he would have done more wisely in facing it out and standing his trial but he said poor fellow that he felt as if the earth had given way under him  there was not a soul near who believed him they brought his fathers history against him and moreover he had been at the races and had been betting though in fact he had won and not lost and the 201 he had become possessed of was his capital besides the little he could draw out of the bank  if he could only have seen jenny in london she would have turned him back  indeed that first stage was to consult her but he fancied he saw the face of the wilsbro superintendent in a cab and the instinct of avoiding arrest carried him to southampton where he got a steerage berth in a sailing vessel and came out to the cape  he has lived hard enough but his scots blood has stood him in good stead and he has made something as an ivoryhunter and now has a partnership in an ostrich farm in the amatongula country still he held to it that it was better he should continue dead to all here since mr bowater would never forgive him and the knowledge of his existence would only hinder jennys happiness  you should have seen the struggle with which he said that  he left me no choice indeed forbade a word to any one until i suggested that i had a wife and that my said wife and julius had put me on the scent  he was immensely struck to find that my sweet nan came from glen fraser  he said the evenings he spent there had done more to renew his homesickness and made him half mad after the sight or sound of us than anything else had done and i got him to promise to come and see us when we are settled in the bush  what should you say to joining him in ostrichhatching or would it be ministering too much to the vanities of the world  however ill do something to get him cleared if it comes to an appeal to old moy himself when i come home  meantime remember you are not at liberty to speak a word of this to any one but julius and i suppose his wife  i hope  there rose i beg your pardon  what does he hope asked rosamond  he only hopes she is a cautious woman  as cautious as his nan eh  ah anne youre a canny scot and maybe think holding your tongue as fine a thing as this archie does but i cant bear it  i think it is shocking just wearing out the heart of the best and sweetest girl in the world  at any rate said julius we must be silent  we have no right to speak however we may feel  you dont expect it will stay a secret or that hell go and pluck ostriches like geese with miles and anne and nobody know it twould be taking example by their ostriches indeed  i think so said julius laughing but as it stands now silence is our duty by both miles and archie and anne herself  we must not make her repent having told us  its lucky im not likely to fall in with jenny just yet said rosamond  dont leave me alone with her either of you if you do it is at your peril  it is all very well to talk of honour and secrets but to see the look in her eyes and know he is alive seems to me rank cruelty and heartlessness  it is all to let miles have the pleasure of telling when he comes home  miles is not a woman nor an irishwoman said julius  but hes a sailor and hes got a feeling heart said rosamond and if he stands one look of jenny why ill disown him for the brotherinlaw i take him for  by the bye is not raymond to know  no said anne here is a postscript forbidding my telling him or mrs poynsett  indeed  and i suppose herbert knows nothing  nothing  he was a boy at school at the time  say nothing to him rose  oh no besides his brain is all run to cricket  it was but too true  when the sun shone bright in april and the wickets were set up herbert had demonstrated that his influence was a necessity on the village green and it was true that his goodly and animated presence was as useful morally to the eleven as it was conducive to their triumphs so his rector suppressed a few sighs at the frequency of the practices and the endless matches  compton had played wilsbro and strawyers duddingstone and woodbury the choir had played the school the single the married and when hay and harvest absorbed the rustic eleven challenges began among their betters  the officers played the countyoxonians cantabs etonians harroviansand wherever a match was proclaimed that prime bowler the reverend herbert bowater was claimed as the indispensable champion of his cause and country  if his sister had any power to moderate his zeal she had had little chance of exercising it for mrs bowater had had a rheumatic fever in march and continued so much of an invalid all the summer that jenny seldom went far from home only saw her brother on his weekly visits to the sickroom and was as rosamond said unlikely to become a temptation to the warm heart and eager tongue        the weekday congregation were surprised one august morning at eight oclock by the entrance of three ladies in the most recent style of fashionable simplicity and making the most demonstrative tokens of reverence  as the rector came out he was seized upon at once by the elder lady  mr charnock  i must introduce myself i knew your dear mother so well when we were both girls  i am so delighted to find such a churchquite an oasis and i want to ascertain the best hour for calling on her  quite an invalidi was so shocked to hear it will the afternoon suit her  i am only here for three days to deposit these two girls while i take the other on a round of visits  three daughters are too great an affliction for ones friends and bee and conny are so delighted to be near their brother and with dear lena vivian that i am very glad above all since i find there are real church privilegesso different from the vicar of wilsbro  poor man he is a great trial  all this was said between the church and the lychgate and almost took juliuss breath away but mrs poynsett was prepared to welcome her old friend with some warmth and more curiosity  lady susan strangeways was a highbred woman but even high breeding could not prevent her from being overwhelming especially as there was a great deal more of her than there had been at the last meeting of the friends so that she was suggestive of hawthornes inquiry whether a man is bound to so many more pounds of flesh than he originally wedded  however it was prime condition and activity was not impeded but rather received impetus  she had already since her matutinal walk of more than a mile and back overhauled the stores for the bazaar inspected the townhall given her advice walked through the ruins for the church expressed herself strongly on the horrors of the plan and begun to organize shilling cards all before sir harry had emerged from his room  she was most warmhearted and goodnatured and tears glistened in her honest gray eyes as she saw her old friends helpless state you dont know how much i have improved said mrs poynsett i feel quite at liberty in this chair all owing to my good daughters inlaw  ah  i have so pitied you for having no girls  my dear daughters have been so entirely one with mesuch a blessing in all i have gone through  mrs poynsett of course declared her complete comfort in her five sons but lady susan was sure that if she had had as many boys instead of one son and four daughters she should have been worn out  lorimer was a dear affectionate fellow  those he loved could guide him with a leash of gossamer but young men in his position were exposed to so many temptations  there ensued a little sighing over the evils of wealth and to see and hear the two ladies no one would have thought that julia poynsett had married a young man for lovesusan lorimer an old man for independence  possibly with her present principles she would not have done so but through the vista of a long and prosperous widowhood deficiencies in the courtship were easily forgotten and perhaps there was the more romance and sentiment now because she had been balked of it in her youth  she had freely allowed her eldest daughter to enter a sisterhood from the purest most unselfish motives but there was compensation in talking of her margaret as a sister of mercy  and ere long she was anxiously inquiring mrs poynsetts opinion of eleonora vivian and making confidences somewhat trying to the mother of the young ladys ardent lover  she was quite aware that as to fortune there could hardly be a worse match than miss vivian but she was sensible enough to see that her son had a sufficiency and generous enough to like the idea of redeeming the old estate  her husband had spent his latter years in a vain search for a faultless property and his wealth was waiting for lorimers settling down  she had always regretted the having no vassals rightfully her own and had felt the disadvantages of being lady bountiful only by tenant right  to save an old estate from entirely passing out of a family and relieve a noble old wreck like sir harry seemed to her so grand a prospect that she could not but cast a little glamour over the manner of the shipwreck  still to do her justice her primary consideration was the blessing such a woman as lenore might be to her son  she had not fathomed lady tyrrell  no woman could do so without knowing her antecedents but she understood enough to perceive that eleonora was not happy with her and this she attributed to the girls deep nature and religious aspirations  rockpier was an ecclesiastical paradise to lady susan and a close bond with lenore to whom in london she had given all the facilities that lay in her power for persevering in the observances that were alien to the gay household at home  she valued this constancy exceedingly and enthusiastically dilated on the young ladys goodness and indifference to the sensation she had created  lorimer allows he never saw her equal for grace and dignity  allows  fancy frank allowing any perfection in his lenore  was it not possible that a little passing encomium on unusual beauty was being promoted and magnified by the mother into a serious attachment  but lady tyrrell was playing into her hands and lenores ecclesiastical proclivities were throwing her into the arms of the family  it hardly seemed fair to feign sympathy yet any adverse hint would be treason and mrs poynsett only asked innocently whether her friend had seen her son frank  oh yes often the handsomest of all your sons is he not  perhaps he is now  my girls rave about his beautiful brown eyes just as you used to do julia fiveandthirty years ago  mrs poynsett was sure that whatever she had thought of miles charnocks eyes fiveandthirty years ago she had never raved about them to susan lorimer but she only said all my boys are like their father except charlie  but master frank has no eyes for any one but miss vivian  oh yes i see the little jealousies i am sorry for him but you see it would be a shocking bad thing for a younger son like him whereas lory could afford it and it would be the making of him  mrs poynsett held her peace and was not sorry that her visitor was called away while she was still deliberating whether to give a hint of the state of the case  lady susan was however more aware of it than she knew lady tyrrell had candidly given her a hint that there had been some nonsense about frank charnock but that he could never afford such a marriage even if his mother would allow it all which she never would  besides he had not fallen into a satisfactory set in londonwhy it was not needful to tell  when after the drive lady tyrrell fairly tired out by her visitors unfailing conversation and superabundant energy had gone to lie down and recruit for the evening lady susan pressed on eleonora a warm invitation to the house in yorkshire which she was renting and where lorimer would get as much shooting as his colonel would permit  the mention of him made lenore blush to the ears and say dear lady susan you are always so kind to me that i ought to be open with you  dont fancy  i understand i understand my dear broke in lady susan  you shall not be teased  do not the girls and i care for you for your own sake  i hope so  the elder lady sprang up and embraced her  affection was very pleasant to the reserved nature that could do so little to evoke caresses  yet eleonora clasped her rockpier charm in her hand and added i must tell you that so far as i can without disobedience i hold myself engaged to frank charnock  to frank charnock repeated lady susan startled at this positive statement  my dear are you quite sure of his wayssince he has been in town i mean  i know him and i trust him  im sure he is a finelooking young man and very clever they say dear julia poynsetts son too and they have all turned out so well said honest lady susan but though you have been used to it all your life my dear a taste for horses is very dangerous in a young man who cant afford to lose now and then you know  i have seriously made up my mind never to marry a man who has anything to do with the turf said eleonora  ah my poor dear i can understand that said lady susan aware how ill this told for her lory  may i ask does he know it  it would insult him to say it  none of the charnocks ever meddle with those things  ah i know your son saw him on the derbyday but he went down with his eldest brother and his wifeand that is a very different thing  i stayed at home you rememberpapa had a fit of the gout  my dear i dont want to accuse him  dont bristle up only i am sorry both for my own little plan of having you for my very own and because i fear there is trouble in store for you  it cant be palatable  here eleonora shook her head and her worn wearied look went to the goodnatured heart  dear child you have gone through a great deal  you shant be worried or fretted about anybody or anything at revelrig  i should be very glad said lenore who had no fears of lory personally though she could not be invited on false pretences  you had better come when bee and conny meet me  let me seewill the retreat be over by that time  are you going to it  you are an associate of st faith  yes but i dont see how i could go to the retreat  oh what a relief it would be to have such a week  exactly what i feel said lady susan somewhat to her surprise it strengthens and sets me right for the year  dr easterby conducts this one  do you not know him  is not rood house near backsworth  yes on the other side but he is utterly out of my reach  julius charnock looks up to him so much but his nameeven more than st faithswould horrify my father  you could not go direct there said lady susan but when once you are with me you are my charge and i could take you  she considered a little  both she and her friend knew that all her religious habits were alien to sir harry and that what he had freely permitted sometimes shared at rockpier was now only winked at and that if he had guessed the full extent of her observances he would have stormily issued a prohibition  could it be wrong to spend part of her visit to lady susan with her hostess in a sisterhood when she had no doubt as to attending services which he absolutely never dreamt of and therefore did not forbid  the sacred atmosphere and holy meditations without external strife and constant watchfulness seemed to the poor girl like water to the thirsty and she thought after all the harass and whirl of the bazaar and race week she might thus recruit her muchneeded strength for the decisive conflicts her majority would bring  lady susan had no doubts  the grand old wreck was in his present aspect a hoary old persecutor and charming lady tyrrell a worldly scheming elder sister  it was as much an act of charity to give their victim an opportunity of devotion and support as if she had been the child of abandoned parents in a back court in east london reserve to prevent a prohibition was not in such cases treachery or disobedience and she felt herself doing a mothers part as she told her daughters with some enjoyment of the mystery  eleonora made no promise hoping to clear her mind by consideration or to get juliuss opinion  he and his wife dined at sirenwood and found joe reynoldss drawings laid out for inspection while lady susan was advising that instead of selling them there should be an industrial exhibition of all curiosities of art and nature to be collected in the neighbourhood and promising her own set of foreign photographs and coloured costumes which had served such purposes many and many a time  after dinner the good dame tried to talk to rosamond on what she deemed the most congenial subjects but my lady rose had no notion of shop at a dinnerparty so she made languid answer that she left all that to the curates and escaped to a frivolous young matron on the other side of the room looking on while her husband was penned in and examined on his services and his choir and his system and his decorations and his classes and his schools for all or any of which lady susan pressed on him the aid of the two daughters she was leaving at sirenwood and on his hint that this was beyond his parish she repeated her strong disapproval of the vicar of wilsbro whom she had met at dinner the night before and besides the school there had numerous sunday teachers  julius assented for he had no redundance of the article and his senior curate had just started on a vacation ramble with a brother but a sort of misgiving crossed him as he heard herbert bowaters last comic song pealing out and beheld the pleasingly plain face of a miss strangeways on either side of him  had he not fought the eton and harrow match over again with one of them at dinner and had not a lawn tennis challenge already passed  for lady tyrrell and mrs charnock poynsett were to have garden parties on alternate wednesdays and the whole neighbourhood soon followed suit  youll find nobody at home jenny said julius coming out of a cottage opposite as she rode up to mrs hornblowers on one of the last days of august  nobodythat is but my mother  can you come up and see her  with all my heart but i must get down here im sent for one of herberts shirts  the good boy lets mamma and aunty manage them still  i believe their hearts would break outright if he took to shop ones like the rest of them  hush tartar for shame dont you know me  wheres your master  at a gardenparty at duddingstone  your mother is better i see  yes thank youout driving with papa  good rollo as the dignified animal rose from the hearthrug to greet her waving his handsome tail and calmly expelled a large tabby cat from the easy chair to make room for his friends  well done old roll  fancy a cat in such company  herberts dogs partake his goodnature  mungo seems to be absent too  gone with him no doubt  he is the great favourite with one of the miss strangeways  whichherbert or mungo  both  i might say i know the young ladies best by one being rapturous about tartar and the other about mungo  rollo treats both with equally sublime and indifferent politeness rather as raymond does  what sort of girls are they  herbert calls them awfully jolly  im sorry to say i never can think of any other epithet for them for once it is really descriptive  is it either of them in particular  confess joan thats what brought you over  perhaps so  edith heard some nonsense at backsworth and mamma could not rest till she had sent me over to see about it but would there be any great harm in it if it were true  is not lady susan a superexcellent woman  youve hit it again jenny  couple the two descriptions  i gather that you dont think the danger great  not at present  the fascination is dual and is at least a counteraction to the great enchantress  that is well  it was not wholesome  whereas these two are hearty honest wellprincipled girls quite genuine  yet you dont say it with all your heart  i own i should like to find something they had left undone  what to reduce them to human natures daily food  daily indeed  theres just no escaping them  there they are at matins and evensong  how shocking  what gossip afterwards  ask rollo whether mungo and tartar dont stand at the lychgate and if he finds it easy to put an end to the game at play  oh and he said they never missed a sunday service or the school do they distract him  whom would it not distract to see two figures walking in with hunches on their backs like camels and highheeled shoes and hats on the back of their heads and chains and things clattering all over them  arent they ladylike  oh they are quite that  rose says it is all the pink of fashion only coming it strongi declare they are infectious  i believe so  i never heard so many nibbles at slang from any of you five as from the rector of compton in the last five minutes  i gather that he is slightly bothered  theres so much of it  we are forced to have them to all the meals on sunday and their lectures on functions have nearly scared poor anne to the pilgrim level again  they have set upon me to get up a choirconcert and a harvestfeast but happily no one has time for the first at this season and as to the other i doubted whether to make this first start after such a rainy summer and they decide me against it  to have them decorating the church  awfully jolly suggested jenny  even so  they are if you understand me technically reverent they have startled the whole place with their curtsies and crossings in church but they gabble up to the very porch and the familiarity with which they discuss high mass as they are pleased to call it i was obliged to silence them and i must say they took it nicely  how do they suit lena  she likes them  lady susan was a great help to her in london and she feels the comfort of their honesty  they brought her to church with them one or two mornings but it knocked her up to walk so early  insensibly i think they do lady tyrrells work in shutting her up from any of us  spite of croquet which seems perpetual  chronic and sporadic parties make it so  there are few days without that or something else  cricket or the band at the barracks  people say the neighbourhood has never been so gay since camilla vivians marriage  i sometimes wonder whether anything can be going to happen said jenny with a sigh not guessing at what julius was thinking of then changing her tone  surely herbert does not go to it all and leave you alone  o julius you should not let him  never mind jenny theres no more work now in the holidays than i am sufficient for and for him it is quite as guileless play as ever he had twenty years ago  it will soon be over or i should take it more seriously  but it is at such a time  yes that is the worst of it  i have thought it over but while he is in this mood the making him feel victimized and interfered with has a worse effect than the letting him have his swing  what is he doing now i wonder  heres his sermonpaper on the table and a greek testament and hints on decorating churches with constance strangeways on the first leafno other book  how long will this saturnalia last  up to the ordination i fear  you know the good people have contrived to put bazaar races and ball all into the ember week and they are the great object of the young ladies visit  could you have him home for a quiet week first  it would not be a quiet week edith is in the way of most of these affairs besides to open fire about these young ladies might just be putting nonsense into an innocent head  now ive not seen your rectory  the said rectory was in a decided state of fresh not to say raw novelty outside though the old trees and garden a little softened its hard grays and strong reds but it promised to look well when crumbling and weatherstain had done their work  at the door they met the pretty young nurse with a delicate seagreen embroidered cashmere bundle in her arms  little lady green mantle exclaimed jenny  eringobragh said julius  rose clung to her colours in spite of all predictions about the good people  asleep of course as jenny took her and uncovered her face  she wont exhibit her eyes but they are quite proper coloured  yes i see she is like raymond  do you  they all say she is a perfect charnock though how they know i cant guess  there after a little more babyworship you may take her emma  is that the undernurse asked jenny rather surprised by her juvenility  the sole one  my mother and susan are rather concerned but rose asserts that experience in that department is always associated with gin and she fell in love with this girla daughter of john gadleys who is much more respectable than he of the three pigeons  i suppose it is not in the nature of things for two women to have the same view of nursery matters unless one have brought up the other  or even if she have  witness mammas sighs over marys nurses  i thought it was the common lot  youve not seen the diningroom and the full honours were done  they were pleasant rooms still unpapered and the furniture chiefly of ambercoloured varnished deal the drawingroom chiefly with green furniture with only a few brighter dashes here and there and a sociable amount of comfortable litter already  the study was full of new shelves and old books and across the windowsill lay a gray figure with a book and a sheet of paper  you here terry  i thought you were gone with rose said julius as the boy rose to greet miss bowater  she said i need not and i hate those gardenparties said terry and they relieved him of their presence as soon as jenny had paid her respects to the favourite prints and photographs on the walls  he has a passion for the history of poland just now said julius sobieski is better company than he would meet at duddingstone i suspectpoor fellow  lord rathforlane has been so much excited by hearing of drivers successes as a coach as to desire terry to read with him for the royal engineers  the boys must get off his hands as soon as possible he says and terry being cleverest must do so soonest but the boy has seen the dullest side of soldiering and hates it  his whole soul is set on scholarship  i am afraid it is a great mistake  cant you persuade him  we have both written but rose has no great hopes of the result  i wish he could follow his bent  yes said jenny lingering as she looked towards churchhouse the young instinct ought not to be repressed  julius knew that she was recollecting how archie douglas had entreated to go to sea and the desire had been quashed because he was an only son  his inclination to speak was as perilous as if he had been rosamond herself and he did not feel it unfortunate that jenny found she must no longer stay away from home      chapter xxii times out of joint   alte der meere komm und hore meine frau die ilsebill will nicht als ich will  life at compton poynsett was different from what it had been when the two youngest sons had been at home and julius and rosamond in the house  the family circle had grown much more stiff and quiet and the chief difference caused by mrs poynsetts presence was that raymond was deprived of his refuge in her room  cecil had taken a line of polite contempt  there was always a certain languid amount of indifferent conversation from the teeth outward as rosamond said  every home engagement was submitted to the elder lady with elaborate scrupulousness almost like irony  visitors in the house or invitations out of it were welcome breaks and the whirl of society which vaguely alarmed joanna bowater was a relief to the inhabitants of the hall  annes companionship was not lively for her motherinlaw but she was brightening in the near prospect of miless return and they had established habits that carried them well through the evening  anne covered screens and made scrapbooks and did other work for the bazaar and mrs poynsett cut out pictures made suggestions and had associations of her own with the combinations of which anne had little notion  or she dictated letters which anne wrote and through all these was a kindly peaceful spirit most unlike the dreary alienation in which cecil persevered  to cecil this seemed the anxious desire for her lawful rights  she had been used to spend the greater part of the evening at the piano but her awakened eyes perceived that this was a cover to raymonds conversations at his mothers sofa so she sat tying knots in stiff thread at her macrame lace pillow making the bazaar a plea for nothing but work  raymond used to arm himself with the newspapers as the safest point dappui and the talk was happiest when it only languished for it could do much worse  shall you be at sirenwood tomorrow cecil asked mrs poynsett as she was wheeled to her station by the fire after dinner  will you kindly take charge of a little parcel for me  one of the miss strangeways asked me to look for some old franks so anne and i have been turning out my drawers  are they for sale asked raymond  yes said cecil  bee strangeways is collecting she will pay for all that are new to her and sell any duplicates  has she many asked mrs poynsett glad of this safe subject  quantities and very valuable ones  her grandfather knew everybody and was in the ministry  was he said raymond surprised  lord lorimer said mrs poynsett  not when i knew them  he was an oldfashioned whig with some peculiar crotchets and never could work with any cabinet  beatrice told me he was said cecil stiffly  i rather think he was master of the buckhounds for a little while in the grey ministry said mrs poynsett but he gave it up because he would not vote with ministers on the poor laws  i knew i was not mistaken in saying he was in the ministry said cecil  the master of the buckhounds is not in the cabinet cecil said her husband  i never said he was  i said he was in office returned the infallible lady  mrs poynsett thought it well to interrupt by handing in an envelope franked by sir robert peel but cecil at once declared that the writing was different from that which bee already owned  perhaps it is not the same sir robert said mrs poynsett  she got it from the queen and they are all authenticated  the queen newspaper of course rather petulantly  indisputable said raymond but this frank contained a letter from the second sir robert to my father  mrs poynsett made a sign of acquiescence and cecil pouted in her dignified way though mrs poynsett tried to improve matters by saying then it appears that miss strangeways will have a series of peel autographs all in fact but the first generation  common sense showed she was right but cecil still felt discontented for she knew she had been resisted and confuted and she believed it was all mrs poynsetts doing instead of raymonds  and she became as mute as anne for the next halfhour nor did either raymond or his mother venture on starting any fresh topic lest there might be fresh jarring  only anne presently came up to mrs poynsett and tenderly purred with her over some little preparation for miles  certainly anne was the most improved in looks of all the three brides who had arrived just a year ago  the thin scraggy scotch girl with the flabby washedout look alternating with angular rigidity was gone but the softening and opening of her expression the light that had come into her eyes and had made them a lovely blue instead of pale gray the rosetint on her cheeks the delicate rounded contour of her face the improved carriage of her really fine figure the traces of style in the braiding of her profuse flaxen hair and the taste that was beginning to conquer in the dress were all due to the thought that the salamanca might soon be in harbour  she sat among them still as a creature whose heart and spirit were not with them  that some change must come was felt as inevitable by each woman and it was mrs poynsett who began one forenoon when her son had brought a lease for her to sign  raymond said she you know churchhouse is to be vacant at michaelmas  i wish you would look at it and see what repairs it wants and if the drawingroom windows could be made to open on the lawn  are you hoping to tempt miles to settle there  no i fear there is no hope of that but i do not think an old brokenbacked invalid ought to engross this great house  mother i cannot hear you say so  this is your own house  so is the other she said trying to smile and much fitter for my needs with susan and jenkins to look after me  there is no fit place for you but this  you said that once  under very different circumstances  all the younger boys were still under my wing and needed the home and i was strong and vigorous  it would not have been acting right by them to have given up the place but now they are all out in the world and i am laid by my stay here only interferes with what can be much better managed without me or my old servants  i do not see that  if any one moves it should be ourselves  you are wanted on the spot continually  if sirenwood were in the market that might not be so much amiss  i do not think that likely  they will delay the sale in the hope of eleonoras marrying a rich man besides mr charnock has set his mind upon swanslea  i hope this is from nothing cecil has said or done  cecil wishes to part then  she has said nothing to me but i see she has to you  dont be annoyed raymond it is in the nature of things  i believe it is all lady tyrrells doing  the mischief such a woman can do in the neighbourhood  perhaps it is only what any friend of cecil would advise  it is the very reverse of what i intended said raymond shading his face  my dear raymond i know what you meant and what you wish but i am also certain it is for no ones happiness to go on in this way  he groaned  and the wifes right comes first  not to this house  but to this man  indeed i see more hope of your happiness now than i did last year  what because she has delivered herself over bound hand and foot to camilla vivian  no because she is altered  last year she was merely vexed at my position in the house  now she is vexed at my position with you  very unjustly  hardly so  i should not have liked your father to be so much devoted to his mother  remember jealousy is a smoke that cannot exist without some warmth  if she had any proper feeling for me she would show it by her treatment of you  that would be asking too much when she thinks i engross you  mother while you show such marvellous candour and generosity and she  hush  raymond leave it unsaid  we cannot expect her to see more than her own side of the question  she has been put into an avowedly trying position and does not deserve hard judgment for not being happy in it  all that remains is to relieve her  whether by my moving or yours is the question  i prefer the churchhouse plan  either way is shame and misery to me broke out raymond in a choked voice  nonsense said his mother trying to be cheerful  you made an impracticable experiment thats all  give cecil free scope let her feel that she has her due and all will come right  nothing can be done till after the wilsbro business said raymond glad of the reprieve  he could not bear the prospect of banishment for his mother or himself from the home to which both were rooted and the sentence of detachment from her was especially painful when she seemed his only consolation for his wifes perverseness  yet he was aware that he had been guilty of the original error and was bound to give such compensation to his wife as was offered by his mothers voluntary sacrifice  he was slow to broach the subject but only the next morning came a question about an invitation to a dull house  but said cecil it is better than home  she spoke on purpose  i am sorry to hear you say so  i cant call it home where i am but a guest  well cecil my mother offers to leave the home of her life and retire into churchhouse  cecil felt as if the screw she had been long working had come off in her hands  she frowned she gazed collecting her senses while raymond added it is to my intense grief and mortification but i suppose you are gratified  uh it would never do she exclaimed to his surprise and pleasure  quite right he returned  just what i felt  nothing can make me so glad as to see that you think the idea as socking as i do  our going to swanslea would be much betterfar more natural and no one could object  we could refurnish and make it perfect whereas nothing can be done to this place so inconveniently built and buried in trees  i should feel much freer in a place of my own  so that is what you meant when i thought you were thinking of my mother  i am obliged to take thought for myself when you take heed to no one but her said cecil and as the carriage was at that moment announced she left him  which was the most sick at heart it would be hard to say the wife with the sense that she was postponed in everything to the mother the husband at the alienation that had never before been so fully expressed  cecils errand was a council about the bazaar and driving round by sirenwood lady tyrrell became her companion in the carriage  the quick eyes soon perceived that something had taken place and confidence was soon drawn forth  the ice is broken and by whom do you think  by la belle mere  skilful strategy to know when the position is not tenable  she wants to retreat to churchhouse  dont consent to that  i said i should prefer swanslea for ourselves  hold to that whatever you do  if she moves to the village you will have all the odium and none of the advantages  there will be the same daily haunt and as to your freedom of action there are no spies like the abdicated and their dependents  a very clever plan but dont be led away by it  no said cecil resolutely but after a moment  it would be inconvenient to raymond to live so far away from the property  swanslea will be property too and a ride over on business is not like strolling in constantly  i know i shall never feel like my own mistress in a house of hers  still less with her close by with the rectory family running in and out to exchange remarks  no no hold fast to insisting that she must not leave the ancestral halls  that you can do dutifully and gracefully  cecil knew she had been betrayed into the contrary but they were by this time in the high street bowing to others of the committee on their way to the townhall a structure of particoloured brick in harlequin patterns with a peaked roof all over little sham domes which went far to justify its title of the rathouse since nothing larger could well use them  the facade was thus somewhat imposing of the rear the less said the better and as to the interior it was at present one expanse of dust impeded by scaffoldpoles and all the windows had large blotches of paint upon them  it required a lively imagination to devise situations for the stalls but mrs duncombe valiantly tripped about instructing her attendant carpenter with little assistance except from the well experienced miss strangeways  the other ladies had enough to do in keeping their plumage unsoiled  lady tyrrell kept on a little peninsula of encaustic tile cecil hopped across birdlike and unsoiled miss slater held her carmelite high and dry but poor miss fullers pale blue and drab trailing at every step became constantly more blended  the dust induced thirst  lady tyrrell lamented that the wilsbro confectioner was so far off and his ices doubtful and miss slater suggested that she had been making a temperance effort by setting up an excellent widow in the lane that opened opposite to them in a shop with raspberry vinegar gingerbeer and the like mild compounds and mrs duncombe caught at the opportunity of exhibiting the sparkling water of the well which supplied this same lane  the widow lived in one of the tenements which pettitt had renovated under her guidance and on a loan advanced by cecil and she was proud of her work  clio tallboys would view this as a triumph said mrs duncombe as standing on the steps of the townhall she surveyed the four tenements at the corner of the alley  not a man would stir in the business except pettitt who left it all to me  taking example by the professor said lady tyrrell  it is strange said miss slater how much illness there has been ever since the people went into those houses  they are in my district you know  you should make them open their windows said mrs duncombe  they lay it on the draughts  and stuff up my ventilators  that is always the way they begin  the excellent widow herself had a bad finger which was a great impediment in administering the cooling beverages but these were so excellent as to suggest the furnishing of a stall therewith for the thirsty as something sure to be popular and at small expense therewith the committee broke up all having been present but miss moy whose absence was not regretted though apologized for by mrs duncombe  i could not get her away from the stables she said she and bob would contemplate dark hag day and night i believe  i wouldnt allow it said lady tyrrell  mrs duncombe shrugged her shoulders and laughed  thats mr moys lookout she said  you dont choose to interfere with her emancipation said lady tyrrell  clio would tell you she could take care of herself at the stables as well as anywhere else  query said lady tyrrell  dont get into a scrape bessie  does your captain report on the flirtation with young simmonds  who is he asked cecil  the trainers son said bessie  it is only a bit of imitation of aurora floyd  you know shes an heiress said lady tyrrell  you had better take care how you put such a temptation in his way  i dont suppose the moys are anybody said cecil  not in your sense my dear said lady tyrrell laughing but from another level theres a wide gap between the heiress of proudfoot lawn and the heir of the training stables  cecil looks simply disgusted said bessie  she cant bear the moys betwixt the wind and her nobility  they are the great drawback to swansea i confess said cecil  oh are you thinking of swanslea cried mrs duncombe  yes said lady tyrrell she is one to be congratulated on emancipation  well can i do so said mrs duncombe  dont i know what mothers inlaw are  mine is the most wonderful old goody with exactly the notions of your meek mrs miles  incompatibility decidedly said lady tyrrell  only she was the spartan mother combined with it continued mrs duncombe  when bob was a little urchin he once in anticipation of his future tastes committed the enormity of riding on a stick on sunday so she locked him up till he had learnt six verses of one of wattss hymns about going to church being like a little heaven below isnt it  increasing his longing that way said lady tyrrell  she doesnt even light the drawingroom fire on sunday for fear people should not sit in their rooms and meditate continued mrs duncombe  bob manages to be fond of her through all but she regularly hates me  not very wonderful said lady tyrrell laughing  i suppose there is a charming reciprocity of feeling  i think i can afford to pity her said mrs duncombe lightly just fancy what i must have been to her  you know i was brought up in a convent at paris  the very bosom of the scarlet woman  but interrupted cecil you were never a roman catholic bessie  oh dear no the protestant boarders were let entirely alone there were only two of us and we lay in bed while the others went to mass and played while they went to confession that was all  i was an orphan never remember my mother and my father died abroad luckily for me bob was done for by my first ball  very odd he should have liked a little redhaired thing like me but every one is ticketed i believe  my uncle was glad enough to get rid of me and poor old mrs duncombe was unsuspecting till we went homeand then  and then  cecil may have some faint idea  of what you underwent  she wanted to begin on me as if i were a wild savage heathen you know  i believe she nearly had a fit when i declined a prayer meeting and as to my walking out with bob on sunday evening  did she make you learn wattss hymns  no but she did what was much worse to poor bob  she told him she had spent the time in prayer and humiliation and the poor fellow very nearly cried  ah those mothers have such an advantage over their sons said lady tyrrell  i determined i would never go near her again after that said mrs duncombe  bob goes he is really fond of her but i knew we should keep the peace better apart  i let her have the children now and then when it is convenient and oddly enough they like it but i shall soon have to stop that for i wont have them think me a reprobate and she has thought me ten times worse ever since i found out that i had brains and could use them  quite true said camilla theres no peacemaker like absence  the only pity is that swanslea is no further off returned bessie  and so it was that cecil backed by her two counsellors held her purpose and raymond sadly spoke of the plan of separation to julius  both thought mrs poynsetts own plan the best though they could not bear the idea of her leaving her own house  raymond was much displeased  at least he said there is a reprieve till this frantic fortnight is over  i envy your exemption from the turmoil  i wish you would exempt yourself from the races said julius the mischief they have done in these villages is incalculable  the very menservants are solicited to put into sweepstakes whenever they go into wilsbro and only this morning mrs hornblower has been to me about her son  i thought he was the great feather in herbert bowaters cap  showing the direction of the wind only too well  since herbert has been infected with the general insanity poor harry hornblower has lapsed into his old ways and is always hanging about the three pigeons with some of the swarm of locusts who have come down already to brawl round the training stables  this has come to trueloves ears and he has notice of dismissal  at the mothers desire i spoke to truelove but he told me that at last years races the lad had gambled at a great rate and had only been saved from dishonesty by detection in time  he was so penitent that truelove gave him another trial on condition that he kept out of temptation but now he has gone back to it mr truelove thinks it the only way of saving him from some fresh act of dishonesty  it is all up with them he says when once they take that turn  you need not speak as if i were accountable for all the blackguardism  every man is accountable who lends his name and position to bolster up a field of vice  come come julius  remember what men have been on the turf  if those men had withheld their support fashion would not have led so many to their ruin  hundreds are present without damage  it is a hearty outofdoors country amusement and one of the few general holidays that bring all ranks together  you speak of racing as it has been or might be in some golden age said julius  of course there is no harm in trying one horses speed against another but look at the facts and say whether it is right to support an amusement that becomes such an occasion of evil  because a set of rascals choose to bring their villainies there you would have the sport of the whole neighbourhood given up  no cakes and ale with a vengeance  the cakes and ale that make a brother offend ought to be given up  that sentences all public amusements  not necessarily  the question is of degree  other amusements may have evil incidentally connected with them and may lead to temptation but it is not their chief excitement  the play or the opera is the prime interest and often a refined and elevated one but at races the whole excitement depends upon the horses and is so fictitious that it needs to be enhanced by this betting system  no better faculty is called into play  some few men may understand the merits of the horse many more and most of the ladies simply like the meeting in numbers but there is no higher faculty called out and in many cases the whole attraction is the gambling and the fouler wickedness in the background  which would be ten thousand times worse if all gentlemen stood aloof  what good do these gentlemen do beyond keeping the contest honourable and the betting in which they are concerned  do not they make themselves decoys to the young men on the borderland who would stay away if the turf were left to the mere vulgar  why should they not leave it to drop like bullbaiting or cockfighting  well done julius said raymond  you will head a clerical crusade against the turf but i do not think it just to compare it with those ferocious sports which were demoralizing in themselves while this is to large numbers simply a harmless holiday and excuse for an outing not to speak of the benefit to the breed of horses  i do not say that all competitions of speed are necessarily wrong but i do say that the present way of managing races makes them so mischievous that no one ought to encourage them  i wonder what backsworth and wilsbro would say to you  it is their great harvest  lodgings for those three days pay a quarters rent and where so many interests are concerned a custom cannot lightly be dropped  well said raymond with a sigh it is not pleasure that takes me i shall look on with impartial eyes if that is what you wish  poor raymond it was plain that he had little liking for anything that autumn  he rode over to swanslea with cecil and when he said it was six miles off she called it four what he termed bare marshy and dreary was in her eyes open and free his swamp was her lake and she ran about discovering charms and capabilities where he saw nothing but damp and dry rot and above all banishment  would she have her will  clio would have thought her lecture had taken effect and mayhap it added something to the general temper of selfassertion but in fact cecil had little time to think so thickly did gaieties and preparations crowd upon her  it was the full glory and importance of the members wife her favourite ideal but all the time her satisfaction was marred by secret heartache as she saw how wearily and formally her husband dragged through whatever fell to his lot saw how jaded and depressed he looked and heard him laugh his company laugh without any heart in it  she thought it all his mothers fault and meant to make up for everything when she had him to herself  julius had his troubles  when rosamond found that races were what she called his pet aversion she resisted with all her might  her home associations were all on fire again  she would not condemn the pleasures she had shared with her parents by abstinence from them any more than she would deviate from lady rathforlanes nursery management to please mrs poynsett and susan  a bonnet which julius trusted never to see in church was purchased in the face of his remark that every woman who carried her gay attire to the stand made herself an additional feather on the hook of evil  at first she laughed and then grew tearfully passionate in protests that nothing should induce her to let her brothers see what their own father did turned into a crime and if they went without her to take care of them and fell into mischief whose fault would that be  it was vain to hint that tom was gone back to school and terry cared more for the olympic dust than that of backsworth  she had persuaded herself that his absence would be high treason to her father whom she respected far more at a distance than when she had been struggling with his ramshackle easygoing ways  even now she was remonstrating with him about poor terrys present misery  his last half year had been spent under the headmaster who had cultivated his historical and poetical intelligence whereas mr driver was nothing but an able crammer and the moment the lad became interested and diverged from routine he was choked off because such things would not tell  if the coach had any enthusiasm it was for mathematics and thitherwards terrys brain was undeveloped  with misplaced ingenuity he argued that sums came right by chance and that euclid was best learnt by heart for the pictures simply confused him and when julius amazed at finding so clever a boy in the novel position of dunce tried to find out what he did know of arithmetic his ignorance and inappreciation were so unfathomable that julius doubted whether the power or the will was at fault  at any rate he was wretched in the present and dismal as to the future and looked on his brotherinlaw as in league with the oppressors for trying to rouse his sense of duty  remonstrance seemed blunted and ineffective everywhere  when herbert bowater tried to reclaim harry hornblower into giving up his notorious comrades he received the dogged reply why should not a chap take his pleasure as well as you  with the authority at once of clergyman and squires son he said harry you forget yourself i am not going to discuss my occupations with you  you know better rudely interrupted the lad  racketing about all over the country and coming home late at night  youd best not speak of other folks  as a matter of fact herbert had never been later than was required by a walk home from a dinner or a very moderate cricket supper and his conscience was clear as to the quality of his amusements but instead of as hitherto speaking as youth to youth he used the language of the minister to the insulting parishioner  i am sorry i have disturbed mrs hornblower but the case is not parallel innocent amusement is one thingit is quite another to run into haunts that have already proved dangerous to your principles  harry hornblower laughed  its no go coming the parson over me mr bowater  its well known what black coats are and how they never cry out so loud upon other folks as when theyve had a jolly lark among themselves  no concealment now were up to a thing or two and parsons and capitalists and squires will have to look sharp  this oration smacking of the three pigeons was delivered so loud as to bring the mother on the scene  o harry harry you arent never speaking like that to mr bowater  when folks jaw me about whats nothing to them i always give them as good as they bring  thats my principle said harry flinging out of the house while the curate tried to console the weeping mother and soon after betook himself to his rector with no mild comments on the lads insolence  another warning how needful it is for us to avoid all occasion for misconstruction said julius  we do all of us said herbert  even that wretched decoction fuller and that mere dictionary driver never gave cause for imputations like these  what has the fellow got hold of  stories of the last century twobottle men said julius trumped up by unionists now against us in these days  the truth is that the world triumphs and boasts whenever it catches the ministry on its own ground  its ideal is as exacting as the saintly one  i say rector exclaimed the curate after due pause youll be at evensong on saturday  the ladies at sirenwood want me to go to backsworth with them to hear the band  cannot young strangeways take care of his sisters  i would not ask it sir but they have set their heart on seeing rood house and want me to go with them because of knowing dr easterby  then im to dine with them and thats the very last of it for me  theres no more croquet after this week  i am thankful to hear it said julius suppressing his distaste that the man he most reverenced and the place which was his haven of rest should be a mere lion for bee and conny a slight pastime before the regimental band      chapter xxiii the apple of ate   oh mirror mirror on the wall who is the fairest of us allthe three bears  i do really think terry has found the secret of happiness for a little while at least said rosamond entering mrs poynsetts room  that funny little man in the loan museum has asked him to help in the arrangement  who is it  the little watchmaker or watch cobbler in the old curiosity shop  yes terry calls him a descendant of the genoese frescobaldi and im sure his black eyes were never made for an english head  terry has always haunted those uncanny wares of his and has pursued them to the museum  tis not every young gentleman i would wish to see there says the old man but the honourable mr de lancey has the soul of an antiquarian  they say the old man is really very clever and well read  he looks like an old magician with his white cap and spectacles and he had need to have a wand to bring order out of that awful chaos  everybody all round has gone and cleared out their rubbish closet  upon my word it looks so  there are pictures all one network of cracks and iron caps and gauntlets out of all the halls in every stage of rust and pots and pans and broken crocks and baskets of coin all verdigris and tarnishpah  are miless birds safe  oh yes with a swordfishs sword and a sawfishs saw making a trophy on the top  terry is in the library hunting material for a dissertation upon the ancient unicorn which ought to conclude with the battle royal witnessed by alice in wonderland  the stuffed department is numerous but in a bad way as to hair and chiefly consists of everybodys grandmothers old parrots and squirrels and white rats  then every boy who ever had a fit of birds eggs or butterflies has sent in a collection chiefly minus the lower wings and with volunteer specimens of moth but luckily some give leave to do what they please with them so the magician is making composition animals with the debris  not really  i made a feeble attempt with an admirals wings and an orange tip but i was scouted  about four dilapidated ones make up a proper specimen and i cant think how it is all to be done in the time but really something fit to be seen is emerging  terry is sorting the coins a pretty job i should say but felicity to him  but oh the industrial articles  there are all the regalia carved out of cherrystones and a patchwork quilt of 5000 bits of silk each no bigger than a shilling  and a calculation of the middle verse in the bible and the longest verse and the shortest verse and the like edifying scriptural researches all copied out like flies legs in writing no one can see but julius with his spectacles off and set in a brooch as big as the top of a thimble all done by a onelegged sergeant of marines  so that the line might not be out done i offered my sergeantmajors bannerscreen but i am sorry to say they declined it which made me jealous  are there any drawings of the reynolds boy  yes lenore vivian brought them down and very good they are every one says he has the making of a genius but he does not look as if it agreed with him he is grown tall and thin and white and i should not wonder if those goodfornothing servants bullied him  did you see anything of eleonora  nothing so impossible  i meet her every day but she is always beset with the strangeways and i think she avoids me  i can hardly think so  i dont like it  that man is always hanging about sirenwood and lenore never stirs an inch without one of those girls  i wish frank could see for himself poor fellow  he does hope to run down next week  i have just heard from him in high spirits  one of his seniors has come into some property another is out of health and retires so there is some promotion in view  i wish it would make haste then  i dont like the look of things  i can hardly disbelieve in the dear girl herself yet i do feel as if it were against nature for it to succeed  did you hear anything of mrs bowater today  yes she is much better and edith is coming to go into the gallery with me on tuesday when they inaugurate the rathouse  oh did you hear of the debate about it  you know theres to be a procession all the volunteers and all the odd fellows and all the good templars and all the schoolchildren of all denominationswhatever can walk behind a flag  our choir boys grew emulous and asked herbert to ask the rector to let them have our lovely banner with the lilies on it but he declined though theres no choice but to give the holiday that will be taken  was that the debate  oh no that was among the higher powerswhere the procession should start from  the precedent was an opening that began with going to church and having a sermon from the bishop but then theres no church and after that spur the bishop gave them they cant ask him without one besides the mayor dissents and so do a good many more of them  so they are to meet at the market cross and mr fuller in the famous black gown supported by mr driver is to head them  im not sure that julius and herbert were not in the programme but mr truelove spoke up and declared that mr flynn the wesleyan methodist and mr howler the primitive methodist and mr riffell the baptist had quite as good a right to walk in the foreground and to hold forth and mr moy supported him  popularity hunting against raymond  precisely  but howler flynn and co were too much for mr fuller so he seceded and the religious ceremonies are now to be confined to his saying grace at the dinner  raymond thinks it as well for the inaugural speech would only have been solemn mockery but julius thinks it a sad beginning for the place to have no blessing because of our unhappy divisions  isnt that like julius  exactly though i see it more from raymonds point of view  so you are going to the dinner  oh yes  happily my rector has nothing to say against that and i am sure he owes me something for keeping me out of the bazaar  in fact having avoided the trouble i couldnt take the pleasure and he must set that against the races  my dear though i am not set against races like julius i think considering his strong feelings on the subject  my dear mrs poynsett it would be very bad for julius to give in to his fancies  the next thing would be to set baby up in a little hood and veil like a nun  rosamonds winsome nonsense could not but gain a smile  no doubt she was a pleasant daughterinlaw though for substantial care anne was the strength and reliance  even anne was much engrossed by preparations for the bazaar  it had been a great perplexity to her that the one thing she thought not worldly should be condemned by julius and he had not tried to prevent her from assisting cecil thinking as he had told eleonora that the question of right and wrong was not so trenchant as to divide households  the banquet and inauguration went off fairly well  there was nothing in it worth recording except that rosamond pronounced that raymond only wanted a particle of irish fluency to be a perfect speaker but every one was observing how ill and depressed he looked  even cecil began to see it herself and to ask lady tyrrell with some anxiety whether she thought him altered  men always look worn after a session said lady tyrrell  if this really makes him unhappy  my dear cecil thats the very proof of the necessity  if it makes him unhappy to go five miles away with his wife it ought not  you should wean him from such dependence  cecil had tears in her eyes as she said i dont know  when i hear him sighing in his sleep i long to give it up and tell him i will try to be happy here  my dear child dont be weak  if you give way now you will rue it all your life  if i could have taken to his mother i think he would have cared more for me  no  the moment her jealousy was excited she would have resumed him and you would have been the more shut out in the cold  a little firmness now and the fresh start is before you  cecil sighed feeling that she was paying a heavy price for that fresh start but her hands were too full for much thought  guests came to dinner mrs poynsett kept more to her own room and raymond exerted himself to talk so that the blank of the evenings was less apparent  the days were spent at the townhall where the stalls were raised early enough for all the ladies their maids and footmen to buzz about them all day decking them out  mrs duncombe was as usual the guiding spirit contriving all with a cleverness that made the deficiencies of her household the more remarkable  conny and bee strangeways were the best workers having plenty of experience and resource and being ready to do anything however hard dusty or disagreeable and to drudge contentedly with plenty of chatter indeed but quite as freely to a female as to a male companion whereas miss moy had a knot of men constantly about her and made a noise which was a sore trial to cecils heavy spirit all the first day exclusive of the offence to her native fastidiousness  she even called upon lady tyrrell and mrs duncombe to hold a council whether all gentlemen should not be excluded the next day as spoiling the ladies work and of no use themselves but there were one or two who really did toil and so well that they could not be dispensed with and mrs duncombe added that it would not do to give offence  there was a harassed look about mrs duncombe herself for much depended on the success of her husbands filly dark hag  the captain had hitherto been cautious and had secured himself against heavy loss so as to make the turf a tolerable speculation on but the wonderful perfections of this animal had led him to stake much more on her than had been his wont and though his wife was assured of being a rich woman in another week she was not sorry for the multiplicity of occupations which hindered her mind from dwelling too much on the chances  how calm you lookhow i envy you she said as she came to borrow some tape of eleonora vivian who was fastening the pendent articles to the drapery of her sisters stall  eleonora gave a constrained smile feeling how little truth there was in her apparent peace wearied out as she was with the long conflict and constant distrust  she was the more anxious to be with lady susan whose every word she could believe and she finally promised to leave home with bee and conny the day after the ball and to meet their mother in london  they knew there was no chance for lorimer but they took her on her own terms hoping something perhaps and at any rate glad to be a comfort to one whom they really loved while lady tyrrell was delighted to promote the visit seeing that the family did more for lorimers cause than he did for himself and in his own home who could guess the result especially after certain other manoeuvres of her ladyship had taken effect  lady tyrrell did not know nor indeed did conny or bee that though they would meet their mother in london she would not at once go into yorkshire with them but would send them to their uncles while she repaired to the retreat at st faiths  the harass of these last few weeks especially the endeavour to make her go to the races had removed all scruples from lenores mind as to leaving her home in ignorance of her intentions  to her mind the circumstances of her brothers death had made a racecourse no place for any of the family especially that of backsworth gout coming opportunely to disable her father in london and one or two other little accidents had prevented the matter from coming to an issue while she had been in london and the avowal of her intention to keep away had filled her father with passion at her for her absurd scruples and pretences at being better than other people  it had been lady tyrrell who pacified him with assurances that she would soon do better no one wished to force her conscience and lenore always on the watch began to wonder whether her sister had any reason for wishing to keep her away and longed the more for the house of truth and peace  so came on the bazaar day which mrs poynsett spent in solitude except for visits from the rectory and one from joanna bowater who looked in while julius was sitting with her and amused them by her account of herself as an emissary from home with ten pounds to be got rid of from her father and mother for good neighbourhoods sake she brought mrs poynsett a beautiful bouquet for the elderly spinsters she said sat on the stairs and kept up a constant supply and she had also some exquisite genoese wire ornaments from cecils counter and a set of studs from a tray of polished pebbles sent up from vivians favourite lapidary at rockpier  she had been amused to find the miss strangeways hunting over it to match that very simplelooking charm which lena wore on to her watch for as she said the attraction must either be the simplicity of it or the general lenaworship in which those girls indulge  how does that dear child look  fagged i think but so does every one and it was not easy to keep order mrs duncombes counter was such a rendezvous for noisy people and miss moy was perfectly dreadful running about forcing things on people and refusing change  and how is poor anne enduring  like christian in vanity fair as long as she did endure for she retired to the spinsters on the back stairs  i offered to bring her home and she accepted with delight but i dropped her in the village to bestow her presents  i was determined to come on here we go on monday  shall you be at the ordination  i trust so  if mamma is pretty well we shall both go  is edith going to the ball on thursday  no she has given it up  it seems as if we at least ought to recollect our ember days though i am ashamed to think we never did till this time last year  i confess that i never heard of them said mrs poynsett  dont look shocked my dear such things were not taught in my time  julius showed her the rubric and the prayer from the book in his pocket knowing that the one endeared to her by association was one of the prayerbooks made easy by omission of all not needed at the barest sunday service  i see she said it seems quite right  i wish you had told me before you were ordained my dear  you kept your ember days for me by instinct dear mother  dont be too sure julius  one learns many things when one is laid on ones back  think of herbert now whispered jenny  i am glad he is sheltered from all this hubbub by being at the palace  i suppose you cannot go to the cathedral julius  no bindon will not come back till his brothers holiday is over nor do i even know where to write to him  oh here comes anne  now for her impressions  anne had brought her little gift for mrs poynsett and displayed her presents for glen fraser but as to what she had seen it made her shudder and say you were right julius i did not know people could go on so  and with all those poor people ill close by  miss slater who sat on the stairs just below me tying up flowers is much grieved about a lad who was at work there till a fortnight ago and now is dying of a fever and harassed by all the rattling of the carriages  what close by  nothing infectious i hope  the doctor called it gastric fever but no one was to hear of it lest there should be an alarm and it was too late to change the place of the bazaar though it is so sad to have all that gaiety close at hand  if these were the impressions of anne and joanna early in the day what were they later when in those not sustained by excitement spirit and energy began to flag  cecils counter with her excellent and expensive wares and her own dignified propriety was far less popular than those where the goods were cheaper and the saleswomen less inaccessible and she was not only disappointed at her failure but vexed when told that the articles must be raffled for  she could not object but it seemed an unworthy end for what had cost her so much money and pains to procure and it was not pleasant to see mrs duncombe and miss moy hawking the tickets about like regular touters nor the most beautiful things drawn by the most vulgar and tasteless people  miss moy had around her a court of horsey men who were lounging away the day before the races and who had excited her spirits to a pitch of boisterousness such as dismayed mrs duncombe herself when her attempts at repression were only laughed at  somehow among these adherents there arose a proposal for the election of a queen of beauty each gentleman paying halfacrown for the right of voting  miss moy bridled and tried to blush  she was a tall highlycoloured flashingeyed brunette to whom a triumph would be immense over the refined statuesque severe miss vivian and an appleblossom innocentlooking girl who was also present and though lady tyrrell was incontestably the handsomest person in the room her age and standing had probably prevented her occurring to the propounders of the scheme  the design was taking shape when young strangeways who was willing to exchange chaff with gussie moy but was gentleman enough to feel the indecorum of the whole thing moved across to his sister and muttered i say con they are getting up that stupid trick of election of a queen of beauty  does lady tyrrell know it  wouldnt it be rather fun  horrid bad form downright impudence  mother would squash it at once  go and warn one of them signing with his head  constance made her way to eleonora who had already been perplexed and angered by more than one critical stare as one and another man loitered past and gazed intrepidly at her  she hurried at once to her sister who was sitting passively behind her counter as if wearied out and who would not be stirred to interference  never mind lenore it cant be helped  it is all for the cause and to stop it would be worse taste fitting on the cap as an acknowledged beauty and to that im not equal  it is an insult  never fear theyll never choose you while you look so forbidding though perhaps it is rather becoming  they have not the taste  eleonora said no more but went over to the window where raymond was keeping his guard with his oldfashioned sense of protection  she had no sooner told him than he started into incredulous indignation in which he was joined by his wife who only wished him to dash forward to prevent the scheme before he would believe it real  however when the ballotbox came his way and a simpering youth presented him with a card begging for his opinion he spoke so as to be heard by all no thank you sir  i am requested by the ladies present to state that such competition was never contemplated by their committee and would be repugnant to all their sentiments they beg that the election may be at once dropped and the money returned  mr charnock poynsett had a weight that no one resisted  there was a moments silence a little murmur apologetic and remonstrant but the deed was done  only a clear voice with the thrillings of disappointed vanity and exultation scarcely disguised by a laugh was heard saying louder than the owner knew oh of course mr charnock poynsett spoiled sport  it would have been awkward between his wife and his old flame  for shame gussie hushed mrs duncombe theyll hear  i dont care  let them  stuckup people  whoever heard cecil charnock poynsett did and felt as if the ground were giving way with her     chapter xxiv the lady green mantle   the night just like the night before    in terrors passed away nor did the demons vanish thence    before the dawn of daymoore  the turmoil was over the gains had been emptied into bags to be counted at leisure the relics of the sale left to be disposed of through the exchange and mart  terry looking tired to death descended from his post as assistant showman and with some gentlemen who were to dine at compton poynsett cecil drove home to dress in haste and act hostess to a large dinnerparty  all the time she felt giddy at the words she had heardmr poynsetts old flame  it was constantly ringing in her ears and one conviction was before her mind  her cheeks burnt like fire and when she reached her own room at night and leant from the window to cool them they only burnt the more  had she been wilfully deceived had she been taking the counsel of a jealous woman about her husband  had not camilla assured her that the object of his first love was not in the country  ay but when that was spoken camilla herself was in london and cecil knew enough of her friend to be aware that she viewed such a subterfuge as ingenious  even then she had perceived that the person alluded to could only have been a vivian and the exclamation of careless spite carried assurance to her that she had been tricked into confidence and acceptance of the advice of a rival  she had a feverish longing to know more and obtain explanation and external certainty  but how  raymond was one of the very tired that night  he fell asleep the instant his head touched the pillow but it was that sobbing sighing sleep which had before almost swept away from very ruth her resolution and on this night there were faltering words strangely though unconsciously replying to her thoughts camilla a cruel revenge  poor child but for you she might have learnt  my mother  why why this persistent hatred  cannot you let us alone  must you destroy our home  these were the mutterings at intervals  she listened and in the darkness her impulse was to throw herself on her husband tell him all show him how she had been misled and promise to give up all to which that true vivienne had prompted her  she did even try to wake him but the attempt caused only a more distinct expostulation of cannot you let her alone  cannot you let us learn to love one another  it may be revenge on me or my mother but what has she done  dontoh dont  the distress she caused forced her to desist and she remembered how raymond had always warned her  the intimacy with lady tyrrell had been in the teeth of his remonstrances  he had said everything to prevent it short of confessing his former attachment and though resentful that the warning had been denied her she felt it had been well that she had been prevented from putting the question on her first impulse  many ways of ascertaining the fact were revolved by her as with an aching head she lay hopelessly awake till morning when she fell into a doze which lasted until she found that raymond had risen and that she must dress in haste unless she meant to lose her character for punctuality  her head still ached and she felt thoroughly tired but when raymond advised her to stay at home and recruit herself for the ball she said the air of the downs would refresh her  indeed she felt as if quiet and loneliness would be intolerable until she could understand herself and what she had heard  raymond took the reins of the barouche and a gentleman who had slept at the hall went on the box beside him leaving room for rosamond and her brother who were to be picked up at the rectory but when they drew up there only rosamond came out in the wonderful bonnet just large enough to contain one big waterlily which suited well with the sleepy grace of her movements and the glossy sheen of her mauve silk  terry is not coming  he has a headache poor boy she said as julius shut her into the barouche  take care of him and baby  take care of yourself madam madcap said julius with a smile as she bent down to give him a parting kiss with perhaps a little pleading for forgiveness in it  but instead of as last year shuddering either at its folly or publicity cecil felt a keen pang of desire for such a look as half rebuked while it took a loving farewell of rosamond  was camilla like that statue which the husband inadvertently espoused with a ring and which interposed between him and his wife for ever  rosamond talked  she always had a certain embarrassment in tetea tetes with cecil and it took form in a flow of words  poor terry he turned faint and giddy at breakfast  i thought he had been indulging at the refreshmentstall but he says he was saving for a fine copy of the faerie queen that friskyball told him of at a book stall at backsworth and existed all day on draughts of water when his throat grew dry as showman so i suppose it is only inanition coupled with excitement and stuffiness and that quiet will repair him  he would not hear of my staying with him  i suppose you do not wish to be late  certainly not said rosamond who indeed would have given up before save for her bonnet and her principle and whatever she said of lady rathforlanes easy management of her nurslings did not desire to be too many hours absent from her julia  i only want to stay till the threeyearold cup has been run for said cecil  mrs duncombe would feel it unkind if we did not  you look tired said rosamond kindly put your feet upon the front seatnobody will look  do you know how much you cleared  not yet said cecil  i do not know what was made by the raffles how i do hate them  fancy that lovely opal venetian vase going to that big bony scotswoman mr mvies mother  indeed  that is a pity  if i had known it would be raffled for i would have sent a private commission though i dont know if julius would have let me  he says it is gambling  what became of the spa workbox with the passionflower wreath  i dont know  i was so disgusted that i would not look any more i never saw such an obnoxious girl as that miss moy  that she is said rosamond  i should think she was acting the fast girl as found in sensation novels  exactly said cecil proceeding to narrate the proposed election and in her need of sympathy she even told its sequel adding rosamond do you know what she meant  is it fair to tell you said rosamond asking a question she knew to be vain  i must know whether i have been deceived  never by raymond cried rosamond  never never never cried cecil with most unusual excitement he told me all that concerned himself at the very first  i wish he had told me who it was  how much it would have saved  rosamond you know i am sure  yes i made julius tell me but indeed cecil you need not mind never has a feeling more entirely died out  do you think i do not know that said cecil  do you think my husband could have been my husband if he had not felt that  dear cecil i am so glad cried impulsive rosamond her gladness in truth chiefly excited by the anger that looked like love for raymond  i mean i am glad you see it so and dont doubt him  i hope we are both above that said cecil  no it is camilla that i want to know about  i must know whether she told me truth  she told what did she tell you  that heraymondhad loved some one said cecil in a stifled voice that i little knew what his love could be  i thought it had been for her sister in india  she told me that it was nobody in the country  but then we were in town  just like her cried rosamond and wondered not to be contradicted  tell me how it really was only asked cecil  as far as i know the attachment grew up with raymond but it was when the brother was alive and sir harry at his worst and mrs poynsett did not like it though she gave in at last and tried to make the best of it but then shecamillaas you call hermet the old monster lord tyrrell made up a quarrel because mrs poynsett would not abdicate and broke it off  she said mrs poynsett only half consented and that the family grew weary of her persistent opposition  and she made you think it mrs poynsetts doing and that she is not possible to live with  o cecil you will not think that any longer  dont you see that it is breaking raymonds heart  cecils tears were starting and she was very near sobbing as she said i thought perhaps if we were away by ourselves he might come to care for me  she said he never would while his mother was by that she would not let him  thats not a bit true said rosamond indignantly  is it not what she has most at heart to see her sons happy  when has she ever tried to interfere between julius and me  not that she could added rosamond to herself in a happy little whisper not meant to be heard but it was and with actual though suppressed sobs cecil exclaimed  o rose rose what do you do to make your husband love you  do  be very naughty said rosamond forced to think of the exigencies of the moment and adding lightly there it wont do to cry  here are the gentlemen looking round to see what is the matter  ardently did she wish to have been able to put cecil into raymonds arms and run out of sight but with two menservants with crossed arms behind a strange gentleman in front the streets of wilsbro at hand and the raceground impending sentiment was impossible and she could only make herself a tonic and declare nothing to be the matter while cecil horrified at attracting notice righted herself and made protest of her perfect health and comfort  when raymond always careful of her stopped the carriage and descended from his perch to certify himself whether she was equal to going on his solicitude went to her heart and she gave his hand as it lay on the door an affectionate thankful pressure which so amazed him that he raised his eyes to her face with a softness in them that made them for a moment resemble franks  that was all emotion must be kept at bay and as vehicles thickened round them as they passed through wilsbro the two ladies betook themselves to casual remarks upon them  overtaking the sirenwood carriage just at the turn upon the down raymond had no choice but to take up his station with that on one side and on the other captain duncombes drag where fluttering with dark hags colours were perched mrs duncombe and miss moy just in the rear of the like conveyance from the barracks  greetings and invitations to both elevations were plentiful and rosamond would have felt in her element on the military one  she was rapidly calculating with her goodnatured eye whether the choice her rank gave her would exclude some eager girl when cecil whispered stay with me pray with an irresistibly beseeching tone  so the strangeways sisters climbed up nothing loth lady tyrrell sat with her father the centre of a throng of gentlemen who welcomed her to the ground where she used to be a reigning belle and the colonels wife mrs ross came to sit with lady rosamond  the whole was perfect enjoyment to the last  she felt it a delightful taste of her merry old bohemian days to sit in the clear september sunshine exhilarated by the brilliancy and life around laughing with her own little court of officers exclaiming at every droll episode holding her breath with the thrill of universal expectation and excitement in the wonderful hush of the multitude as the thud of the hoofs and rush in the wind was heard coming nearer straining her eyes as the glossy creatures and their gay riders flashed past and setting her whole heart for the moment on the one she was told to care for  raymond seeing his ladies well provided for gave up his reins to the coachman and started in quest of a friend from the other side of the county  about an hour later when luncheon was in full progress and rosamond was by cecils languor driven into doing the honours with her most sunshiny drollery and mirth raymonds hand was on the carriage door and he asked in haste can you spare me a glass of champagne  have you a scentbottle  an accident  yes no not exactly  she has been knocked down and trampled on  who  let me come  cant i help  could rosamond  no no  it is a poor woman brutally treated  no i say ill manage  it is a dreadful scene dont  but there was something in his tone which impelled rosamond to open the carriage door and spring out  rose i say it is no place for a lady  i cant answer for it to julius  ill do that  take me  there was no withstanding her and after all raymonds tone betrayed that he was thankful for her help and knew that there was no danger for her  he had not many yards to lead her  the regions of thoughtless gaiety were scarcely separated from the regions of undisguised evil and raymond on his way back from his friend had fallen on a horrible row in which a toyselling woman had been set upon thrown down and trodden on and then dragged out by the police bleeding and senseless  when he brought rosamond to the spot she was lying propped against a bundle moaning a little and guarded by a young policeman who looked perplexed and only equal to keeping back the crowd who otherwise with better or worse purposes would have rushed back in the few minutes during which mr poynsett had been absent  they fell back staring and uttering expressions of rough wonder at the advance of the lady in her glistening silk but as she knelt down by the poor creature held her on her arm bathed her face with scent on her own handkerchief and held to her lips the champagne that raymond poured out there was a kind of hoarse cheer  i think her arm is put out said rosamond she ought to go to the infirmary  send for a cab said raymond to the policeman but at that moment the girl opened her eyes started at the sight of him and tried to hide her face with her hand  it is poor fanny reynolds said he in a low voice to rosamond while the policeman was gruffly telling the woman she was better and ought to get up and not trouble the lady but rosamond waved off his too decided assistance saying  i know who she is she comes from my husbands parish and i will take her home  you would like to go home would you not poor fanny  the woman shuddered but clung to her and in a minute or two an unwilling fly had been pressed into the service and the girl lifted into it by raymond and the policeman  you are really going with her said the former  you will judge whether to take her home but she ought to go to the infirmary first  tell cecil i am sorry to desert her said rosamond as he wrung her hand then paid the driver and gave him directions the policeman going with them to clear the way through the throng to the border of the down  the choice of the cabman had not been happy  he tried to go towards backsworth and when bidden to go to wilsbro growled out an imprecation and dashed off at a pace that was evident agony to the poor patient but when rosamond stretched out at the window to remonstrate she was answered with rude abuse that he could not be hindered all day by whims  she perceived that he was so much in liquor that their connection had better be as brief as possible and the name on the door showed that he came from beyond the circle of influence of the name of charnock poynsett  she longed to assume the reins if not to lay the whip about his ears but all she could do was to try to lessen the force of the jolts by holding up the girl as the horse was savagely beaten and the carriage so swayed from side to side that she began to think it would be well if there were not three cases for the infirmary instead of one  to talk to the girl or learn her wishes was not possible among the moans and cries caused by the motion and it was no small relief to be safely at the infirmary door though there was no release till after a fierce altercation with the driver who first denied and then laughed to scorn the ample fare he had received so that had any policeman been at hand the porter and house surgeon would have given him in charge but they could only take his number and let him drive off in a fury  poor fanny was carried away fainting to the accident ward and rosamond found it would be so long before she would be visible again that it would be wiser to go home and send in her relations but there was not a fly or cab left in wilsbro and there was nothing for it but to walk  she found herself a good deal shaken and walked fast because thus her limbs did not tremble so much while the glaring september afternoon made her miss the parasol she had left in the carriage and find little comfort in the shadeless erection on her head  it was much further than she had walked for a long time past and she had begun to think she had parted with a good deal of her strength before the compton woods grew more defined or the church tower came any nearer  though the lane to the reynolds colony was not full in her way she was glad to sit down in the shade to speak to old betty who did not comport herself according to either extreme common to parents in literature  so fanny she be in the firmary be her  im sure as twas very good of the young squire and you my lady and im sorry hers bin and give you so much trouble  everybody was harvesting but the old woman who had the inevitable bad leg  all men and beasts were either in the fields or at the races and rosamond uncertain whether her patient was not in a dying state rejoiced in her recent acquisition of a pony carriage and speeding home with renewed energy roused her parsons man from tea in his cottage and ordered him off to take betty reynolds to see her daughter without loss of time  then at length she opened her own gate and walked in at the drawing room window  terry started up from the sofa and anne from a chair by his side exclaiming at her appearance and asking if there had been any accident  not to any of us but to a poor woman whom i have been taking to the infirmary she said sinking into a low chair  wheres julius  he went to see old george willett said anne  the poor old man has just heard of the death of his daughter at wilsbro  and you came to sit with this boy you good creature  how are you master  oh better thanks he said with a weary stretch  how done up you look rose  how did you come  i walked from wilsbro  walked echoed both her hearers  walked  i liked my two legs better than the four of the horse that brought me there though twasnt his fault poor beast but the brute of a driver whom well have up before the magistrate  ive got the name doing his best to dislocate every bone in the poor things body  well and i hope baby didnt disturb you  baby has been wonderfully quiet  julius went to see after her once but she was out  ill go and see the young woman and then come and tell my story  but rosamond came back almost instantly exclaiming emma must have taken the baby to the hall  i wish she would be more careful  the sun is getting low and theres a fog rising  she had not been there when i came down an hour ago said anne at least not with mrs poynsett  they may have had her in the housekeepers room  i had better go and hasten her home  julius came in shortly after but before he had heard the tale of fanny reynolds anne had returned to say that neither child nor nurse had been at the hall nor passed the large gate that morning it was growing rather alarming  the other servants said emma had taken the baby out as usual in the morning but had not returned to dinner and they too had supposed her at the hall  none of the dependants of the hall in the cottages round knew anything of her but at last dilemma hornblower imparted that she had seen my ladys babys green cloak atop of a taxcart going towards wilsbro  now emma had undesirable relations and rosamond had taken her in spite of warning that her uncle was the keeper of the three pigeons  the young parents stood looking at one another and rosamond faintly said if that girl has taken her to the races  im more afraid of that fever in water lane said julius  i have a great mind to take the pony carriage and see that the girl does not take her there  oh  i sent it with betty reynolds cried rosamond in an agony  at that moment the hall carriage came dashing up and as raymond saw the three standing in the road he called to the coachman to stop for he and his friend were now within and cecil leaning back looking much tired  raymonds eager question was what rosamond had done with her charge  left her at the infirmarybut oh youve not seen baby  seenseen what your baby asked raymond as if he thought rosamonds senses astray while his bachelor friend was ready to laugh at a young mothers alarms all the more when julius answered it is too true the baby and her nurse have not been seen here since ten oclock and we are seriously afraid the girl may have been beguiled to those races  there is a report of the childs cloak having been seen on a taxcart  then it was so exclaimed cecil starting forward  i saw a babys mantle of that peculiar green and it struck me that some farmers wife had been aping little julias  where  when cried rosamond  they passed us trying to find a place  i did not show it to you for you were talking to those gentlemen  did you see it brown asked julius going towards the coachman our baby and nurse i mean  i cant tell about miss charnock sir said the coachman but i did think i remarked two young females with young gadley in a tax cart  i would not be alarmed sir nor my lady he added with the freedom of a confidential servant who like all the household adored lady rosamond  it was a giddy thing in the young woman to have done and no place to take the young lady to  but therethere were more infants there than a man could count and it stands to reason they come to no harm  the most sensible thing that has been said yet muttered the friend but rosamond was by no means pacified  gadleys cart theyll go to that horrid publichouse in water lane where theres typhus and diphtheria and everything and theres this fogand that girl will never wrap her up  oh why did i ever go  my dear rose said julius trying to speak with masculine composure this is nonsense  depend upon it emma is only anxious to get her home  i dont know i dont know  if she could take her to the races she would be capable of taking her anywhere  they all go and drink at that beershop and catchjulius the pony carriage  oh its gone  yes said julius in explanation  she sent betty reynolds into wilsbro in it  get in rosamond cried cecil we will drive back till we find her  but this was more than a good coachman could permit for his horses sake and brown declared they must be fed and rested before the ball  cecil was ready to give up the ball but still they could not be taken back at once and rosamond had by this time turned as if setting her face to walk at once to the raceground until she found her child when raymond said rose would you be afraid to trust to king coal and me  i would put him in at once and drive you till you find julia  oh  raymond how good you are  the coachman glad of this solution only waited to pick up anne and hurried on his horses while the bachelor friend could not help grunting a little and observing that it was plain there was only one child in the family and that he would take any bet it was at home all right long before poynsett reached the parsonage  maybe so said raymond but i would do anything rather than leave her mother in the distress you take so easily  besides theres every chance of her being taken to that low publichouse said cecil  one that mr poynsett would not allow our servants to go to during the bazaar though it is close to the townhall and all the others did  let us hope that early influence may prevent contamination solemnly said the friend  cecil turned from him  i still hope she may be at home she said it is getting very chill and foggy  raymond i hope you may not have to go  you must lie down and get thoroughly rested he said as he helped her out and only waiting to equip himself for the evening dance he hurried to the stables to expedite the harnessing of the powerful and fiery steed which had as yet been only experimentally driven by himself and the coachman  rosamond was watching and when king coal was with difficulty pulled up she made but one spring to the seat of the dogcart and julius who was tucking in the rug had to leap back to save his foot so instantaneous was the dash forward  they went like the wind rosamond not caring to speak and raymond had quite enough on his hands to be glad not to be required to talk while he steered through the numerous vehicles they met and she scanned them anxiously for the outline of emmas hat  at last they reached wilsbro where as they came to the entrance of water lane rosamond through the hazy gaslight declared that she saw a tax cart at the door of the three pigeons and raymond albeit uncertain whether it were the taxcart could only turn down the lane at her bidding with difficulty preventing king coal from running his nose into the vehicle  something like an infants cry was heard through the open door and before he knew what she was about rosamond was on the pavement and had rushed into the house and while he was signing to a man to take the horses head she was out again the gaslight catching her eyes so that they glared like a tigresss her child in her arms and a whole babel of explaining tongues behind her  how she did it neither she nor raymond ever knew but in a second she had flown to her perch saying hoarsely drive me to dr worths  they were drugging her  i dont know whether i was in time  no not a wordthis to those behind never let me see any of you again  king coal prevented all further words of explanation by dancing round so that raymond was rejoiced at finding that nobody was run over  they were off again instantly while rosamond vehemently clasped the child which was sobbing out a feeble sound as if quite spent with crying but without which the mother seemed dissatisfied for she moved the poor little thing about if it ceased for a moment they were soon within dr worths iron gates where raymond could give the horse to a servant help his sisterinlaw down and speak for her for at first she only held up the phial she had clutched and gazed at the doctor speechlessly  he looked well both at the bottle and the baby while raymond spoke and then said are you sure she took any lady rosamond  quite quite sure cried rosamond  the spoon was at her lips the dear little helpless darling  well then said the doctor dryly it only remains to be proved whether an aristocratic baby can bear popular treatment  i dare say some hundred unlucky infants have been lugged out to the racecourse today and come back squalling their hearts out with fatigue and hunger and ill be bound that ninetenths are lulled with this very sedative and will be none the worse  then you do not think it will hurt her  so far from it that under the circumstances it was the best thing she could have  she has plainly been exhausted and though i would not exactly recommend the practice in your nursery i doubt if she could have taken nourishment till she had been composed  she will sleep for an hour or two and by that time you can get her home and feed her as usual  i should be more anxious about lady rosamond herself he added turning to raymond  she looks completely worn out  let me order you a basin of soup  but rosamond would not hear of it she must get baby home directly raymond advised a fly but it was recollected that none was attainable between the races and the ball so the little one was muffled in shawls and cloaks almost to suffocation and the doctor forced a glass of wine on her mother and promised to look in the next day  still they had a delay at the door caused by the penitent emma and her aunt bent on telling how far they had been from intending any harm how emma when carrying the baby out had been overpersuaded by the cousins she had never disappointed before how they had faithfully promised to take her home early long before my ladys return how she had taken babys bottle but how it had got broken how impossible it had been to move off the ground in the throng and how the poor babys inconsolable cries had caused the young nurse to turn aside to see whether her aunt could find anything to prevent her from screaming herself into convulsions  nothing but the most determined volubility on mrs gadleys part could have poured this into the ears of raymond rosamond either could not or would not heed pushed forward past the weeping emma and pulled away her dress with a shudder when there was an attempt to draw her back and make her listen  dont girl said raymond  dont you see that lady rosamond cant attend to you  if you have anything to say you must come another time  youve done quite enough mischief for the present  yes said the doctor tell your brother to put them both to bed and keep them quiet  i should like to prescribe the same for you mr poynsett you dont look the thing and i suppose you are going to take the ball by way of remedy  raymond thanked the doctor but was too much employed in enveloping his passengers to make further reply  it was quite dark and the fog had turned to misty rain soft and still but all pervading and rosamond found it impossible to hold up an umbrella as well as to guard the baby who was the only passenger not soaked and dripping by the time they were among the lighted windows of the village  oh raymond  raymond she then said in a husky dreamy voice how good and kind you have been  i know there was something that would make you very very glad  is there he said  i have not met with anything to make me glad for a long time past  and i dont seem able to recollect what it was or even if i ought to tell said rosamond in the same faint bewildered voice which made raymond very glad they were at the gate where stood julius  but before rosamond would descend into her husbands arms she opened all her childs mufflings saying kiss her kiss her raymondhow she shall love you  and when he had obeyed and rosamond had handed the little one down to her father she pressed her own wet cheek against his dripping beard and moustache and exclaimed ill never forget your goodness  have you got her safe julius  ill never never go anywhere again      chapter xxv the pebbles   o no no no tis true  here take this too it is a basilisk unto mine eye kills me to look ont  let there be no honour where there is beauty truth where semblance love where theres another mancymbeline  when julius according to custom opened his study shutters at halfpast six to a bright sunrise his eldest brother stood before the window  well how are they he said  all right thank you the child woke had some food and slept well and naturally after it and rose has been quite comfortable and at rest since midnight  you saved us from a great deal raymond  ah with a sound of deep relief may julia only turn out as sweet a piece of womanhood as her mother  julius i never understood half what that dear wife of yours was till yesterday  i was forced to cut our gratitude very short said julius laying his hand on his brothers shoulder  you know ive always taken your kindness as a matter of course  i should think so said raymond the more moved of the two  i tell you julius that rosamond was to me the only redeeming element in the day  i wanted to know whether you could walk with me to ask after that poor girl i hear she came home one with her grandmother  gladly said julius  i ought to have gone last night but what with rose and the baby and terry i am afraid i forgot everything  he disappeared and presently issued from the front door in his broad hat while raymond inquired for terry  he is asleep now but he has been very restless and there is something about him i dont like  did not worth say he would come and look at the baby  yes but chiefly to pacify rosamond about whom he was the most uneasy  she is quite herself now but you look overdone raymond  have you had any sleep  i have not lain down  when we came home at four oclock cecil was quite knocked up excited and hysterical  her maid advised me to leave her to her so i took a bath and came down to wait for you  julius would have liked to see the maid who could have soothed his rosamond last night without him  he only said however is frank come down  my mother rather expected him  yes he came to the raceground  indeed  he was not with you when you came back or were we not sufficiently rational to see him  duncombe gave a dinner at the hotel and carried him off to it im mortally afraid theres something amiss in that quarter  what didnt you know that duncombes filly failed  no indeed i did not  the town was ringing with it  beaten outandout by fair phyllida a beast that took them all by surprisenothing to look atbut causing i fancy a good deal of distress  they say the duncombes will be done for  i only wish frank was clear but that unhappy engagement has thrown him in with sir harrys set and he was with them all dayhardly spoke to me  to a fellow like him a veteran scamp like old vivian with his benignant looks is ten times more dangerous than men of his own age  however having done the damage they seem to have thrown him off  miss vivian would not speak to him at the ball  eleonora  i dont know how to think it  what you cannot think a vivian can do and does said raymond bitterly  my belief is that he was decoyed into being fleeced by the father and now they have done their worst he is cast off  he came home with us but sat outside and i could not get a word out of him  i hope my mother may  if he be not too far gone for her  i always did expect some such termination but not with this addition  i dont understand it nowlena  i only wonder at your surprise  the girl has been estranged from us all for a long time  if it is at an end so much the better  i only wish we were none of us ever to see the face of one of them again  julius knew from his wife that there were hopes for raymond but of course he might not speak and he was revolving these words which had a vehemence unlike the wont of the speaker when he was startled by raymonds saying julius you were right  i have come to the conclusion that no consideration shall ever make me sanction races again  i am glad began julius  you would not be glad if you had seen all i saw yesterday  you must have lent me your eyes for when you spoke before of the evils i thought you had picked up a utopian notion and were running a muck with it like an enthusiastic young clergyman  for my own part i cant say i ever came across anything offensive  of course i know where to find it as one does wherever one goes but there was no call to run after it and as we were used to the affair it was a mere matter of society  no it could never be any temptation to you said julius  no nor to any other reasonable man and i should add though perhaps you might not allow it that so long as a man keeps within his means he has a right to enhance his excitement and amusement by bets  umph  he has a right then to tempt others to their ruin and create a class of speculators who live by gambling  you need not go on trying to demolish me  i was going to say that i had only thought of the demoralization from the betting side but yesterday it was as if you had fascinated my eyes to look behind the scenes  i could not move a step without falling on something abominable  roughs with every passion up to feverpitch ferocity barely kept down by fear of the police gambling everywhere innocent young things looking on at coarseness as part of the humour of the day foul language swarms of vagabond creatures whose trade is to minister to the license of such occasions  i declare that your wife was the only being i saw display a spark of any sentiment human nature need not blush for  nay raymond i begin to wonder whose is the exaggerated feeling now  you were not there was the answer and they were here interrupted by crossing the path of the policeman evidently full of an official communication  i did not expect to see you so early sir he said  i was coming to the hall to report to you after i had been in to the superintendent  what is it  there has been a burglary at mrs hornblowers sir  if you please sir to julius when is the reverend mr bowater expected home  not before monday  is anything of his taken  yes sir  a glass case has been broken open and a silver cup and oar prizes for sports at college i believe have been abstracted also the money from the till below and i am sorry to say young hornblower is absconded and suspicion lies heavy on him  they do say the young man staked heavily on that mare of captain duncombes  you had better go on to the superintendent now said raymond you can come to me for a summons if you can find any traces  poor mrs hornblower what horror for her and poor herbert too who would acutely feel this ingratitude  the blackness of it was beyond what julius thought probable in the lad and the discussion of it occupied the brothers till they reached the reynolds colony where they were received by the daughterinlaw a much more civilized person than old betty  after fannys dislocated arm had been set the surgeon had sent her home in the rectory carriage saying there was so much fever in wilsbro that she would be likely to recover better at home but she had been suffering and feverish all night and dan reynolds was now gone in quest of drake for whom she had been calling all night  is he her husband asked julius  well i dont know sir leastways granny says he ought to be answerable for whats required  mrs reynolds further betrayed that the family had not been ignorant of fannys career since she had run away from home leaving her child on her grandmothers hands  she had made her home in one of the yellow vans which circulate between fairs and races driving an ostensible trade in cheap toys but really existing by setting up games which were in fact forms of gambling according to the taste of the people and the toleration of the police  from time to time she had appeared at home late in the evening with small sums of money and presents for her boy and mrs dan believed that she thought herself as good as married to that there drake  she was reported to be asleep and the place all of a caddle and julius promised to call later in the day  yes sir said mrs reynolds it would be a right good thing poor girl  sheve a kind heart they all do say not as i know not coming here till she was gone nor wanting to know much on her for twas a right bad way she was in and twere well if them nasty races were put down by act of parliament for they be the very ruin of the girls in these parts  theres a new suggestion raymond said julius as he shut the garden gate  raymond was long in answering and when he spoke it was to say i shall withdraw from the subscription to the wilsbro cup  so much the better  then raymond began discussing the terms of the letter in which he would state his reasons but with an amount of excitement that made julius say i should think it better not to write in this first heat  it will take more effect if it is not so visibly done on the spur of the moment  but the usually deliberate raymond exclaimed i cannot rest till it is done  i feel as if i must be like lady macbeth continually washing my hands of all this wreck and ruin  no wonder but i should think there was great need of cautionto use your own words  my seat must go if this is to be the price said raymond  i felt through all the speeches at that giltgingerbread place that it was a monument of my truckling to expediency  we began the whole thing at the wrong end and i fear we are beginning to see the effects  do you mean that you are anxious about that fever in water lane  there was an oppressive sickly air about everything strongest at the ball  i cant forget it said raymond taking off his hat so that the morning air might play about his temples  we talked about meddling women but the truth was that they were shaming us by doing what they could  i hope others will see it so  is not whitlock to be mayor next time  yes  he may do something  well they will hardly unseat me  i should not like to see moy in my place and it would be a sore thing for my mother but he continued in the same strange dreamy manner everything has turned out so wretchedly that i hardly know or care how it goes  my dear old fellow  raymond had stopped to lean over a gate where he could look up to the old red house in the green park set in brightlytinted trees all aglow in the morning sunshine  tears had sprung on his cheeks and a suppressed sob heaved his chest  julius ventured to say perhaps there may yet be a change of mind  no was the answer  in the present situation there is nothing for it but to sacrifice my last shred of peace to the one who has the chief rightin a certain way  they walked on and he hardly spoke again till as they reached the rectory julius persuaded him to come in and have a cup of tea and though he said he must go back and see his friend off he could not withstand the sight of rosamond at the window fresh and smiling with her child in her arms  not a bit the worse for her dissipation she merrily said  oh the naughty little thingto have begun with the turf and then the three pigeons  arent you ashamed of her papa  sit down raymond how horribly tired you do look  ha  whats this exclaimed julius who had been opening the post bag  heres a note from the bishop desiring me to come to the palace today if possible  oh cried raymond  where is there vacantisnt there a canonry or a chaplaincy  or an archbishopric or two said julius  the pony can do it i think as there will be a long rest  if he seems fagged i can put up at backsworth and take a fly  youll let james drive you said rosamond  i had rather not said julius  it may be better to be alone  he is afraid of betraying his elevation to james laughed rosamond  mrs daniel reynolds to see you sir  this was with the information that that there trapezing chap drake had fetched off poor fanny in his van  he had been in trouble himself having been in custody for some misdemeanour when she was thrown down but as soon as he was released he had come in search of her and though at first he seemed willing to leave her to be nursed at home he had no sooner heard of the visitors of that morning than he had sworn he would have no parson meddling with his poor gal she was good enough for him and he would not have a pack of nonsense put in her head to set her against him  hes good to her sir said mrs reynolds i think he be but he is a very ignorant man  he telld us once as he was born in one of they vans and hadnt never been to school nor nothin nor heard tell of god save in the way of bad words  heve done nothin but go from one races and fairs to another just like the gipsies though he baint a gipsy neither but hes right down attacted to poor fanny and good to her  another product of the system said raymond  like the gleeman whom we see through a picturesque medium said julius but who could not have been pleasant to the mediaeval clergyman  i have hopes of poor fanny yet  she will drift home one of these days and we shall get hold of her  what a fellow you are for hoping returned raymond a little impatiently  why not said julius  why  i should say replied raymond setting out to walk home where he presided over his friends breakfast and departure and received a little banter over his solicitude for the precious infant  cecil was still in bed and frank was looking ghastly and moved and spoke like one in a dream raymond was relieved to hear him pleading with susan for to his mothers room much earlier than usual  susan took pity and let him in when at once he flung himself into a chair with his face hidden on the bed and exclaimed mother it is all over with me  my dear boy what can have happened  mother you remember those two red pebbles  could you believe that she has sold hers  are you sure she has  i heard that they had a collection of such things from the lapidary at rockpier  no mother that is no explanation  when i found that i should be able to come down i sent a card to lady tyrrell saying i would meet them on the racegrounda postcard so that lena might see it  when i came there was no lena only some excuse about resting for the balllying down with a bad headache and so forthmaking it plain that i need not go on to sirenwood  by and by there was some mild betting with the ladies and lady tyrrell said theres a chance for you bee dont i see the very fellow to connys charm whereupon that girl conny pulled out the very stone i gave lena three years ago at rockpier  i asked yes i askedlena had sold it lena at the bazaar lena who  stay frank is this trusting lena as she bade you trust her  how do you know that there were no other such pebbles  you have not seen her as i have done  there has been a gradual alienationholding aloof from us and throwing herself into the arms of those strangeways  it is no fault of her sisters  she has lamented it to me  or pointed it out  did she know the history of these pebbles  no one did  lena was above all reserved with her  camilla tyrrell knows a good deal more than she is told  wheres your pebble  you did not stake that  those who had one were welcome to the other  o my poor foolish frank  may it not be gone to tell the same tale of you that you think was told of her  is this all  would that it were  well go on my dear  was she at the ball  surrounded by all that set  i was long in getting near her and then she said her card was full and when i made some desperate entreaty she said in an undertone that stabbed me by its very calmness after what has passed today the less we meet the better  and she moved away so as to cut me off from another word  after what had passed  was it the parting with the stone  not only  i got a few words with lady tyrrell  she told me that early impressions had given lena a kind of fanatical horror of betting and that she had long ago made a sort of vow against a betting man  lady tyrrell said she had laughed at it but had no notion it was seriously meant and ii never even heard of it  nor are you a betting man my frank  ay mother you have not heard all  you are not in a scrape my boy  yes i am  you see i lost my head after the pebble transaction  i couldnt stand small talk or bear to go near raymond so i got among some other fellows with sir harry  and excitement and distress led you on  i dont know what came over me  i could not stand still for fear i should feel  i must be mad on something  then that mare of duncombes poor fellow seemed a personal affair to us all and sir harry and a few other knowing old hands went working one up till betting higher and higher seemed the only way of supporting duncombe besides relieving ones feelings  i know it was being no end of a fool but you havent felt it mother  and sir harry took your bets  one must fare and fare alike said frank  how much have you lost  ive lost lena thats all i know said the poor boy but he produced his book and the sum appalled him  mother he said in a broken voice theres no fear of its happening again  i can never feel like this again  i know it is the first time one of your sons has served you so and i cant even talk of sorrow it seems all swallowed up in the other matter  but if you will help me to meet it i will pay you back ten or twenty pounds every quarter  i think i can frankie  i had something in hand towards my own possible flitting  here is the key of my desk  bring me my bankers book and my cheque book  mother mother he cried catching her hand and kissing it what a mother you are  you understand she said that it is because i believe you were not master of yourself and that this is the exception not the habit that i am willing to do all i can for you  the habit  no indeed  i never staked more than a box of gloves before but whats the good if she has made a vow against me  mrs poynsett was silent for a few moments then she said my poor boy i believe you are both victims of a plot  i suspect that camilla tyrrell purposely let you see that pebbletoken and be goaded into gambling that she might have a story to tell her sister when she had failed to shake her constancy and principle in any other way  mother that would make her out a fiend  she has been my good and candid friend all along  you dont know her  what would a friend have done by you yesterday  she neither saw nor heard my madness  no mother lenores heart has been going from me for months past and she is glad of this plea for release believing me unworthy  oh that stern face of hers set like a head of justice with not a shade of pityso beautiful so terrible  it will never cease to haunt me  he sat in deep despondency while mrs poynsett overlooked her resources but presently he started up saying theres one shadow of a hope  ill go over to sirenwood insist on seeing one her and having an explanation  i have a right whatever i did yesterday and you have forgiven me for that mother  i think it is the most hopeful way  if you can see her without interposition you will at least come to an understanding  here you had better take this cheque for sir harry  when he was gone she wondered whether she had been justified in encouraging him in defending eleonora  was this not too like another form of the treatment raymond had experienced  her heart bled for her boy and she was ready to cry aloud must that woman always be the destroyer of my sons peace  when frank returned it was with a face that appalled her by its blank despair as he again flung himself down beside her  she is gone he said  gone  gone and with the strangeways  i saw her  spoke to her  oh no  the carriage turned the corner as i crossed the road  the two girls were there and she  going with them to the station  i thought so i went to the house meaning to leave my enclosure for sir harry and meet her on her way back but i heard she was gone to stay with lady susan in yorkshire  sir harry was not up nor lady tyrrell  mrs poynsetts hope failed though she was relieved that camillas tongue had not been in action  she was dismayed at the prone exhausted manner in which frank lay partly on the floor partly against her couch with his face hidden  do you know where she is gone  yes revelrig cleveland yorkshire  i will write to her  whatever may be her intentions they shall not be carried out under any misrepresentation that i can contradict  you have been a foolish fellow frankie but you shall not be painted worse than you are  she owes you an explanation and i will do my best that you shall have it  my dear what is the matter  she rang her bell hastily and upheld the sinking head till help came  he had not lost consciousness and called it giddiness and he was convicted of having never gone to bed last night and having eaten nothing that morning but he turned against the wine and soup with which they tried to dose him and looking crushed and bewildered said he would go and lie down in his own room  raymond went up with him and returned saying he only wanted to be alone with his face from the light and mrs poynsett gazing at her eldest son thought he looked as ill and sunken as his younger brother      chapter xxvi a stickit minister   and the boy not out of himtennysons queen mary  julius had only too well divined the cause of his summons  he found herbert bowaters papers on the table before the bishop and there was no denying that they showed a declension since last year and that though from men without his advantages they would have been passable yet from him they were evidences of neglect of study and thought  nor could the cause be ignored by any one who had kept an eye on the cricket reports in the county paper but herbert was such a nice hearty innocent fellow and his father was so much respected that it was with great reluctance that his rejection was decided on and his rector had been sent for in case there should be any cause for extenuation  julius could not say there was  he was greatly grieved and personally ashamed but he could plead nothing but his own failure to influence the young man enough to keep him out of a rage for amusement of which the quantity not the quality was the evil  so poor herbert was sent for to hear his fate and came back looking stunned  he hardly spoke till they were in the fly that julius had brought from backsworth and then the untamed schoolboy broke forth  what are you doing with me  i say i cant go back to compton like a dog in a string  where will you go  i dont care  to jericho at once out of the way of every one  i tell you what rector it was the most ridiculous examination i ever went up for and im not the only man that says so  there was rivers of st marys at backsworthhe says the questions were perfectly unreasonable and what no one could be prepared for  this fellow danvers is a new hand and they are always worst setting one a lot of subjects of no possible use but to catch one out  i should like to ask him now what living soul at compton he expects to be the better for my views on the right reading of  julius interrupted the passionate tones at the lodge by saying if you wish to go to jericho you must give directions  herbert gave something between a laugh and a growl  i left the pony at backsworth  will you come with me to strawyers and wait in the park till i send jenny out to you  no i say  i know my father will be in a greater rage than he ever was in his life and i wont go sneaking about  id like to go to london to some hole where no one would ever hear of me  if i were not in orders already id be off to the ivoryhunters in africa and never be heard of more  if this was to be i wish they had found it out a year ago and then i should not have been bound continued the poor young fellow in his simplicity thinking his thoughts aloud and his sweet candid nature beginning to recover its balance  now im the most wretched fellow going  i know what ive undertaken  its not your fault nor poor joannas  youve all been at me but it only made me worse  what could my father be thinking of to make a parson of a fellow like me  well i must face it out sooner or later at compton and i had better do it there than at home even if my father would have me  i must go to strawyers  the bishop gave me a letter for your father and i think it will break it a little for your mother would you wait for me at rood house  you could go into the chapel and if they wish for you i could return and fetch you  herbert caught at this as a relief and orders were given accordingly  it seemed a cruel moment to tell him of young hornblowers evasion and robbery but the police wanted the description of the articles and in fact nothing would have so brought home to him that though compton might not appreciate minutiae of greek criticism yet the habit of diligence of which it was the test might make a difference there  the lingering self justification was swept away by the sense of the harm his pleasure seeking had done to the lad whom he had once influenced  he had been fond and proud of his trophies but he scarcely wasted a thought on them so absorbed was he in the thought of how he had lorded it over the youth with that late rebuke  the blame he had refused to take on himself then came full upon him now and he reproached himself too much to be angered at the treachery and ingratitude  i cant prosecute he said when julius asked for the description he had promised to procure  we must judge whether it would be true kindness to refrain if he is captured said julius  i had not time to see his mother but rosamond will do what she can for her poor woman  how shall i meet her sighed herbert and so they arrived at the tranquil little hospital and passed under the deep archway into the gray quadrangle bright with autumn flowers and so to the chapel as they advanced up the solemn and beautiful aisle herbert dropped on his knees with his hands over his face  julius knelt beside him for a moment laid his hand on the curly brown hair whispered a prayer and a blessing and then left him but ere reaching the door the low choked sobs of anguish of heart could be heard  a few steps more and in the broad walk along the quadrangle julius met the frail bowed figure with his saintly face that seemed to have come out of some sacred bygone age  julius told his errand  if you could have seen him just now he said you would see how much more hope there is of him than of many who never technically fail but have not the same tender generous heart and free humility  yes many a priest might now be thankful if some check had come on him  and if he had met it with this freedom from bitterness  and it would be a great kindness to keep him here a day or two  apart from being with you the showing himself at compton or at strawyers on sunday would be hard on him  i will ask him  i will gladly have him here as long as the quiet may be good for him  my nephew william will be here till the end of the long vacation but i must go to st faiths on monday to conduct the retreat  i leave him in your hands then and will call as i return to see what is settled and report what his family wish  i grieve more for them than for himself  julius first encountered jenny bowater in the village making farewell calls  he stopped the carriage and joined her and not a word was needed to tell her that something was amiss  you have come to tell us something she said  herbert has failed  prayers are sometimes answered as we do not expect said julius i believe it will be the making of him  oh but how will mamma ever bear it cried jenny  we must remind her that it is only a matter of delay not rejection said julius  have you seen him  yes the bishop sent for me and asked me to see your father  it was partly from slips in critical knowledge which betrayed the want of study and the general want of thought and progress and all the rest of it in his papers  just the fact  yes which a man of less reality and more superficial quickness might have concealed by mere intellectual answers though it might have been much worse for him in the end  where is he  at rood house  unless your mother wishes for him here he had better stay there till he can bear to come among us again  much better indeed said jenny  i only hope papa and mamma will see how good it is for him to be there  o julius if he is taking it in such a spirit i can think it all right for him but for them for them it is very hard to bear  nothing ever went wrong with the boys before and herbertmammas darling  her eyes were full of tears  i wish he had had a better rector said julius  no dont say that  it was not your fault  i cannot tell  an older man or more truly a holier man might have had more influence  we were all in a sort of laissezaller state this autumn and now comes the reckoning  theres papa said jenny  had you rather go to him alone or can i do any good  i think i will go alone said julius  mr bowater who had grown up in a day when examinations were much less earnest matters never guessed what brought julius over but simply thought he had come to wish them goodbye then believed in any accident rather than in failure and finally was exceedingly angry and stormed hotly first at examinations and modern bishops then at cricket and fine ladies then at julius for not having looked after the lad better and when this was meekly accepted indignation took a juster direction and herberts folly and idleness were severely lashed more severely than julius thought they quite deserved but a word of pleading only made it worse  have him home to take leave  no indeed mr bowater hoped he knew his duty better as father of a family when a young man had publicly disgraced himself  ill tell you what julius charnock if you wish him to forget all the little impression it may have made and be ready to run after any amount of folly youd make me have him home to be petted and cried over by his mother and sisters  he has been their spoilt pet too long and i wont have him spoilt now ill not see him till he has worked enough to show whether theres any real stuff in him  mr bowater never even asked where his son was probably taking it for granted that he was gone back to compton nor did julius see jenny again as she was trying to comfort her mother under the dreadful certainty that poor dear herbert was most cruelly treated and that the examining chaplain came of a bad stock and always had had a dislike to the family  it was to be hoped that mr bowater would keep to his wise resolution and not send for herbert for nothing could be worse for him than the sympathy he would have met with from her  what with looking in to report at rood house and finding herbert most grateful for leave to remain there for a few days julius did not reach home till long after dark  pleasantly did the light greet him from the open doorway where his rosamond was standing  she sprang at once into his arms as if he had been absent a month and cried here you are safe at last  then as she pulled off his wraps how tired you must be  have you had any food  noits all ready and he could see high tea spread and lighted by the first fire of the season  come and begin  what without washing my hands  you are to do that in the study it is all ready  he did not exactly see why he should be too tired to mount to his dressing room but he obeyed not ungratefully and his chair was ready his plate heaped with partridge and his tumbler filled with ale almost before his eyes had recovered the glare of light  the eagerness and flutter of rosamonds manner began to make him anxious and he began for the third time the inquiries she had always cut shortbaby all right  terry better  babyoh yes a greater duck than ever  i put her to bed myself and she was quite delicious  eat i say go on  not unless you eat that other wing  ill help myself then  you go on  i dont see herbert so i suppose it is all right  wheres your canonry  alas poor herbert is plucked  i had to go round by strawyers to tell them  plucked  i never heard of such a thing  i think it is a great shame such a nice honest fellow should be so illused and when all his pretty things have been stolen too  do you know theyve taken up young hornblower but his friends have made off with the things and they say they are in the meltingpot by this time and theres no chance of recovering them  i dont think he cares much now poor fellow  did you see mrs hornblower  no by the time i could get my hat on she had heard it poor thing and was gone to backsworth for hes there in the county gaol was taken at the station i believe i dont half understand it  her manner was indeed strange and flighty and though she recurred to questions about the ordination and the bowaters julius perceived that she was forcing her attention to the answers as if trying to stave off his inquiries and he came to closer quarters  how is terry  has dr worth been here  yes but not till very late  he says he never was so busy  rosamond what is it  what did he say of terry  he saidshe drew a long breathhe says it is the water lane fever  terry my dear  she held him down with a hand on his shoulder  be quiet  finish your dinner  dr worth said the great point was to keep strong and not be overdone nor to go into infected air tired and hungry  i would not have let you come in if there had been any help for it and now ill not have you go near him till youve made a good meal  you must do the same then  there eat that slice or i wont and as she allowed him to place it on her plate what does he call it not typhus  he cant tell yet he does not know whether it is infectious or only epidemic and when he heard how the dear boy had been for days past at the exhibition at the townhall and drinking lots of iced water on saturday he seemed to think it quite accounted for  he says there is no reason that in this good air he should not do very well but oh julius i wish i had kept him from that horrid place they left him in my charge  there is no reason to distress yourself about that my rose  he was innocently occupied and there was no cause to expect harm theres all good hope for him with gods blessing  who is with him now  cook is there now  both the maids were so kind and hearty declaring they would do anything and were not afraid and i can manage very well with their help  you know papa had a low fever at montreal and mamma and i nursed him through it so i know pretty well what to do  but how about the baby  emma came back before the doctor came crying piteously poor child as if she had had a sufficient lesson so i said she might stay her month on her good behaviour and now we could not send her out of the house  i have brought the nursery down to the spare room and in the large attic with plenty of disinfecting fluid we can as the doctor said isolate the fever  he is quiet and sleepy and i do not think it will be hard to manage if you will only be good and conformable  i dont promise if that means that you are to do everything and i nothing  when did worth see him  not till five oclock  and he would not have come at all if anne had not sent in some one from the hall when she saw how anxious i was  he would not have come otherwise he is so horribly busy with lots of cases at wilsboro  now if you have done you may come and see my boy  julius did see a flushed sleeping face that did not waken at his entrance and as his wife settled herself for her watch he felt as if he could not leave her after such a day as she had had but an indefinable apprehension made him ask whether she would spare him to run up to the hall to see his mother and ask after raymond whose looks had haunted him all day  she saw he would not rest otherwise and did not show how unwilling was her consent for though she knew little her mind misgave her  he made his way into the hall by the back door and found his mother still in the drawingroom and raymond dozing in the large armchair by the fire  mrs poynsett gave a warning look as julius bent over her but raymond only opened his eyes with a dreamy gaze without speaking  why mother where are the rest  poor franki hope it is only the shock and fatigue but dr worth wished him to be kept as quiet as possible  he cant bear to see any one in the room so that good anne said she would sit in charlies room close by  then he is really ill said julius  he nearly fainted after walking over to sirenwood in vain  i dont understand it  theres something very wrong there which seems perfectly to have crushed him  ill go up and see him said julius  you both of you look as if you ought to be in bed  how is cecil raymond  quite knocked up he sleepily answered  heres susan mother  susan must have been waiting till she heard voices to carry off her mistress  raymond pushed her chair into her room bent over her with extra tenderness bade her good night and when julius had done the same they stood by the drawingroom fire together  ive been trying to write that letter julius said raymond but i never was so sleepy in my life and i cant get on with it  what letter  that letter  about the races  oh  that seems long ago  so it does said raymond in the same dreamy manner as if trying to shake something off  some years isnt it  i wanted it done somehow  i would sit down to it now only i have fallen asleep a dozen times over it already  not very good for composition said julius alarmed by something indefinable in his brothers look and by his manner of insisting on what was by no means urgent  come put it out of your head and go to bed  how did you find the boy terry asked raymond again as if in his sleep  i scarcely saw him  he was asleep  and worth calls it  the same fever as in water lane  i thought so  we are in for it said raymond now quite awake he did not choose to say so to my mother but i gathered it from his orders  but frank only came down yesterday  frank was knocked down and predisposed by the treatment he met with poor boy  they say he drank quarts of iced things at the dinner and ball and ate nothing  this may be only the effect of the shock but his head is burning and there is a disposition to wander  however he has had his coup de grace and that may account for it  it is cecil  cecil  cecil poor child  she has been constantly in that pestiferous place  all worth would say was that she must be kept quiet and cool but he has sent the same draughts for all three  i saw for terrys came here  i fancy worth spoke out plainly to that maid of cecils grindstone but she only looks bitter at me says she can attend to her mistress and has kept me out of the room all day but i will go in tonight before i go to bed added raymond energetically  you are ready to laugh at me julius  no one has meddled between you and rosamond  thank god no cried julius  friend abroad or you may leave out the r said raymond maid at home  what chance have i ever had  ill tell you what i should do raymond said julius turn out the maid keep the field nurse her myself  yes said raymond thats all very well ifif you havent got the fever yourself  there you need say nothing about it nobody would be of any use to me tonight and it may be only that i am dead beat  but there was something about his eyes and his heavy breath which confirmed his words and julius could only say my dear raymond  it serves us right does not it said his brother smiling  i only wish it had not fixed on the one person who tried to do good  if i could only stay with you but i must tell rosamond first  no indeed  i want no one tonight no one after that youll look after my mother thats the great thing  he spoke steadily but his hand trembled so that he could not light his candle and julius was obliged to do it saying wistfully ill come up the first thing in the morning and see how you are  do and if there is need you will tell my mother  a nights rest may set me right but i have not felt well these three or four days i shall be in my own old room  he leant heavily on the balusters but would not take his brothers arm  he passed into his dressingroom and thus to the open door of the room where he heard his wifes voice and as mrs grindstone came forward to warn him off he said she is awake  yes sir but she must not be excited  raymond  how are you now he asked coming up to the bed  oh it is very hot and heavy said cecil wearily putting her hand into his im aching all over  poor child he said softly  she lifted her eyes to his face  i wanted to tell you all day she said  didnt you come to the door  many times my dear  and now oh dear  i dont recollect  dont go please  he sat down by her she held his hand and dozed again  you had best leave her now sir said the maid she will only go on in this way and i can tend her  he would have given a great deal to have been sure that he could hold up his head ten minutes longer and to venture to send the woman away  cecil muttered stay and he sat on till her sleep seemed deeper and he felt as if a few moments more might disable him from crossing the room but his first movement again made her say dont  mr poynsett cannot stay maam said grindstone in a persuasive tone  he is very tired and not well and you would not wish to keep him  give me a kiss she said like a tired child  it was not like the shy embrace with which they had sometimes met and parted but he knew he must not rouse her and only said very low good night my poor dear god bless you and grant us a happy meeting whenever it is  tears were flowing down his cheeks when julius presently came to him again and only left him when settled for the night     chapter xxvii the water lane fever   the water lane fever  people called it so as blinking its real name but it was not the less true that it was a very pestilence in the lower parts of wilsbro and was prostrating its victims far and wide among the gentry who had resorted to the townhall within the last few weeks  cases had long been smouldering among the poor and the workmen employed and several of these were terminating fatally just as the outbreak was becoming decisive  on monday morning julius returned from visits to his brothers to find a piteous note from mrs fuller entreating him to undertake two funerals  her husband had broken down on sunday morning and was very ill and mr driver had merely read the services and then joined his pupils whom he had sent away to the seaside  he had never been responsible for pastoral care and in justice to them could not undertake it now  those streets are in a dreadful state wrote the poor lady several people dying and there is such a panic in the neighbourhood that we know not where to turn for help  if you could fix an hour we would let the people know  the doctor insists on the funerals being immediate  julius was standing in the porch reading this letter and thinking what hour he could best spare from nearer claims when he heard the gate swing and beheld his junior curate with a very subdued and sobered face asking is it true  that the fever is here  yes it is  and very bad  poor frank is our worst case as yet  he is constantly delirious the others are generally sensible except that terry is dreadfully haunted with mathematics  then it is all true about the hall  any one else ill  only the two willses  they were carousing at the three pigeons i hope that raymonds prohibition against that place may have been the saving of the hall servants  see here and he gave the note  i had better take those two funerals  i can at least do that said herbert  that driver must be a regular case of a hireling  he never professed that the sheep were his said julius  then ill go to the vicarage and get a list of the sick and see after them as far as i can said herbert in a grave humble tone showing better than a thousand words how he felt the deprivation he had brought on himself and as to shame or selfconsciousness the need had swallowed them all  it will be a great act of kindness herbert  the point of infection does not seem clear yet but i am afraid it will be a serious outbreak  i did not believe it could all be true when the report came to rood house but of course i came to hear the truth and see what i could do  how is mrs poynsett bearing up  bravely  anne contrived our carrying her upstairs and it is the greatest comfort to raymond to lie and look at her and susan looks after them both  then he cant be so very ill  not so acutely but there are symptoms that make worth anxious shall i give you a note for mrs fuller  do and put me at your disposal for all you can spare for or i can do  have you written to bindon  i dont know where within some hundred miles  but herbert i think we ought to undertake the help that is wanted at wilsbro smith of duddingstone is too weakly and poor old mr moulden neither could nor would  we are the nearest and having it here already do not run the risk of spreading it  as things are i cannot be very long away from home but i would come in for an hour or so every day if you could do the rest  yes that was what i meant said herbert  worth says the best protection is never to go among the sick hungry or exhausted  he says he keeps a biscuit in his pocket to eat before going into a sick house  i shall make rosamond keep you supplied and you must promise to use them  oh yes i promise  and never drink anything there  there is to be a public meeting tomorrow to see whether the cause of this outbreak is not traceable to the water down there  mrs duncombes meddling  dont judge without evidence  but it does seem as if the water at the well at pettitts houses had done much of the harm  terry was drinking it all that hot day and today we hear that lady tyrrell and two of the servants are ill besides poor little joe reynolds  it is very terrible said herbert  lady tyrrell did you say  yes  she was there constantly like raymonds wife  happily there is not much fear for your people herbert  your father was at the dinner but he is not a water drinker and jenny only just came to the bazaar that was all  edith happily gave up the ball  i know said herbert colouring  jenny persuaded her to give it up because ofme  oh how i have served them all  i told jenny that perhaps her ember prayers had been met in the true way  yes said herbert  i cant understand now how i could have been such an audacious fool as to present myself so coolly after the year i had spent  god forgive me for it  rector thank you for leaving me at rood house  it was like having ones eyes opened to a new life  i say do you know anything about harry hornblower  is he come home  yes  you wouldnt prosecute  happily i couldnt  the things were gone and could not be identified and there was nothing about him  so though they had me over to backsworth they could not fall foul of me for refusing to prosecute  have you seen him  no i tried but he had got out of my way  youve not been there seeing that herbert had brought back his bag  no i will not till i come back and as he took the note he added rector i do beg your pardon with all my might  then after a strong clasp of the hand he sped away with a long manful energetic stride which made julius contrast his volunteer courage with the flight of the man who if not pledged to pastoral care at wilsbro still had priestly vows upon him  julius had no scruples about risking this favourite home child  if he thought about it at all it was to rejoice that mrs bowater was safely gone for he had passed unscathed through scenes at st awdrys that would have made his mother tremble and he had little fear of contagion with reasonable care  of course the doctors had the usual debate whether the fever were infectious or epidemic but it made little difference  the local ones as well as an authority from london had an inspection previous to the meeting which took place in the school whose scholars were dispersed in the panic  no ladies were admitted  we have had enough of them quoted worshipful mayor truelove  mr briggs the exmayor was at the bedside of his son and there were hardly enough present to make decisions  the focus of the disease was in pettitts well  the water though cold clear and sparkling was affected by noxious gases from the drains and had become little better than poison the air was not much better and as several neighbouring houses some swarming with lodgers used this water the evil was accounted for  the three pigeons had been an attraction to the servants waiting with their ladies carriages during the entertainments and though they had not meddled much with the simple element spirits had not neutralized the mischief  thence too had come water for the tea and iced beverages used at the bazaar and ball  odours there had been in plenty from the untouched drainage of the other houses and these no doubt enhanced the evil but every one agreed that the bad management of the drains on mr pettitts property had been the main agency in the present outbreak  the poor little perfumer had tears of grief and indignation in his eyes but he defended his cause and shielded the ladies with chivalry worthy of his french ancestry  he said he had striven to do his duty as a proprietor and if other gentlemen had done the same and the channels could have had a free outlet this misfortune would never have occurred  he found himself backed up by mr julius charnock who rose to declare that what mr pettitt had said was just what his brother mr charnock poynsett had desired should be stated as his own opinion namely that the responsibility rested not with those who had done all within their power or knowledge for the welfare of their tenants but with those whose indifference on the score of health had led them to neglect all sanitary measures  he desires me to say added julius that being concerned both in the neglect and in the unfortunate consequences he is desirous to impress his opinion on all concerned  future prevention was no longer in the hands of the town council for a sanitary commission would take that in hand but in the meantime it was a time of plague and sickness and measures must be taken for the general relief  mr moy to whom most of the houses belonged was inquired for but it appeared that he had carried off his wife and daughter on saturday in terror when one of his servants had fallen ill and even his clerks would not know where to write to him till he should telegraph  the man gadley was meantime driving an active trade at the three pigeons whither the poor possessed with the notion that spirits kept out the infection were resorting more than ever and he set at defiance all the preventives which doctors overseer and relieving officer were trying to enforce with sullen oaths against interference  two deaths yesterday one today three hourly apprehended doctors incessantly occupied nurses however unfit not to be procured by any exertion of the halfmaddened relievingofficer breadwinners prostrated food wine bedding everything lacking  such was the state of things around the new townhall of wilsbro and the gentry around were absorbed by cases of the same epidemic in their own families  to telegraph for nurses from a hospital to set on foot a subscription appoint a committee of management and name a treasurer and dispenser of supplies were the most urgent steps julius suggested applying to a nursing sisterhood but mr truelove without imputing any motives to the reverend gentleman was unwilling to insert the thin end of the wedge so the telegram was sent to a london hospital and mr whitlock the mayorelect undertook to be treasurer and to print and circulate an appeal for supplies of all sorts  those present resolved themselves into a committee and consulted about a fever hospital since people could hardly be expected to recover in the present condition of water lane but nothing was at present ready and the question was adjourned to the next day  as julius parted with mr whitlock he met herbert bowater returning from the cemetery in search of him with tidings of some cases where he was especially needed  as they walked on together mrs duncombe overtook them with a basket on her arm  she held out her hand with an imploring gesture  mr charnock it cant be true can itthey only say so out of ignorancethat it was pettitts well i mean  in a few words julius made it clear what the evil had been and how it arose  she did not dispute it she merely grew sallower and said  god forgive us  we did it for the best  i planned  i never thought of that  oh  my brother insists that the mischief came of not following the example you set  and cecil  cecil is too much stupefied to know anything about it  you are helping here  make me all the use you can  whatever has to be done give it to me  nay you have your family to consider  my boys are at their grandmothers  my husband is gone abroad give me work  i have brought some wine  who needs it most  wine said herbert  here  i was going back for some but half an hour may make all the difference to the poor lad in here  mrs duncombe was within the door in a moment  there has been an execution in her house said herbert as they went home  that fellow went off on saturday and left her alone to face it  i thought she had striven to keep out of debt  what can a woman do when a man chooses to borrow  that horse brought them to more unexpected smash  they say that after the ball where she appeared in all her glory as if nothing had happened she made bob give her a schedule of his debts packed his portmanteau sent him off to find some cheap hole abroad and stayed to pick up the pieces after the wreck  she is a brave woman said julius  therewith they plunged into the abodes of misery where the only other helper at present was good old miss slater who was going from one to another trying to show helpless women how to nurse but able only to contribute infinitesimal grains of aid or comfort at immense cost to herself  julius insisted on taking home with him his curate who had been at work from ten oclock that morning till six when as julius resigned the ponys reins to him he begged that they might go round and inquire at sirenwood to which consent was the more willingly given because poor franks few gleams of consciousness were spent in sending his indefatigable nurse anne to ask whether his mother had had that letter and in his delirium he was always feeling his watchchain for that unhappy pebble and moaning when he missed it  mrs poynsetts letter had gone on friday and still there was no answer and this was a vexation adding to the fear that the poor fellows rejection had been final yet she might have missed the letter by being summoned home  close to the lodge they overtook sir harry riding dejectedly homewards and glad to be saved going up to the house they stopped and inquired for lady tyrrell  very low and oppressed he said  mvie does not give us reason to expect a change just yet  do they tell you the same  worth attends you i think  he seems to think it must run on for at least three weeks said julius  youve been to the meeting eh  was it that well of pettitts really that meddling wife of duncombes ought to be prosecuted  i hope shell catch the fever and be served out  she tried to prevent it said julius  pshaw women have no business with such things they only put their foot in it  nobody used to trouble themselves about drains and one never heard of fevers  instead of contesting the point julius asked whether miss vivian were at home  no thats the odd thing  i wrote for mvie has no fear of infection and poor camilla is always calling for her and that french maid has thought proper to fall ill and we dont know what to do  upper housemaid cut and run in a panic cook dead drunk last night not a servant in the house to be trusted  if it were not for my man victor i dont know where i should be  very odd what that child is about  lady susan cant be keeping it from her unjustifiable  she is with lady susan strangeways  yes  went with bee and conny  i was glad for we cant afford to despise a good match though i was sorry for your brother  do i understand you that she is engaged to mr strangeways  no no not yet  one always hears those things before they are true and you see they are keeping her from us as if she belonged to them already  i call it unfeeling  i have just been to the post to see if theres a letter  cant be anything wrong in the address revelrig cleveland yorkshire  why dont you telegraph  i shall if i dont hear tomorrow morning  but the mornings telegrams were baffling  none came in answer to sir harry though he had bidden his daughter to telegraph back instantly and two hospitals replied that they had no nurses to spare  this was the first thing julius heard when he came to the committeeroom  the second was that the only parish nurse had been found asleep under the influence of the portwine intended for her patients the third that there were five more deaths one being mrs gadley of the three pigeons from diphtheria and fourteen more cases of fever were reported  julius had already been with the schoolmistress who was not expected to live through the day  he had found that mrs duncombe had been up all night with one of the most miserable families and only when her unpractised hands had cared for a little corpse had been forced home by good miss slater for a little rest  he had also seen poor mr fuller who was too weak and wretched to say anything more than god help us charnock you will do what you can and when julius asked for his sanction to sending for sisters he answered anything anything  the few members who had come to the committee were reduced to the same despairing consent and julius was allowed to despatch a telegram to st faiths which had sent sisters in the emergency at st awdrys  he likewise brought an offer suggested by raymond of a great old tithe barn his own property but always rented by mrs poynsett in a solitary field where the uninfected children might be placed under good care and the houses in water lane thus relieved  as to a fever hospital raymond had sent his advice to use the new townhall itself  a word from him went a great way just then with the town council and the doctors were delighted with the proposal  funds and contributions of bedding clothing food and wine were coming in but hands were the difficulty  the adaptations of the townhall and the bringing in of beds were done by one strong carpenter and mrs duncombes man alexander whom she had brought with her and who proved an excellent orderly and the few who would consent or did not resist occupying the beds there were carried in by herbert bowater and a strapping young doctor who had come down for this fever pasture  there mrs duncombe and miss slater received them  no other volunteer had come to light willing to plunge into this perilous and disgusting abyss of misery and among the afflicted families the power of nursing was indeed small  however the healthy children were carried away without much resistance and established in the great barn under a trustworthy widow and before night two effectivelooking sisters were in charge at the hospital  still however no telegram no letter came from eleonora vivian mr mvie had found a nurse for lady tyrrell but old sir harry rode in to meet every delivery of the post and was half distracted at finding nothing from her and franks murmurs of her name were most piteous to those who feared that if he were ever clearly conscious again it would only be to know how heavy had been the meed of his folly      chapter xxviii the retreat   what dost thou here frail wanderer from thy taskchristian year  eleonora vivian was trying to fix her attention on writing out the meditation she had just heard from dr easterby  it had been a strange time  all externally was a great hush  there was perfect rest from the tumult of society and from the harassing state of tacit resistance habitual to her  this was the holy quietude for which she had longed yet where was the power to feel and profit by it  did not the peace without only make her hear the storm within all the more  a storm had truly been raging within ever since conny strangeways had triumphantly exhibited the prize she had won from frank charnock at the races and camilla had taken care that full and undeniable evidence should prove that this was not all that the young man had lost upon the backsworth raceground  lenore might guess with her peculiarly painful intuition who had been the tempter but that did not lessen her severity towards the victim  in her resolution against a betting man had she not trusted frank too implicitly even to warn him of her vow  nay had she not felt him drifting from her all through the season unjustly angered unworthily distrustful easily led astray  all the misgivings that had fretted her at intervals and then cleared away seemed to gather into one convictionfrank had failed her  eleonoras nature was one to resent before grieving  her spirit was too high to break down under the first shock and she carried her head proudly to the ball betraying by no outward sign the stern despair of her heart as she listened to the gay chatter of her companions and with unflinching severity she carried out that judicial reply to frank which she had already prepared and then guarded herself among numerous partners against remonstrance or explanation  it had been all one whirl of bewilderment lady tyrrell tired and making the girls intended journey on the morrow a plea for early departure and the strangeways though dancing indefatigably and laughing at fatigue coming away as soon as they saw she really wished it  all said good night and goodbye together both to lady tyrrell and sir harry and lenore started at ten oclock without having seen either  her sense of heroism lasted till after the glimpse of frank on the road  her mood was of bitter disappointment and indignation  frank was given up but not less so were her father her sister and the world  sir harry had made camilla suffice to him he did not want her  he had been the means of perverting frank and lenore could not see that she need any longer be bound for his sake to the life she detested  in a few weeks she would be of age and what would then prevent her from finding a congenial home in the sisterhood since such kindred could have no just claim to her allegiance  it was the hasty determination of one who had suffered a tacit persecution for three years and was now smarting under the cruellest of blows  her lover perverted her conditions broken her pledge gambled away and all this the work of her father and sister  conny and bee thought her grave and more silent than usual and when lady susan met them in london there was no time for thought saturday was spent on a harvest festival at a suburban church after which the daughters were despatched to their uncles by a late train  sunday was spent in the pursuit of remarkable services and on monday lady susan and eleonora had gone to st faiths and the retreat began  here was to be the longedfor rest for which she had thirsted all the more through those days of hurry and of religious spectacles as she felt that be they what they might to their regular attendants to her as an outsider they could be but sights into whose spirit her sick and wearied soul could not enter  here was no outward disturbance no claim from the world no importunate chatter only religious services in their quietest most unobtrusive form and dr easterbys low tender tones leading his silent listeners to deep heartsearchings earnest thoughts and steadfast resolutions  ah so no doubt it was with many but lena with book and pen was dismayed to find that the one thing she recollected was the question friend how camest thou in hither  after that she had only heard her own thoughts  her mind had lapsed into one vague apprehension of the effects of having cut off all communication with home imaginings of franks despair relentings of pity all broken by dismay at her own involuntary hypocrisy in bringing such thoughts into the retreat  had she any right to be there at all  was not a thing that should have been for her peace become to her an occasion of falling  it was thursday evening and on the morrow there would be the opportunity of private interviews with dr easterby  she longed for the moment chiefly to free herself from the sense of deception that had all this time seemed to vitiate her religious exercises deafen her ears and blow aside her prayers  there was a touch on her shoulder and one of the sisters who had received the ladies said interrogatively miss vivian  the mother would be obliged if you would come to her room  the general hush prevented lenore from manifesting her extreme agitation and she moved with as quiet a step as she could command though trembling from head to foot  in the room to which she came stood the superior and dr easterby and a yellow telegrampaper lay on the table  my father she asked  no said the superior kindly it is your sister who is ill here is the telegram  sister margaret to the mother superior st faiths dearport lady tyrrell has the fever  miss vivian much needed  wilsbro sept 26th 530  the fever  she looked up bewildered and the superior added  you did not know of a fever at wilsbro  some of our nursing sisters were telegraphed for and went down yesterday  i was sorry to send sister margaret away just when her mother and you are here but she was the only available head and the need seemed great  i have heard nothing since i left home on friday said eleonora hoarsely  it is my own fault  they think i am at revelrig  your family do not know you are here said the superior gravely  it was very wrong she said  this is the punishment  i must go can i  surely as soon as there is a train said the superior beginning to look for a bradshaw while dr easterby gave lenore a chair and bade her sit down  she looked up at his kind face and asked whether he had heard of this fever  on sunday evening some friends who came out from backsworth to our evening service spoke of an outbreak of fever at wilsbro and said that several of the charnock family were ill  i have had this card since from young mr bowater  t f in severe form  j c well but both his brothers are down in it and lady ks brother also lady t and the vicar no one to do anything we have taken charge of wilsbro  i have no time to do more than thank you for unspeakable kindness  h b  you knew exclaimed lenore as she saw her sisters initial  i knew lady tyrrell was ill but i do not know who the ladies are whom i address  i did not guess that you were here said dr easterby gently  no one living near backsworth could fail to know sir harry vivians reputation so that the master of rood house knew far better than the superior of st faiths how much excuse lenores evasion might have but whatever could seem like tampering with young people was most distressing to the sisters and the mother was more grave than pitiful  there was no train till the mail at night and there would be two hours to wait in london but lenore would listen to no entreaties to wait till morning and as they saw that she had plenty of health and strength they did not press her though the superior would send a nurse with her who if not needed at sirenwood might work in water lane  it was thought best not to distract lady susan and lenore was relieved not to have her vehement regret and fussy cares about her but there were still two hours to be spent before starting and in these dr easterby was the kindest of comforters  had she erred in her concealment  he thought she had though with much excuse  a retreat was not like a sacrament a necessity of a christians life and no merely possible spiritual advantage ought to be weighed against filial obedience  it was a moment of contrition and of outpouring for the burthened heart as lenore was able to speak of her long trial and all the evil it had caused in hardening and sealing up her better nature  she even told of her unsanctioned but unforbidden engagement and of its termination yearning to be told that she had been hasty and hard and to be bidden to revoke her rejection  she found that dr easterby would not judge for her or give her decided direction  he showed her indeed that she had given way to pride and temper and had been unjust in allowing no explanation but he would not tell her to unsay her decision nor say that it might not be right even though the manner had been wrong  while the past was repented and had its pardon for the future he would only bid her wait and pray for guidance and aid through her trial  my child he said chastening is the very token of pardon and therein may you find peace and see the right course  and you will pray for methat however it may be he may forgive me  indeed i will  we all will pray for you as one in sorrow and anxiety  and remember this  there is a promise that a great mountain shall become a plain and so it does but to those who bravely try to climb it in strength not their own not to those who try to go round or burrow through  i see was all she answered in the meek submissive tone of a strong nature bent but not daring to break down  she could not shed tears deeply as she felt she must save all her strength and bear that gnawing misery which herbert bowaters mention of j cs brothers had inflicted upon herbear it in utter uncertainty through the nights journey until the train stopped at wilsbro at eleven oclock and her father to whom she had telegraphed met her holding out his arms and absolutely crying over her for joy  my dear my dear i knew you would come i could trust to my little lena  it was all some confounded mistake  it was my fault  how is she  does nothing but ask for you  very lownasty fever at night whats that woman  mvie sent a nurse who is awfully jealous cant have her in to camilla  but theres plenty to do anais is laid upcoachman too and joehalf the other servants gone off  i told victor i would pay anything to him if he would stay  andat compton faintly asked lenore  bad enough they say  serves em right mrs raymond was as mischievous as duncombes wife but ive not heard for the last two days theres been no one to send over and ive had enough to think about of my own  who have it there she managed to say  raymond and his wife both and frank and the young de lancey i heard  i met julius charnock the other day very anxious about them hes got his tithe barn stuffed with children from water lane as if he wanted to spread it  all their meddling  but what kept you so long little one  where were you hidingor did lady susan keep it from you  i began to think you had eloped with her son  you are sure you have not  i was wrong father i went to a retreat with lady susan  a what  some of lady susans little poperies eh  i cant scold you child now ive got you only have your letters forwarded another time said sir harry placable as usual when alone with lenore  fears of infection for her did not occur to him  mr mvie held the noncontagion theory and helpless selfishness excluded all thoughts of keeping his daughter at a distance  he clung to her as he used to do in former days before camilla had taken possession of him and could not bear to have her out of reach  in the sickroom she was of disappointingly little use  the nurse was a regular professional used to despotism and resenting her having brought home any one with her and she never permitted miss vivians presence except when the patients anxiety made it necessary to bring her in and when admitted there was nothing to be done but to sit by camilla and now and then answer the weary disjointed talk and if it grew a little livelier the warning that lady tyrrell was getting excited was sure to follow  outside there was enough to do in the disorganized state of the sick and panicstricken household where nobody was effective but the french valet and one very stupid kitchenmaid  lena helped the st faiths nurse in her charge of the french maid but almost all her time in the morning was spent in domestic cares for the sick and for her father and when he was once up he was half plaintive half passionate if she did not at once respond to his calls  she read the papers to him walked up and down the terrace with him while he smoked and played bezique with him late into the night to distract his thoughts  and where were hers while each days bulletin from compton hall was worse than the last  little joe reynolds had been sent home on being taken ill and she would fain have gone to see him but detentions sprang up around her and sometimes it would have been impossible to go so far from the house so that days had become weeks and the month of october was old before she was walking down the little garden of old bettys house  the door opened and julius charnock came out startling her by the sight of his worn and haggard looks as he made a deprecating movement and shut the door behind him  then she saw that the blinds were in the act of being drawn down  is it so she said  yes said julius in a quiet tone as sad and subdued as his looks  he slept himself away peacefully a quarter of an hour ago  i suppose i must not go in now  i longed to come before  poor boy he was like a toy flung away  you need not grieve over him said julius  far from it  you have done a great deal for him  ii only caused him to be put into temptation  nay  your care woke his spirit up and guarded him  no one could hear his wanderings without feeling that he owed much to you  there is a drawing to be given to you that will speak much to you  it is at the rectory it was not safe here  and his mother is here  i cant but hope her soul has been reached through him  yes as lenore leant against the gate her warm tears dropping there is no grief in thinking of him  he had yearnings and conceptions that could not have been gratified in his former station and for him an artists life would have been more than commonly uphill workfull of trial  i wish you could have heard the murmured words that showed what glorious images floated before himno doubt now realized  i am glad he was really good were the only words that would come  the hearts of both were so full that these words on what was a little further off were almost necessary to them  take my arm said julius kindly  our roads lie together down the lane  how is your sister  better i hope as i see you here  she has slept more quietly  mr mvie thinks her a little better  so it is with terry de lancey said julius he is certainly less feverish today but there was no corresponding tone of gladness in the voice though he added cecil is going on well too  and  poor lenores heart died within her she could only press his arm convulsively and he had mercy on her  franks illness has been different in character from the others he said the fever has run much higher and has affected the brain more and the throat is in a very distressing state but dr worth still does not think there are specially dangerous symptoms and is less anxious about him than raymond  ah is it true  he does not seem as ill as frank but there have been bleedings at the nose which have brought him very low and which have hitherto been the worst symptoms and here the steady sadness of his voice quivered a little  lenore uttered a cry of dismay and murmured your mother  she is absorbed in him  happily she can be with him constantly they seem to rest in each others presence and not to look forward  and cecil  it has taken the lethargic turn with cecil  she is almost always asleep and is now i believe much better but in truth we have none of us been allowed to come near her  her maid grindstone has taken the sole charge and shuts us all out for fear i believe of our telling her how ill raymond is  oh i know grindstone  who looks on us all as enemies  however raymond has desired us to write to her father and he will judge when he comes  they were almost at the place of parting  eleonora kept her hand on his arm longing for another word nay feeling that without it her heart would burst  who is with frank  anne  she hardly ever leaves him  she is our mainstay at the hall  is he ever sensible she faintly asked  he has not been really rational for nearly ten days now  ififoh you know what i mean  oh gain his pardon for me and she covered her face with her hand  poor frankit is of your pardon that he talks  tell me eleonora did you ever receive a letter from my mother  never  where was it sent she said starting  to revelrig  it was written the day after the ball  i never went to revelrig  oh if i could have spoken to you first i should have been saved from so much that was wrong  no one knew where i was  no not till sister margaret told herbert bowater that her sisters had been at a ball at the townhall the week before  then he saw she was miss strangeways and asked if she knew where you were  ah yes disobediencetacit deceptiontemper  oh they have brought their just punishment  but that letter  i think it was to explain poor franks conduct at the races perhaps as the servants at revelrig had no knowledge of you it may have been returned and my mothers letter have been left untouched i will see  they knew they must not delay one another and parted julius walking homewards by the hall where alas there was only one of the family able to move about the house and she seldom left her patient  julius did however find her coming downstairs with dr worth and little as he gathered that was reassuring in the physicians words there was a wistful moisture about her eyes a look altogether of having a bird in her bosom which made him say as the doctor hurried off anne some one must be better  cecil is she said and he had nearly answered only cecil but her eyes brimmed over suddenly and she said i am so thankful  miles he exclaimed  she handed him a telegram  the salamanca was at spithead miles telegraphed to her to join him  miles come  thank god  does mother know  hush no one does and with a heaving breast she added i answered that i could not and why and that he must not come  no i suppose he must not till he is free of his ship  my poor anne  oh no  i know he is safe  i am glad  but the knowledge would tear your mother to pieces  her soul is in raymond now and to be certain of miles being at hand would be an unspeakable relief to him  come and tell them  no no i cant she cried with a sudden gush of emotion sweeping over her features subdued instantly but showing what it was to her  you do it  only dont let them bring him here  and anne flew to her fastness in franks attic while julius repaired to raymonds room and found him as usual lying tranquil with his mothers chair so near that she could hand him the cool fruit or drink or ring to summon other help  their time together seemed to both a rest and julius always liked to look at their peaceful faces after the numerous painful scenes he had to encounter  raymond too was clinging to him to his ministrations and his talk as to nothing else save his mother  raymond had always been upright and conscientious but his religion had been chiefly duty and obligation and it was only now that comfort or peace seemed to be growing out of it for him  as he looked up at his brother he too saw the involuntary brightness that the tidings had produced and said is any one else better julius  i know terry is i am so glad for rose  i asked anne the same question said julius  mother you will be more glad than tantalized  the salamanca is come in  raymond made an inarticulate sound of infinite relief  his mother exclaimed he must not come here  but frankie could not spare anne to him  what will she do  she will stay bravely by frank said julius  we must all wait till the ship is paid off  of course said raymond  if she can rejoice that he is out of danger we will i am content to know him near  it makes all much easier  and mother he will find all ready to own what a priceless treasure he sent before him in his wife  there was the old note of pain in the comparison  juliuss heart was wrung as he thought of sirenwood with the sense that the victim was dying the author of the evil recovering  he could only stifle the thought by turning away and going to the table in his mothers adjacent room where letters had accumulated unopened  on her majestys service bore the postmark which justified him in opening it and enclosing the letter it contained to miss vivian  he did so almost mechanically  he had gone through these weeks only by never daring to have a self  the only man of his family who could be effective the only priest in the two infected parishes he had steadfastly braced himself for the work  he ventured only to act and pray never to talk save for the consolation of others  to wilsbro he daily gave two morning hours for he never failed to be wanted either for the last rites or for some case beyond herberts experience as well as to see the vicar who was sinking fast in a devout and resigned frame which impressed while it perplexed his brother clergyman in view of the glaring deficiencies so plain to others but which never seemed to trouble his conscience  the nursingstaff still consisted of the sisters herbert bowater mrs duncombe and her manservant  under their care the virulence of the disease was somewhat abating and the doctors ventured to say that after the next few days there would be much fewer fatal cases but water lane was now a strangely silent placewindows open blinds flapping in the wind no children playing about and the three pigeons remained the only publichouse not shut up  it was like having the red cross on the door      chapter xxix a strange night   cold cold with death came up the tide    in no manner of haste up to her knees and up to her side    and up to her wicked waist for the hand of the dead and the heart of the dead    are strong hasps they to holdg macdonald  rector said herbert bowater are you specially at home  why asked julius pausing  theres that man gadley  gadley  is he down  it seems that he has been ill this fortnight but in the low smouldering form and he and that hostler of his kept it a secret for fear of loss of gain and hatred of doctors parsons sisters and authorities generally until yesterday when the hostler made off with all the money and the silver spoons  this morning early a policeman seeing the door open went in and found the poor wretch in a most frightful state but quite sensible  i was passing as he came out to look for help and i have been there mostly ever since he is dyingmvie says theres not a doubt of that and he has got something on his mind  he says he has been living on moys hush money all this time for not bringing to light some embezzlement of your mothers money and letting the blame light on that poor cousin of yours douglas  herbert was amazed at the lighting up of his rectors worn anxious face  douglas  thank heaven  herbert we must get a magistrate at once to take the deposition  what  do you want to prosecute moy  no but to clear archie  i thought he was drowned  no that was all a mistake  miles saw him at natal  herbert this will be life and joy to your sister  whatyou did not know about jenny and archie  not ijennypoor old joan  so thats what has stood in her way and made her the jolliest of old sisters is it  poor old joanie what was she engaged to him  yes much against your fathers liking though he had consented  i remember he forbade it to be spoken ofand you were at school  and joan was away nursing old aunt joan for two years  so archie went off with this charge on him and was thought to be lost  whew how did she stand it  i say does she know he is alive  no he forbade miles to speak  no one knows but miles and i and our wives  anne put us on the scent  now herbert ill go to the poor man at once and you had better find a magistrate  whom can i find said herbert  theres my father away and raymond ill and lipscombe waved me offwouldnt so much as speak to me for fear i should be infectious  you must get a town magistrate  briggs is frantic since he lost his son and truelove thinks he has the fever though worth says it is all nonsense  theres nobody but whitlock  dear old jenny  well there always was something different from other people in her and i never guessed what it was id go to the end of the world to make her happy and get that patient look out of her eyes  herbert had nearly to fulfil this offer for mr whitlock was gone to london for the day and magistrates were indeed scarce but at last after walking two miles out of the town his vehemence and determination actually dragged in the unfortunate timid justice of the peace who had avoided him in the road but who could not refuse when told in strong earnest that the justification of an innocent man depended on his doing his duty  poor mr lipscombe  the neglected three pigeons was just now the worst place in all water lane  the little that had hastily been done since the morning seemed to have had no effect on the foetid atmosphere even to herberts well accustomed nostrils and what must it have been to a stranger in spite of the open window and all the disinfectants  and alas the man had sunk into a sleep julius who still stood by him had heard all he had to say to relieve his mind all quite rationally and had been trying to show him the need of making reparation by repeating all to a magistrate when the drowsiness had fallen on him and though the sound of feet roused him it was to wander into the habitual defiance of authority merging into terror  herbert soothed him better than any one else could do and he fell asleep again but mr lipscombe declared it was of no use to remain nothing but madness and they could not gainsay him  he left the two clergymen together feeling himself to have done a very valiant and useless thing in the interests of justice or at the importunity of a foolishly zealous young curate  look here said herbert whitlock may be trusted  leave a note for him explaining  ill stay here im the best to do so any way if he revives and is sensible ill send off at once for whitlock or if there is no time ill write it down and let him see me sign it  and some one else if possible said julius  the difficulty is that i never had authority given me to use what he said to me in private  rather the contrary for old instinctive habits of caution awoke the instant i told him it was his duty to make it known and that archie was alive  i dont like leaving you here herbert but raymond was very weak this morning besides theres poor joes funeral  oh never mind  hell have his sleep out and be all right when he awakes  think of righting jennys young man  how jolly  julius went across to the townhall hospital and told the sisters whose darling his curate was of the charge he had undertaken and they promised to look after him  after which julius made the best of his way home where rosamond had as usual a bright face for him  her warm heart and tender tact had shown her that obtrusive attempts to take care of him would only be harassing so she only took care to secure him food and rest in his own house whenever it was possible and that however low her own hopes might be she would not add to his burden and now terry was so much better that she could well receive him cheerily and talk of what terry had that day eaten so joyously as almost to conceal that no one was better at the hall  i will come with you she said i might do something for poor fanny as the bell began to toll for little joshuas funeral fanny reynolds hearing some rumour of her boys illness had brought drake to her home three days before his death  the poor little fellows utterances both conscious and unconscious had strangely impressed the man and what had they not awakened in the mother  and when the words so solemn and mysterious fell on those unaccustomed ears in the churchyard and fanny in her wild overpowering grief threw herself about in an agony of sorrow and remorse and sobbed with low screams it was the lady whom she viewed as an angel of mercy who held her and hushed her and when all was over and she was sinking down faint and hysterical it was the lady whoa little to the scandal of the more respectable helped drake to carry her to the rectory the man obeying like one dazed  i must leave the sheep that was lost to you rose said julius you can do more for them than i as yet and they have sent for me to the hall  you will stay there tonight if they want you i dont want any one said rosamond at the door  he was wanted indeed at his home  frank was in a wilder and more raving state than ever and raymond so faint and sinking and with such a look about him that julius felt more than he had ever done before that though the fever had almost passed away there was no spirit or strength to rally  he was very passive and seemed to have no power to wonder though he was evidently pleased when julius told him both of archie douglass life and the hopes of clearing his name  tell jenny she was right he said and did not seem inclined to pursue the subject  they wheeled mrs poynsett away at her usual hour when he was dozing and as frank was still tossing and moaning incoherently and often required to be held julius persuaded anne to let him take her place with him while she became raymonds watcher  he dozed about half an hour and when she next gave him some food he said in a very low feeble tone  you have heard from miles  yes he says nothing shall stop him the moment they are paid off  thats right  no fear of infectionthats clear said raymond  i think notunder god and annes two hands unseen clasped over her throbbing yearning heart  dear old fellow said raymond  it is such pleasure to leave mother to him  if i dont see him anne tell him how glad i am ive no charge  i know he will do it all right  and mother will have you and he held out his hand to her  presently he said anne  one thing  yes she said anxiously  you always act on principle i know but dont hang back from miless friends and pleasures  i know the old fellow anne  his nature is sociable and he wants sympathy in it  i know what you mean raymond said anne i do mean to try to do right  i know i know said he getting a little excited and speaking eagerly but dont let right blind you anne if you censure and keep from all he likesif you will be a recluse and not a woman hedont be offended anne but if you leave him to himself then will every effort be made to turn him from you  you dont believe me  my dear raymond dont speak so eagerly as his cheeks flushed  i must  i cant see his happiness and yours wrecked like mine  go with him anne  dont leave him to be poisoned  mesmerism has its power over whoever has been under the spell  and he hashe has she will try to turn him against you and mother  hush raymond  indeed i will be on my guard  theres no one there  what are you looking at  camilla he said with eyes evidently seeing something  camilla is it not enough to have destroyed one peace  raymond indeed there is no one here  but he had half raised himself  yes camilla you have had your revenge  let it be enough  nono i forgive you but i forbid you to touch her  he grasped annes arm with one hand and stretched the other out as though to warn some one away  the same moment there was another outburst of the bleeding  anne rang for help with one hand and held him as best she could  it lasted long and when it was over he was manifestly dying  it is coming he said looking up to julius  pray  only firstmy love to cecil  i hope she is still young enough not to have had all her life spoilt  is her father coming  tomorrow said anne  thats well  poor child she is better free  how piteously sad those words of one wedded but a year  how unlike the look that met his mothers woeful yet tender eyes as she held his hand  she would aid him through that last passage as through all before only a word of strong and tender love as he again looked up to julius and anne as if to put her in their keeping and once more murmured something of love to sweet rose  now julius pray  an ever dutiful man there was no wandering in look or tone  he breathed amen once or twice but never moved again only his eyes still turned on his mother and so in its time came the end  old susan saw at first that the long fluttering gasp had no successor and her touch certified julius  he rose and went towards his mother  she held out her hands and said  take me to my frank  we had better whispered anne  they wheeled her to the foot of the stairs  julius took her in his arms anne held her feet and thus they carried her up the stairs and along the passage hearing franks husky rapid babble all the way and finding him struggling with the fierce strength of delirium against jenkins who looked as if he thought them equally senseless when he saw his helpless mistress carried in  frank my boy do lie still she said and he took no notice but when she laid her hand on his he turned looked at her with his dull eyes and muttered mother  it was the first recognition for many a day and at the smoothing motion of her hand over him while she still entreated lie still my dear the mutterings died away the childish instinct of obedience stilled the struggles and there was something more like repose than had been seen all these weary months  mother said julius you can do for us what no one else can  you will save him  she looked up to him and hope took away the blank misery he had dreaded to see  my poor frankie she said dreamily he has wanted me i will not leave him now  all was soon still franks face had something like rest on it as he lay with his mothers hand on his brow and she intent only on him  you can leave them to me i think said anne  i will send if there be need but if not you had better not come up till you have been to wilsbroif you must go  i must i fear i promised to come to fuller if he be still here i will speak to jenkins first  julius was living like a soldier in a campaign with numbers dropping beside him and no time to mourn scarcely to realize the loss and he went on almost as if he had been a stranger while the grief of poor old jenkins was uncontrollable both for his ladys sake and for the young master who had been his pride and glory his sobs brought out mrs grindstone into the gallery to insist with some asperity that there should be no noise to awaken her mistress who was in a sweet sleep  we will take care said julius sadly  i suppose she had better hear nothing till mr charnock comes  she must be left to me sir or i cannot be answerable for the consequences was the stiff reply wherewith mrs grindstone retreated into her castle  julius left the hushed and veiled house in the frosty chill of the late autumn just before dawn shivering between grief and cold and he walked quickly down the avenue feeling it strange that the windows in the face of his own house were glittering back the reflection of the setting moon  something long and black came from the opposite direction rector it said in a low hoarse voice ive got leave from him to use what he said to you  sister margaret and i signed it  will that do  i cant tell now herbert i cant think  my brother is just gone said julius in his inward voice  raymond  no  oh i beg your pardon i never thought of that raymond  go home and go to bed said julius as the young man wrung his hand  rest nowwe must think another time  did rosamond know was perhaps the foremost of his weary thoughts ah did she not  was she not standing with her crimson shawl round her and the long black plaits falling on it to beckon him to the firelit comfort of his own room  did she not fall on his neck as he came heavily up and cling around him with her warm arms  oh julius what a dear brother he was  what can we do for your mother  as he told her how franks need did more than any support could do for her her tears came thicker but in spite of them her fond hands put him into the easychair by the fire and drew off his damp boots and while listening to the low sunken voice that told her of the end she made ready the cup of cocoa that was waiting and put the spoon in his hand in a caressing manner that made her care comfort not oppression  fatigue seconded her for he took the warm food faltered and leant back dozing till the babys voice awoke him and as he saw rosamond hushing her he exclaimed  o rose if poor raymond had ever known one hour like this and he held out his arms for his child  you know i dont let you hold her in that coat  go into your dressingroom have your bath and put on your dressinggown and if you will lie on the bed you shall take care of her while i go and feed terry  you cant do anything for anybody yet it is only six oclock  these precautions hindering his going jaded and exhausted into infection were what rosamond seemed to live for though she never forced them on him and he was far too physically tired out not to yield to the soothing effect so that even two hours on the bed sent him forth renovated to that brief service in the church where herbert and he daily met and found their strength for the day  they had not had time to exchange a word after it before there was a knock at the vestry door and a servant gave the message to herbert who had opened it  lady tyrrell is taken worse sir and sir harry vivian begged that mr charnock would come immediately  a carriage had been sent for him and he could only hurry home to tell rosamond to send on the pony to sirenwood to take him to wilsbro unless he were first wanted at home  she undertook to go up to the hall and give anne a little rest and he threw himself into the carriage not daring to dwell on the pain it gave him to go from his brothers death bed to confront camilla  at the door eleonora came to meet him  thank you she said  we knew it was no time to disturb you  i can be better spared now answered julius  you dont mean she said with a strange look which was not quite surprise  yes my dear brother left us at about three oclock last night  a change came on at twelve  twelve  eleonora laid her hand on his arm and spoke in a quick agitated manner  camilla was much better till last night when at twelve i heard such a scream that i ran into her room  she was sitting up with her eyes fixed open like a clairvoyante and her voice seemed pleadingpleading with him as if for pardon and she held out her hands and called him  then suddenly she gave a terrible shriek and fell back in a kind of fit  mr mvie can do nothing and though she is conscious now she does nothing but ask for you and say that he does not want you now  julius grew paler as he said very low anne said he seemed to be seeing and answering her  not like delirium but as if she were really there  dont tell any one entreated eleonora in a breathless whisper and he signed consent as both felt how those two spirits must have been entwined since these long years had never broken that subtle link of sympathy which had once bound them  sir harrys face dreary sunken and terrified was thrust over the balusters as he called dont hinder him lena she asks for him every moment and as they came on he caught juliuss hand saying soothe her soothe hertis the only chance  if she could but sleep  there lay camilla tyrrell beautiful still but more than ever like the weird tragic head with snakewreathed brows in the wasted contour of her regular features and the flush on her hollow cheeks while her eyes burned with a strange fire that almost choked back juliuss salutation of peace even while he breathed it for might not the son of peace be with some there  the eager glance seemed to dart at him  julius charnock she cried come and as he would have said some word about her health she cut him short  never mind that i must speak while my brain serves  after that be the priest  he is dead  my brother  yes  the only one i ever loved  theres no sin nor scandal in saying so now  his wife is better  it will never kill her  she does not know  no  there was nothing to make her  he could not give her his heart try as he would  why did he turn the unchangeable to hate hate hate  lady tyrrell you did not send for me to hear what ought not to be said at all  dont fly off she said  i had really something to say  it was not wholly hate julius i really tried to teach his little idiot of a wife to win him at last  i meant it to turn out well and nothing could with that mother there  i must leave you lady tyrrell if you will not control yourself  dont be hard on me julius and she looked up with a glance of better days  you idolize her like all the rest of you but she chilled me and repelled me and turned me to bitterness when i was young and he might have led me  her power and his idolatry made me jealous and what i did in a fit of petulance was so fastened on that i could not draw back  why did not he wait a little longer to encumber himself with that girl  nothat wasnt what i had to say its all over now  it is the other thing  how is frank  very ill indeed but quieter just now  then there shall not be another wreck like ours  lena are you here  you saw that frank had let constance strangeways win your pebble  it was because i showed him the one beatrice bought and he thought it yours  yes i saw nothing else for it  what was to become of the property if you threw yourself away and on her son she added with the malignant look  whether he knew of this little vow of yours i cant tell but he had lost his head and did for himself  it was for your good and papas but i shall not be here to guide the clue so you must go your own way and be happy in it if she will let you  father do you hear  dont think to please me by hindering the course of true love and you julius tell frank he was a dull moor  i liked the boy i was sorry for him but he ought to have known his token betterand there was the estate to be saved  estates weigh little now  clerical  i suppose now is the time for it  you were all precision at compton  it would kill me i cant live with mrs poynsett  no no tom i cant have old raymond quizzed ill get him out of it when the leadingstrings are cut  what right has she   the delirium had returned  juliuss voice kept her still for a few moments but she broke out afresh at his first pause and murmurs fell thick and fast from her tongue mixing the names of her brother and raymond with railings at mrs poynsett for slights in the days when the mother was striving to discourage the inclination that resulted in the engagement  earnestly did julius beseech for peace for repentance for the poor stormtossed soul but when the raving grew past control and the time was coming for his ministrations to the vicar of wilsbro he was forced to leave her  poor old sir harry would have clung to him as to anything like a support but eleonora knew better  no dear papa she said he has given us too much of his time already  he must go where he can still help  poor camilla cannot attend to him  if she came to herself  then send for me  i would come instantly  send to the townhall any time before twelve after that to compton  send without scruples lenore you have truly the right  they did not send except that a note met him as he returned home telling him that suffusion of the brain had set in  camilla tyrrell did not survive raymond poynsett twelve hours      chapter xxx come back   and are ye sure the news is true and are ye sure hes weelj thompson  eleonora vivian was striving to write her sorrowful announcements in the deepening dusk of that autumn evening while her father had shut himself up after his vigil to sleep under victors care when a message came that lady rosamond charnock earnestly begged to see her  she stood with a face white and set looking like a galvanized corpse as her lips framed the words he is dead  no almost screamed rosamond snatching her hand  no  but no one can save him but you  come  without a word eleonora stepped into her own room and came back in cloak hat and veil  right said rosamond seizing her arm and taking her to the pony carriage at the door then explaining while driving rapidly  he has left off raving ever since his mother has been with him but he liesnot still but weak not speaking only moaning now and then his throat is so dreadful that it is hard to give him anything and he takes no notice of what one says only if his mother takes the spoon  he gets weaker and dr worth says it is only because there is no impulse to revive himhe is just sinking because he cant be roused  when i heard that i thought i knew who could  eleonoras lips once moved but no sound came from them and rosamond urged her little pony to its best speed through the two parks from one veiled house to another fastened it to the garden door without calling any one and led her silent companion up the stairs  mrs poynsett felt a hand on her shoulder and rosamond said i have brought our only hope and eleonora stood looking at the ghastly face  the yellow skin the inflamed purple lips the cavernous look of cheeks and eyes were a fearful sight and only the feeble incessant groping of the skeleton fingers showed life or action  put this into his hand said rosamond and lenore found the pebble token given to her and obeyed  at the touch a quivering trembled over face and form the eyelids lifted the eyes met hers there was a catching of the breath a shudder and convulsive movement  he is going cried his mother but anne started forward with drops of strong stimulant rosamond rubbed spirit into his forehead the struggle lessened the light flickered back into his brown eyes his fingers closed on hers  speak to him said mrs poynsett  do you see her frankie dear  frank dear frank here i am  the eyes gazed with more meaning the lips moved but no sound came till anne had given another drop of the stimulant and the terrible pain of the swallowing was lessened  then he looked up and the words were heard  is it true  it is my dear boy  it is lena  here frank as still the wistful gaze was unsatisfied she laid her hands on his and then he almost smiled and tried to raise it to his cheeks but he was too weak and she obeyed the feeble gesture and stroked the wasted face while a look of content came over it the eyes closed and he slept with his face against her hand his mother watching beside with ineffable gratitude and dawning hope  lenore was forgetting everything in this watching but in another quarter of an hour anne was forced again to torture him with her spoon but life was evidently gaining ground for though he put it from him at first he submitted at lenas gesture and word  she felt the increased warmth and power in his grasp as he whispered lena you are come back then felt for the token  alas that she must leave him  they knew she must not stay away from her father indeed rosamond had told no one of her attempt her forlorn hope  lena tried to give assurances that she only went because it could not be helped and the others told him she would return but still he held her and murmured stay  she could not tear herself away she let him keep her hand and again he dozed and his fingers relaxed  go now my dear said mrs poynsett you have saved him  this stone will show him that you have been here you will come back tomorrow i may promise him  yes yes  in the morning or whenever i can be spared whispered lena who was held for a moment to mrs poynsetts breast ere rosamond took her away again and brought her once more downstairs and to the ponycarriage  there she leant back weeping quietly but bitterly over the shock of franks terribly reduced state which seemed to take from her all the joy of his revival weeping too at the cruel need that was taking her away  he will do now  i know he will said rosamond happy in her bold venture  oh if i could stay  most likely you would be turned out for fear of excitement  the stone will be safer for him  where did that come from asked lenore struck suddenly with wonder  i wrote to miss strangeways when i saw how he was always feeling feeling feeling for it like the bride of lammermoor  i told her there was more than she knew connected with that bit of stone and life or death might hang on it  then when id got it i hardly knew what to do with it for if it had soothed the poor boy delirious the coming to his right mind might have been all the worse  rosamond kissed her effusively and she dreamily muttered he must be saved  there was a sort of strange mist round her as though she knew not what she was doing and she longed to be alone  she would not let rosamond drive her beyond the sirenwood gate but insisted on walking through the park alone in the darkness by that very path where frank had ten months ago exchanged vows with her  rosamond turned back to the hall  it was poor cecils ponycarriage that she was driving and she took it to the stableyard where her entreaty had obtained it from the coachman whom she rewarded by saying i was right brown i fetched his best doctor and the old servant understood and came as near a smile as any one at compton could do on such a day  is the carriage gone for mr charnock  yes my lady i sent alfred with it i did not seem as if i could go driving into wilsbro on such a day  rosamond bade a kind farewell to the poor old coachman and was walking homewards when she saw a figure advancing towards her strangely familiar and yet hat and coat forbade her to believe it her husband even in the dusk  she could not help exclaiming miles  yes he said coming to a standstill  are you rosamond  i amanne is quite well and frank better  oh this will do them good  you know  yesyes i know he said hastily as if he could not bear to let himself out to one as yet a stranger  my mother  absorbed in frank too much to feel it yet fully anne watches them both  oh miles what she has been and she clasped his hand again  let me call her  and rosamond opened the hall door just as some instinct for it could hardly have been sense of hearing had brought anne upon the stairs where as miles would have hurried up to her she seemed in the light gray dress she still wore to hover like some spirit eluding his grasp like the fabled shades  oh no you ought not  infectioni am steeped in it  nonsense and she was gathered into the strong grasp that was home and rest to her while miles was weeping uncontrollably as he held her in his arms  o nannie nannie  i did not think it would be like this  why did they keep me till he was gone  no i did not get the telegram i only heard at the station  they let me go this morning and i did think i should have been in time  he loosed himself from her and hung over the balustrade struggling with a strong mans anguish then said in a low voice did he want me  he knew it was your duty said anne  we all were thankful you were kept from infection and he said many little things but the chief was that he trusted you too much to leave any special messages  hark that must be mr charnock cecils father  i must go and receive him  stay back miles you cant nowyou know my room  he signed acquiescence but lingered in the dark to look down and see how though rosamond had waited to spare them this reception his wifes tall graceful figure came forward and her kindly comforting gestures as the two sistersinlaw took the newcomer into the drawingroom and in another minute anne flitted up to him again  that good rosamond is seeing to mr charnock she said will you come miles  i think it will do your mother good only quietly for frank knows nothing  mrs poynsett still sat by frank  to miless eyes he was a fearful spectacle but to anne there was hourly progress the sunken dejected look was gone and though there was exhaustion there was rest but he was neither sleeping nor waking and showed no heed when his brother dropped on one knee by his mothers side put an arm round her waist and after one fervent kiss laid his black head on her lap hiding his face there while she fondled his hair and said frank frankie dear heres miles come home  he did not seem to hear only his lips murmured something like anne and the tender hand and ready touch of his unwearied nurse at once fulfilled his need while his mother whispered miles she is our blessing  poor miles  never had sailor a stranger though some may have had an even sadder return  he had indeed found his wife but hers was the only hand that could make frank swallow the sustenance that he needed every halfhour or who knew how to relieve him  indeed even the being together in the sickroom was not long possible for anne was called to the door  mr charnock was asking to see mrs poynsett  would mrs miles come and speak to him  mr charnock was a small and restless man with white hair little black eyes looking keener than they were and a face which had evidently been the mould of cecils  he was very kind with a full persuasion that the consolations of his august self must be infallible but this was coupled with an inclination to reprove everybody for the fate that had left his cherished darling a childless widow at twoandtwenty  to take him to franks room was impossible and he had to be roundly told so  neither had he seen his daughter  she was very weak but recovering and grindstone whom he had seen and talked with was as strenuous in deprecating any excitement as he was nervous about it  so he could only be disposed of in his room till dinnertime when he came down prepared to comfort the family but fulfilled his mission rather by doing such good as a blister which lessens the force of the malady by counterirritation  julius came up to be with miles and to help them through the dinner the first which had been laid for many a long day  his enquiry for cecil was answered  she is progressing as favourably as there can be reason to expect but i have not seen her  i follow the judgment of her faithful grindstone  then she still knows nothing  of her bereavement  no  her state does not yet warrant it  in fact i almost wish i had obeyed my original impulse and brought down venn to make the melancholy communication  to every ones surprise anne bristled up saying why here is julius mr charnock  mr charnock bowed  i understand that my cousin julius has been engrossed by his wifes family and by the adjoining parish the care of which he has assumed  anne fairly coloured up and exclaimed julius has been our main stay and help in everythingi cant think how he has done it  he has been here whenever we needed him as well as at wilsbro where people have been dying everywhere the poor vicar and all  far be it from me to discourage philanthropy said mr charnock only i would have it within due bounds  i am an oldfashioned squire of a school it may be antiquated an advocate of the parochial system and i cannot help thinking that if this had been closely adhered to by hotheaded young clergymen my poor child might not have been a childless widow at twoandtwenty  julius was too much tired and too sadhearted to heed greatly what mr charnock said  it was so strange to have miles in sight yet to feel so unable to be glad that he scarcely heard anything  but anne again took up the cudgels  mr charnock you dont suppose that it was anything julius did that brought this fever here  it was going to the townhall among the drains  my dear mrs miles charnock i am sure your husband will agree with me that sanitary arrangements and all connected with them are beyond the range of ladies who are happily exempted from all knowledge of the subject  anne could not say aloud that she wished cecil had held this opinion but she subsided while mr charnock prosed on asking questions about the arrangements and seeming shocked to hear that the funeral must be early the next day this being one of the prime injunctions of the doctors and that the one had been asked to attend it  it made him sigh again for his poor daughter as he handed anne in to dinner  she did not stay half through it for it was again the time for feeding frank  miles went half way upstairs with her and returned looking very wistful  julius smiled at him your wife is too valuable miles she is every ones property  it must be very gratifying to you added mr charnock to find how example and superior society have developed the native qualities your discernment detected in the charming young lady who has just quitted us  it was a most commendable arrangement to send her to enjoy the advantages of this place  i sent her to be a comfort to my mother said miles bluntly  and so she has been said julius fervently but sotto voce  i understand said mr charnock and as i was saying my dear cecil expressed from the first her desire to assist in forming her stranger sisterinlaw and i am happy to see the excellent effect i should scarcely have guessed that she came from a colony  indeed miles answered dryly  mr charnock might have it his own way if he liked to think anne had been a hottentot till cecil reclaimed her  the two brothers did feel something like joy when a message at last informed mr charnock that his daughter was awake and he might see her  they drew nearer together and leant against one another with absolute joy in the contact  they were singularly alike in outline voice and manner in everything but colouring and had always been one in spirit except for the strong passion for adventure which had taken miles to sea to find he had chosen his profession too young to count the cost and he held to it rather by duty than taste slight as had been his seniority poor raymond had always been on a sort of paternal pinnacle sharing the administration with his mother while miles and julius had paired on an equality  poor mother sighed miles  how is she to live without him julius did he leave any word for me with you  above all that anne is the daughter for my mother and so she is  what when this poor wife of raymonds was said to be the superior creature  you see her adoring father said julius  my rose has necessarily her own cares but anne has been my mothers silent aid and stay for months and what she has been in the present need no words can say my mother has had no power to take the direction of anything her whole being has been absorbed first in raymond now in frank and not only has anne been franks constant nurse through these five weeks of the most frightful fever and delirium i have seen at all here but she has had thought for all and managed all the house and servants  we could do comparatively little with roses brother ill at home and the baby so young besides there have been eleven cases in the parish and there was wilsbrobut anne has been the angel in the house  i knewi knew she would be everything when once the first strangeness was over but poor girl her heart is in africa and it has been all exile here i could see it in every letter though she tried to make the best of it  if there had but been a child here  i think you will find sufficient attachment to mother to weigh a good deal with her  poor anne she did think us all very wicked at first and perhaps she does still but at least this has drawn us all nearer together  and then the brothers lowered their voices and miles heard the full history of raymonds last illness with all the details that julius could have spoken of to none else while the sailors tears slowly dropped through the hands that veiled his face  it was a great deprivation to him that he might not look on raymonds face again but the medical edict had been decisive and he had come home to be of use and not a burthen  as julius told rosamond he only thoroughly felt the blessing of miless return when he bade good night and left the hall in peace and security that it had a sufficient aid and stay and that he was not deserting it  miles had proposed to send his wife to bed and take the night watch and he so far prevailed that she lay down in the adjoining room in her dressing gown while he sat by franks side  she lay where she could feast her eyes upon him as the lamplight fell on his ruddy brown cheek black hair and steady dark eye so sad indeed but so full of quiet strength and of heedful alacrity even in stillnessa look that poor raymond with all his grave dignity had never worn that sight was all anne wanted  she did not speak she did not sleep it was enough more than enough to have him there  she was too much tired body and mind after five weeks of strain for more than the sense that god had given her back what she loved and this was more than peace and more than rest      chapter xxxi breaking down   funerals were little attended in these sad days  the living had to be regarded more than the dead and raymond poynsett was only followed to the grave by his two brothers his fatherinlaw and some of the servants  rosamond however weeping her soft profuse tears could hear everything from behind the blind at terrys open window on that moist warm autumn day everything for no exception was made to the rule that coffins might not be taken into the church during this deadly sickness  she did hear a faltering and a blundering which caused her to look anxiously at the tall white figure standing at the head of the grave and as she now saw once or twice catching at the iron railing that fenced in the poynsett tombs  neither her husband nor his brother seemed to notice what she observed  absorbed in the sorrow and in one another they turned away after the service was ended and walked towards the hall rosamond did not speak for a minute or two then she turned round to terry who was sitting up in bed with an awestruck face listening as well as he could to the low sounds and watching her  terry dear shall you mind my going to see after herbert bowater i am sure they have let him overwork himself  if he is not fit to take lady tyrrells funeral this afternoon i shall send to duddingstone on my own responsibility  i will not have julius doing that  do you think he is illbowater i mean asked terry  i dont like it  he seemed to totter as he went across the churchyard and he blundered  i shall go and see  oh yes go said terry i dont want anybody  dont hurry  rosamond put on her hat and sped away to mrs hornblowers  as usual the front door leading to the staircase was open and going up she knocked at the sittingroom door but the only response was such a whining and scratching that she supposed the dogs had been left prisoners there and forgotten and so she turned the lockbut there was an obstruction so that though mungo and tartar darted out and snuffed round her only rollos paw and head appeared and there was a beseeching earnestness in his looks and little moans as if entreating her to come in  another push vigorously seconded by rollo within showed her that it was herberts shoulder that hindered her and that he was lying outstretched on the floor apparently just recalled to consciousness by the push for as rollo proceeded to his one remedy of licking there was a faint murmur of whowhat  it is i  what is the matter  lady rose  illill try to moveoh  his voice died away and rosamond thrust in her salts and called to mrs hornblower for water but in vain  however herbert managed to move a little to one side  she squeezed into the doorway hastily brought water from his bedroom within and kneeling down by him bathed his face so that he revived to say in the same faint voice im so sorry i made such mulls  i couldnt see  i thought i knew it by heart  never mind never mind dear herbert  you are better  couldnt you let me help you to the sofa  oh presently and as she took his head on her lap thank you i did mean to hold out till after this days work but it is all right now bindon is come  comeis he she joyfully exclaimed  yes i saw him from the window  i was getting up to hail him when the room turned upside down with me  theres his step now exclaimed rosamond  squeeze in mr bindon you are a very welcome sight  mr bindon did make his way in and stood dismayed at the black mass on the floor  rosamond and rollo one on each side of herberts great figure in his cassock and the rosy face deadly white while mungo and tartar who hated mr bindon both began to bark and thus did the most for their master whose call of quiet you brutes seemed to give him sudden strength  he took a grip of rollos curly back and supported by mr bindon dragged himself to the sofa and fell heavily back on it  give him some brandy said mr bindon hastily  theres not a drop of anything muttered herbert its all gone   to wilsbro explained rosamond then seeing the scared face of dilemma at the door she hastily gave a message and sent her flying to the rectory while mr bindon was explaining  i wish i had known  i never will go out of the reach of letters again  i saw in the times at innspruck a mention of typhoid fever here and i came back as fast as trains would bring me but too late i fear  you are welcome indeed repeated rosamond  herbert has broken down at last after doing more than man could do and i am most thankful that my husband should be saved the funerals at wilsbro  mr bindon whose face showed how shocked he was made a few inquiries  he had learnt the main facts on his way but had been seeking his junior to hear the details and he looked like the warrior who had missed thermopylae ashamed and grieved at his holiday  the bottle rosamond had sent for arrived and there was enough vigour restored to make her say heres a first service mr bindon to help this poor fellow into bed  no no exclaimed herbert  you are not going to say theres nothing the matter with you said rosamond as a flush passed over the pale face  no he said but i want to go home  i should have taken a fly at wilsbro  cranky will see to me without bothering anybody else if you would send for one  i dont think i can till i know whether you are fit to move said rosamond  i desired dilemma to tell them to send dr worth here when he comes to terry  besides is it quite right to carry this into another place  i never thought of that said herbert  but they would shut me up nobody come near me but cranky  but there a shivering fit caught him so that the sofa shook with him and rosamond covered him with rugs and again told him bed was the only place for him and he consented at last holding his head as he rose dizzy with the ache  look here lady rose he said falling back into a sitting posture at the first attempt wheres my writingcase  if i go off my head will you give this to the rector and ask him if it will be any good in the matter he knows of and he handed her an envelope and this keep he added giving her one addressed to his father dont let him have it till its all over  you know  then he took up a pen and a sheet of paper and got as far with a shaking hand as dear crank but there he broke down and laid his head on the table groaning  ill do it  what shall i say dear herbert  only tell her to come to me he gasped  cranstounour old nurse  then ill be no trouble  while mr bindon helped herbert into his room rosamond sped home to send for mrs cranstoun arrange for the care of the new patient in the intervening hours and fetch some of those alleviations of which experience had taught the use  mr bindon came to meet her on her return carefully shutting the door and saying lady rosamond can he be delirious already  he is talking of being plucked for his ordination  too true said rosamond  i thought it a great shame to be so hard on a man with that in him but i believe you expected it  no i may have said he would fail but i never expected it  fail indeed  fancy a man being turned back who has worked night and daynight and daydoing all the very hardest servicesnever resting  very likely killing himself cried rosamond hotly  may i come back to him  terry can spare me and if you will go to wilsbro ill stay till my husband comes or the doctor  the sisters will tell you what to do  herbert was however so much more comfortable for being in bed that he was able to give mr bindon directions as to the immediate cares at wilsbro but he was distressed at occupying lady rose his great object being to be no trouble to anybody though he had seen so much of the disease as to have been fully aware that it had been setting in for the last two days yet his resolution to spare his rector had kept him afoot till he had seen other help arrive he declared that he wanted nobody but rollo who could fetch and carry and call any one if only the doors were open and really the creatures wistful eyes and gentle movements justified the commendation  only said herbert anxiously i suppose this is not catching for dogs  youll make a home for him lady rose he added  i should like you to have him and hell be happier with you than with any one else  herbert i cant have you talk of that  very well he said quietly  only you will keep my dear old fellowive had him from a puppyand he is but three years old now  rosamond gave all promises from her full heart as she fondled the soft wise black head  herbert was unhappy too about mrs hornblowers trouble  harry had been one of the slighter cases and was still in his room a good deal subdued by the illness and by the attention the lodger had shown him for herbert had spent many hours when he had been supposed to be resting in relieving mrs hornblower and she was now in a flood of gratitude only longing to do everything for him herself  had he not as she declared saved her son body and soul  the most welcome sight was julius who came down in dismay as soon as he could leave the hall  i am so glad said the patient i want to talk things over while my head is clearer than it ever may be again  dont begin by desponding  these fevers are much less severe now than six weeks ago  yes but they always go the hardest with the great big strong young fellows  ive buried twelve young men out of the whole fortyfive  poor lads i doubt if their life had been such a preparation as yours  dont talk of my life  a stewardship i never set myself to contemplate and so utterly failed in  ive got nothing to carry to my god but broken vows and a wasted year  nothing can be brought but repentance  yes but look at others who have tried felt their duties and cared for souls while i thought only of my vows as a restraint and tried how much pleasure i could get in spite of them  a pretty story of all the ministry i shall ever have  these last weeks  common humanitynonsense  i should always have done as much besides i was crippled everywhere not merely by want of power as a priest but by having made myself such a shallow thoughtless ass but that was not what i wanted to say  it was about gadley and his confession  o herbert  i am afraid i was very unkind that night  i did not think of anything but our own trouble nor see how much it had cost you  of course notnonsense  you had enough to think of yourself and i was only ashamed of having bored you  and when i think of the state of that room i am afraid it was then you took in the poison  dont say afraid  if it was for jenny i shall have done some good in the world  but the thing isis it good  will it clear douglas  i suppose what he said to you was under seal of confession  scarcely so technically but when a man unburthens himself on his deathbed and then so far from consenting shows terror and dismay at the notion of his words being taken down as evidence it seems to me hardly right or honourable to make use of themthough it would right a great wrong  but what did you get from him  i gave lady rose the paper  he raved most horribly for an hour or two as if all the foul talk of his pothouse had got into his brain said herbert with a shudder  rector rector pray for me that i maynt come out with that at any rate  it has haunted me ever since  well at last he slept and woke up sinking but conscious knew me and began to ask if this was death and was frightened clutching at me and asking to be held and what he could do  i told him at least he could undo a wrong if he would only authorize us to use what he said to clear douglas and then as sister margaret had come across i wrote as well as i could george gadley authorizes what he said to the rev julius charnock to be used as evidence and i suppose he saw us sign it if he could see at all for his sight was nearly gone  julius drew a long breath  and now what was it said herbert  well the triomoy young proudfoot and tom viviandetained a letter of my mothers with a cheque in it and threw the blame of it on archie douglas  they thought no one was in the office but themselves but gadley was a clerk there and was in the outer room where he heard all  he came to moy afterwards and has been preying on him for hushmoney ever since  and this will set things straight  yes  how to set about the public justification i do not yet see but with your father and all the rest archies innocence will be as plain as it always has been to us  where is he  on an ostrich farm at natal  whewwe must have him home  jenny cant be spared  poor jenny when she hears that it will make all other things light to her  what is their address  no dont write  mamma has had a fresh cold and neither my father nor jenny could leave her  let them have a little peace till it gets worse  there will be plenty of time if it is to be a twenty eight days business like the others  poor mamma and he rolled his head away then after some minutes of tossing and shivering he asked for a prayer out of the little book in his pocket  i should know it but my memory is muddled i think  the booka manual for sickroomswas one which julius had given him new five weeks back  it showed wear already having been used as often in that time as in six ordinary years of parish work  by the time the hardpressed doctor came it was plain that the fever was setting in severely aggravated no doubt by the dreadful night at the three pigeons and the unrelaxed exertions ever since for he was made to allow that he had come home in the chill morning air cold sickened and exhausted had not chosen to disturb anybody and had found no refreshment but a raw applethe last drop of wine having been bestowed on the sick had lain down for a short sleep worse than waking and had neither eaten nor slept since but worked on by sheer strength of will and muscle  when julius thought of the cherishing care that he had received himself he shuddered with a sort of selfreproach for his neglect and the doctor though good humouredly telling herbert not to think he knew anything about his own symptoms did not conceal from julius that enough harm had been done in these few days to give the fine bowater constitution a hard struggle  grown careless he said  regular throwing away of his life  careless herbert might have been but julius wondered whether this might not be losing of the life to find it  cranstoun or cranky arrived a charming old nurse much gratified in the midst of her grief and inclination to scold  she summarily sent off mungo and tartar by the conveyance that brought her and would have sent rollo away but that herbert protested against it and no power short of an order from him would have taken the dog from his bedside  and mr bindon returned from wilsbro in unspeakable surprise the heroes of the occasion he said were bowater and mrs duncombe  every sick person i visited and there were fourteen in all stages had something to say of one or other  poor things how their faces fell when they saw me instead of his bright honest face  cheering the very heart of one as a poor woman said thats what i calls a true shepherd said an old man  you dont really mean he was rejected at the ordination  yes and it will make him the still truer shepherd if he is only spared  the sisters cant say enough of him  they thought him very ill yesterday and implored him to take care of himself but he declared he could not leave these two funerals to you  but after all he is less amazing to me than mrs duncombe  she has actually been living at the hospital with the sisters  i should not have known her  great revolutions have happened in your absence  much that has drawn out her sterling worth poor woman  i shall never speak harshly again i hope  it seems to be a judgment on me that i should have been idling on the mountains while those two were thus devoting themselves to my master in his poor  we are thankful enough to have you coming in fresh instead of breaking down now  have you a sermon  you will have to take wilsbro tomorrow  driver wont come  he wrote to the churchwardens that he had a cold and that his agreement was with poor fuller  and you undertook the sunday  yes  they would naturally have no celebration and i thought herberts preaching in the midst of his work would be good for them you never heard such an apology and confession as the boy made to our people the first sunday here begging them to bear with him  then i cant spare you anything here  yes much care and anxiety  the visitation has done its worst in our house  we have got into the lull after the storm and you need not be anxious about me  there is peace in what i have to do now it is gathering the salvage after the wreck  then julius went into his own house where he found terry alone and as usual ravenously hungry  is bowater really ill he asked  i am afraid there is no believing otherwise terry said julius you will have to spare rose to him sometimes till some one comes to nurse him  i would spare anything to him said terry fervently  julius it is finer than going into battle  i thought you did not care much for battles terry  if it was battles i should not mind said the boy it is peaceful soldiering that i have seen too much of  but dont you bother my father julius i wont grumble any more i made up my mind to that  i know you did my boy but you did so much futile arithmetic and so often told us that abc equalled peter the great that dr worth said you must not be put to mathematics for months to come and i have told your father that if he cannot send you to oxford we will manage it  a flush of joy lighted up the boys face  julius you are a brick of a brother he said  ill do my best to get a scholarship  and the best towards that you can do now is to get well as soon as possible  yes  and you lie down on the sofa there julius and sleeprose would say you must  only i want to say one thing more please  if i do get to oxford and you are so good ive made up my mind to one thing  its not only for the learning that ill go but ill try to be a soldier in your army and bowaters  thats all that seems to me worth the doing now  so julius dropped asleep with a thankworthy augury in his ears  it is not triumph but danger and death that lead generous spirits each to step where his comrade stood      chapter xxxii the salvage   frank was certainly better  ever since that sight of eleonora he had been mending  if he muttered her name or looked distressed it was enough to guide his hand to her token he smiled and slept again and on the sunday morning his throat and mouth were so much better that he could both speak and swallow without nearly so much pain but one of his earliest sayings was louder please i cant hear  when does she come  mrs poynsett raised her voice anne tried but he frowned and sighed and only when miles uttered a seacaptains call close to his ear did he smile comprehension adding were you shouting a fact only too evident to those around  then im deaf he said  and anne wrote and set before him we hope it will pass as you get better  he looked grateful but there was little more communication for his eyes and head were still weak and signs and looks were the chief currency however julius met eleonora after morning service to beg her to renew her visit after having first prepared her for what she would find  eleonora was much distressed then paused a minute and said it does him good to see me  it seems to be the one thing that keeps him up said julius surprised at the question  o yes  i canti could not stay away she said  it is all so wrong together yet this last time cannot hurt  last time  yes did you not know that papa has set his heart on going to london tomorrow  yes early tomorrow  and it will be for ever we shall never see sirenwood again  she stood still almost bent with the agony of suppressed grief  i am very sorry but i do not wonder he wishes for change  he has been in an agony to go these three days  it was all i could do to get him to stay today  you dont think it will do frank harm  then i would stay if i took lodgings in the village but otherwisepoor papai think it is my dutyand he cant do without me  i think frank is quite capable of understanding that you are forced to go and that he need not be the worse for it  and then she lowered her voice it does a little reconcile me that i dont think we ought to go further into it till we can understand  i did make that dreadful vow  i know i ought not now but still i did in so many words  you mean against a gambler  if it had only been against a gambler but i was stung and wanted to guard myself and made it against any one who had ever betted if i go on i must break it you see and if i do might it not bring mischief on him  i dont even feel as if it were true to have come to him on friday and nowyet they said it was the only chance for his life  yes i think it saved him then and to disappoint him now might quite possibly bring a relapse said julius  it seems to me that you can only act as seems right at the moment  when he is his own man again you will better have the power of judging about this vow and if it ought to bind you  and so it may really be well you do not see more of him and that his weakness does not lead you further than you mean  a tottering step and an almost agonized though very short sob under the crape veil proved to julius that his counsel though chiming in with her stronger sterner judgment was terrible to her nor would he have given it if he had not had reason to fear that while she had grown up frank had grown down and that after this illness it would have to be proved whether he were indeed worthy of the highminded girl whom he had himself almost thrown over in a passion  but there was no room for such misgivings when the electric shock of actual presence was feltthe thin hollowcheeked face shone with welcome the liquid brown eyes smiled with thankful sweetness the fingers fleshless but cool and gentle were held out and the faint voice said my darling  once try to make me hear  and when with all her efforts she could only make him give a sort of smile of disappointment she would have been stonyhearted indeed if she had not let him fondle her hand as he would while she listened to his mothers report of his improvement  with those eyes fixed in such content on her face it seemed absolutely barbarous to falter forth that she could come no more for her father was taking her away  my dear you must be left with us cried mrs poynsett  he cannot spare you  ah but my poor father  he is lost without me  and i came of age on tuesday and there are papers to sign  what is it murmured frank watching their faces  mrs poynsett gave her the pen saying you must tell him if it is to be  she wrote  my father takes me to london tomorrow to meet the lawyers  his face fell but he asked coming backwhen  she shook her head and her eyes filled with tears as she wrote sirenwood is to be put up to auction  your sister began frank and then his eye fell on her crape trimmings  he touched her sleeve and made a low wail  oh is every one dead  it was the first perception he had shown of any death though mourning had been worn in his room  his mother leant down to kiss him bidding lena tell him the truth and she wrote  i am left alone with poor papa  let me gonow you can do without me  can i he asked again grasping her hand  she pointed to his mother and anne but he repeated youyou  when you are better we will see how it is to be she wrote  he looked sadly wistful  no i cant now  something was very wrong but it wont come back  by and by  if you wouldnt go  but his voice was now more weak and weary tired by the effort and a little kneeling by him allowing his tender touch soothed him enough to say submissively goodbye thenill come for you wherewith he faltered into slumber  rosamond had just seen her off in the pony carriage and was on the way upstairs when she stumbled on a little council consisting of dr worth mr charnock and grindstone all in the gallery  a widow in her twentysecond year  good heavens was the echo she heard and grindstone was crying and saying she did it for the best and she could not do it poor lamb not if you killed her for it and dr worth said perhaps lady rosamond can  you see lady rosamond mrs grindstone whose care i must say has been devoted has hitherto staved off the sad question from poor young mrs poynsett until now it is no longer possible and she is becoming so excited that  cecils bell rang sharply  i cannoti cannot  in her twentysecond year cried her father wringing his hands  grindstones face was all tears and contortions and rosamond recollecting her last words with poor cecil sprang forward both men opening a way for her  cecil was sitting up in bed very thin but with eager eyes and flushed cheeks as she held out her hands  rosamond  oh  but arent you afraid  no indeed im always in it now said rosamond kissing her and laying her down it has been everywhere  ah then they sent him awayraymond then clutching rosamonds hand and looking at her with searching eyes tell me has his mother any right  would you bear it if she kept you apart  ah  cecil it was not her doing  you dont mean it was his own  papa is not afraid  you are not afraid  if it had been he i wouldnt have feared anything  i would have nursed him day and night tilltill i made him care for me  hush dear cecil said rosamond with great difficulty  i know you would and so would he have done for you only the cruel fever kept you apart  the fever  he had it  yes he had it  but he is better  i am better  let me be taken to him  his mother is not there now  i heard them say she was in franks room call papa  he will carry me  oh poor poor cecil  his mother only went to frank when he did not need her any more  and rosamond hid her face on the bed afraid to look  cecil lay back so white that grindstone approached with some drops but this made her spring up crying no no dont come near me you never told me  you deceived me  dont dont maammy dear miss charnocknow  it was all for the best  you would not have been here now  and then i should be with him  rosamond send her away i cant bear her  she sent him away from me that night  i heard her  my dear cecil this will not do  you are making your father dreadfully unhappy  dear raymond stayed with you till he really could not sit up any longer and then he kissed you  kissed me  oh where  did you see  no dont ask grindstone she made me think he had left me and fancyoh rosamond such such things  and all the time  the moaning became an anguish of distress unable to weep like terrible pain as the poor young thing writhed in rosamonds arms it was well that this one sister understood what had been in cecils heart and did believe in her love for raymond  rosamond too had caressing power beyond any other of the family and thus she could better deal with the sufferer striving above all to bring tears by what she whispered to her as she held her to her bosom  they were a terrible storm at last but cecil clung to rosamond through all absolutely screaming when grindstone came near poor grindstone who had been so devoted though mistaken  weakness however after the first violent agitation was soothed favoured a kind of stunned torpor and cecil lay still except when her maid tried to do anything for her and then the passion returned  when old susan alston came with a message she was at once recognized and monopolized and became the only servant whom she would suffer about her  the inconvenience was great but relapse was such an imminent danger that it was needful to give up everything to her and mr charnock regarding his daughters sufferings as the only ones worth consideration seemed to pursue rosamond the instant she had sat down by the still feeble weary convalescent terry imploring her to return to cecil with the irresistible force of tearful eyes and piteous descriptions and as terry had a weeks start in recovery and was not a widow under twentytwo he had to submit and lie as contentedly as he could in his solitude  susan could be better spared to cecils morbid fancy of being waited on by her who had attended her husband for miles and anne were sufficient for mrs poynsett and frank  the longsundered husband and wife scarcely saw each other except over franks bed and mr charnock was on the captains hands whenever he came beyond it  on the wednesday however julius who had only once spoken to his brother alone came up to the breakfasttable where he and mr charnock were sitting and hurt the feelings of the latter by first asking for frank  he had slept all night and only half woke when miles and anne changed watch and gave him beeftea  cecil very moaning and restlessmore fever about her poor dear  when would lady rosamond come upshe was asking for her  when she had seen to a few things at home given her brother his breakfast and seen to poor herbert he had had a dreadful night and that cranstoun would shut the window unless some one defended him  mr charnock began to resume his daughters symptoms when julius at the first pause said  have you finished miles  could you speak to me in the library a minute  i beg your pardon mr charnock but my time is short  i hopei quite understand  do not let me be in your way  and the brothers repaired to the library where juliuss first words were miles you must make up your mind  they are getting up a requisition to you to stand for wilsbro  to me  you are the most obvious person and the feeling for dear raymond is so strong as to prevent any contest  whitlock told bindon yesterday that you should have no trouble  i cant  it is absurd  i know nothing about it  my poor mother bred up raymond for nothing else  dont you remember how she made him read history volumes upon volumes while i was learning nothing but the ropes  i declare julius there he goes  who  why that old ass down to hunt up poor rosamond i dont believe he thinks theres any one in the world but his daughter  i declare ill hail him and stop him  no no miles rosamond can take care of herself  she wont come till she has seen to her patients down there and after all cecils is the saddest case poor thing  to return  if you dont take to politics in the end i think you should let them put you in now if only as a stopgap or we shall get some one whom it may not be easy to get rid of  theres something in that but i cant accept without knowing my position and i would not utter a word to disturb my mother till it occurs to her of herself  now that frank is better  no  it will all come on her soon enough  would you stand if she made it right for you  i cant tell  there would be no punishment so great to my poor anne as to be dragged into society and i dont know how she would bear it even if she had no scruples  we never thought of anything but settling in glen fraser only i wanted her to know you all  if that poor cecil only had a child we could be free to go back  poor anne  do you think she is still as homesick as at first  well not quite perhaps but i never can get to talk to her and i know it is a terrible sacrifice to her to live here at all and i wont have her forced into a style of thing against her conscience if they come to me i shall tell them to take mr bowater  poor mr bowater  he will have little heart  who else is there  that fellow moy would like it i suppose  that fellow moy may have to change his note said julius  i think we have the means of clearing archie when we can see how to use them  miles gave a sort of leap as he stood by the fire  tell me archie  i had no heart to write to him poor fellow  write to him by all means but say nothing here  and julius briefly repeated what gadley had said  i dont see that the scoundrel moy deserves any consideration  i dont know whether he does but he has a good wife ailing and sickly and a daughter  he has lived in good report these many years and i think it is due to him and to old proudfoot not to spread the report before giving him warning  in fact i am not sure whether we could proceed against him as things stand  it is just what raymond would have known said miles with a sigh but you are right julius one ought to give him fair play  ah whats that jenkinsnote from lord belfort  wait for an answer cant they give one any peace  while miles was reluctantly answering his note julius resolving to act before he was forbidden mounted to franks room requested to speak with his mother and propelled her into the outer room leaving anne on guard  now then my dear she said i have known a talk must soon come you have all been very good to me to leave it so long  i am come now without poor miless knowledge or consent said julius because it is necessary for him to know what to do  he will give up the navy said his mother  o julius does he require to be told that he and she laid her head on her sons shoulder  it is what he cannot bear to be told but what drives me on is that whitlock tells me that the wilsbro people want to bring him in at once as the strongest proof of their feeling for raymond  yes she raised her head proudly of course he must come forward he need have no doubt  send him to me julius i will tell him to open letters and put matters in train  perhaps you will write to graves for me if he does not like it poor boy  she had roused herself into the woman of business and when miles after some indignation at her having been disturbed obeyed the summons she held out her arms and became the consoler  come my boy she said we must face it sooner or later  you must stand foremost and take up his work for him  oh mother mother you know how little i am able said miles covering his face with his hands  you do not bring his burthened heart to the task she said  if you had watched and felt with him as perhaps only his mother could you would know that i can be content that the long heartache should have ceased where the weary are at rest  yes miles i feel as if i had put him to sleep after a long day of pain as when he was a little child  they hardened themselves to the discussion mrs poynsett explaining what she thought the due of her eldest son only that cecils jointure would diminish the amount at her disposal  indeed when she was once aroused she attended the most fully but when miles found her apologizing for only affording him the little house in the village he cried out with consternation  my dear she said it is best so i will not be a burthen on you young ones  i see the mistake  i know stammered miles my poor anne is not up to your marknot clever like you or jennybut i thought you did like her pretty handy ways  i feel them and love them with all my heart but i cannot have her happiness and yours sacrificed to me  yes you boys love the old nest but even julius and rose rejoice in their own and you must see what she really wishes not what she thinks her duty  take her out walking you both need it badly enough  they ventured to comply and eluding mr charnock went into the park silvery with the unstanched dews and the leaves floating down one by one like golden rain  not much like the bush said miles  no was all anne durst say  poor nan how dreary it must have looked to you last year  i am afraid i wrote very complaining letters  not complaining but a direful little effort at content showing the more piteously because involuntarily what a mistake i had made  no no mistake  indeed miles it was not  nothing else would have cured me of the dreadful uncharitableness which was the chief cause of my unhappiness and if i had not been so forlorn i should never have seen how good and patient your mother was with me  yes i mean it  i read over my old diary and saw how tiresome and presumptuous i was and how wonderfully she bore with me and so did julius and rosamond while all the time i fancied themno christians  ah you child  you know i would never have done it if i had known you were to be swamped among brides  at any rate this poor old place doesnt look so woefully dismal and hateful to you now  it could not where you are and where i have so many to know and love  you can bear the downfall of our bush schemes  your duty is here now  are you grieved little one  i dont know  i should like to have seen mamma but she does not need me now as your mother does  then you are willing to be her daughter  i have tried hard and she is very kind but i am far too dull and ignorant for her  i can only wait upon her but when she has you and julius to talk to my stupidity will not matter  would you be content to devote yourself to her instead of making a home of our own  she cant be left alone in that great house  the question is can you be happy in it or do you wish for a house to ourselves  you dont miles it is your own home  thats not the question  miles why do you look at me so  i was told to ascertain your wishes  i dont wish anythingnow i have youbut to be a comfort to your mother  that is my first earthly wish just now  if that be earthly it has a touch of the heavenly muttered miles to himself  you will make it clear to mother then that you like to go on with her  if she does not mind having me  and julius says it really cheered our dear raymond to think you would be the one to look after her  but thats not all nanny ive only till tomorrow to decide whether i am to be member for wilsbro  is that a duty  not such a duty as to bind me if it were altogether repugnant to you  i was not brought up for it and may be a mere stopgap but it is every mans duty to come to the front when he is called for and do his utmost for his country in parliament i suppose as much as in action  i see but it would be leaving your mother alone a great deal  not necessarily  you could stay here part of the time and i go backwards and forwards as raymond did before his marriage  it would be better than your being at sea  but remember he added there is much that cant be shirked  i dont mean currying popularity but if one is in that position theres no shutting oneself up  it becomes a duty to keep society going and give it the sort of tone that a nice woman can do  do you see  i think i do  julius said so once  so if we are to have such tears and despair as there were about the ball in the chimaera then  i was wrong then said anne  i did not behave at all well to you all that time dear miles i have been sorry for it ever since i understood  it was not you little one it was mr pilgrim  no it was not mr pilgrim who made me cross  yes it was  he exacted pledges that he had no right to lay on your conscience and your poor little conscience was in terrible straits and i was too angry to feel for it  never mind all that you have done with the fellow and understand better now  he thought he was right and that only such abstinence could guard me  and miles a promise is a promise and i do not think i ought to dance or play at cards  it is not that i think them wrong for others but i cannot break my word  except thosei will do whatever is fitting for your wife  spoken like a heroine  i dont think i could ever give a tone  rosamond could if she tried but i have no readiness and no training but i do see that there is more good in being friendly like jenny bowater than in avoiding everything and as long as one does it because it is right and loving it cant be the world or worldliness  it was not lucidly expressed but it satisfied the captain  all right my bonnie nance ill promise on my side never to ask you to go against your real conscience and if you must have a pope i had rather it were pope julius than pope pilgrim  dont miles  popes are all wrong and i dont know whether mr pilgrim would give the right hand of fellowship to julius  miles chuckled  you may think yourself lucky you have not to adjust that question madame nan  theres the quarter chiming frank will want his beeftea  presently after miles laid his hand on his mothers shoulder and said mother heres a daughter who thinks you want to turn us out because she is too slow and stupid for your home child  and he drew anne up blushing as if she were his freshlywon bride  my dear are you sure you dont want to go away from the old woman should you not be happier with him all to yourself  i could not be happy if you were left said anne  may i go on as we did last winter  i will try to do better now i have him to help me  my own dear child  that was the way anne forgot her own people and her fathers house      chapter xxxiii herberts victory   and of our scholars let us learn our own forgotten lorekeble  joan jenny dearest old joanie  it was eagerly spoken though the voice was strangely altered that came from behind the flowered curtain of that big bed while the fingers drew it back and rollo raised his black muzzle near at hand  oh jenny have you come to me  my dear dear poor boy  no kissingits not safe and he burrowed under the sheet  as if i did not mean to do more for you than that  besides it is not catching  so i said till it caught me  what a jolly cold hand  youve not come in cold and hungry though  no indeed rosamond forced me to sit down to a whole spread  as if one could eat with a knot in ones throat  mind you do jennyit was what did for me  the rector ordered me never to go about unfed but one could not alwaysand there was something i have to tell you that drove all the rest out  dear herbs  papa cant talk of what you have done without tears he longed to come but we could not leave mamma without one of us and he thought i could do the most for you  i have a note for you  forgiving me  i should think so  it is in my bag  no not this moment i like to know it  and mammypoor mammy  she is as comforted as she can be that you have cranky and me and then papas being proud of you has cheered heroh so much  im glad they can comfort themselves  but herbert dear you must be much better i did not expect to see you so well  i am not so bad between whiles said herbert wearily  and while i can ive got something to tell you that will make it up to you and a great deal more  make it up said jenny looking with bewildered eyes at the dear face  yes i made gadley consent  the rector has it in writing and it will do quite as well if i die  o jenny woman think of my never knowing what you had gone through  is it about archie said jenny beginning to tremble  yes  it will clear him  i always knew he was clear  yes but he can come back now all right  eh what an ass i am ive begun at the wrong end  he wasnt drownedit was all a mistake miles saw him in africacranky i say come to her  yes master herbert youve been talking a great deal too much for your sister just off a journey  youll get the fever on again miss joanna you ought to know better than to let him run on i shant be able to let you do nothing for him if this is the way  was it too sudden joan said herbert wistfully as she bent to kiss his brow with trembling lips  i couldnt let any one tell you but myself while i could but i dont seem able to go on  is the rector there cranky  yes sir waiting in the parlour  rector and julius hurried in at once take her and tell her  i cant do it after all  is he alive whispered jenny so much overcome that julius had to hold her up for a moment as he led her into the other room  really  she thinks me delirious said herbert rather amused tell her all rector  really joan said julius putting her into the great chair and holding her trembling hand  miles has seen him has had him in his ship  and you never told me  he made miles promise not to tell  but he told you  yes because it was anne who gave the clue which led to his discovery but when he found we all thought him dead he laid miles under the strictest charge to say nothing  he is on an ostrich farm in natal jenny well and all that he ever was and more too  he took your photograph from miless book  and i never knew moaned jenny quite overcome  he would not be persuaded that it was not more for your peace not to know of his life and when miles was put on honour what could we do  but now it is all changed  since herberts discovery he need not be a banished man any more  and julius told jenny the manner of the discovery  she listened evidently gathering all in and then she asked  and what have you done  nothing as yet  nothing while there is this blot on archies name and he is living in exile and that moy is revelling in prosperity  nothing why dont you publish it to every one  my dear jenny i have only known it a week and i have not been able to find out where mr moy is  what to have him taken up  taken up no i dont imagine he could be prosecuted after this length of time and on this kind of evidence  no to give him warning  warning  to flee away and never clear archie  what are you about julius  he ought to be exposed at once if he cannot be made to suffer otherwise  nay jenny that would be hard measure  hard measure she interrupted what has my innocent archie had  think of the old man his wife and daughter jenny  shes a proudfootand that girl the scandal of the country  you want to sacrifice archie to them julius  you are tired and shaken jenny or you would see that all i want to do is to act with common consideration and honour  she interrupted again  what honour do you mean  you are not making it a secret of the confessional  you are misunderstanding me joanna julius gently said herberts vigil spared me from that difficulty but  then you would have sacrificed archie to this imaginary  hush jenny  i fear he is wandering again  alas it is the sad old refrain  as they came to the door together herberts voice under that strange change which wandering brings was heard muttering give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward and mrs cranstoun received them with her head shaking and tearful eyes  it has come on again sir i was afraid it would be too much for him  herberts prayer had been granted inasmuch as the horrible ravings that he feared repeating never passed his lips  if he had gone down to the smoke of tartarus to restore his sisters lover none of its blacks were cleaning to him but whether conscious or wandering the one thought of his wasted year seemed to be crushing him  it was a curious contrast between poor mr fullers absence of regret for a quarter of a centurys supineness and this lads repentance for twelve months idleness  that his follies had been guileless in themselves might be the very cause that his spirit had such power of repentance  his admiration of lady tyrrell had been burnt out and had been fancy not heart and no word of it passed his lips far less of the mirth with the strangeways  habit sometimes brought the phrases of the cricketfield but these generally ended in a shudder of selfrecollection and prayer  the delirium only came with the accesses of fever and when sensible he was very quiet and patient but always as one weighed down by sense of failure in a trust  he never seemed to entertain a hope of surviving  he had watched too many cases not to be aware that his symptoms were those that had been almost uniformly fatal and he noted them as a matter of course  dr easterby came to see him and was greatly touched herbert was responsive but it was not the ordinary form of comfort that he needed for his sorrow was neither terror nor despair  his heart was too warm and loving not to believe that his heavenly father forgave him as freely as did his earthly father but that very hope made him the more grieved and ashamed of his slurred task nor did he view his six weeks at wilsbro as any atonement knowing it was no outcome of repentance but of mere kindliness and aware as no one else could be how his past negligence had hindered his full usefulness so that he only saw his failures  as to his young life he viewed it as a mortally wounded soldier does as a mere casualty of the war which he was pledged to disregard  he did perhaps like to think that the fatal night with gadley might bring archie back and yet jenny did not give him the full peace in her happiness which he had promised himself  joanna had suffered terribly far more than any one knew and her mind did not take the revulsion as might have been expected  her lighthouse was shining again when she thought it extinguished for ever but her spirits could not bear the uncertainty of the spark she could not enter into what miles and julius both alike told her of the impossibility of their mother beginning a prosecution for money embezzled ten years back when no living witness existed nothing but the scrap of paper written by herbert and signed by him and margaret strangeways authorizing julius charnock to use what had been said by the dying halfdelirious man  what would a jury say to such evidence  and when julius said it only freed himself morally from the secrecy poor jenny was bitter against his scruples even though he had never said more than that he should have been perplexed  the most bitter antiritualist could hardly have uttered stronger things than she thought and sometimes said against what seemed to her to be keeping archie in banishment while the brothers reluctance to expose mr moy and blast his reputation and that of his family was in her present frame of mind an incomprehensible weakness  people must bear the penalty of their misdeeds families and all and mrs and miss moy did not deserve consideration  the pretensions of the mother had always been half scorn half thorn to the old county families and the fast airs of the daughter had been offensive enough to destroy all pity for her if an action in a court of justice were as miles and julius told her impossibleand she would not believe it except on the word of a lawyerpublic exposure was the only alternative for righting archie and she could not or would not understand that they would have undergone an action for libel rather than not do their best to clear their cousin but that they thought it due to mr moy to give him the opportunity of doing the thing himself she thought it folly and only giving him time and chance for baffling them  the strange thing was that not only when she argued with the two brothers but when she brooded and gave way to these thoughts as she kept her watch it probably made her less calmfor an access of restlessness and fever never failed to come onwith herbert probably she was less calm externally and the fret of face and manner communicated itself to him for the consequences were so invariable that cranstoun thought they proved additionally what she of course believed that miss joan could not be trusted with her brother  at last jenny in her distress and unwillingness to abandon herbert to crankys closed windows traced cause and effect and made a strong resolution to banish the allpervading thought and indeed his everincreasing weakness and danger filled her mind so as to make this easier and easier so that she might no longer have to confess to herself that rollo was a safer companion since herbert with a hand on that black head certainly only derived soothing influences from those longing sympathetic eyes  and he could not but like the testimony of strong affection that came to him  the whole parish was in consternation and inquiries and very odd gifts which he was supposed to fancy came from all over compton as well as from strawyers and were continually showering upon his nurses so that mrs hornblower and dilemma spent their lives in mournful replies over the counter and fifty times a day he was pronounced to be as bad as he could be to be alive  old servants and keepers made progresses from strawyers to see master herbert and were terribly aggrieved because miss bowater kept them out of his room as much for their sake as his and mrs cranstoun pointed to the open lattice which she believed to be killing him as surely as it gave aches to her rheumatic shoulder  julius thought almost as much as jenny could do of the means of recalling archie but it was necessary to wait until he could communicate with mr moy and his hands were still overfull for though much less fatal the fever smouldered on both in wilsbro and compton and as st nicholas was a college living which had hitherto been viewed as a trump card it might be a long time going the round of the senior fellows  julius had just been at poor mrs fullers trying to help her to put her complicated affairs in order so as to be ready for a move as soon as one daughter who had the fever slightly could be taken away and he was driving home again when he overtook mrs duncombe and offered her a lift for her step was weary  she was indeed altered pale with cheekbones showing and all the lustre and sparkle gone out of her while her hat was as rigidly dowdy as miss slaters  she roused herself to ask feebly after the remaining patients  cecil is really getting better at last he said  her father wants to take her to portishead next week  and young bowater  no change  his strength seems to be going  i wouldnt pity him sighed bessie duncombe he has only seen the best end of life and has laid it down for something worth  im sure he and your brother are the enviable ones  nay mrs duncombe you have much to work for and love in this life  and i must go away from everything just as i had learnt to value it  bob has taken a house at monaco and writes to me to bring the children to join him there  at monaco  at monaco  yes and i know that it is all my own fault  i might have done anything with him if i had known how  but what could you expect  i never saw my mother i never knew a home i was bred up at a french school where if one was not a roman catholic there was not a shred of religion going  i married after my first ball nobody taught me anything but i could not help having brains so i read and caught the tone of the day and made my own line while he went on his  and now there is a greater work for you to do since you have learnt to do it  ah learnt too late  when habits are confirmed and home station forfeitedwhat is there left for him or my poor boys to do  a colony perhaps  damaged goods she said smiling sadly  then are you going  as soon as i have seen this fever out and can dispose of the things here  i have just been to moys office to see about getting rid of the lease  is mr moy come home  yes  have you not heard  whatnot the fever  no  worse i should say  gussie has gone off and got married to harry simmonds  the man at the training stables  yes  they put up their banns at the union at brighton and were married by the registrar then went off to paris  they say it will kill her mother  the man is a scoundrel who played bob false and won largely by that mare  and the girl has had the cheek to write to me said mrs duncombe warming into her old phraseologyto meto thank me for opportunities of meeting and to tell me she has followed up the teaching of last year  whatthe rights of women  ay  this is a civil marriagenot mocking her with antiquated servile vows she says  ah well it was my doing i suppose clio tallboys held forth in private i believe to poor gussie on theories that were mere talk in her but which this poor girl has taken in earnest  very sad earnest she may find it i fear  can i do anything for you as they reached the gate of aucuba villa  no thank you unless to get the house off my hands  you are alone  will you not come and spend the evening with us  that is very kind but i have too much to do and besides sister margaret is coming to spend the night with me  i am glad to hear it  yes mr charnock i trust i have learnt something in this spell of work  ive not been for nothing in such scenes with those sisters and young bowater  im more ignorant than half the poor things that ive heard talk of their faith and hope but i see it is not the decorous humbug it once looked like  and now that i would have learnt here i go to monaco  you will learn  you have a work before you that will teach you  my boys are young enough to start with on a different tack she said  you will tell menoill not hinder you now  i shall see you again  julius was too anxious to get home to refuse to be released much as he felt for this brave woman  the day before herbert had been frightfully faint and exhausted by the mornings attack of fever but had been so still ever since that there was a shade of hope that the recurrence might not take place and this hope grew stronger when jenny came into the outer room to say that the usual time for the fever was passing so quietly in a sort of sleep that dr worth seemed to think rally possible if only there was no fresh access  they stood over the fire and julius asked cant you lie on the sofa jenny  i can stay  no said jenny restlessly  no i cant  i know you have something to tell me  moy has come home jenny  he is in terrible trouble  his daughter has eloped with young simmonds at the training stables  the most appropriate end of her bringing up said jenny in the hard tone it was so difficult to answerit was so unlike herself and her thought was that weak pity and forbearance would hinder exertions in archies cause  generous at other folks expense said she to herself  sparing the guilty and leaving the innocent to exile  but a moaning murmur and cranstouns movement at once summoned them both to the bedside  alas here was the attack that the doctor had evidently apprehended as likely to be fatal  hour after hour did sister nurse and friend stand watching and doing their best their piteously little best while consciousness if there was any was far out of their reach  late into the night it went on and then followed the collapse with locked teeth which could hardly be drawn asunder to put the stimulus hopelessly between them and thus came the tardy december dawn when the churchbell made jenny bid julius not stay but only first read the commendatory prayer  i thought there was a little more revival just now he said his hands are warmer and he really did swallow  the old nurse shook her head  thats the way before they go said she  dont ye wish him poor lamb it makes it the harder for him  julius prayed the prayer and as he tenderly laid his hand on the brow he wondered whether he should find the halfclosed eyes shut for ever on his return  but as he went there was a quiver of lip and flicker of eyelid the lightening as cranky called it was evidently gaining ground herberts faint whisper was heard againjenny  dearest  the lords prayer  she beganhis fingers tightened on hers  pray it for old moy he said and as she paused scarce hearing or understanding hehe wants it gasped herbert  no  one cant pray it without another pause  help me jenny  say ito lord who savedst us forgive us  help us to forgive from our hearts that man his trespasses  amen  jenny said it  herberts voice sank in the amen  he lay breathing in long gasps but he thus breathed still when julius came back and jenny told him that a few words had passed adding  julius i will say nothing bitter again  god help me not to think it  did herbert hear  was that the reason of the calm which made the white wasted face so beautiful and the strange soft cool hush throughout the room      chapter xxxiv silver hair   and how should i your true love know from another manfriar of orders gray  please god i can try again  those were the words with which herbert bowater looked into his rectors face on awaking in the evening of that same december day from one of a series of sleeps each sweeter and longer than the last and which had borne him over the dreaded hours without fever and with strengthening pulse  julius had not ventured to leave the sickroom that whole day and when at last he went home and sank into the chair opposite terry for the first time through all these weeks of trouble and tension he burst into a flood of tears  he had hardly made the startled lad understand that life not death had thus overcome him when the door flew open and in rushed rosamond crying julius julius come  it is he or his ghost  who  what  it is your hair  at mrs douglass grave  hell be gone  make hastemake haste  he started up letting her drag him along but under protest  my dear men do come to have hair like mine  i tell you it was at our gravesour owni touched him  i had this wreath for raymond and there he was with his hat off at the railing close to mrs douglass  i thought his back was yours and called your name and he started and i sawhe had a white beard but he was not old  he just bowed and then went off very fast by the other gate towards wilsbro  i did call wait wait but he didnt seem to hear  oh go go julius  make haste  infected by the wild hope julius hurried on the road where his wife had turned his face almost deriding himself for obeying her when he would probably only overtake some old family retainer but as under the arch of trees that overhung the road he saw a figure in the moonlight a thrill of recognition came over him as he marked the vigorous tread of the prime of life and the white hair visible in the moonlight together with something utterly indescribable but which made him call out archie  archie douglas wait for me  the figure turned  julius came in response the two cousins hands clasped and there was a sob on either side as they kissed one another as brothers  archie  how could youcome back was all that julius could say leaning breathlessly against him and holding him tight  no  do not know that i have been here  i was sent to london on business  i could not help running home in the dark  no one must know it  i am dead to them  no archie you are not  gadley has confessed and cleared you come home  cleared me  the two arms were stretched up to the sky and there was the sound of a mighty sob as though the whole man body soul and spirit were relieved from an unspeakable burthen  say it again julius  gadley on his deathbed has confessed that moy and proudfoot took that money incited by tom vivian  archie douglas could not speak but he turned his face towards compton again strode swiftly into the churchyard and fell on his knees by his mothers grave  when at last he rose he pointed to the new and as yet unmarked mound and said your mothers  oh no  raymonds  we have had a terrible fever herealmost a pestilenceand we are scarcely breathing after it  ah some one in the train spoke of sickness at wilsbro but i would ask no questions for i saw faces i knew and i would lead to no recognition  i could not stay away from getting one sight of the old place  miles made it all burn within me but heres my return ticket for the mailtrain  never mind returntickets  come home with me  i shall startle your mother  i meant my homethe rectory  it was my wife who saw you in the churchyard and sent me after you  she is watching for you  archie still bewildered as if spellbound by his ticket muttered i thought i should have time to walk over and look at strawyers  joanna is here  julius  it is too much  you are sure i am awake  this is not the old dream cried the exile grasping his cousins arm quite gainfully  i am a waking man and i trust you are said julius  come into the light  no that is not jenny on the step  it is my rose  yes here he is  and as they came into the stream of light from the porch irish rosamond forgetting that archie was not a brother caught him by both hands and kissed him in overpowering welcome exclaiming oh i am so glad  come income in  there he stood blinking in the lamplight a tall powerful broad chested figure but hardly a hero of romance to suit terrys fancy after a rapid summary of the history from rosamond  his hair and beard were as white as juliuss and the whole face was tanned to uniform red but no one could mistake the dazed yet intense gladness of the look  he sank into a chair clasped his hands over his face for a moment then surveyed them all one by one and said you told me she was here  she is with her brother herbert at mrs hornblowers lodgings no you must wait archie he has barely in the last few hours by gods great mercy taken a turn for the better in this fever and i dont see how she can leave him  but she must hear it cried rosamond  im going to make her or cranky get some rest but you ought to be the one to tell her julius you that have stood by her through all  and arent you burning to do so rosey woman and i think you had better rather than that i should startle herbert by returning but stay mind your own ruleseat and drink before you go and give the same to archie  i shall send up a note to miles  how is cecil  very silent and broken poor thing  she is to see your mother to morrow  how well it was that she kept me so late over her wreath of camellias  archie submitted to wait for food and fuller informationindeed the lady of the house manifested more impatience than he did as she flitted about making preparations and he sat with hands locked together over his knee gazing fixedly at julius scarcely speaking though eagerly listening and when the meal was brought in he could not eat only eagerly drank off a cup of scalding tea and watched rosamond as if jealous of any delay over her cutlet  she did not abuse his patience  now then she said rising  you shall hear something of her before long  let me come to her door entreated archie  and as the light shone from the window of the sickroom rosamond said stand under that tree in the moonlight and i will make her look out  all was intensely quiet cranky fast asleep in the armchair in the outerroom and jenny sitting by the bed watching the smooth quiet breath  you are to lie down on the sofa and sleep said rosamond kissing her and she shook her head you must  people want strength for joy as well as grief  trust him to me for there is some one for you to see tomorrow  not papa said jenny startled  no nor phil  tell me rosamond  there is only one you could look at me like that for  look out at the window  trembling all over jenny went and put her face to the lattice  the figure under the tree came nearer  archie must have been able clearly to see her face in the moonlight  he stretched up his arms to her then folded them together on his breast and let himself be led away by julius while jenny slid down on her knees with her face buried and the suppressed choking sobs made herbert look up at rosamond and whisper it is  it is repeated rosamond who had thought him asleep or entirely absorbed in the trouble of living  go to her he added  rosamond put her arm round her and supported her into the next room for after the month of hopeless watching the long sleeplessness and the struggle of this silent day to force her spirit to the forgiveness she had promised and then the sudden reaction had overpowered her and the suppression and silence were beyond endurance  she did not even know that herbert was awake when rosamond brought her out into mrs hornblowers room and said have it out now my dear no one will hear  scream comfortably it will do you good  but jenny could not even scream  she was in the excited agony when the mind is far too much for the body and joy unrealized is like grief  if her brother had that day passed away and if nothing had been heard of her lover she would have been all calmness and resignation but the revulsion had overcome her and at the moment she was more conscious of strangulation than of anything else rosamond tended her for full half an hour and then she seemed almost asleep though she resisted the attempt to undress her with the words i must go to herbert  i will take care of herbert and jenny was too much spent not to acquiesce and fell asleep almost before she was laid down on the bed their landlady had given up to the watchers  rosamonds task was a comfortable one for every hour of sleep every mouthful of food seemed to do its work of restoration on the sound healthy frame and a smile and word of thanks met her whenever she roused her patient with the inevitable spoon  when he awoke towards morning he asked what day it was and when she told him answered so i thought  then i have not lost count of time  no you have been wonderfully clearheaded  i cant see how there can have been time to write he said  it is true that he is come is it not  quite true but he came independently on business and rosamond told of juliuss chase bringing a look of amusement on his face  jenny came in with the rising sun pale indeed but another creature after her rest and in the sight of the restful countenance that greeted her with a smile  the moaning hoarse voice was gone too it was a faint shadow of herberts own tones that said is not this good jenny  i didnt think to have seen it  my herbert you have given him back  you have given me the heart to be glad  you must go and see him said herbert  jenny looked wistful and undecided but julius entered to say that she must come at once for archie must go back to london by the ten oclock train to an appointment and could not return for two days  herbert smiled her away for he was still in a state where it was not possible to bear any engrossing of his headnurse and the lovers absence was even to his unselfishness good news  rosamond could not refrain from the pleasure of peeping down the little dark stair as archie and his jenny met in the doorway and she walked demurely in their rear wondering whether other eyes saw as much as she did in the manner in which jenny hung on his arm she left them to their dewy walk in the rectory garden to the last minute at which breakfast could be swallowed and told jenny that she was to drive him in the ponycarriage to hazletts gate she would take care of herbert  you ought to be asleep you know said jenny  my dear i couldnt sleep  theres a great deal better than sleep is not herbert going to get well and arent you jolly again and archie back again  sleepwhy i want to have wings and clap them and more than all is not mr charnock off and away tomorrow sleep indeedi should like to see myself so stupid  mr charnock interrogatively said archie  the head of the familythe original charnock of dunstone said rosamond who was in wild spirits coming on a wornout body and mind and therefore perfectly unguarded  dont shake your head at me jenny archie is one of the family and that makes you so and i must tell you of his last performance  you know he is absolutely certain that his dear daughter is more infallible than all the popes even since the council or than anybody but himself and that whatever goes wrong here is the consequence of juliuss faith in dr easterby  so when poor cecil uneasy in her mind began asking about the illness at wilsbro he enlivened her with a prose about misjudging through wellintentioned efforts of clerical philanthropy to interfere with the sanitary condition of the town so that wells grew tainted c all from ignorant interference poor man he heard a little sob and looked round and there was cecil in a dead faint  he set all the bells ringing and sent an express for me  but wasnt he furious with anne for mentioning drains at all  my dear joan dont you know how many old women there are of both sorts who wont let other people look over the wall at what they gloat on in private  however he had his punishment for he really thought that the subject had been too much for her delicacy and simply upset her nerves  when was this  four or five days ago  she is better but has said not a word more about it  she is nothing like strong enough even for so short a journey as to portishead but they say change will be the best thing for her and the coming down into the family would be too sad  poor thing  yes indeed said jenny and feeling universally benevolent she added give her my love a thing which so sincere a person could hardly have said a few weeks ago  reserve was part of cecils nature and besides her father was almost always with her but when she had been for the first time dressed in crape up to her waist with the tiniest of caps perched toylike on the top of her passive head the sight upset him completely and muttering good heavensa widow at twentytwo he hid himself from the sight over some business transactions with mrs poynsett and miles  rosamond seized the opportunity of bringing julius in to pay his farewell visit and presently cecil said julius i should be much obliged if you would tell me the real facts about this illness  do said rosamond  her half knowledge is most wearing  he gently told her what science had pronounced  then it was pettitts well she said  they tell us that this was the immediate cause of the outbreak but there would probably have been quite as much fatal illness the first time any infectious disease came in  the whole place was in a shameful state and you were the only people who tried to mitigate it  and did worse harm because we would not listen to advice said cecil  julius i have a great deal of money cant i do anything now  my father wants me to give a donation to the church as a memorial of him but somehow i dont feel as if i deserved to do that  i see what you mean cecil but the town is being rated to set the drainage to rights and it will thus be done in the most permanent and effectual way  there are some orphans who might be saved from the union about whom i thought of asking you to help  cecil asked the details of the orphans and the consultation over them seemed to be prolonged by her because even now she could not resolve to go below the surface  it lasted until her father came to ask whether she were ready to go with him to mrs poynsetts sittingroom  she looked very fragile and childish as she stood up clinging to his arm to help her wavering uncertain step holding out her hand to julius and saying i shall see you again  he was a little disappointed to see her no older and no warmer having gone thus far it seemed as if she might have gone further and opened more  perhaps he did not understand how feelings naturally slow were rendered slower by the languor of illness which made them more oppressive than acute  as mr charnock and his daughter knocked the door was opened by miles who merely gave his hand and went down  frank who had been reading in a low easy chair by the fire drew it close to his mother for her and retreated to another seat and the mother and daughterinlaw exchanged a grave kiss  cecil attempted some civility about the chair to which poor frank replied im afraid it is of no use to speak to me cecil miles can only just make me hear  regret for his misfortune and inquiry as to the chance of restoration were a possible topic  mr charnock gave much advice about aurists and examples of their success or nonsuccess and thence he diverged to the invalidcarriage he had secured and his future plans for expediting his daughters recovery  meanwhile mrs poynsett and cecil sat grave dryeyed and constrained each feeling that in mr charnocks presence the interview was a nullity yet neither of them able to get rid of him nor quite sure that she would have done so if she could  he meanwhile perfectly satisfied with his own considerate tact talked away the allotted halfhour and then pronounced his daughter pale and tired  she let him help her to rise but held mrs poynsetts hand wistfully as if she wished to say something but could not and all mrs poynsett could bring out was a hope of hearing how she bore the journey  it was as if they were both frozen up  yet the next moment cecil was holding franks hand in a convulsive clasp and fairly pulling him down to exchange a kiss when he found her tears upon his cheek  were they to his misfortune or to his muchincreased resemblance to his brother  mr charnock kept guard over her so that her other farewells were almost as much restrained as these and though she hung on rosamonds neck and seemed ready to burst forth with some fervent exclamation he hovered by saying my dear child dont dont give way to agitation  it does you honour but it cannot be permitted at such a moment  lady rosamond i appeal to your unfailing good sense to restrain her emotion  i havent any good sense and i think it only hurts her to restrain her emotion said rosamond with one of her little stamps pressing cecil in her arms  there there my dear crynever mind if it will comfort your poor heart  lady rosamond  this iscecil my dear child  your resolution your resignation  and the boxes are packed and we shall be late for the train  mr charnock was a little jealous of lady rosamond as a comforter preferred to himself and he spoke in a tone which cecil had never resisted  she withdrew herself from rosamond still tearless though her chest heaved as if there were a great spasm in it she gave her hand to miles and let him lead her to the carriage and so raymonds widowed bride left compton poynsett enfolded in that strange silence which some called sullenness and pride others more merciful stunned grief  poor cecil there was less pity to be spared to her because of the intense relief it was to be free from her father and to be able to stand in a knot consulting on the steps without his coming out to find out what they were talking about and to favour them with some dunstone counsel  the consultation was about mr moy  it was determined that since archie was in england it would be better not to wait till herbert was recovered but that miles and julius should go together at once to see what effect they could produce on him  they drove together to his office  he was a tall man a few years over forty and had hitherto been portly and wellpreserved with a certain serene air of complacent prosperity about him that had always been an irritation to the county families with whom he tried to assert an equality but as he rose to greet the brothers there was a bent and shrunken look about him  the hair on his temples had visibly whitened his cheeks seemed to have sunk in and there were deep furrows on them  altogether he had grown full twenty years older in appearance since he had stood proposing a popular toast at the dinner at the townhall  there was something nervous and startled in his gray eye as he saw them enter though he tried to assume his usual halfbland halfeasy manner  good morning captain charnock poynsett  good morning mr charnock i hope i see you well the words faltering a little as neither sailor nor clergyman took notice of his proffered hand but he continued his inquiries after the convalescents though neither inquired in return after mrs moy feeling perhaps that they would rather not hear a very sad account of her state just before letting their inevitable nemesis descend also not feeling inclined for reciprocal familiarity and wanting to discourage the idea that miles came for political purposes  it has been a terrible visitation said moy when he had been reduced to replying to himself  it has said julius  perhaps you have heard that your tenant gadley is dead  yes i did hear it  a very melancholy thingthe whole family sweptaway said mr moy his eye again betraying some uneasiness which julius increased by saying  we thought it right that you should hear that he made a disclosure on his deathbed  indeed mr moy sat erectthe hard keen watchful lawyer  a disclosure that nearly affects the character of mr archibald douglas proceeded julius  may i ask what this may be  mr gadley then informed me that he had been in the outer room behind his desk at the time when mr douglas brought in the letter from my mother containing the missing cheque and that after douglas was gone he heard mr vivian propose to those within to appropriate the amount to their own debts  pardon me mr charnock this is a very serious charge to bring on the authority of a man in a raving fever  was any deposition taken before a magistrate  no said julius  mr lipscombe was fetched but he was unable to speak at the time  however on reviving he spoke as is thus attested and he showed herbert bowaters slip of paper  mr charnock said mr moy without the slightest imputation on the intentions of yourself or of young mr bowater i put it to yourself and captain charnock poynsett whether you could go before a jury with no fuller attestation than you have in your hand  we know what mr charnock and mr bowater are  to a jury they would simply appearpardon mea young clergyman his still more youthful curate and a sister of mercy attaching importance to the words of a delirious man and juries have become very incredulous in such cases  we shall see that said miles sharply  the more cautious added mr moy when it is the raking up of a matter eleven years old where the witnesses are mostly dead and where the characters of two gentlemen also deceased would be implicated  believe me sir this firmi speak as its present headwill be rejoiced to make any compensation to mrs poynsett for what went astray while coming to their hands  it has been our desire to do so from the very first as letters of which i have copies testify but our advances were met in a spirit of enmity which may perhaps be laid aside now  no socalled compensation can be accepted but the clearing of douglass character said miles  it is a generous feeling said mr moy speaking apparently most dispassionately though julius saw his hands trembling below the table but even if the word of this delirious man were sufficient have you reflected captain charnock poynsett on the unequal benefit of justifyingallowing that you could justifya young man who has been dead and forgotten these eleven years and has no relation living nearer than yourself at the expense of those also gone but who have left relations who could ill bear to suffer from such a revelation  justice is justice whether a man be dead or alive said miles and douglas is alive to demand his right  alive cried mr moy starting violently  alive  archie douglas alive  alive and in england said julius  he slept in my house the night before last  he never was in the hippolyta at all but has been living in africa all these years of exile  mr moys selfcommand and readiness were all gone  he sank back in his chair with his hands over his face  the brothers looked at one another fearing he might have a stroke but he revived in a moment yet with a totally different expression on his countenance  the keen defensive look was gone there was only something piteously worn and supplicating in the face as he said  then gentlemen i cannot resent anything you may do  believe me but for the assurance of his death i should have acted very differently long ago  i will assist you in any way you desire in reinstating mr douglas in public opinion only if it be possible let my wife be spared  she has recently had the heaviest possible blow she can bear no more  mr moy we will do nothing vindictive  we can answer for my mother and douglas began julius but miles more sternly would not let his brother hold out his hand and said  you allow then the truth of gadleys confession  what has he confessed said moy still too much the lawyer not to see that his own complicity had never yet been stated  julius laid before him his own written record of gadleys words not only involving moy in the original fraud but showing how he had bribed the only witness to silence ever since  the unhappy man read it over and said  yes mr charnock it is all true  i cannot battle it further  i am at your mercy  i would leave you to proclaim the whole to the world if it were not for my poor wife and her father i would be glad to do so  heaven knows how this has hung upon me for years  i can well believe it said julius not to be hindered now from grasping mr moys hand  it seemed to be a comfort now to tell the whole story in detail moy the favoured and trusted articled clerk at first then the partner the lover and husband of the daughter had been a model of steadiness and success so early that when some mens youthful follies are wearing off he had begun to weary of the monotony of the office and after beginning as mentor to his young brotherin law george proudfoot had gradually been carried along by the fascination of tom vivians society to share in the same perilous pursuits until both had incurred a debt to him far beyond their powers while he was likewise so deeply involved that no bonds of george proudfoot would avail him  then came the temptation of mrs poynsetts cheque suggested perhaps in jest by vivian but growing on them as the feasibility of using it became clear  it was so easy to make it appear to archie douglas that the letter was simply an inquiry for the lost one  mr proudfoot the father was out of reach mrs poynsett would continue to think the cheque lost in the post and tom vivian undertook to get it presented for payment through persons who would guard against its being tracked  the sum exceeded the debt but he would return the overplus to them and they both cherished the hope of returning it with interest  indeed it had been but a half consent on the part of either elicited only by the dire alternative of exposure the envelope and letter were destroyed and vivian carried off the cheque to some of the jews with whom he had had only too many transactions and they never met him again  moys part all along had been half cowardice half ambition  the sense of that act and of its consequences had gnawed at his heart through all his success but to cast himself down from his position as partner and soninlaw of mr proudfoot the keen clever trusted confidential agent of half the families aroundto let his wife know his shame and that of her brother and to degrade his daughter into the daughter of a felonwas more than he could bear and he had gone on trying to drown the sense of that one lapse in the prosperity of his career and his efforts to place his daughter in the first ranks of society  no doubt the having done an injury to the poynsett family had been the true secret of that enmity more than political which he had always shown to raymond and after thinking gadley safer out of that office and having yielded to his solicitations and set him up at the three pigeons he had been almost compelled to bid for popularity by using his position as a magistrate to protect the blackguardism of the town  he had been meant for better things and had been dragged on against his conscience and judgment by the exigencies of his unhappy secret and when the daughter for whose sake he had sacrificed his better self had only been led by her position into the follies and extravagances of the worst part of the society into which she had been introduced and threw herself into the hands of a dissipated gambler to whom her fortune made her a desirable preytruly his sin had found him out  his fight at first had been partly force of habit but he was so entirely crushed that they could only have pity on him when he put himself so entirely in their hands only begging for forbearance to his wife and her aged father and entreating that principal interest and compound interest might at once be tendered to mrs poynsett  the brothers could answer for nothing  archie must decide for himself what he would accept as restoration of his character and mrs poynsett could alone answer as to whether she would accept the compensation  but neither of them could be hard on one so stricken and sorrowful and they did not expect hardness from their mother and cousin especially so far as old mr proudfoot and his daughter were concerned  that the confession was made and that archie should be cleared was enough for julius to carry to herberts room while miles repaired to his mother  it was known in the sickroom where the brothers had been and julius was watched as he crossed the street by jennys eager eye and she met him at the door of the outer room with a face of welcome  come in and tell us all she said  i see it is good news herbert was quite well enough to bear good news in full detail as he lay not saying much but smiling his welcome and listening with ears almost as eager as his sisters  and as julius told of the crushed and broken man jennys tears rose to her eyes and she pressed her brothers hand and whispered thanks dear boy  small thanks to me  yes i can enjoy it now said jenny thanks to you for forcing the bitterness out of me  can you bear a little more good news herbert said julius  who do you think is to have st nicholas  not william easterby  thats too good to be true  but so it is  all the senior fellows dropped it like a redhot coal  i thought dwight wanted to marry  yes but the ladys friends wont hear of his taking her there so it has come down to young easterby  he cant be inducted of course yet but he has written to say he will come down on saturday and take matters in hand  the services on sunday  oh said herbert with as great a gasp of relief as if he had been responsible for them and indeed rosamond declared that both her husband and mr bindon looked like new men since wilsbro was off their backs  archie was coming back that evening  jenny much longed to show her two treasures to each other for it was a useless risk for the healthy man and the sick one was too weak and tired to wish for a new face or the trouble of speaking nay he could not easily bring himself to cheerful acquiescence in even his favourite lady rose taking his sisters place to set her free for an evening with archie at the hall  mrs poynsett was in the drawingroom  she had taken courage to encounter the downstair associations saying she would make it no sadder for the dear boy than she could help and so miles had carried her down to meet one who had been always as one of her own sons  and thus it was that she gathered him into her embrace while the great strong man only then fully realizing all the changes sobbed uncontrollably beside her  my boy my poor archie she said you are come at last  did you not know you still had a mother to trust to  i ought to have known it said archie in a choked voice  oh that i had seen jenny in london  for indeed it had become plain that it had been his flight that had given opportunity and substance to the accusation  if he had remained backed by the confidence of such a family as the poynsetts gadley would have seen that testimony in his favour would be the safer and more profitable speculation and moy himself as he had said would have testified to the innocence of a living man on the spot though he had let the blame rest on one whom he thought in the depths of the sea  archies want of moral courage had been his ruin  it had led him to the scene of temptation rather than resist his companions and had thus given colour to the accusation and in the absence of both joanna and of his cousins it had prevented him from facing the danger  this sense made him the more willing to be forbearing when after dinner the whole council sat round to hear in full the history of the interview with mr moy anne taking up her position beside frank with whom between her pencil and the fingeralphabet she had established such a language as to make her his best interpreter of whatever was passing in the room  one could not help being sorry for moy said miles as he concluded he turns out to be but half the villain after all made so rather by acquiescence than by his own free will  but reaping the profit said mrs poynsett  yes though in ignorance of the injury he was doing and thus climbing to a height that makes his fall the worse  i am sorry for old proudfoot too added julius  i believe they have not ventured to tell him of his granddaughters marriage  i do not think the gain to me would be at all equal to the loss to them said archie  exposure would be ruin and heartbreak there and i dont see what it would do for me  my dear archie exclaimed both mrs poynsett and joanna in amazement  so long as you and mr bowater are satisfied i care for little else said archie  but your position my dear said mrs poynsett  we dont care much about a mans antecedents within a few years out in the colonies dear aunt julia said archie smiling  you arent going back  that depends said archie his eyes seeking joannas but i dont see what there is for me to do here  im spoilt for a solicitor anyway  we could find an agency miles couldnt weor a farm  thank you dear aunt said archie i dont definitely answer because mr bowater must be consulted but i have a business out there that i can do and where i can make a competence that i can fairly offer to jenny here  if i came home as i am now i should only prey on you in some polite form and i dont think jenny would wish for that alternative  i must go back any way as i have told her and whether to save for her or to make a home for her there it must be for her to decide  they looked at jenny  she was evidently prepared for though her colour rose a little her frank eyes looked at him with a confiding smile  but we must have justice done to you my dear boy whether you stay with us or not said mrs poynsett  that might have been done if i had not been fool enough to run away said archie having done so the mass of people will only remember that there has been something against me in spite of any justification  it is not worth while to blast moys character and show poor old proudfoot what a swindler his son was just for that the old man was good to me  i should like to let it rest while he lives  if moy would sign such an exculpation of me as could be shown to mr bowater and any other whom it might concern i should be quite willing to have nothing told publicly at least as long as the old gentleman lives  i think archie is right said miles in the pause with a great effort  yes right in the highest sense of the word said julius  it is christian anne breathed across to her husband  i dont like it said mrs poynsett  let that scoundrel go unhung burst from frank who had failed to catch the spirit of his interpreter  i dont like it in the abstract mother said miles but you and frank have not seen the scoundrel in his beaten down state and as archie says it is hard to blacken the memory of either poor george proudfoot or tom vivian who have fathers to feel it for them  poor tom vivians can hardly be made much blacker said mrs poynsett nor are sir harrys feelings very acute but perhaps poor old proudfoot ought to be spared and there are considerations as to the vivian family  still i dont see how to consent to archie going into exile again with this stigma upon him  i am sure raymond would not and i do not think mr bowater will  dear aunt julia said archie affectionately coming across to her it was indeed exile before when i was dead to all of you but can it be so now the communication is open and when i am making or winning my home and his eyes brought jenny to him by her side  yes dear mrs poynsett she said holding her hand i am sure he is right and that it would spoil all our own happiness to break that poor old fathers heart and bring him and his wife to disgrace and misery  when i think of the change in everything since two days backdear herbert wrung a sort of forgiveness out of mei cant bear to think of anybody being made miserable  and what will your papa say child  i think he will feel a good deal for old proudfoot said jenny he rather likes the old man and has laughed at our hatred of miss moys pretensions  then it is settled said archie i will write to moy for i suppose he had rather not see me that i will say nothing about it publicly while mr proudfoot lives and will not show this confession of his unless it should be absolutely necessary to my character  nor after old proudfoots death will i take any step without notice to him  much more than he ought to expect said mrs poynsett  i dont know said archie  if he had refused it would not have been easy to bring him to the point i suppose i must have surrendered to take my trial but after so many years and with so many deaths it would have been awkward  and the money mother said miles producing a cheque  poor moy that was a relief to him  he said he had kept it ready for years mrs poynsett waved it off as if she did not like to touch it  i dont want it  take it archie  set up housekeeping on it she said  you are not really going back to that place  yes indeed i am i sail on tuesday  dear good aunt julia how comfortable it is to feel any one caring for me again but i am afraid even this magnificent present were it ten times as much could not keep me i must go back to fulfil my word to my partner out there even if i returned at once  and you let him go jenny  i must said jenny  and only think how different it is now  for the rest whether he comes back for me at once or some years hence must depend on papa and mamma  she spoke with grave content beaming in her eyes just like herself the restoration was still swallowing up everything else      chapter xxxv herberts christmas   and when the selfabhorring thrill    is pastas pass it must when tasks of life thy spirit fill then be the selfrenouncing will    the seal of thy calm trustlyra apostolica  by christmas day archie douglas was in the bay of biscay but even to joanna it was not a sorrowful day for did not herbert on that day crawl back into his sittingroom full dressed for the first time holding tight by her shoulder and by every piece of furniture on his way to the sofa rollo attending in almost pathetic delight gazing at him from time to time and thumping the floor with his tail  he had various visitors after his arrivalthe first being his rector who came on his way back from church to give his congratulations mention the number of convalescents who had there appeared and speak of the wedding he had celebrated that morning that of fanny reynolds and her drake who were going forth the next day to try whether they could accomplish a hawkers career free from what the man at least had only of late learnt to be sins  it was a great risk but there had been a penitence about both that julius trusted was genuine  a print of the guardian angel which had been her boys treasure had been hung by fanny in her odd little bedroom and she had protested with tears that it would seem like her boy calling her back if she were tempted again  not that i trust much to that said julius  poor fanny is soft and likes to produce an effect but i believe there is sterling stuff in drake  and he never had a chance before said herbert  no  which makes a great differenceall indeed between the publicans or the heathens and the pharisees  he cant read and i doubt whether he said the words rightly after me but i am sure he meant them  i suppose all this has done great good said jenny  it will be our fault if it do not do permanent good  it ought said julius gravely  no no herbert i did not mean to load you with the thought  getting well is your business for the present not improving the occasion to others  to which all that herbert answered was harry hornblower as if that name spoke volumes of oppression of mind  that discussion however was hindered by mrs hornblowers own arrival with one of her lodgers numerous meals and julius went off to luncheon  the next step on the stairs made herbert start and exclaim thats the dragoon  come in phil  and there did indeed stand the eldest brother who had obtained a few days leave as he told them and had ridden over from strawyers after church  he came in with elaborate caution in his great muddy boots and looked at herbert like a sort of natural curiosity exclaiming that he only wanted a black cap and a pair of bands to be exactly like bishop bowater a caroline divine with a meek oval spiritual face and a great display of delicate attenuated fingers the length of which had always been a doubt and marvel to his sturdy descendants  hands and all quoth philip and what are you doing with them as he spied a greek testament in the fingers and something far too ponderous for them within reach  jenny how dare you he remonstrated poising the bigger book as if to heave it at her head thats what comes of your encouraging followers eh  ah said jenny pretending to dodge the missile while rollo exercised great forbearance in stifling a bark greek is not quite so severe to some folks as dragoon captains think  severe or not he might let it alone said phil looking much disposed to wrest away the little book which herbert thrust under his pillow saying  it was only the lesson  why cant you read the lesson like a sensible man in its native english  dont laugh children you know what i mean  theres no good in this fellow working his brain  he cant go up again before september and according to the bishops letter to my father he is safe to pass if he could not construe a line after what he did at wilsbro  the bishop and co found they had made considerable donkeys of themselves  yes tis the ticket for you to be shocked but it is just like badgering a fellow for his commission by asking him how many facets go to a dragonflys eye instead of how he can stand up to a battery  so i thought said herbert but i know now what it is to be in the teeth of the battery without having done my best to get my weapons about me  come now  would any of those poor creatures have been the better for your knowing  how many notes a sackbut has or whether shawms have strings  or the greek particles which i believe were what sacked you  they would have been the better if i had ever learnt to think what mens souls are or my own either said herbert with a heavy sigh  ah well you have had a sharp campaign said phil but youll soon get the better of it when you are at nice with the old folks jolly placelots of nice girlssomething always going on  ill try and get leave to take you out but youll cut us all out ladies wont look at a fellow when theres an interesting young parson to the fore  herbert made an action of negation and his sister said  the doctors say nice will not do after such an illness as this papa asked the doctor there and he said he could not advise it  indeed  then ill tell you what herbs you shall come into lodgings at york and ill look after you there  you shall ride pimento and dine at the mess  thank you phil said herbert to whom a few months ago this proposal would have been most seducing but i am going home and thats all the change i shall want  home  yes ellen is getting ready for you  not your roomoh no but the state bedroom  when will you come  my leave is only till tuesday  oh  i dont know how to think of the drive sighed herbert wearily  we must wait for a fine day when he feels strong enough said jenny  all right said phil but ten days or a fortnight there will be quite enough and then youll come  there are some friends of yours that only looked at me i can tell you for the sake of your nameeh master herbs  herbert did not rise to the bait but jenny said the miss strangeways  yes  wouldnt he be flattered to hear of the stunning excitement when they heard of captain bowater and how the old lady their mother talked by the yard about him  youll get a welcome indeed when you come old fellow  when shall it be  no thank you phil said herbert gravely  i shall come back here as soon as i am well enough  but there is one thing i wish you would do for me  well what  ill speak about having any horse you please taken up for you to ride i came over on brown ben but he would shake you too much  no no its about a young fellow  if you could take him back to york to enlist  my dear herbert i aint a recruitingsergeant  no but it might be the saving of him said herbert raising himself and speaking with more animation  it is harry hornblower  why thats the chap that bagged your athletic prizes  whew rather strong aint it joan  he did no such thing said herbert rather petulantly never dreamt of it  he only was rather a fool in talking of them vaunting of me i believe as not such a bad fellow for a parson so his friends got out of him where to find them  but they knew better than to take him with them  tell him jenny he wont believe me  it is quite true phil said jenny the poor fellow did get into bad company at the races but that was all  he did not come home that night but he was stupefied with drink and the beginning of the fever and it was provedperfectly provedthat he was fast asleep at a house at backsworth when the robbery was committed and he was as much shocked about it as any onemore i am sure than herbert who was so relieved on finding him clear of it that he troubled himself very little about the things  and now he has had the fever not very badlyand he is quite well now but he cant get anything to do  truelove turned him off before the races for hanging about at the three pigeons and nobody will employ him  i do think it is true what they sayhis mother and julius and herbert and all that he has had a lesson and wants to turn over a new leaf but the people here wont let him  julius and herbert want him to enlist and i believe he would but his motheras they all dothinks that the last degradation but she might listen if captain bowater came and told her about his own regimentcavalry tooand the style of men in itand it is the only chance for him  philip made a wry face  you see i took him up and let him down said herbert sadly and earnestly  i really do believe said jenny clenching the matter that herbert would get well much faster if harry hornblower were off his mind  phil growled and his younger brother and sister knew that they would do their cause no good by another word  there was an odd shyness about them all  the elder brother had not yet said anything about jennys prospects and only asked after the party at the hall  all nearly well except franks deafness said jenny  in a day or two he is going up to london to consult an aurist and see whether he can keep his clerkship  miles is going with him and rosamond takes terry up to see his brother in london and then i believe she is going on to get rooms at rockpier while miles comes home to fetch his mother there  mrs poynsett with infinite wonder  oh yes all this has really brought out much more power of activity in her  you know it was said that there was more damage to the nervous system than anything else and the shock has done her good besides miles is so much less timid about her than dear raymond who always handled her like a cracked teapot and never having known much of any other woman did not understand what was good for her  miles has more pith in him than ever poor old raymond had said phil  poor old poynsett i used to think he wanted to be spoony on you joan if he had only known his own mind  if he had i suppose he would have been alive now  what a pleasing situation for jenny herbert could not help muttering  much better than running after ostriches in the wilderness quoth philip  you ride them double dont you  two little negro boys at a time replied jenny according to the nurserybook  will you come and try phil  you dont mean to go out  i dont know said jenny it depends on how mamma is and how edith gets on  philip gave a long whistle of dismay  herbert looked at him wistfully longing to hear him utter some word of congratulation or sympathy with his sister but none was forthcoming  philip had disliked the engagement originallynever had cared for archie douglas and was not melted now that jenny was more valuable than ever  she knew him too well to expect it of him and did not want to leave him to vex herbert by any expression of his opinion on the matter and on this account as well as on that of the fatigue she saw on her patients features she refused his kind offer of keeping guard while she went in the afternoon to church adding that herbert must rest as mrs duncombe was coming afterwards to take leave of him  philip shrugged his shoulders in horror and declared that he should not return again till that was over but he should look in again before he went home to settle about herberts coming to york  york said herbert with a gasp as jenny brought his jelly and arranged his pillows for a rest while the dragoons boots resounded on the stairs  please tell him to say no more about it  i want them all to understand that im not going in for that sort of thing any more  my dear i think you had better not say things hotly and rashly you may feel so very differently by and by  i know that said herbert but after all it is only what my ordination vows mean though i did not see it then  and this year must be a penance year i had made up my mind to that before i fell ill  only you must get well said jenny  that takes care of itself when one is sound to begin with said herbert  and now that i have been brought back again and had my eyes opened and have got another trial given me it would be double shame to throw it away  i dont think you will do that  i only pray that all that seems burnt out of me by what i have seen and heard and felt may not come back with my strength  i could hardly pray that for you herbert said jenny  spirits are wanted to bear a clergyman through his work and though you are quite right not to go in for those things i should be sorry if you never enjoyed what came in your way  if i never was tempted  it need not be temptation  it would not be if your mind were full of your workit would only be refreshment  i dont want my boy to turn stern and dry and ungenial  that would not be like your rector  my rector did not make such a bad start and can trust himself better said herbert  come jenny dont look at me in that way you cant wish me to go to york and meet those rattling girls again  no certainly not though sister margaret told rosamond they had never had such a sobering lesson in their lives as their share in the mischief to you  it was not their fault said herbert  it was deeper down than that  and they were good girls after all if one only had had sense  oh  nonsense jenny with a little smile as he read her face im not bittennobut they and poor lady tyrrell and all are proof enough that it is easy to turn my head and that i am one who ought to keep out of that style of thing for the future  so do silence phil for you know when he gets a thing into his head how he goes on and i do not think i can bear it now  i am sure you cant said jenny emphatically and ill do my best  only herbie dear do one thing for me dont bind yourself by any regular renunciations of moderate things now your mind is excited and you are weak  i am sure julius or dr easterby would say so  ill think said herbert  but if i am forgiven for this year nothing seems to me too much to give up to the great shepherd to show my sorrow  feed my sheep was the way he bade st peter prove his love  jenny longed to say it was feeding the sheep rather than self privation but she was not sure of her ground and herberts low quiet soft voice went to her heart  there were two great tears on his cheeks he shut his eyes as if to keep back any more and turned his face inwards on the sofa his lips still murmuring over feed my sheep  she looked at him feeling as if while her heart had wakened to new glad hopes of earth her brother in her fulfilled prayer had soared beyond her  they were both quite still till mrs duncombe came to the door  she was at the rectory her house being dismantled and she having stayed till the last case of fever was convalescent and the sisters recalled was to go the next day to her motherinlaws  she was almost as much altered as herbert himself  her jaunty air had given way to something equally energetic but she looked wiry and worn and her gold pheasants crest had become little more than a sandy wisp as she came quietly in and took the hand that herbert held out to her saying how glad she was to see him on the mend  he asked after some of the people whom they had attended together and listened to the details asking specially after one or two families where one or both parents had been taken away  poor cecil poynsett is undertaking them was the answer in each case some had been already sent to orphanages others were boarded out till places could be found for them and the sisters had taken charge of two  then one widow was to do for the vicar who had taken solitary possession of the vicarage but would soon be joined there by one or more curates  he had been inducted into the ruinous chancel of the poor old church had paid the architect of the rathouse fifty pounds a sum just equalling the proceeds of the bazaar to be rid of his plans had brought down a firstrate architect and in the meantime was working the little iron church vigorously  everything seems to be beginning there just as i go into exile said mrs duncombe  it seems odd that i should have to go from what i have only just learnt to prize  but you have taught mo a good deal  every one must have learnt a good deal said herbert wearily  if one only has  i meant you yourself and that is what i came to thank you for yes i did even if you dont like to hear it your sister does and i must have it out  i shall recollect you again and again standing over all those beds and shrinking from nothing and i shall hold up the example to my boys  do hold up something better  can you write she said abruptly  i have written a few lines to my mother  do you remember what you said that night when you had to hold that poor man in his delirium and his wife was so wild with fright that she could not help  i am not sure what you mean  you said it three or four times  it was only  i remember said herbert as she paused it was the only thing i could recollect in the turmoil  would it tire you very much to write it for me in the flyleaf of this prayerbook that mr charnock has given me  herbert pulled himself into a sitting posture and signed to his sister to give him the ink  i shall spoil your book he said as his hand shook  never mind she said eagerly the words come back to me whenever i think of the life i have to face and i want them written they soothe me as they soothed that frightened woman and raving man  and herbert wrote  it was onlythe lord is a very present help in trouble  yes she said thank you  put your initials pray  therethank you  no you can never tell what it was to me to hear those words so quietly and gravely and strongly in that deadly struggle  it seemed to me for the first time in all my life that god is a real presence and an actual help  there  i see miss bowater wants me gone so i am off  i shall hear of you  herbert was exhausted with the exertion and only exchanged a close pressure of the hand and when jenny came back after seeing the lady to the door she thought there were tears on his cheek and bent down to kiss him  that was just the way jenny his low tired voice said  i never could recollect what i wanted to say  only just those few psalms that you did manage to teach me before i went to school they came back and back  jenny had no time to answer for the feet of philip were on the stairs  he had been visiting mrs hornblower and persuading her that to make a dragoon of her son was the very best thing for him great promotion and quite removed from the ordinary vulgar enlistment in the linetill he had wiled consent out of her  and though philip declared it was blarney and was inclined to think it infra dig to have thus exerted his eloquence it was certain that mrs hornblower would console herself by mentioning to her neighbours that her son was gone in compliment to captain bowater who had taken a fancy to him  the relief to herbert was infinite but he was by this time too much tired to do anything but murmur his thanks and wish himself safe back in his bed and philips strongarmed aid in reaching that haven was not a little appreciated  julius looked in with his mothers entreaty that philip and if possible his sister should come up to eat their christmas dinner at the hall and herbert wearily declaring that sleep was all he needed and that cranky would be more than sufficient for him insisted on their accepting the invitation and jenny was not sorry for she did not want a teteatete with philip so close to her patients room that whatever he chose to hear he might  she had quite enough of it in the walk to the hall  phil with the persistency of a person bent on doing a kind thing returned to his york plan viewing it as excellent relaxation for a depressed over worked man and certain it would be a great treat to little herb he still looked on the tall young man as the small brother to be patronized and protected and dragged out of homepetting so he poohpoohed all jennys gentler hints as to herberts need of care and desire to return to his work until she was obliged to say plainly that he had entreated her to beg it might not be argued with him again as he was resolved against amusement for the present  then phil grew very angry both with herbert and jenny  did they suppose he wanted the boy to do anything unclerical  no but you know it was by nothing positively unclerical that he was led aside before  phil broke out into a tirade against the folly of jennys speech in his view herberts conduct at wilsbro had confuted the bishops censure and for his own part he only wished to amuse the boy and give him rest and if he did take him to a ball or even out with the hounds he would be on leave and in another diocese where the bishop had nothing to do with him  jenny tried to make him understand that dread of the bishop was the last thing in herberts mind  it was rather that he did not think it right to dissipate away a serious impression  that was worse than before  she was threatened with the most serious displeasure of her father and mother if she encouraged herbert in the morbid ascetic notions ascribed to dr easterby  it was always the way with the womenthey never knew where to stop  no said jenny i did not know there was anywhere to stop in the way of heaven  as if there were no way to heaven without making a fool of oneself  this answer made jenny sorry for her own as needlessly vexatious and yet she recollected st pauls christian paradoxes and felt that poor herbert might have laid hold of the true theory of the ministry  at any rate she was glad that they were at that moment hailed and overtaken by the party from the rectory and that phil pounced at once on julius to obtain his sanction to giving herbert a little diversion at york  julius answered more warily does he wish it  no but he is too weak yet and is hipped and morbid  well phil i would not put it into his head  no doubt you would take very good care of him but i doubt whether your father would like the bishop to hear of himunder the circumstancesgoing to disport himself at the dragoon mess  besides i dont think he will be well enough before lent and then of course he could not  this outer argument in a mans voice pacified phil as julius knew it would much better than the deeper one and he contented himself with muttering that he should write to his father about it which every one knew he was most likely not to do  who could have foretold last christmas who would be the party at that dinner  mrs poynsett at the head of her own table and miles in the masters place and the three waifs from absent families would have seemed equally unlikely guests while of last years partycharlie was in india tom de lancey with the aunts in ireland cecil at dunstone  mrs duncombe was perfectly quiet not only from the subduing influence of all she had undergone but because she felt herself there like an intruder and would have refused but that to leave her at home would have distressed her hostess  mrs poynsett had never seen her before and after all she had heard about her was quite amazed at the sight of such an insignificant little person as she was without her dash and sparkle and in a dress which when no longer coquettish verged upon the slovenly  poor thing she was waiting till the christmas visit of the elder mrs duncombes own daughter was over so that there might be room for her and she was thankful for the reprieve which left her able to spend christmas among the privileges she had only learnt to value just as she was deprived of them  she looked at mrs poynsett half in curiosity half in compunction as she remembered how she had helped to set cecil against her  but then as she said to rosamond in going home i had prejudices about the genus bellemere  and mine always knew and said i should ruin her son in which alas she was quite right  she will be pleased now said rosamond  no indeed i believe she had rather i were rapidity personified than owe the change to any one of your rectors sort  i have had a letter or two warning me against the sisters or thinking there is any merit in works of mercy  ah well  ill try to think her a good old woman  but if she had only not strained the cord till it snapped how much happier bob and i should have been  what a difference there is between straining the cord for ones self and for other people  so julius could not help feeling when herbert in spite of all that could be said to him about morbid haste in renunciation sent for the village captain of the cricket club and delivered over to him the bat which had hitherto been as a knightly sword to him resigning his place in the compton poynsett eleven and replying to the dismayed entreaties and assurances of the young farmer that he would reconsider his decision and that he would soon be quite strong again that he had spent too much time over cricket and liked it too well to trust himself at it again  that was the last thing before on a new years day which was like an april day herbert came into church once more and then was carried off in the strawyers carriage lying back half ashamed half astonished at the shower of strange tears which the ecstatic shouts and cheers of the village boys had called forth      chapter xxxvi rockpier   for love himself took part against himself    to warn us offtennyson  rosamond was to have a taste of her old vocation and go campaigning for lodgings the searching for which she declared to be her strongest point  rockpier was to be the destination of the family eleonora vivian whose letters had been far fewer than had been expected of her was known to be there with her father and this was lure sufficient for frank  franks welfare again was the lure to mrs poynsett and the benefit rosamond was to derive from sea air after all she had gone through made julius willing to give himself the holiday that everybody insisted on his having until lent  first however was sent off an advanced guard consisting of rosamond and terry who went up to london with frank that he might there consult an aurist and likewise present himself to his chief and see whether he could keep his clerkship  all this turned out well his duties did not depend on his ears and a months longer leave of absence was granted to him moreover his deafness was pronounced to be likely to yield to treatment and a tube restored him to somewhat easier intercourse with mankind and he was in high spirits when after an evening spent with rosamonds friends the mkinnons the trio took an early train for rockpier where rosamond could not detain frank even to come to the hotel with them and have luncheon before hurrying off to verdure point the villa inhabited by sir harry  all he had done all the way down was to impress upon her in the fulness of his knowledge of the place that the only habitable houses in rockpier were in that directionthe nearer to verdure point the more perfect  terry listened with smiling eyes sometimes viewing the lover as a bore sometimes as a curious study confirming practical statements terry was thoroughly well only with an insatiable appetite and he viewed his fellow convalescents love with double wonder when he found it caused oblivion of hunger especially as frank still looked gaunt and sallow and was avowedly not returned to his usual health  rosamond set forth househunting dropping terry ere long at the library where she went to make inquiries and find the sine qua non  when she reached the sittingroom at the hotel she found frank cowering over the fire in an armchair the picture of despondency  of course he did not hear her entrance and she darted up to him and put her hand on his shoulder  he looked up to her with an attempt at indifference  well frank  well rose  how have you sped  i have got a house but it is in marine terrace  i dont know what youll say to me  i dont know that it signifies  you are shivering  whats the matter  only it is very cold  aside  ring the bell terry he is as cold as ice  did you see her  oh yes  did you have any luncheon  some portwine and hot water directly please  yes i believe so  you are not ordering anything for me  theres nothing amissonly it is so cold  it is cold and you are not to be cold nor are we to be cold sir you must go to bed early in the evening terry said rosamond at last  i shall make nothing of him while you are by and an hours more sleep will not be lost on you  will you come and tell me then rosey  i deserve something  what for sleeping there instead of here when youve nothing to do  indeed but i have  i want to make out this little chaucer  i shall go down to the coffeeroom and do it  well if you like poking out your eyes with the gas in the coffee room i have no objection since you are too proud to go to bed wish him good night first and do it naturally  nature would be thrown away on him poor fellow said terry as he roused frank with difficulty to have good night roared into his ear and give a listless hand  he was about to deal with rosamond in the same way but she said  no i am not going yet and settled herself opposite to him with her halfknitted babys shoe in her hands and her feet on the fender her crape drawn up from the fire disposed for conversation frank on the other hand fell back into the old position looking so wretched that she could bear it no longer picked up the tube forced it on him and said do tell me dear frank  you used to tell me long ago  he shook his head  thats all over  you are very good rosamond but you should not have forced her to come to me  not  my life was not worth saving  she has not gone back from you againthe horrible girl this last aside  it is not that she has gone back  she has never changed  it is i who have forfeited her  youyoushe has not cast you off  you know how it was and the resolution by which she had bound herself and how i was maddened  that  i thought it was all forgiven and forgotten cried rosamond  it is not a matter of forgiveness  she put it to me whether it was possible to begin on a broken word  worse and worse  why when youve spoken a foolish word it is the foolishest thing in the world to hold to it  if it were a foolish word said poor frank  i think i could have atoned for that day if she could have tried me but when she left me to judge and those eyes of sweet sorrowful  sweet  sorrowful indeed  about as sweet and sorrowful as the butcher to the lamb  left you to judge  a refinement of cruelty she had better have stayed away when i told her it was the only chance to save your life  would that she had sighed frank  but that was your doing rosamond and what she did in mere humanity cant be cast back again to bind her against her conscience  plague on her conscience was my ladys imprecation  i wonder if it is all coquetry  she deserves no blame said frank understanding the manner though the words were under rosamonds breath  her very troubles in her own family have been the cause of her erecting a standard of what alone she could trust  once in better days she fancied i came up to it and when i know how far i have fallen short of it  nonsense  she had no business to make the condition without warning you  she knows more of me than only that muttered poor frank  i was an ass in town last summer  it was the hope of seeing her that drew me but if i had kept out of that set all this would never have been  it was all for her sake  a substratum of ungrateful ungenerous girl  for her sake i thoughtnot her true sake  then there was a silence broken by his exclaiming rose i must get away from here  you cant she called back  heres your mother coming  she would be perfectly miserable to find you gone  it is impossible i should stay here  dont be so chickenhearted frank  if she has a heart worth speaking of shell come round if you only press hard enough  if not you are well quit of her  he cried out at this and rosamond saw that what she called faintness of heart was really reverence and sense of his own failings but none the less did she scorn such misplaced adoration as it seemed to her and scold him in her own fashion for not rushing on to conquer irresistibly or else being cool and easy as to his rejection  he would accept neither alternative was depressed beyond the power of comfort bodily weariness adding to his other ills and went off at last to bed without retracting his intention of going away  well terry it is a new phase and a most perplexing one said rosamond when her brother came back with arch curiosity in his brown eyes  the girl has gone and turned him over and there he lies on his back prostrate just like ponto when he knows he deserves it  turned him overyou dont mean that she is off  i thought she was a perfect angel of loveliness and goodness  goodness  it is enough to make one hate goodness unless this is all mere pretence on her part  but what i am afraid of is his setting off no one knows where before any one is up and leaving us to confront his mother while he falls ill in some doghole of a place  he is not fit to go about by himself and i trust to you to watch him terry  shall i lie on the mat outside his door said terry half meaning it and somewhat elated by the romantic situation  no we are not come to quite such extremities  you need not even turn his key by mistake only keep your ears open  he is next to you is he notand go in on pretext of inquiryif you hear him up to mischief  nothing was heard but the ordinary summons of boots and it turned out in the morning that the chill had exasperated his throat and reduced him to a condition which took away all inclination to move besides deafening him completely  rosamond had to rush about all day providing plenishing for the lodging  once she saw sir harry and his daughter in the distance and dashed into a shop to avoid them muttering i dont believe she cared for him one bit  i dare say she has taken up with lorimer strangeways after all  rather worse than her sister i declare for she never pretended to be too good for raymond and then as a curate in a cassock passedah some of them have been working on her and persuading her that he is not good enough for her impertinent prig  he looks just capable of it  frank was no better as to cold and deafness though somewhat less uncomfortable the next day in the lodging and rosamond went up without him to the station to meet the rest of the party and arrange for mrs poynsetts conveyance  they had accomplished the journey much better than had been hoped but it was late and dark enough to make it expedient that mrs poynsett should be carried to bed at once after her most unwonted fatigue and only have one glimpse and embrace of frank so as to stave off the knowledge of his troubles till after her nights rest  he seconded this desire and indeed miles and anne only saw that he had a bad cold but rosamond no sooner had her husband to herself than she raved over his wrongs to her hearts content and implored julius to redress them though how she did not well know since she by turns declared that frank was well quit of lenore and that he would never get over the loss  julius demurred a good deal to her wish of sending him on a mission to eleonora  all charnocks naturally swung back to distrust of the vivians and he did not like to plead with a girl who seemed only to be making an excuse to reject his brother while on the other hand he knew that raymond had not been satisfied with franks london habits nor had he himself been at ease as to his religious practices which certainly had been the minimum required to suit his mothers notions  he had been a communicant on christmas day but he was so entirely out of reach that there was no knowing what difference his illness might have made in him eleonora might know more than his own family did and have good and conscientious reasons for breaking with him and aware that his own authority had weight with her julius felt it almost too much responsibility to interfere till the next day when his mother with tears in her eyes entreated him to go to miss vivian to find out what was this dreadful misunderstanding which perhaps might only be from his want of hearing and implore her in the name of an old woman not to break her boys heart and darken his life as it had been with his brother  mrs poynsett was tremulous and agitated and grief had evidently told on her high spirit so that julius could make no objection but promised to do his best  by the time it was possible to julius to call sir harry and miss vivian were out riding and he had no further chance till at the gaslit friday evening lecture to which he had hurried after dinner a lady became faint in the heated atmosphere two rows of chairs before him and as she turned to make her way out he saw that it was eleonora and was appalled by seeing not only the whiteness of the present faintness but that thinness and general alteration which had changed the beautiful face so much that he asked himself for a moment whether she could have escaped the fever  in that moment he had moved forward to her support and she seeming to have no one belonging to her clung to the friendly arm and was presently in the porch where the cool night air revived her at once and she begged him to return saying nothing ailed her but gas  no i shall see you home lena  indeed there is no need said the trembling voice in which he detected a sob very near at hand  i shall use my own judgment as to that said julius kindly  she made no more resistance but rose from the seat in the porch and accepted his arm  he soon felt that her steps were growing firmer and he ventured to say i had been looking for you today  yes i saw your card  i had a message to you from my mother  lenore trembled again but did not dare to relax her hold on him  i think you can guess what it is  she thinks poor frank must have mistaken what you said  noi wrote it said lena very low  and you really meant that the resolution made last year is to stand between you and frank  i am not blaming you i do not know whether you may not be acting rightly and wisely and whether you may not have more reason than i know of to shrink from intrusting yourself to frank but my mother cannot understand it and when she sees him heartbroken and too unwell to act for himself  oh is he ill  he has a very bad cold and could not get up till the afternoon and he is deafer than ever  lena moaned  he proceeded  so as he cannot act for himself my mother begged me to come to an understanding  i told him to judge said lena faintly but turning julius so as to walk back along the parade instead of to her abode  was not that making him his own executioner said julius  a promise is binding she added  yet is it quite fair said julius sure now which way her heart went and thinking she was really longing to be absolved from a superstitious feeling is it fair to expect another person to be bound by a vow of which you have not told him  i never thought he could sighed she  and you know he was entrapped said julius roused to defend his brother  and by whom she said in accents of deep pain  i should have thought it justboth by your poor sister and by him to undo the wrong then wrought said julius unless indeed you have some further cause for distrusting him  no no cried she  oh julius  i do it for his own good  your mother knows not what she wishes in trying to entangle him again with me  lenore will you tell me if anything in him besides that unhappy slip makes you distrust him  i must tell the whole truth gasped the poor girl as they walked along in the sound of the sea the dark path here and there brightened by the gaslights or you will think it is his fault julius i know more about my poor father than ever i did before  i was a child when i lived here before and then camilla took all the management  when we came to london two months ago i soon saw the kind of people he got round him for his comforters  i knew how he spent his evenings  it is second nature to himhe cant get put of it i believe  i persuaded him to come down here thinking it a haven of peace and safety  alas  i little knew what old habits there were to resume nor what was the real reason camilla brought us away after paying our debts  i was a happy child then when i only knew that papa was gone to his club  now i know that it is a billiardroomand that it is doing all the more harm because he is thereand i see him with people whom he does not like me to speak to  i dont know whether i could get him away and it would be as bad anywhere else  i dont think he can help it  and he is often unwell he cant do without me when he has the gout and i ought not to leave him to himself  and then ifif we did marry and he lived with us in london think what it would be for frank to have such a set brought about him  i dont see how he could keep them off  or even an engagement bringing him down hereor anywhere among papas friends would be very bad for him  i saw it in london even with camilla to keep things in check  she was almost choked with suppressed agony  i see said julius gravely and pitifully it would take a man of more age and weight than poor frank to deal with the habits of a lifetime  the risk is great  and when i saw it added eleonora i felt i must never never bring him into it  and how could i tell him  your mother does not know or she could not wish it  it is plain that in the present state of things you ought not to marry and so far you are judging nobly said julius but next comes the questionhow far it is well to make that day at the races the pretext  dont call it a pretext said lenore quickly  i meant what i said a year ago with all my soul  perhaps it was hasty when poor camilla drove me into saying i did not mean only an habitual gambler but one who had ever betted  and now well as i know how cruelly she used that presumptuous vow of mine and how she repented of it at last still i feel that to fly in its face might be so wrong that i should have no right to expect not to drag frank down  perhaps i am too much interested to judge fairly said julius  i should like you to consult some onesay dr easterbybut it seems to me that it is just such a vow as you may well be absolved from  but is it not franks protection  put yourself in that poor fellows place lena and see what it is to him to be cast off for such a reason  he did the wrong i know he knew he ought not apart from your resolution and he did thus prove his weakness and unfitness  oh no noit was not his fault  julius laughed a little and added i am not saying he deserves youhushor that it would be well to take him now only that i think to find himself utterly rejected for so insufficient a reason and when he was really deceived would not only half kill him now but do his whole nature cruel harm  what is to be done then sighed eleonora  i should say and i think my mother would put him on some probation if you like even before you call it an engagement but give him hope  let him know that your attachment is as true and unselfish as ever and do not let him brood in misery enhanced by his deafness  i cant marry while poor papa is like what he is said she as if trying to keep hold of her purpose  but you can be franks light and hopethe prize for which he can work  ifyour mother will have it sothen said eleonora and the sigh that followed was one to relieve not exhaust  may i tell her then  you must i suppose said the poor girl but she can never wish it to go on  julius left her at her own door and went home  as mrs poynsett said she could expect nothing better of him  it is quite clear she said that poor lena is right that frank must not set up housekeeping with him  even if he were certain to be proof against temptation it would be as bad a connection as could be  i never thought of his being with them but i suppose there is nothing else to be done with him  frank ought not to be exposed to the trial  the old man has a certain influence over him  though i should have thought such a hoary old wreck was nothing but a warning  it has been a most unhappy affair from first to last but lena is a good unselfish girl and nothing else will give frank a chance of happiness  waiting will do them no harm they are young enough and have no great sum to marry upon so if you can bring her to me tomorrow julius i will ask her to grant my poor boy leave to wait till she can see her way to marrying  julius ventured to write down hope on  to this frank replied with rather a fiery look mind i will not have her persuaded or worked on  it must be all her own doing yes answering a look of his brother i see what you are about you want to tell her it is a superstition about her vow and not using me fairly  so it may be in some points of view but the fact remains  she thought she might trust to my good sense and principle and it proved that she was wrong  after that it is not right to force myself on her  i dont dare to do it julius  i have not been shut up with myself all these weeks for nothing  i know now how unworthy i ever was to think of her as mine  if i can ever prove my repentance she might in time forgive me but for her to be driven to take me out of either supposed justice or mercy i will not stand  a wretched deaf being like me  it is not fitting and i will not have it done  julius wroteshe is suffering greatly  she nearly fainted at church and i had to take her out  franks face worked and he put his hand over it as he said you are all torturing her i shall write a letter and settle it myself  frank did write the letter that very night and when julius next saw eleonora her eyes were swollen with weeping and she said  take me to him  i must comfort him  you have heard from him  yes  such a beautiful letter  but he must not think it that  she did show the letter reserved though she was  she was right about it julius was struck with the humble sweetness which made him think more highly of poor frank than ever he had done before he had decided against himself feeling how much his fall at the raceground had been the effect of the manner in which he had allowed himself to be led during the previous season in london and owning how far his whole aim in life fell short of what it ought to be asking nothing for himself not even hope nor patience though he could not refrain from expressing his own undying love and his one desire that if she had not attached herself to one more worthy he might in time be thought to have proved his repentance  in the meantime she would and could be only his beacon star  julius could not but take her home and leave her with frank though his mother was a little annoyed not to have first seen her but when frank himself brought her to mrs poynsetts arms it turned out that the two ladies were quite of one mind as to the inexpediency of sir harry living with frank  they said it very covertly but each understood the other and eleonora went home wonderfully happier and looking as if her fresh beauty would soon return  there was quite enough to dazzle miles whose first opinion was that they were hard on sir harry and that two ladies and a clergyman might be making a great deal too much of an old mans form of loitering especially in a female paradise of ritualism as he was pleased to call rockpier where all the male population seemed to be invalids  however it was not long before he came round to their view  he found that sir harry in spite of his gentlemanly speech and bearing was a battered old roue who was never happy but when gambling and whose air and title were baits to victims of a lower class than himself young clerks and medical students who were flattered by his condescension  he did not actually fleece them himself he had too little worldly wisdom for that but he was the decoy of a coterie of nyms pistols and bardolphs who gathered up the spoil of these and any unwary youth who came to rockpier in the wake of an invalid or to see life at a fashionable watering place  miles thought the old man was probably reduced to a worse style of company by the very fact of the religious atmosphere of the place where he himself found so little to do that he longed for the opening of the session but he was strongly impressed with the impracticability of a menage for frank with the baronet as father inlaw  not so sir harry  he was rather fond of frank and had been glad to be no longer bound to oppose the match and he had benignantly made up his mind to the great sacrifice of living in his house in london surrounding himself with all his friends and making the young couple supply him with pocketmoney whenever he had a run of illluck  they would grant it more easily than camilla and would never presume to keep him under regulation as she had done  they would be too grateful to him  so after a day or two he demanded of eleonora whether her young man had given her up or what he meant by his coolness in not calling  lena answered the last count by explaining how unwell he had been and how his hearing might be lost by a renewal of his cold  she was however further pressed and obliged to say how matters stood namely that they were engaged but meant to wait  whereupon sir harry quite sincerely poor old man grew compassionate and grandly benignant  the young people were prudent but he would come to their aid  his pittance added to theirseven now would set all things straight  he would never stand in the way of their happiness  mrs poynsett had bidden lena cast the whole on her shoulders  the girl was too truthful and generous to do this fond as she still was of her father  no dear papa she said it is very kind in you for she knew that so he meant it but i am afraid it will not quite do  you see frank must be very careful in his situationand i dont think so quiet a way of life would suit you  nonsense child im an old man and i want no racketing  just houseroom for myself and victor  that fellow is worth two women in a house  youll keep a good cook  ill never ask for more than a few old friends to dinner when i dont feel disposed to have them at the club  old friends  yes lenore knew them and her flesh crept to think of franks chief hearing of them constantly at his house  i dont think we should afford it dear papa she said  we have agreed that i had better stay with you for the present and let frank make his way  then a thought occurred to sir harry  is this the poynsetts doing  no said eleonora stoutly  it is mine  i know thatoh papa forgive methe things and people you like would not be good for frank and i will not leave you nor bring him into them  never  sir harry sworealmost for the first time before herthat this was that old hag mrs poynsetts doing and that she would make his child abandon him in his old age  he would not have his daughter dragged into a long engagement  waithe knew what waiting meant wait for his death but they should have her now or not at all and he flung away from her and her entreaties to announce his determination to the suitors family  he did not find this very easy to accomplish  franks ears were quite impervious to all his storming and if he was to reduce his words to paper they came less easily  miles to whom he tried to speak as a man of the world would only repeat that his mother would never consent to the marriage unless the young couple were to live alone nay he said with a grain of justice he thought that had been sir harrys own view in a former case  would he like to see mrs poynsett she is quite ready  again sir harry quailed at the notion of encountering mrs poynsett but miles who had a great idea that his mother could deal with everybody and was the better for doing so would not let him off and ushered him in then stood behind her chair and thoroughly enjoyed the grand and yet courteous way in which she reduced to nothing sir harrys grand beneficence in eking out the young folks income with his own  she knew very well that even when the estate was sold at the highest estimate eleonora would have the barest maintenance and that he could hardly expect what the creditors now allowed him and she made him understand that she knew this and that she had a right to make conditions since frank like her other sons could not enter into possession of his share of his fathers fortune unless he married with her consent  and when he spoke of breaking off the engagement she was callous and said that he must do as he pleased though after young people were grown up she thought the matter ought to rest with themselves she did not wish her son to marry till his character was more confirmed  he went home very angry and yet crestfallen sought out eleonora and informed her of his command that her engagement should be broken off  i do not know how that can be done papa said eleonora  we have never exactly made an engagement we do not want to marry at once and we could not help loving each other if we tried  humph  and if i laid my commands on you never to marry into that family  i do not think you will do that papa after your promise to camilla  she had conquered  no further objection was made to her being as much as she pleased with the charnocks as long as they remained at rockpier nor to her correspondence with frank when he went away not to solitary lodgings as before but to the london house which miles and anne only consented to keep on upon condition of their mother sharing it with them      chapter xxxvii the third autumn   a good man ther was of religion that was a poure persone of a toune but rich he was of holy thought and work he also was a learned man a clerkchaucer  autumn came round again and brought with it a very different september from the last  willansborough was in a state of commotion  that new vicar had not only filled the place with curates multiplied services in the iron church and carried on the building of st nicholas in a style of beauty that was quite affronting to those who were never asked to contribute to it but he gave people no peace in their easy conventional sins pricked them in their hearts with personal individual stings and worse than all protested against the races as conducted at wilsbro  and their member was just as bad  captain charnock poynsett instead of subscribing as part of his duty to his constituents had replied by sending his brother raymonds halffinished letter to the club with an equally strong and resolute one of his own and had published both in all the local papers  great was the fury and indignation of wilsbro backsworth and all the squires around  of course it was a delirious fancy of poor raymond poynsett and miles had been worked upon by his puritanical wife and ritualistic brother to publish it  newspapers teemed with abuse of superstition and pharisaism and praise of this wholesome moral and truly english sport  gentlemen and ladies too took the remonstrance as a personal offence and threatened to visit no more at compton the electors bade him look to his seat and held meetings to invite mr simmonds proudfoot as he now called himself to represent them and the last week before the races the roughs mobbed him in water lane  he rode quietly through them with his sailor face set as if against a storm but when he was out of the place he stopped his horse at herbert bowaters lodgings that his black eye might be washed and the streams of rotten egg removed from his coat before he presented himself at home  not that he had much fear of startling his wife and mother  it was more from the englishmans hatred of showing himself a hero for anne was perfectly happy in the persecution he had brought on himself for she never had been so sure before that he was not of the world worldly  the races were exceptionally brilliant and fully attended but the triumph of the roughs had made them more outrageously disgraceful in their conduct than ever and when miles went to the quarter sessions rather doubting whether he should not find himself landed in coventry not only did the calendar of offences speak for itself but sundry country gentlemen shook him by the hand lamenting that railways and rowdyism had entirely altered races from what they used to be that he was in the right and what they had seen so recently proved that the only thing to be done was to withdraw from what respectable people could no longer keep within bounds  such withdrawal will not prevent them but it will hinder the demoralization from being so extensive as formerly since no one of much character to lose will attend them  mr bowater rejoiced in miless triumph  none of that family had been at these same races  they had all been much too anxious about herbert not to view ember week in a very different light from that in which they had thought of it before  lent had brought the junior curate back from strawyers not much more than a convalescent but with his sister to look after him and both rector and senior anxious to spare him he had gone on well till the family returned and resumed jenny when he was left to his own devices namely all work and no play  he was as fixed as ever in his resolution of making this a penance year and believed himself so entirety recovered as to be able to do without relaxations  cricket riding dinners and gardenparties alike he had given up and divided his time entirely between church and parish work and study  hard reading had never been congenial and took a great deal out of him and in fact all his theological study had hitherto been little more than taskwork into which he had never fully entered whereas these subjects had now assumed such a force depth and importance that he did in truth feel constrained to go to the very foundation and work through everything again moved and affected by them in every fibre of his soul which vibrated now at what it had merely acquiesced in before  it was a phase that had come suddenly on him when his mind was in full vigour of development and his frame and nerves below par and the effect could not but be severe  he was wrapped up in these great realities and seemed to care for no talk except discussing them with julius or the senior curate and often treated things of common life like the dream that they really are  julius laid as little parish work on him as possible only indeed what seemed actually beneficial by taking him out but it may be feared that in his present fervid state he was not nearly so winning to his young clients as when he was less terribly in earnest although the old women were perhaps more devoted to him from the tender conviction that the poor dear young gentleman would not be here long  for indeed it was true that he had never advanced in strength or looks since his return but rather lost ground and thus every change of weather or extra exertion told on him till in august he was caught in a thunderstorm and the cold that ensued ran on into a feverish attack which barely left him in time for the ordination and then with a depressed system and nerves morbidly sensitive  so sensible or more than sensible was he of his deficiencies that he would willingly have held back and he was hardly well enough to do himself justice but there was no doubt that he would pass and it was plain that three more months of the strain of preparation might leave permanent effects on his health  as it was the examining chaplain did not recognize the lean pale anxious man for the roundfaced rosy overgrown boy of a year ago his scholarship and critical knowledge were fairly above the mark in spite of a racking headache and his written sermon together with all that was elicited from him revealed all unconsciously to himself what treasures he had brought back from the deep waters which had so nearly closed over him  so superior had he shown himself that he was appointed to read the gospel a choice that almost shocked him knowing that what had made him excel had been an experience that the younger men had happily missed  but the mark of approval was compensation to his parents and sisters for the disappointment of the last year and the only drawback was fear of the effect of the long ceremonial so deeply felt  he met them afterwards very whitefaced with head aching and weary almost beyond speech but with a wonderfully calm restful look on his face such as reminded jenny of those first hours of his recovery  they took him home and put him to bed and there he lay hardly speaking and generally sleeping  there he still was on the monday when julius came to inquire after him and was taken upstairs at once by jenny with the greeting so the son and heir is come julius  yes and i never saw my mother more exulting  when rosamond ran down to tell her she put her arms round her neck and cried  she who never had a tear through all last year  i met your father and mother halfway and they told me i might come on  i think nothing short of such news would have made mamma leave this boy said jenny but she must have her jubilee with mrs poynsett  and im quite well said herbert who had been grasping juliuss hand with a wonderful look in his eyes yes reallythe doctor said so  yes he did said jenny only he said we were to let him alone and that he was not to get up till he felt quite rested  and i shall get up to dinner said herbert so sleepily that julius doubted it  i hope to come back before sunday  what does your doctor say to that  he says replied jenny that this gentleman must be rational that he has nothing the matter with him now but that he is low and ripe for anything  dont laugh you naughty boy he said you were ripe for anything and that he mustyes he mustbe turned out to grass somehow or other for the winter and do nothing at all  i begin to see what you are driving at mrs joan you look so triumphant  yes said jenny blushing a little and looking quite young again i believe poor mamma would be greatly reconciled to it if herbert were to see me out to natal  is that to be the way  it would be very absurd to make archie come home again for me said jenny  and everything else is most happily smoothed for me you know edith has come quite to take my place at home mamma learnt to depend on her much more than on me while i was with herbert  and it has made her much more of a woman added herbert  then you know that full statement poor mr moy put forth when he left the place on his wifes death quite removed all lingering hesitation on papas part added jenny  it ought i am sure said julius  so now if herbert will go out with me it seems to me to be all right said jenny colouring deeply as she made this lame and impotent conclusion  my father wishes it said herbert  i believe he meant to see you today to ask leave of absence for me  that is what he wishes but i have made up my mind that i ought to resign the curacywhere i have never been any use to youthough if i had been well i meant to have worked a year with you as a priest  i dont like to lose you but i think you are right  your beginning with me was a mistake  there is not enough work for three of us but you know easterby would be delighted to have you at st nicholas  he says his most promising people talk of what you said to them when they were ill and he asked me if you could possibly come to him  i think it would be better to begin in a new place further from home said herbert quietly  and both knew what he meant and how hard it would be to be the clergyman he had learnt to wish to be if his mother were at hand to be distressed by all he did or did not do  but any way added herbert i hope to have some time longer at compton before i go  next sunday if i only can  his mind was evidently full of the feast of the sunday and julius answered whichever sunday you are strong enough of course dear fellow  you had better come with him jenny and sleep at the rectory  oh thank you  i should like nothing so much and i think they will spare me that one day  you will come in for a grand gathering that is if poor cecil accepts  miles thinks she ought to be godmother  oh  and no one has said a word of any cloud  it is better he should know nothing  and oh julius is it true that her father has bought sirenwood for her  quite true  you know it was proposed at first but the trustees doubted of the title but when all that was cleared up it turned out to be a better investment than swanslea and so they settled it without much reference to her  she will let it of course  i suppose so  you dont think she will come to the christening  i cannot tell rose has had one or two very sad letters from her she wanted us very much to come to dunstone and was much disappointed that we were prevented  i fancy her heart has turned to us and that it is very sore poor thing  julius was right  cecil did return an answer whose warmth quite amazed all but miles and anne who thought nothing too much for their son and she gladly came to attend the christening of the young raymond  gladlyyes she was glad to leave dunstone  she had gone home weary and sick of her lodging and convalescence and hoping to find relief in the home that had once been allsufficient for her but dunstone was not changed and she was  she had not been able to help outgrowing its narrow opinions and formal precisions and when she came home crushed with her scarcely realized grief nothing there had power to comfort her  there was soothing at first in her stepmothers kindness and she really loved her father but their petting admiration soon grew oppressive after the more bracing air of compton and their idolatry of her little brother fretted and tried her all the more because they thought he must be a comfort to her and any slight from her might be misconstrued  mr venns obsequiousness instead of rightful homage seemed deprivation of support and she saw no one spoke to no one without the sense of raymonds vast superiority and her own insensibility to it loving him a thousand times more than she had loved him in life and mourning him with an anguish beyond what the most perfect union would have left  she had nothing to do  selfimprovement was a mere oppression and she longed after nothing so much as the sight of rosamond anne julius or even frank and her amiable wishes prevailed to have them invited to dunstone but at the times specified there were hindrances  anne had engagements at home and rosamond appeared to the rest of the family to be a perpetual refuge for stray de lanceys while frank had to make up for his long enforced absence by a long unbroken spell of work  cecil therefore had seen none of the family till she arrived at compton  she was perfectly well she said and had become a great walker and so indeed she showed herself for she went out directly after breakfast every morning and never appeared again till luncheon time and would take long rides in the afternoon  it was her only chance of sleep she said when remonstrated with she did not look ill but there was a restless worn air that was very distressing on her young features and was the more piteous to her relations that she was just as constrained as ever in her intercourse with them  she was eagerly attentive to mrs poynsett and evidently so anxious to wait on her that anne left to her many little services but if they were alone together they were tongue tied and never went deeper than surface subjects  mrs poynsett never discussed her never criticized her never attempted to fathom her being probably convinced that there was nothing but hard coldness to be met with by probing  yet there was something striking in cecils having made people call her mrs raymond poynsett surrendering the charnock which she had once brandished in all their faces and going by the name by which her husband had been best known  to anne she was passively friendly and neither gave nor sought confidences and anne was so much occupied with her baby and all the little household services that had grown on her as well as with her busy husband that there was little leisure for them and though the meeting with rosamond was at first the most effusive and affectionate of all afterwards she seemed to avoid tetesatetes with her and was shyer with her than with anne  it was miles that she got on with best  he had never so fully realized the unhappiness of his brothers married life as those who had watched it and he simply viewed her as raymonds loved and loving widow and sincere mourner and treated her with all brotherly tenderness and reverence for her grief while she responded with a cordiality and gratitude which made her when talking to him a pleasanter person than she had ever been seen at compton before  but it was not to miles but to rosamond that she brought an earnest question walking in one autumn morning to the rectory amid the falling leaves of the virginiancreeper and amazing rosamond who was writing against time for the indian mail by asking  rosamond will you find out if mrs poynsett would mind my coming to live at sirenwood  you cecil  yes im old enough  theres no place for me at home and though i must be miserable anywhere it will be better where i have something to do of some real use to somebody  ive been walking all round every day and seeing what a state it is inin the hands of creditors all these years  but you would be quite alone  i am quite alone as it is  and would your father consent  i think he would  i am a burthen to them now  they cannot feel my grief nor comfort it and they dont like the sight of it though i am sure i trouble them with it as little as possible  dear cecil and the ready tears welled up in rosamonds gray eyes  i dont want to talk of it said cecil  if i felt worthy to grieve it would be less dreadful but it all seems like hypocrisy rosamond if you were to lose julius tomorrow you would not be as unhappy as i am  dont dont cried rosamond making a gesture of horror  but does not coming here make it worse  no real stabs are better than dull aching and then youyou rosamond did know how it really was and that i wouldi would  cecil wept now as rosamond had longed to see her weep when she had left compton and rosamond spoke from her tender heart of comfort but the outburst did not last long and cecil said recovering herself  after all my most peaceful times of late have been in walking about in those woods at sirenwood i should like to live there  you know he always wished it to be the purchase because it joins compton and i should like to get it all into perfect order and beauty and leave it all to little raymond  i should have thought the place would have been full of ghosts  i tried  i made the woman let me in and i sat where poor camilla used to talk to me and i thought i was the better for facing it out  the question is whether mrs poynsett will dislike it  she has a right to be consulted  perhaps cecil could not be gracious  certainly raymond would have been thankful for even this admission  you wish me to find out  if you would be so good  i would give it up at once if she has any feeling against it and go somewhere elseand of course she has she never can forget what i did  rosamond caressed cecil with that sweetness which saw everything in the most consoling manner but when the poor young widow was out of sight there was a revulsion of feeling  no mrs poynsett must always feel that that wretched marriage broke her sons heart and murdered himmurdered him said rosamond to herself clenching that soft fist of hers  it ought not to be broached to her  but juliuswhen she stated it to him rather less broadly but still saying that she did not know whether she could bear the sight of cecil except when she was before her eyes and how could his mother endure her at alldid not see it in the same light  he thought sirenwood gave duties to cecil and that she ought not to be hindered from fulfilling them  and he said his mother was a large minded woman and not likely to have that personal bitterness towards cecil that both the ladies seemed to expect as her rival in her sons affections and the means of his unhappiness and death  he was right mrs poynsett was touched by finding that cecil clung to them rather than to her sublime family and especially by the design as to little raymond though she said that must never be mentioned nothing must bind so young a creature as cecil who really did not know what love was at all  she is afraid the sight of her is distressing to you said rosamond  poor child why should she said mrs poynsett  she was the victim of an unsuccessful experiment of my dear boys and the unsuspecting instrument of poor camillas vengeance  that is all i see in her  mrs poynsett how can you cried rosamond impetuously  with all i know of her sorrow i rage at her whenever i am out of sight of her  i cant do that said mrs poynsett half smiling any more than i could at a doll  the poor thing was in a false position and nobody was more sorry for her than raymond himself but you see he had fancied that marriage must bring the one thing it would not in that short time  it would if she had not been a little foolish donkey  or if camilla tyrrell had let her alone  it is of no use to rake up these things my dear rosamond  let her come to sirenwood and do such good as she can there if it can comfort her  it was for my sake that the unconscious girl was brought here to have her life spoilt and i would not stand in the way of what seems to be any relief  but is it no pain persisted rosamond  no my dear  i almost wish it was  i shall never get on with her but i am glad she should come and be near you all and miles likes her  mr charnock demurred at first and wanted to saddle cecil with her old governess as a companion but when he found that mrs poynsett and miles made no objection and remembered that she would be under their wing and would be an inestimable adviser and example to anne he consented and cecils arrangements were made with startling rapidity so that she was in possession before christmas which she insisted on spending there  dunstone had stereotyped hospitalities which she could not bear and would not prevent and now that her first year of widowhood was over the sorrow was not respected while it seemed to her more oppressive than ever  so there she was in vehement activity restless rather than religious in her beneficence still though the lesson she had had showed itself in her constantly seeking the advice of miles who thought her the most sensible woman in the world except his nan whether this constant occupation furnishing repairing planning beautifying her model cottages her school chapel and all the rest were lessening the heartache no one knew but the sharp black eyes looked as dry and hard the lines round the mouth as weary as ever and rosamond sometimes thought if sirenwood were not full of ghosts to her she was much like a ghost herself who came  hovering around her ancient home    to find no refuge there  there was another who could not help seeing her somewhat in that light and this was eleonora vivian who had come to compton to be with frank when he was at last able to enjoy a wellearned holiday and with ears restored to their natural powers though he always declared that his eight months of deafness had done him more good than anything that had ever befallen him in his life  it had thrown him in on his real self and broken all the unfortunate associations of his first year in london  his first few months while he was still in need of care had been spent with miles and anne and that tender ministry to him which his sisterinlaw had begun in his illness had been with him when he was tired dispirited or beset by the trials of a tardy convalescence  as his interpreter too and caterer for the pleasures his infirmity allowed anne had been educating herself to a degree that self improvement never would have induced  and when left alone in london he was able to take care of himself in all ways and had followed the real leadings of his disposition which his misdirected courtship had interrupted for the time returning to the intellectual pursuits which were likely to be beneficial not only as pleasures but in an economical point of view and he was half shy half proud of the profits such as they were of a few poems and essays which he certainly had not had it in him to write before the ordeal he had undergone  eleonoras elder sister mrs fanshaw had come home from india with her husband newly made a majorgeneral  frank had gone to rockpier early in january to be introduced to them and after spending a day or two there to escort lena to compton  mrs poynsett needed but one glance to assure her that the two were happier than their wooing had ever made them before save in that one brief moment at cecils party  eleonora looked more beautiful and the look of wistful pain had left her brow but it had made permanent lines there as well had seemed likely and though her laugh would never have the abandon of rosamonds still it was not so very rare and though she was still like a beautiful night it was a bright moonlight one  a few private interviews made the cause of the change apparent  the sister mary fanshaw had something of camillas dexterity but having been early married to a good man she had found its use instead of its abuse and though lenas trust had come very slowly she had given it at last and saw that her elders could deal with her father as she could never do  sir harry respected the general enough to let himself be restrained by him and the husband and wife were ready to take the chargeremoving however from rockpier for the religious atmosphere of which they were unprepared and which general fanshaw thought very dull  affairs were in course of being wound up on the sale of sirenwood and the general had talked to frank as one of the family in a way that had proved to him his own manhood more than anything that had happened to him  out of the wreck nothing remained to the old man and the portion which had been secured by the mothers marriage settlements to younger children though hitherto out of reach was felt by the daughters to be due to the creditors so that only two thousand pounds apiece had been secured to each of them and this the general consulted frank about appropriating for sir harrys use during his lifetime himself retaining the management so as to secure the attendance of the favourite valet the keeping of a horse and a fair amount of menus plaisirs  it was also made plain to frank that lenas filial duties and scruples need no longer stand in the way of the marriage  mrs fanshaw had two girls almost come out and perhaps she did not wish them to be overshadowed by the aunt who however retiring could not help being much more beautiful  so all that remained was that mrs poynsett should be willing to supplement franks official income with his future portion  she was all the more rejoiced as this visit showed her for the first time what lena really was when brought into the sunshine without dread of what she might hear or see or of harm being done by her belongings and her gratitude for the welcome with which she was received was most touching  the rest of her family were in course of removing to their new home where mrs fanshaw would be mistress of the house and so eleonoras stay at compton was prolonged till the general migration to london which was put off till easter  just before this herbert bowater came back from natal and walked from strawyers with all his happy dogs as strong and hearty and as merry as ever his boyish outlines gone but wholesome sunburn having taken the place of his rosiness and his bonny smile with its old joyousness  he had married jenny and archie himself and stayed a month on their ostrich farm which he declared was a lesson on womans rights since mrs ostrich was heedless and indifferent as to her eggs but was regularly hunted back to the duties by her husband who always had two wives and regularly forced them to take turns in sitting a system which herbert observed would be needful if the rights of women were to work  he had brought offerings of eggs and feathers to lady rosamond and pockets full of curiosities for all his village friends also he had been at the cape had seen glen fraser rejoiced the inhabitants with his accounts of anne and brought home a delightful budget for her  but the special cause of his radiance was a letter he brought from his father to mr bindon  the family living which had decided his own profession had fallen vacant and his father wishing perhaps not to be thought cruel and unnatural by his wife had made no appointment until herberts return well knowing that he would decide against himself  and feeling that as things stood it would be an awkward exercise of patronage to put him in at once  herbert had declared that nothing would have induced him to accept what he persuaded his father to let him offer to james bindon whom he had found to have an old mother in great need of the comfortable home which without interest or any talent save for hard work he could scarcely hope to secure to her  and you herbert said julius can i ask you to come back to me now that we shall have a fair amount to do between us  herbert smiled and shook his head as he took out an advertisement for a curate in one of the blackest parishes of the black country ive written to answer that he said  julius did not try to hinder him  what had been exaggerated had parsed away and he was now a brave man going forth in his strength and youth to the service he had learnt to understand able still keenly to enjoy but only using pleasure as an incidental episode for the delight of others and as subordinate to the true work of his life  he asked for his fellowworker mrs duncombe  there were tidings but disappointing ones  she had written a long letter to julius full of her reasons for being received into the roman communion where she rapturously declared she had for the first time found peace  anne and rosamond took the change most bitterly to heart but julius though believing he could have saved her from the schism by showing her the true beauty and efficiency of her own church could not wonder at this effect of foreign influences on one so recently and imperfectly taught and whose ardent nature required strong forms of whatever she took up  and the letters she continued to write to julius were rapturous in the cause of the pope and as to all that she had once most contemned  she had taken her children with her but her husband remained tolerant indifferent and so probably he would do while his health lasted  early in the summer frank and eleonora were married and a pretty little house in the outskirts of london found for them suiting with the grace of the one and the poetry of the other  it was a small quiet household but could pleasantly receive those literary friends of franks whom he delighted to present to his beautiful and appreciative wife whose sweetness and brightness grew every day under the influence of affection and confidence  the other augury of poor lady tyrrell that their holidays would be spent at compton hall was fulfilled but very pleasantly for both parties for it was as much home to lena as to frank  miless geniality made all at ease that came near him and anne though never a conversational person was a quietly kind hostess much beloved by all who had experienced her gentleness and she had frank and lena to give distinction in their different ways to her london parties as at compton rosamond never failed to give everything a charm where she assisted in planning or receiving  rosamond would never cease to love society  even had she been a grandmother she would have fired at the notion of a party enjoy and render it enjoyable and the mere announcement of a new face would be as stimulating to her as it was the reverse to anne  but she had grown into such union with her husband and had so forgotten the rathforlane defence as to learn that it was pleasanter to do as he liked than to try to make him like what she did and a look of disapproval from him would open her eyes to the flaws in any scheme however enchanting at first  she was too necessary an element in all hospitalities of cecil or of anne not to get quite as much diversion as so thorough a wife and mother could find time for since julia did not remain by any means an only child and besides her permanent charge of terence relays of de lanceys were constantly casting up at the rectory for mothering in some form or other  cecil depended on her more than on any one else for sympathy not expressly in feeling but in all her pursuits  in three years time sirenwood was in perfect order the once desolate garden blazed with ribbons triangles and pattipans of verbena scarlet geranium and calceolaria with intervals of echiverias pronounced by tom to be like cabbages trying to turn into copper kettles her foliage plants got all the prizes at horticultural shows her poultry were incomparable at their exhibitions her cottages were models her school machinery perfect and if a pattern in farming apparatus were wanted people went to mrs raymond poynsetts steward  she had people of note to stay with her every winter went to london for the season and was made much of and all the time she looked as little and pinched and weary and hearthungered as ever and never seemed to thaw or warm clinging to no one but to miles for counsel and to rosamond for the fellowfeeling it was not always easy to givewhen it was apparently only about an orchid or a churnand yet rosamond tried for she knew it was starvation for sympathy  the charnock world murmured a little when after a succession of de lancey visitors for four months the rectory was invaded by rosamonds eldest brother lord ballybrehon always the most hair brained of the family and now invalided home in consequence of a concussion of the brain while pigsticking in india  he was but a year older than rosamond and her favourite of all whose scrapes she had shared befriended defended and scolded in turn very handsome very lazily daring droll and mischievous a sort of concentration of all the other de lanceys  his sister loved him passionately he fascinated the rector and little julia was the adorer of uncle bally  but rosamond was rather aghast to find bally making such love as only an irishman could do to the prim little widow at sirenwood dismayed and a little bit ashamed of her unspoken conviction that bally after all his wild freaks and frolics had come to have an eye to the needs of the rathforlane property and what were her feelings when instead of finding the wild irishman contemned she perceived that he was believed in and met fully half way  the stiffness melted the eyes softened and sparkled the lips parted in soft agitated smiles the cheeks learnt to blush and cecil was absolutely and thoroughly in love  yes she had found her heart and was wonwon in spite of the dunstone dislike to the beggarly titlein spite of miless well considered cautionsin spite of all her original self  and if ballybrehon began from mere desire to try for the wellendowed widow he had the warm loving nature that was sure to kindle and reciprocate the affection he evoked enough to make him a kind husband  and yet could any one have wished cecil poynsett a more trying life than one of her disposition must needs have with impetuous unpunctual uncertain scatterbrained openhanded ballybrehon always in a scramble always inviting guests upon guests without classification and never remembering whom he had invited  rosamond herself declared she should be either in a rage or worn to fritters by a month of it  how cecil liked it never appeared  some thought that they squabbled and worried each other in private but it is certain that as terry said bally had turned the block into living flesh and blood and lady ballybrehon was wondrously livelier brighter and sweeter ever since she had been entirely conquered by the tyrant love and had ceased to be the slave of her own way
