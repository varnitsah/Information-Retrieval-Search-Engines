54732281	some roundabout papers     on some carp at sans souci    we have lately made the acquaintance of an old lady of ninety who has passed the last twentyfive years of her old life in a great metropolitan establishment the workhouse namely of the parish of saint lazarus  stay  twentythree or four years ago she came out once and thought to earn a little money by hop picking  but being overworked and having to lie out at night she got a palsy which has incapacitated her from all further labour and has caused her poor old limbs to shake ever since  an illustration of that dismal proverb which tells us how poverty makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows this poor old shaking body has to lay herself down every night in her workhouse bed by the side of some other old woman with whom she may or may not agree  she herself cant be a very pleasant bedfellow poor thing with her shaking old limbs and cold feet  she lies awake a deal of the night to be sure not thinking of happy old times for hers never were happy  but sleepless with aches and agues and rheumatism of old age  the gentleman gave me brandyand water she said her old voice shaking with rapture at the thought  i never had a great love for queen charlotte but i like her better now from what this old lady told me  the queen who loved snuff herself has left a legacy of snuff to certain poorhouses  and in her watchful nights this old woman takes a pinch of queen charlottes snuff and it do comfort me sir that it do  pulveris exigui munus  here is a forlorn aged creature shaking with palsy with no soul among the great struggling multitude of mankind to care for her not quite trampled out of life but past and forgotten in the rush made a little happy and soothed in her hours of unrest by this penny legacy  let me think as i write  the next months sermon thank goodness is safe to press  this discourse will appear at the season when i have read that wassailbowls make their appearance  at the season of pantomime turkey and sausages plumpuddings jollifications for schoolboys  christmas bills and reminiscences more or less sad and sweet for elders  if we oldsters are not merry we shall be having a semblance of merriment  we shall see the young folks laughing round the hollybush  we shall pass the bottle round cosily as we sit by the fire  that old thing will have a sort of festival too beef beer and pudding will be served to her for that day also christmas falls on a thursday  friday is the workhouse day for coming out  mary remember that old goody twoshoes has her invitation for friday 26th december  ninety is she poor old soul  ah what a bonny face to catch under a mistletoe  yes ninety sir she says and my mother was a hundred and my grandmother was a hundred and two  herself ninety her mother a hundred her grandmother a hundred and two  what a queer calculation  ninety  very good granny  you were born then in 1772  your mother we will say was twentyseven when you were born and was born therefore in 1745  your grandmother was thirtyfive when her daughter was born and was born therefore in 1710  we will begin with the present granny first  my good old creature you cant of course remember but that little gentleman for whom you mother was laundress in the temple was the ingenious mr goldsmith author of a history of england the vicar of wakefield and many diverting pieces  you were brought almost an infant to his chambers in brick court and he gave you some sugarcandy for the doctor was always good to children  that gentleman who wellnigh smothered you by sitting down on you as you lay in a chair asleep was the learned mr s johnson whose history of rasselas you have never read my pour soul and whose tragedy of irene i dont believe any man in these kingdoms ever perused  that tipsy scotch gentleman who used to come to the chambers sometimes and at whom everybody laughed wrote a more amusing book than any of the scholars your mr burke and your mr johnson and your dr goldsmith  your father often took him home in a chair to his lodgings  and has done as much for parson sterne in bond street the famous wit  of course my good creature you remember the gordon riots and crying no popery before mr langdales house the popish distillers and that bonny fire of my lord mansfields books in bloomsbury square  bless us what a heap of illuminations you have seen for the glorious victory over the americans at breeds hill  for the peace in 1814 and the beautiful chinese bridge in st jamess park  for the coronation of his majesty whom you recollect as prince of wales goody dont you  yes  and you went in a procession of laundresses to pay your respects to his good lady the injured queen of england at brandenburg house  and you remember your mother told you how she was taken to see the scotch lords executed at the tower  and as for your grandmother she was born five months after the battle of malplaquet she was where her poor father was killed fighting like a bold briton for the queen  with the help of a wades chronology i can make out ever so queer a history for you my poor old body and a pedigree as authentic as many in the peeragebooks  peeragebooks and pedigrees  what does she know about them battles and victories treasons kings and beheadings literary gentlemen and the like what have they ever been to her granny did you ever hear of general wolfe  your mother may have seen him embark and your father may have carried a musket under him  your grandmother may have cried huzza for marlborough  but what is the prince duke to you and did you ever so much as hear tell of his name  how many hundred or thousand of years had that toad lived who was in the coal at the defunct exhibition  and yet he was not a bit better informed than toads seven or eight hundred years younger  dont talk to me your nonsense about exhibitions and prince dukes and toads in coals or coals in toads or what is it says granny  i know there was a good queen charlotte for she left me snuff  and it comforts me of a night when i lie awake  to me there is something very touching in the notion of that little pinch of comfort doled out to granny and gratefully inhaled by her in the darkness  dont you remember what traditions there used to be of chests of plate bulses of diamonds laces of inestimable value sent out of the country privately by the old queen to enrich certain relatives in mckl nbrg strltz  not all the treasure went  non omnis moritur a poor old palsied thing at midnight is made happy sometimes as she lifts her shaking old hand to her nose  gliding noiselessly among the beds where lie the poor creatures huddled in their cheerless dormitory i fancy an old ghost with a snuffbox that does not creak  there goody take of my rappee  you will not sneeze and i shall not say god bless you  but you will think kindly of old queen charlotte wont you  ah  i had a many troubles a many troubles  i was a prisoner almost so much as you are  i had to eat boiled mutton every day  entre nous i abominated it  but i never complained  i swallowed it  i made the best of a hard life  we have all our burdens to bear  but hark  i hear the cockcrow and snuff the morning air  and with this the royal ghost vanishes up the chimney  if there be a chimney in that dismal harem where poor old twoshoes and her companions pass their nights  their dreary nights their restless nights their cold long nights shared in what glum companionship illumined by what a feeble taper  did i understand you my good twoshoes to say that your mother was sevenandtwenty years old when you were born and that she married your esteemed father when she herself was twentyfive 1745 then was the date of your dear mothers birth  i daresay her father was absent in the low countries with his royal highness the duke of cumberland under whom he had the honour of carrying a halberd at the famous engagement of fontenoy  or if not there he may have been at preston pans under general sir john cope when the wild highlanders broke through all the laws of discipline and the english lines  and being on the spot did he see the famous ghost which didnt appear to colonel gardner of the dragoons  my good creature is it possible you dont remember that doctor swift sir robert walpole my lord orford as you justly say old sarah marlborough and little mr pope of twitnam died in the year of your birth  what a wretched memory you have  what havent they a library and the commonest books of reference at the old convent of saint lazarus where you dwell  convent of saint lazarus prince william dr swift atossa and mr pope of twitnam  what is the gentleman talking about says old goody with a ho ho and a laugh like a old parrot  you know they live to be as old as methuselah parrots do and a parrot of a hundred is comparatively young ho ho ho  yes and likewise carps live to an immense old age  some which frederick the great fed at sans souci are there now with great humps of blue mould on their old backs  and they could tell all sorts of queer stories if they chose to speak  but they are very silent carps are  of their nature peu communicatives oh what has been thy long life old goody but a dole of bread and water and a perch on a cage  a dreary swim round and round a lethe of a pond  what are rossbach or jena to those mouldy ones and do they know it is a grandchild of england who brings bread to feed them  no  those sans souci carps may live to be a thousand years old and have nothing to tell but that one day is like another  and the history of friend goody twoshoes has not much more variety than theirs  hard labour hard fare hard bed numbing cold all night and gnawing hunger most days  that is her lot  is it lawful in my prayers to say thank heaven i am not as one of these  if i were eighty would i like to feel the hunger always gnawing gnawing to have to get up and make a bow when mr bumble the beadle entered the common room to have to listen to miss prim who came to give me her ideas of the next world  if i were eighty i own i should not like to have to sleep with another gentleman of my own age gouty a bad sleeper kicking in his old dreams and snoring to march down my vale of years at word of command accommodating my tottering old steps to those of the other prisoners in my dingy hopeless old gang  to hold out a trembling hand for a sickly pittance of gruel and say thank you maam to miss prim when she has done reading her sermon john when goody twoshoes comes next friday i desire she may not be disturbed by theological controversies  you have a fair voice and i heard you and the maids singing a hymn very sweetly the other night and was thankful that our humble household should be in such harmony  poor old twoshoes is so old and toothless and quaky that she cant sing a bit  but dont be giving yourself airs over her because she cant sing and you can  make her comfortable at our kitchen hearth  set that old kettle to sing by our hob  warm her old stomach with nutbrown ale and a toast laid in the fire  be kind to the poor old schoolgirl of ninety who has had leave to come out for a day of christmas holiday  shall there be many more christmases for thee  think of the ninety she has seen already  the fourscore and ten cold cheerless nipping new years  if you were in her place would you like to have a remembrance of better early days when you were young and happy and loving perhaps  or would you prefer to have no past on which your mind could rest  about the year 1788 goody were your cheeks rosy and your eyes bright and did some young fellow in powder and a pigtail look in them  we may grow old but to us some stories never are old  on a sudden they rise up not dead but living  not forgotten but freshly remembered  the eyes gleam on us as they used to do  the dear voice thrills in our hearts  the rapture of the meeting the terrible terrible parting again and again the tragedy is acted over  yesterday in the street i saw a pair of eyes so like two which used to brighten at my coming once that the whole past came back as i walked lonely in the rush of the strand and i was young again in the midst of joys and sorrows alike sweet and sad alike sacred and fondly remembered  if i tell a tale out of school will any harm come to my old schoolgirl  once a lady gave her a halfsovereign which was a source of great pain and anxiety to goody twoshoes  she sewed it away in her old stays somewhere thinking here at least was a safe investment  vestis  a vest  an investment  pardon me thou poor old thing but i cannot help the pleasantry  and what do you think  another pensionnaire of the establishment cut the coin out of goodys stays  an old woman who went upon two crutches  faugh the old witch  what  violence amongst these toothless tottering trembling feeble ones  robbery amongst the penniless  dogs coming and snatching lazaruss crumbs out of his lap  ah how indignant goody was as she told the story  to that pond at potsdam where the carps live for hundreds of hundreds of years with hunches of blue mould on their back i daresay the little prince and princess of preussenbritannien come sometimes with crumbs and cakes to feed the mouldy ones those eyes may have goggled from beneath the weeds at napoleons jackboots  they have seen fredericks lean shanks reflected in their pool  and perhaps monsieur de voltaire has fed them and now for a crumb of biscuit they will fight push hustle rob squabble gobble relapsing into their tranquillity when the ignoble struggle is over  sans souci indeed  it is mighty well writing sans souci over the gate  but where is the gate through which care has not slipped  she perches on the shoulders of the sentry in the sentrybox  she whispers the porter sleeping in his armchair  she glides up the staircase and lies down between the king and queen in their bedroyal  this very night i daresay she will perch upon poor old goody twoshoes meagre bolster and whisper will the gentleman and those ladies ask me again  no no  they will forget poor old twoshoes goody  for shame of yourself  do not be cynical  do not mistrust your fellowcreatures  what  has the christmas morning dawned upon thee ninety times  for fourscore and ten years has it been thy lot to totter on this earth hungry and obscure peace and goodwill to thee let us say at this christmas season come drink eat rest awhile at our hearth thou poor old pilgrim  and of the bread which gods bounty gives us i pray brother reader we may not forget to set aside a part for those noble and silent poor from whose innocent hands war has torn the means of labour  enough  as i hope for beef at christmas i vow a note shall be sent to saint lazarus union house in which mr roundabout requests the honour of mrs twoshoes company on friday 26th december    de juventute    we who lived before railways and survive out of the ancient world are like father noah and his family out of the ark  the children will gather round and say to us patriarchs tell us grandpapa about the old world  and we shall mumble our old stories  and we shall drop off one by one  and there will be fewer and fewer of us and these very old and feeble  there will be but ten praerailroadites left  then three  then two  then one  then 0  if the hippopotamus had the least sensibility of which i cannot trace any signs either in his hide or his face i think he would go down to the bottom of his tank and never come up again  does he not see that he belongs to bygone ages and that his great hulking barrel of a body is out of place in these times  what has he in common with the brisk young life surrounding him  in the watches of the night when the keepers are asleep when the birds are on one leg when even the little armadillo is quiet and the monkeys have ceased their chatter he  i mean the hippopotamus  and the elephant and the longnecked giraffe perhaps may lay their heads together and have a colloquy about the great silent antediluvian world which they remember where mighty monsters floundered through the ooze crocodiles basked on the banks and dragons darted out of the caves and waters before men were made to slay them  we who lived before railways are antediluvians  we must pass away  we are growing scarcer every day  and old  old  very old relicts of the times when george was still fighting the dragon  not long since a company of horseriders paid a visit to our wateringplace  we went to see them and i bethought me that young walter juvenis who was in the place might like also to witness the performance  a pantomime is not always amusing to persons who have attained a certain age  but a boy at a pantomime is always amused and amusing and to see his pleasure is good for most hypochondriacs  we sent to walters mother requesting that he might join us and the kind lady replied that the boy had already been at the morning performance of the equestrians but was most eager to go in the evening likewise  and go he did  and laughed at all mr merrymans remarks though he remembered them with remarkable accuracy and insisted upon waiting to the very end of the fun and was only induced to retire just before its conclusion by representations that the ladies of the party would be incommoded if they were to wait and undergo the rush and trample of the crowd round about  when this fact was pointed out to him he yielded at once though with a heavy heart his eyes looking longingly towards the ring as we retreated out of the booth  we were scarcely clear of the place when we heard god save the queen played by the equestrian band the signal that all was over  our companion entertained us with scraps of the dialogue on our way home  precious crumbs of wit which he had brought away from that feast  he laughed over them again as he walked under the stars  he has them now and takes them out of the pocket of his memory and crunches a bit and relishes it with a sentimental tenderness too for he is no doubt back at school by this time  the holidays are over  and doctor birchs young friends have reassembled  queer jokes which caused a thousand simple mouths to grin  as the jaded merryman uttered them to the old gentleman with the whip some of the old folks in the audience i daresay indulged in reflections of their own  there was one joke  i utterly forget it  but it began with merryman saying what he had for dinner  he had mutton for dinner at one oclock after which he had to come to business  and then came the point  walter juvenis esq rev doctor birchs market rodborough if you read this will you please send me a line and let me know what was the joke mr merryman made about having his dinner  you remember well enough  but do i want to know  suppose a boy takes a favourite longcherished lump of cake out of his pocket and offers you a bit  merci  the fact is i dont care much about knowing that joke of mr merrymans  but whilst he was talking about his dinner and his mutton and his landlord and his business i felt a great interest about mr m in private life  about his wife lodgings earnings and general history and i daresay was forming a picture of those in my mind   wife cooking the mutton  children waiting for it merryman in his plain clothes and so forth  during which contemplation the joke was uttered and laughed at and mr m resuming his professional duties was tumbling over head and heels  do not suppose i am going sicut est mos to indulge in moralities about buffoons paint motley and mountebanking nay prime ministers rehearse their jokes  opposition leaders prepare and polish them  tabernacle preachers must arrange them in their minds before they utter them  all i mean is that i would like to know any one of these performers thoroughly and out of his uniform  that preacher and why in his travels this and that point struck him  wherein lies his power of pathos humour eloquence   that minister of state and what moves him and how his private heart is working   i would only say that at a certain time of life certain things cease to interest but about some things when we cease to care what will be the use of life sight hearing  poems are written and we cease to admire  lady jones invites us and we yawn  she ceases to invite us and we are resigned  the last time i saw a ballet at the opera  oh it is many years ago  i fell asleep in the stalls wagging my head in insane dreams and i hope affording amusement to the company while the feet of five hundred nymphs were cutting flicflacs on the stage at a few paces distant  ah i remember a different state of things  credite posteri  to see these nymphs  gracious powers how beautiful they were  that leering painted shrivelled thinarmed thickankled old thing cutting dreary capers coming thumping down on her board out of time  that an operadancer  pooh  my dear walter the great difference between my time and yours who will enter life some two or three years hence is that now the dancing women and singing women are ludicrously old out of time and out of tune the paint is so visible and the dinge and wrinkles of their wretched old cotton stockings that i am surprised how anybody can like to look at them  and as for laughing at me for falling asleep i cant understand a man of sense doing otherwise  in my time a la bonne heure  in the reign of george iv i give you my honour all the dancers at the opera were as beautiful as houris  even in william ivs time when i think of duvernay prancing in as the bayadere  i say it was a vision of loveliness such as mortal eyes cant see nowadays  how well i remember the tune to which she used to appear  kaled used to say to the sultan my lord a troop of those dancing and singing gurls called bayaderes approaches and to the clash of cymbals and the thumping of my heart in she used to dance  there has never been anything like it  never  there never will be  i laugh to scorn old people who tell me about your noblet your montessu your vistris your parisot  pshaw the senile twaddlers  and the impudence of the young men with their music and their dancers of today  i tell you the women are dreary old creatures  i tell you one air in an opera is just like another and they send all rational creatures to sleep  ah ronzi de begnis thou lovely one  ah caradori thou smiling angel  ah malibran  nay i will come to modern times and acknowledge that lablache was a very good singer thirty years ago though porto was the boy for me  and they we had ambrogetti and curioni and donzelli a rising young singer  but what is most certain and lamentable is the decay of stage beauty since the days of george iv  think of sontag  i remember her in otello and the donna del lago in 28  i remember being behind the scenes at the opera where numbers of us young fellows of fashion used to go and seeing sontag let her hair fall down over her shoulders previous to her murder by donzelli  young fellows have never seen beauty like that heard such a voice seen such hair such eyes  dont tell me  a man who has been about town since the reign of george iv ought he not to know better than you young lads who have seen nothing  the deterioration of women is lamentable  and the conceit of the young fellows more lamentable still that they wont see this fact but persist in thinking their time as good as ours  bless me when i was a lad the stage was covered with angels who sang acted and danced  when i remember the adelphi and the actresses there  when i think of miss chester and miss love and mrs serle at sadlers wells and her forty glorious pupils  of the opera and noblet and the exquisite young taglioni and pauline leroux and a host more  one muchadmired being of those days i confess i never cared for and that was the chief male dancer  a very important personage then with a bare neck bare arms a tunic and a hat and feathers who used to divide the applause with the ladies and who has now sunk down a trapdoor for ever  and this frank admission ought to show that i am not your mere twaddling laudator temporis acti  your old fogey who can see no good except in his own time  they say that claret is better nowadays and cookery much improved since the days of my monarch  of george iv  pastry cookery is certainly not so good  i have often eaten halfa crowns worth including i trust gingerbeer at our school pastrycooks and that is a proof that the pastry must have been very good for could i do as much now  i passed by the pastrycooks shop lately having occasion to visit my old school it looked a very dingy old bakers  misfortunes may have come over him  those penny tarts certainly did not look so nice as i remember them  but he may have grown careless as he has grown old i should judge him to be now about ninetysix years of age and his hand may have lost its cunning  not that we were not great epicures  i remember how we constantly grumbled at the quantity of the food in our masters house  which on my conscience i believe was excellent and plentiful  and how we tried once or twice to eat him out of house and home  at the pastrycooks we may have overeaten ourselves i have admitted halfacrowns worth for my own part but i dont like to mention the real figure for fear of perverting the present generation of boys by my monstrous confession  we may have eaten too much i say  we did  but what then  the school apothecary was sent for  a couple of small globules at night a trifling preparation of senna in the morning and we had not to go to school so that the draught was an actual pleasure  for our amusements besides the games in vogue which were pretty much in old times as they are now except cricket par exemple  and i wish the present youth joy of their bowling and suppose armstrong and whitworth will bowl at them with light fieldpieces next there were novels  ah i trouble you to find such novels in the present day  o scottish chiefs didnt we weep over you o mysteries of udolpho didnt i and briggs minor draw pictures out of you as i have said  efforts feeble indeed but still giving pleasure to us and our friends  i say old boy draw us vivaldi tortured in the inquisition or draw us don quixote and the windmills you know amateurs would say to boys who had a love of drawing  peregrine pickle we liked our fathers admiring it and telling us the sly old boys it was capital fun  but i think i was rather bewildered by it though roderick random was and remains delightful  i dont remember having sterne in the school library no doubt because the works of that divine were not considered decent for young people  ah not against thy genius o father of uncle toby and trim would i say a word in disrespect  but i am thankful to live in times when men no longer have the temptation to write so as to call blushes on womens cheeks and would shame to whisper wicked allusions to honest boys  then above all we had walter scott the kindly the generous the pure  the companion of what countless delightful hours  the purveyor of how much happiness  the friend whom we recall as the constant benefactor of our youth how well i remember the type and the brownish paper of the old duodecimo tales of my landlord  i have never dared to read the pirate and the bride of lammermoor or kenilworth from that day to this because the finale is unhappy and people die and are murdered at the end  but ivanhoe and quentin durward  oh for a halfholiday and a quiet corner and one of those books again  those books and perhaps those eyes with which we read them  and it may be the brains behind the eyes it may be the tart was good  but how fresh the appetite was  if the gods would give me the desire of my heart i should be able to write a story which boys would relish for the next few dozen of centuries  the boycritic loves the story  grown up he loves the author who wrote the story  hence the kindly tie is established between writer and reader and lasts pretty nearly for life  i meet people now who dont care of walter scott or the arabian nights  i am sorry for them unless they in their time have found their romancer  their charming scheherazade by the way walter when you are writing tell me who is the favourite novelist in the fourth form now  have you got anything so good and kindly as dear miss edgeworths frank  it used to belong to a fellows sisters generally  but though he pretended to despise it and said oh stuff for girls he read it  and i think there were one or two passages which would try my eyes now were i to meet with the little book  as for thomas and jeremiah it is only my witty way of calling tom and jerry i went to the british museum the other day on purpose to get it  but somehow if you will press the question so closely on reperusal tom and jerry is not so brilliant as i had supposed it to be  the pictures are just as fine as ever and i shook hands with broadbacked jerry hawthorn and corinthian tom with delight after many years absence  but the style of the writing i own was not pleasing to me  i even thought it a little vulgar  well well other writers have been considered vulgar  and as a description of the sports and amusements of london in the ancient times more curious than amusing  but the pictures  oh the pictures are noble still  first there is jerry arriving from the country in a green coat and leather gaiters and being measured for a fashionable suit at corinthian house by corinthian toms tailor  then away for the career of pleasure and fashion  the park delicious excitement the theatre the saloon the greenroom  rapturous bliss  the opera itself and then perhaps to temple bar to knock down a charley there  there are jerry and tom with their tights and little cocked hats coming from the opera  very much as gentlemen in waiting on royalty are habited now  there they are at almacks itself amidst a crowd of highbred personages with the duke of clarence himself looking at them dancing  now strange change they are in tom cribbs parlour where they dont seem to be a whit less at home than in fashions gilded halls and now they are at newgate seeing the irons knocked off the malefactors legs previous to execution  what hardened ferocity in the countenance of the desperado in yellow breeches  what compunction in the face of the gentleman in black who i suppose has been forging and who clasps his hands and listens to the chaplain  now we haste away to merrier scenes  to tattersalls ah gracious powers what a funny fellow that actor was who performed dicky green in that scene in the play  and now we are at a private party at which corinthian tom is waltzing and very gracefully too as you must confess with corinthian kate whilst bob logic the oxonian is playing on the piano  after the text says the oxonian had played several pieces of lively music he requested as a favour that kate and his friend tom would perform a waltz  kate without any hesitation immediately stood up  tom offered his hand to his fascinating partner and the dance took place  the plate conveys a correct representation of the gay scene at that precise moment  the anxiety of the oxonian to witness the attitudes of the elegant pair had nearly put a stop to their movements  on turning round from the pianoforte and presenting his comical mug kate could scarcely suppress a laugh  and no wonder  just look at it now as i have copied it to the best of my humble ability and compare master logics countenance and attitude with the splendid elegance of tom  now every london man is weary and blase  there is an enjoyment of life in these young bucks of 1823 which contrasts strangely with our feelings of 1860  here for instance is a specimen of their talk and walk if says logic  if enjoyment is your motto you may make the most of an evening at vauxhall more than at any other place in the metropolis  it is all free and easy  stay as long as you like and depart when you think proper  your description is so flattering replied jerry that i do not care how soon the time arrives for us to start  logic proposed a bit of a stroll in order to get rid of an hour or two which was immediately accepted by tom and jerry  a turn or two in bond street a stroll through piccadilly a look in at tattersalls a ramble through pall mall and a strut on the corinthian path fully occupied the time of our heroes until the hour for dinner arrived when a few glasses of toms rich wines soon put them on the qui vive  vauxhall was then the object in view and the trio started bent upon enjoying the pleasures which this place so amply affords  how nobly those inverted commas those italics those capitals bring out the writers wit and relieve the eye  they are as good as jokes though you maynt quite preceive the point  mark the varieties of lounge in which the young men indulge  now a stroll then a look in then a ramble and presently a strut when george prince of wales was twenty i have read in an old magazine the princes lounge was a peculiar manner of walking which the young bucks imitated  at windsor george iii had a cats path  a sly early walk which the good old king took in the grey morning before his household was astir  what was the corinthian path here recorded  does any antiquary know  and what were the rich wines which our friends took and which enable them to enjoy vauxhall  vauxhall is gone but the wines which could occasion such a delightful perversion of the intellect as to enable it to enjoy ample pleasures there what were they  so the game of life proceeds until jerry hawthorn the rustic is fairly knocked up by all this excitement and is forced to go home and the last picture represents him getting into the coach at the white horse cellar he being one of six inside  whilst his friends shake him by the hand  whilst the sailor mounts on the roof  whilst the jews hang round with oranges knives and sealingwax  whilst the guard is closing the door  where are they now those sealingwax vendors where are the guards where are the jolly teams where are the coaches and where the youth that climbed inside and out of them  that heard the merry horn which sounds no more  that saw the sun rise over stonehenge that rubbed away the bitter tears at night after parting as the coach sped on the journey to school and london  that looked out with beating heart as the milestones flew by for the welcome corner where began home and holidays  it is night now  and here is home  gathered under the quiet roof elders and children lie alike at rest  in the midst of a great peace and calm the stars look out from the heavens  the silence is peopled with the past  sorrowful remorses for sins and shortcomings  memories of passionate joys and griefs rise out of their graves both now alike calm and sad  eyes as i shut mine look at me that have long ceased to shine  the town and the fair landscape sleep under the starlight wreathed in the autumn mists  twinkling among the houses a light keeps watch here and there in what may be a sick chamber or two  the clock tolls sweetly in the silent air  here is night and rest  an awful sense of thanks makes the heart swell and the head bow as i pass to my room through the sleeping house and feel as though a hushed blessing were upon it    round about the christmas tree    the kindly christmas tree from which i trust every gentle reader has pulled out a bonbon or two is yet all aflame whilst i am writing and sparkles with the sweet fruits of its season  you young ladies may you have plucked pretty giftlings from it  and out of the cracker sugarplum which you have split with the captain or the sweet young curate may you have read one of those delicious conundrums which the confectioners introduce into the sweetmeats and which apply to the cunning passion of love those riddles are to be read at your age when i daresay they are amusing  as for dolly merry and bell who are standing at the tree they dont care about the loveriddle part but understand the sweetalmoned portion very well  they are four five six years old  patience little people  a dozen merry christmases more and you will be reading those wonderful loveconundrums too  as for us elderly folks we watch the babies at their sport and the young people pulling at the branches  and instead of finding bonbons or sweeties in the packets which we pluck off the boughs we find enclosed mr carnifexs review of the quarters meat  mr sartors compliments and little statement for self and the young gentlemen  and madame de sainte crinolines respects to the young ladies who encloses her account and will sent on saturday please  or we stretch our hand out to the educational branch of the christmas tree and there find a lively and amusing article from the rev henry holyshade containing our dear tommys exceedingly moderate account for the last terms school expenses  the tree yet sparkles i say  i am writing on the day before twelfth day if you must know  but already ever so many of the fruits have been pulled and the christmas lights have gone out bobby miseltow who has been staying with us for a week and who has been sleeping mysteriously in the bathroom comes to say he is going away to spend the rest of the holidays with his grandmother  and i brush away the manly tear of regret as i part with the dear child  well bob goodbye since you will go  compliments to grandmamma  thank her for the turkey heres  a slight pecuniary transaction takes place at this juncture and bob nods and winks and puts his hand in his waistcoat pocket  you have had a pleasant week  bob  havent i  and exit anxious to know the amount of the coin which has just changed hands  he is gone and as the dear boy vanishes through the door behind which i see him perfectly i too cast up a little account of our past christmas week  when bobs holidays are over and the printer has sent me back this manuscript i know christmas will be an old story  all the fruit will be off the christmas tree then  the crackers will have cracked off  the almonds will have been crunched  and the sweetbitter riddles will have been read the lights will have perished off the dark green boughs  the toys growing on them will have been distributed fought for cherished neglected broken  ferdinand and fidelia will each keep out of it be still my gushing heart the remembrance of a riddle read together of a double almond munched together and of the moiety of an exploded cracker the maids i say will have taken down all that holly stuff and nonsense about the clocks lamps and lookingglasses the dear boys will be back at school fondly thinking of the pantomime fairies whom they have seen whose gaudy gossamer wings are battered by this time  and whose pink cotton or silk is it lower extremities are all dingy and dusty  yet but a few days bob and flakes of paint will have cracked off the fairy flowerbowers and the revolving temples of adamantine lustre will be as shabby as the city of pekin  when you read this will clown still be going on lolling his tongue out of his mouth and saying how are you tomorrow  to morrow indeed  he must be almost ashamed of himself if that cheek is still capable of the blush of shame for asking the absurd question  tomorrow indeed  tomorrow the diffugient snows will give place to spring the snowdrops will lift their heads  ladyday may be expected and the pecuniary duties peculiar to that feast  in place of bonbons trees will have an eruption of light green knobs the whitebait season will bloom  as if one need go on describing these vernal phenomena when christmas is still here though ending and the subject of my discourse  we have all admired the illustrated papers and noted how boisterously jolly they become at christmas time  what wassail bowls robinredbreasts waits snow landscapes bursts of christmas song  and then to think that these festivities are prepared months before  that these christmas pieces are prophetic  how kind of artists and poets to devise the festivities beforehand and serve them pat at the proper time we ought to be grateful to them as to the cook who gets up at midnight and sets the pudding aboiling which is to feast us at six oclock  i often think with gratitude of the famous mr nelson lee  the author of i dont know how many hundred glorious pantomimes  walking by the summer wave at margate or brighton perhaps revolving in his mind the idea of some new gorgeous spectacle of faery which the winter shall see complete he is like cook at midnight si parva licet  he watches and thinks  he pounds the sparkling sugar of benevolence the plums of fancy the sweetmeats of fun the figs of  well the figs of fairy fiction let us say and pops the whole in the seething cauldron of imagination and at due season serves up the pantomime  very few men in the course of nature can expect to see all the pantomimes in one season but i hope to the end of my life i shall never forego reading about them in that delicious sheet of the times which appears on the morning after boxingday  perhaps reading is even better than seeing  the best way i think is to say you are ill lie in bed and have the paper for two hours reading all the way down from drury lane to the britannia at hoxton  bob and i went to two pantomimes  one was at the theatre of fancy and the other at the fairy opera and i dont know which we liked the best  at the fancy we saw harlequin hamlet or daddys ghost and nunkys pison which is all very well  but gentlemen if you dont respect shakspeare to whom will you be civil  the palace and ramparts of elsinore by moon and snowlight is one of loutherbourgs finest efforts  the banqueting hall of the palace is illuminated  the peaks and gables glitter with the snow  the sentinels march blowing their fingers with the cold  the freezing of the nose of one of them is very neatly and dexterously arranged  the snow storm rises  the winds howl awfully along the battlements  the waves come curling leaping foaming to shore  hamlets umbrella is whirled away in the storm  he and his two friends stamp on each others toes to keep them warm  the stormspirits rise in the air and are whirled howling round the palace and the rocks  my eyes what tiles and chimneypots fly hurtling through the air  as the storm reaches its height here the wind instruments come in with prodigious effect and i compliment mr brumby and the violoncellos  as the snow storm rises queek queek queek go the fiddles and then thrumpty thrump comes a pizzicato movement in bob major which sends a shiver into your very bootsoles the thunder clouds deepen bong bong bong from the violoncellos  the forked lightning quivers through the clouds in a zigzag scream of violins  and look look look as the frothing roaring waves come rushing up the battlements and over the reeling parapet each hissing wave becomes a ghost sends the gun carriages rolling over the platform and plunges into the water again  hamlets mother comes on to the battlements to look for her son the storm whips her umbrella out of her hands and she retires screaming in pattens  the cabs on the stand in the great marketplace at elsinore are seen to drive off and several people are drowned  the gaslamps along the street are wrenched from their foundations and shoot through the troubled air  whist rush hish how the rain roars and pours  the darkness becomes awful always deepened by the power of the music  and see  in the midst of a rush and whirl and scream of spirits of air and wave  what is that ghastly figure moving hither  it becomes bigger bigger as it advances down the platform  more ghastly more horrible enormous  it is as tall as the whole stage  it seems to be advancing on the stalls and pit and the whole house screams with terror as the ghost of the late hamlet comes in and begins to speak  several people faint and the lightfingered gentry pick pockets furiously in the darkness  in the pitchy darkness this awful figure throwing his eyes about the gas in the boxes shuddering out of sight and the windinstruments bugling the most horrible wails the boldest spectator must have felt frightened  but hark what is that silver shimmer of the fiddles  is it  can it be  the grey dawn peeping in the stormy east  the ghosts eyes look blankly towards it and roll a ghastly agony  quicker quicker ply the violins of phoebus apollo  redder redder grow the orient clouds  cockadoodledoo crows that great cock which has just come out on the roof of the palace  and now the round sun himself pops up from behind the waves of night  where is the ghost  he is gone  purple shadows of morn slant oer the snowy sward the city wakes up in life and sunshine and we confess we are very much relieved at the disappearance of the ghost  we dont like those dark scenes in pantomimes  after the usual business that ophelia should be turned into columbine was to be expected  but i confess i was a little shocked when hamlets mother became pantaloon and was instantly knocked down by clown claudius  grimaldi is getting a little old now but for real humour there are few clowns like him  mr shuter as the gravedigger was chaste and comic as he always is and the scenepainters surpassed themselves  harlequin conqueror and the field of hastings at the other house is very pleasant too  the irascible william is acted with great vigour by snoxall and the battle of hastings is a good piece of burlesque  some trifling liberties are taken with history but what liberties will not the merry genius of pantomime permit himself  at the battle of hastings william is on the point of being defeated by the sussex volunteers very elegantly led by the always pretty miss waddy as haco sharpshooter when a shot from the normans kills harold  the fairy edith hereupon comes forward and finds his body which straightway leaps up a live harlequin whilst the conqueror makes an excellent clown and the archbishop of bayeux a diverting pantaloon c c c  perhaps these are not the pantomimes we really saw  but one description will do as well as another  the plots you see are a little intricate and difficult to understand in pantomimes and i may have mixed up one with another  that i was at the theatre on boxingnight is certain  but the pit was so full that i could only see fairy legs glittering in the distance as i stood at the door  and if i was badly off i think there was a young gentleman behind me worse off still  i own that he has good reason though others have not to speak ill of me behind my back and hereby beg his pardon  likewise to the gentleman who picked up a party in piccadilly who had slipped and fallen in the snow and was there on his back uttering energetic expressions  that party begs to offer thanks and compliments of the season  bobs behaviour on new years day i can assure dr holyshade was highly creditable to the boy  he had expressed a determination to partake of every dish which was put on the table  but after soup fish roastbeef and roastgoose he retired from active business until the pudding and mincepies made their appearance of which he partook liberally but not too freely  and he greatly advanced in my good opinion by praising the punch which was of my own manufacture and which some gentlemen present mr omgn amongst others pronounced to be too weak  too weak a bottle of rum a bottle of madeira half a bottle of brandy and two bottles and a half of water  can this mixture be said to be too weak for any mortal  our young friend amused the company during the evening by exhibiting a twoshilling magic lantern which he had purchased and likewise by singing sally come up a quaint but rather monotonous melody which i am told is sung by the poor negro on the banks of the broad mississippi  what other enjoyments did we proffer for the childs amusement during the christmas week  a great philosopher was giving a lecture to young folks at the british institution  but when this diversion was proposed to our young friend bob he said lecture  no thank you  not as i knows on and made sarcastic signals on his nose  perhaps he is of dr johnsons opinion about lectures  lectures sir what man would go to hear that imperfectly at a lecture which he can read at leisure in a book  i never went of my own choice to a lecture  that i can vow  as for sermons they are different  i delight in them and they cannot of course be too long  well we partook of yet other christmas delights besides pantomime pudding and pie  one glorious one delightful one most unlucky and pleasant day we drove in a brougham with a famous horse which carried us more quickly and briskly than any of your vulgar railways over battersea bridge on which the horses hoofs rung as if it had been iron  through suburban villages plumcaked with snow  under a leaden sky in which the sun hung like a redhot warmingpan  by pond after pond where not only men and boys but scores after scores of women and girls were sliding and roaring and clapping their lean old sides with laughter as they tumbled down and their hobnailed shoes flew up in the air  the air frosty with a lilac haze through which villas and commons and churches and plantations glimmered  we drive up the hill bob and i  we make the last two miles in eleven minutes  we pass that poor armless man who sits there in the cold following you with his eyes  i dont give anything and bob looks disappointed  we are set down neatly at the gate and a horseholder opens the brougham door i dont give anything  again disappointment on bobs part  i pay a shilling apiece and we enter into the glorious building which is decorated for christmas and straightway forgetfulness on bobs part of everything but that magnificent scene  the enormous edifice is all decorated for bob and christmas  the stalls the columns the fountains courts statues splendours are all crowned for christmas  the delicious negro is singing his alabama choruses for christmas and bob  he has scarcely done when tootarootatoo  mr punch is performing his surprising actions and hanging the beadle  the stalls are decorated  the refreshmenttables are piled with good things  at many fountains mulled claret is written up in appetizing capitals  mulled claret  oh jolly  how cold it is says bob  i pass on its only three oclock says bob  no only three i say meekly  we dine at seven sighs bob and its sooo coo old  i still would take no hints  no claret no refreshment no sandwiches no sausagerolls for bob  at last i am obliged to tell him all  just before we left home a little christmas bill popped in at the door and emptied my purse at the threshold  i forgot all about the transaction and had to borrow halfacrown from john coachman to pay for our entrance into the palace of delight  now you see bob why i could not treat you on that second of january when we drove to the palace together  when the girls and boys were sliding on the ponds at dulwich  when the darkling river was full of floating ice and the sun was like a warmingpan in the leaden sky  one more christmas sight we had of course and that sight i think i like as well as bob himself at christmas and at all seasons  we went to a certain garden of delight where whatever your cares are i think you can manage to forget some of them and muse and be not unhappy  to a garden beginning with a z which is as lively as noahs ark  where the fox has brought his brush and the cock has brought his comb and the elephant has brought his trunk and the kangaroo has brought his bag and the condor his old white wig and black satin hood  on this day it was so cold that the white bears winked their pink eyes as they plapped up and down by their pool and seemed to say aha this weather reminds us of dear home  cold bah  i have got such a warm coat says brother bruin i dont mind  and he laughs on his pole and clucks down a bun  the squealing hyaenas gnashed their teeth and laughed at us quite refreshingly at their window and cold as it was tiger tiger burning bright glared at us redhot through his bars and snorted blasts of hell  the woolly camel leered at us quite kindly as he paced round his ring on his silent pads  we went to our favourite places  our dear wambat came up and had himself scratched very affably  our fellow creatures in the monkey room held out their little black hands and piteously asked us for christmas alms  those darling alligators on their rock winked at us in the most friendly way the solemn eagles sat alone and scowled at us from their peaks whilst little tom ratel tumbled over head and heels for us in his usual diverting manner  if i have cares in my mind i come to the zoo and fancy they dont pass the gate  i recognise my friends my enemies in countless cages  i entertained the eagle the vulture the old billygoat and the blackpated crimsonnecked bleareyed baggy hookbeaked old marabou stork yesterday at dinner  and when bobs aunt came to tea in the evening and asked him what he had seen he stepped up to her gravely and said   first i saw the white bear then i saw the black then i saw the camel with a hump upon his back  chorus of children  then i saw the camel with a hump upon his back  then i saw the grey wolf with mutton in his maw then i saw the wambat waddle in the straw then i saw the elephant with his waving trunk then i saw the monkeys  mercy how unpleasantly they  smelt  there  no one can beat that piece of wit can he bob  and so it is over  but we had a jolly time whilst you were with us hadnt we  present my respects to the doctor  and i hope my boy we may spend another merry christmas next year
