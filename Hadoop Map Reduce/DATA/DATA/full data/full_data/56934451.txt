56934451	familiar studies of men and books     preface by way of criticism    these studies are collected from the monthly press  one appeared in the new quarterly one in macmillans and the rest in the cornhill magazine  to the cornhill i owe a double debt of thanks first that i was received there in the very best society and under the eye of the very best of editors and second that the proprietors have allowed me to republish so considerable an amount of copy  these nine worthies have been brought together from many different ages and countries  not the most erudite of men could be perfectly prepared to deal with so many and such various sides of human life and manners  to pass a true judgment upon knox and burns implies a grasp upon the very deepest strain of thought in scotland  a country far more essentially different from england than many parts of america for in a sense the first of these men recreated scotland and the second is its most essentially national production  to treat fitly of hugo and villon would involve yet wider knowledge not only of a country foreign to the author by race history and religion but of the growth and liberties of art  of the two americans whitman and thoreau each is the type of something not so much realised as widely sought after among the late generations of their countrymen and to see them clearly in a nice relation to the society that brought them forth an author would require a large habit of life among modern americans  as for yoshida i have already disclaimed responsibility it was but my hand that held the pen  in truth these are but the readings of a literary vagrant one book led to another one study to another  the first was published with trepidation  since no bones were broken the second was launched with greater confidence  so by insensible degrees a young man of our generation acquires in his own eyes a kind of roving judicial commission through the ages and having once escaped the perils of the freemans and the furnivalls sets himself up to right the wrongs of universal history and criticism  now it is one thing to write with enjoyment on a subject while the story is hot in your mind from recent reading coloured with recent prejudice and it is quite another business to put these writings coldly forth again in a bound volume  we are most of us attached to our opinions that is one of the natural affections of which we hear so much in youth but few of us are altogether free from paralysing doubts and scruples  for my part i have a small idea of the degree of accuracy possible to man and i feel sure these studies teem with error  one and all were written with genuine interest in the subject many however have been conceived and finished with imperfect knowledge and all have lain from beginning to end under the disadvantages inherent in this style of writing  of these disadvantages a word must here be said  the writer of short studies having to condense in a few pages the events of a whole lifetime and the effect on his own mind of many various volumes is bound above all things to make that condensation logical and striking  for the only justification of his writing at all is that he shall present a brief reasoned and memorable view  by the necessity of the case all the more neutral circumstances are omitted from his narrative and that of itself by the negative exaggeration of which i have spoken in the text lends to the matter in hand a certain false and specious glitter  by the necessity of the case again he is forced to view his subject throughout in a particular illumination like a studio artifice  like hales with pepys he must nearly break his sitters neck to get the proper shadows on the portrait it is from one side only that he has time to represent his subject  the side selected will either be the one most striking to himself or the one most obscured by controversy and in both cases that will be the one most liable to strained and sophisticated reading  in a biography this and that is displayed the hero is seen at home playing the flute the different tendencies of his work come one after another into notice and thus something like a true general impression of the subject may at last be struck  but in the short study the writer having seized his point of view must keep his eye steadily to that  he seeks perhaps rather to differentiate than truly to characterise  the proportions of the sitter must be sacrificed to the proportions of the portrait the lights are heightened the shadows overcharged the chosen expression continually forced may degenerate at length into a grimace and we have at best something of a caricature at worst a calumny hence if they be readable at all and hang together by their own ends the peculiar convincing force of these brief representations  they take so little a while to read and yet in that little while the subject is so repeatedly introduced in the same light and with the same expression that by sheer force of repetition that view is imposed upon the reader  the two english masters of the style macaulay and carlyle largely exemplify its dangers  carlyle indeed had so much more depth and knowledge of the heart his portraits of mankind are felt and rendered with so much more poetic comprehension and he like his favourite ram dass had a fire in his belly so much more hotly burning than the patent reading lamp by which macaulay studied that it seems at first sight hardly fair to bracket them together  but the point of view was imposed by carlyle on the men he judged of in his writings with an austerity not only cruel but almost stupid  they are too often broken outright on the procrustean bed they are probably always disfigured  the rhetorical artifice of macaulay is easily spied it will take longer to appreciate the moral bias of carlyle  so with all writers who insist on forcing some significance from all that comes before them and the writer of short studies is bound by the necessity of the case to write entirely in that spirit  what he cannot vivify he should omit  had it been possible to rewrite some of these papers i hope i should have had the courage to attempt it  but it is not possible  short studies are or should be things woven like a carpet from which it is impossible to detach a strand what is perverted has its place there for ever as a part of the technical means by which what is right has been presented  it is only possible to write another study and then with a new point of view would follow new perversions and perhaps a fresh caricature  hence it will be at least honest to offer a few grains of salt to be taken with the text and as some words of apology addition correction or amplification fall to be said on almost every study in the volume it will be most simple to run them over in their order  but this must not be taken as a propitiatory offering to the gods of shipwreck i trust my cargo unreservedly to the chances of the sea and do not by criticising myself seek to disarm the wrath of other and less partial critics  hugos romances  this is an instance of the point of view  the five romances studied with a different purpose might have given different results even with a critic so warmly interested in their favour  the great contemporary master of wordmanship and indeed of all literary arts and technicalities had not unnaturally dazzled a beginner  but it is best to dwell on merits for it is these that are most often overlooked  burns  i have left the introductory sentences on principal shairp partly to explain my own paper which was merely supplemental to his amiable but imperfect book partly because that book appears to me truly misleading both as to the character and the genius of burns  this seems ungracious but mr shairp has himself to blame so good a wordsworthian was out of character upon that stage  this half apology apart nothing more falls to be said except upon a remark called forth by my study in the columns of a literary review  the exact terms in which that sheet disposed of burns i cannot now recall but they were to this effect  that burns was a bad man the impure vehicle of fine verses and that this was the view to which all criticism tended  now i knew for my own part that it was with the profoundest pity but with a growing esteem that i studied the mans desperate efforts to do right and the more i reflected the stranger it appeared to me that any thinking being should feel otherwise  the complete letters shed indeed a light on the depths to which burns had sunk in his character of don juan but they enhance in the same proportion the hopeless nobility of his marrying jean  that i ought to have stated this more noisily i now see but that any one should fail to see it for himself is to me a thing both incomprehensible and worthy of open scorn  if burns on the facts dealt with in this study is to be called a bad man i question very much whether either i or the writer in the review have ever encountered what it would be fair to call a good one  all have some fault  the fault of each grinds down the hearts of those about him and  let us not blink the truth  hurries both him and them into the grave and when we find a man persevering indeed in his fault as all of us do and openly overtaken as not all of us are by its consequences to gloss the matter over with too polite biographers is to do the work of the wrecker disfiguring beacons on a perilous seaboard but to call him bad with a selfrighteous chuckle is to be talking in ones sleep with heedless and toobold in the arbour  yet it is undeniable that much anger and distress is raised in many quarters by the least attempt to state plainly what every one well knows of burnss profligacy and of the fatal consequences of his marriage  and for this there are perhaps two subsidiary reasons  for first there is in our drunken land a certain privilege extended to drunkenness  in scotland in particular it is almost respectable above all when compared with any irregularity between the sexes  the selfishness of the one so much more gross in essence is so much less immediately conspicuous in its results that our demiurgeous mrs grundy smiles apologetically on its victims it is often said  i have heard it with these ears  that drunkenness may lead to vice  now i did not think it at all proved that burns was what is called a drunkard and i was obliged to dwell very plainly on the irregularity and the too frequent vanity and meanness of his relations to women hence in the eyes of many my study was a step towards the demonstration of burnss radical badness  but second there is a certain class professors of that low morality so greatly more distressing than the better sort of vice to whom you must never represent an act that was virtuous in itself as attended by any other consequences than a large family and fortune  to hint that burnss marriage had an evil influence is with this class to deny the moral law  yet such is the fact  it was bravely done but he had presumed too far on his strength  one after another the lights of his life went out and he fell from circle to circle to the dishonoured sickbed of the end  and surely for any one that has a thing to call a soul he shines out tenfold more nobly in the failure of that frantic effort to do right than if he had turned on his heel with worldly wiseman married a congenial spouse and lived orderly and died reputably an old man  it is his chief title that he refrained from the wrong that amendeth wrong  but the common trashy mind of our generation is still aghast like the jews of old at any word of an unsuccessful virtue  job has been written and read the tower of siloam fell nineteen hundred years ago yet we have still to desire a little christianity or failing that a little even of that rude old norse nobility of soul which saw virtue and vice alike go unrewarded and was yet not shaken in its faith  walt whitman  this is a case of a second difficulty which lies continually before the writer of critical studies that he has to mediate between the author whom he loves and the public who are certainly indifferent and frequently averse many articles had been written on this notable man  one after another had leaned in my eyes either to praise or blame unduly  in the last case they helped to blindfold our fastidious public to an inspiring writer in the other by an excess of unadulterated praise they moved the more candid to revolt  i was here on the horns of a dilemma and between these horns i squeezed myself with perhaps some loss to the substance of the paper  seeing so much in whitman that was merely ridiculous as well as so much more that was unsurpassed in force and fitness  seeing the true prophet doubled as i thought in places with the bull in a china shop  it appeared best to steer a middle course and to laugh with the scorners when i thought they had any excuse while i made haste to rejoice with the rejoicers over what is imperishably good lovely human or divine in his extraordinary poems  that was perhaps the right road yet i cannot help feeling that in this attempt to trim my sails between an author whom i love and honour and a public too averse to recognise his merit i have been led into a tone unbecoming from one of my stature to one of whitmans  but the good and the great man will go on his way not vexed with my little shafts of merriment  he first of any one will understand how in the attempt to explain him credibly to mrs grundy i have been led into certain airs of the man of the world which are merely ridiculous in me and were not intentionally discourteous to himself  but there is a worse side to the question for in my eagerness to be all things to all men i am afraid i may have sinned against proportion it will be enough to say here that whitmans faults are few and unimportant when they are set beside his surprising merits  i had written another paper full of gratitude for the help that had been given me in my life full of enthusiasm for the intrinsic merit of the poems and conceived in the noisiest extreme of youthful eloquence  the present study was a rifacimento  from it with the design already mentioned and in a fit of horror at my old excess the big words and emphatic passages were ruthlessly excised but this sort of prudence is frequently its own punishment along with the exaggeration some of the truth is sacrificed and the result is cold constrained and grudging  in short i might almost everywhere have spoken more strongly than i did  thoreau  here is an admirable instance of the point of view forced throughout and of too earnest reflection on imperfect facts  upon me this pure narrow sunnilyascetic thoreau had exercised a great charm  i have scarce written ten sentences since i was introduced to him but his influence might be somewhere detected by a close observer still it was as a writer that i had made his acquaintance i took him on his own explicit terms and when i learned details of his life they were by the nature of the case and my own partipris read even with a certain violence in terms of his writings  there could scarce be a perversion more justifiable than that yet it was still a perversion  the study indeed raised so much ire in the breast of dr japp h a page thoreaus sincere and learned disciple that had either of us been men i please myself with thinking of less temper and justice the difference might have made us enemies instead of making us friends  to him who knew the man from the inside many of my statements sounded like inversions made on purpose and yet when we came to talk of them together and he had understood how i was looking at the man through the books while he had long since learned to read the books through the man i believe he understood the spirit in which i had been led astray  on two most important points dr japp added to my knowledge and with the same blow fairly demolished that part of my criticism  first if thoreau were content to dwell by walden pond it was not merely with designs of selfimprovement but to serve mankind in the highest sense  hither came the fleeing slave thence was he despatched along the road to freedom  that shanty in the woods was a station in the great underground railroad that adroit and philosophic solitary was an ardent worker soul and body in that so much more than honourable movement which if atonement were possible for nations should have gone far to wipe away the guilt of slavery  but in history sin always meets with condign punishment the generation passes the offence remains and the innocent must suffer  no underground railroad could atone for slavery even as no bills in parliament can redeem the ancient wrongs of ireland  but here at least is a new light shed on the walden episode  second it appears and the point is capital that thoreau was once fairly and manfully in love and with perhaps too much aping of the angel relinquished the woman to his brother  even though the brother were like to die of it we have not yet heard the last opinion of the woman  but be that as it may we have here the explanation of the rarefied and freezing air in which i complained that he had taught himself to breathe  reading the man through the books i took his professions in good faith  he made a dupe of me even as he was seeking to make a dupe of himself wresting philosophy to the needs of his own sorrow  but in the light of this new fact those pages seemingly so cold are seen to be alive with feeling  what appeared to be a lack of interest in the philosopher turns out to have been a touching insincerity of the man to his own heart and that finespun airy theory of friendship so devoid as i complained of any quality of flesh and blood a mere anodyne to lull his pains the most temperate of living critics once marked a passage of my own with a cross ar d the words this seems nonsense it not only seemed it was so  it was a private bravado of my own which i had so often repeated to keep up my spirits that i had grown at last wholly to believe it and had ended by setting it down as a contribution to the theory of life so with the more icy parts of this philosophy of thoreaus he was affecting the spartanism he had not and the old sentimental wound still bled afresh while he deceived himself with reasons  thoreaus theory in short was one thing and himself another of the first the reader will find what i believe to be a pretty faithful statement and a fairly just criticism in the study of the second he will find but a contorted shadow so much of the man as fitted nicely with his doctrines in the photographers phrase came out  but that large part which lay outside and beyond for which he had found or sought no formula on which perhaps his philosophy even looked askance is wanting in my study as it was wanting in the guide i followed  in some ways a less serious writer in all ways a nobler man the true thoreau still remains to be depicted  villon  i am tempted to regret that i ever wrote on this subject not merely because the paper strikes me as too picturesque by half but because i regarded villon as a bad fellow  others still think well of him and can find beautiful and human traits where i saw nothing but artistic evil and by the principle of the art those should have written of the man and not i  where you see no good silence is the best  though this penitence comes too late it may be well at least to give it expression  the spirit of villon is still living in the literature of france  fat peg is oddly of a piece with the work of zola the goncourts and the infinitely greater flaubert and while similar in ugliness still surpasses them in native power  the old author breaking with an eclat de voix out of his tonguetied century has not yet been touched on his own ground and still gives us the most vivid and shocking impression of reality  even if that were not worth doing at all it would be worth doing as well as he has done it for the pleasure we take in the authors skill repays us or at least reconciles us to the baseness of his attitude  fat peg la grosse margot is typical of much it is a piece of experience that has nowhere else been rendered into literature and a kind of gratitude for the authors plainness mingles as we read with the nausea proper to the business  i shall quote here a verse of an old students song worth laying side by side with villons startling ballade  this singer also had an unworthy mistress but he did not choose to share the wages of dishonour and it is thus with both wit and pathos that he laments her fall  nunc plango florem aetatis tenerae nitidiorem veneris sidere tunc columbinam mentis dulcedinem nunc serpentinam amaritudinem verbo rogantes removes ostio munera dantes foves cubiculo illos abire praecipis a quibus nihil accipis caecos claudosque recipis viros illustres decipis cum melle venenosa 1  1 gaudeamus carmina vagorum selecta  leipsic  trubner 1879  but our illustrious writer of ballades it was unnecessary to deceive it was the flight of beauty alone not that of honesty or honour that he lamented in his song and the nameless mediaeval vagabond has the best of the comparison  there is now a villon society in england and mr john payne has translated him entirely into english a task of unusual difficulty  i regret to find that mr payne and i are not always at one as to the authors meaning in such cases i am bound to suppose that he is in the right although the weakness of the flesh withholds me from anything beyond a formal submission  he is now upon a larger venture promising us at last that complete arabian nights to which we have all so long looked forward  charles of orleans  perhaps i have done scanty justice to the charm of the old dukes verses and certainly he is too much treated as a fool  the period is not sufficiently remembered  what that period was to what a blank of imbecility the human mind had fallen can only be known to those who have waded in the chronicles  excepting comines and la salle and villon i have read no author who did not appal me by his torpor and even the trial of joan of arc conducted as it was by chosen clerks bears witness to a dreary sterile folly  a twilight of the mind peopled with childish phantoms  in relation to his contemporaries charles seems quite a lively character  it remains for me to acknowledge the kindness of mr henry pyne who immediately on the appearance of the study sent me his edition of the debate between the heralds a courtesy from the expert to the amateur only too uncommon in these days  knox  knox the second in order of interest among the reformers lies dead and buried in the works of the learned and unreadable mcrie  it remains for some one to break the tomb and bring him forth alive again and breathing in a human book  with the best intentions in the world i have only added two more flagstones ponderous like their predecessors to the mass of obstruction that buries the reformer from the world i have touched him in my turn with that mace of death which carlyle has attributed to dryasdust and my two dull papers are in the matter of dulness worthy additions to the labours of mcrie  yet i believe they are worth reprinting in the interest of the next biographer of knox  i trust his book may be a masterpiece and i indulge the hope that my two studies may lend him a hint or perhaps spare him a delay in its composition  of the pepys i can say nothing for it has been too recently through my hands and i still retain some of the heat of composition  yet it may serve as a text for the last remark i have to offer  to pepys i think i have been amply just to the others to burns thoreau whitman charles of orleans even villon i have found myself in the retrospect ever too grudging of praise ever too disrespectful in manner  it is not easy to see why i should have been most liberal to the man of least pretensions  perhaps some cowardice withheld me from the proper warmth of tone perhaps it is easier to be just to those nearer us in rank of mind  such at least is the fact which other critics may explain  for these were all men whom for one reason or another i loved or when i did not love the men my love was the greater to their books i had read them and lived with them for months they were continually in my thoughts i seemed to rejoice in their joys and to sorrow with them in their griefs and behold when i came to write of them my tone was sometimes hardly courteous and seldom wholly just  r l s    contents   i    victor hugos romances ii   some aspects of robert burns iii  walt

drame et epopee pittoresque mais poetique reel mais ideal vrai mais grand qui enchassera walter scott dans homere  victor hugo on quentin durward   victor hugos romances occupy an important position in the history of literature many innovations timidly made elsewhere have in them been carried boldly out to their last consequences much that was indefinite in literary tendencies has attained to definite maturity many things have come to a point and been distinguished one from the other and it is only in the last romance of all quatre vingt treize that this culmination is most perfect  this is in the nature of things  men who are in any way typical of a stage of progress may be compared more justly to the hand upon the dial of the clock which continues to advance as it indicates than to the stationary milestone which is only the measure of what is past  the movement is not arrested that significant something by which the work of such a man differs from that of his predecessors goes on disengaging itself and becoming more and more articulate and cognisable the same principle of growth that carried his first book beyond the books of previous writers carries his last book beyond his first  and just as the most imbecile production of any literary age gives us sometimes the very clue to comprehension we have sought long and vainly in contemporary masterpieces so it may be the very weakest of an authors books that coming in the sequel of many others enables us at last to get hold of what underlies the whole of them  of that spinal marrow of significance that unites the work of his life into something organic and rational  this is what has been done by quatre vingt treize for the earlier romances of victor hugo and through them for a whole division of modern literature  we have here the legitimate continuation of a long and living literary tradition and hence so far its explanation  when many lines diverge from each other in direction so slightly as to confuse the eye we know that we have only to produce them to make the chaos plain this is continually so in literary history and we shall best understand the importance of victor hugos romances if we think of them as some such prolongation of one of the main lines of literary tendency  when we compare the novels of walter scott with those of the man of genius who preceded him and whom he delighted to honour as a master in the art  i mean henry fielding  we shall be somewhat puzzled at the first moment to state the difference that there is between these two  fielding has as much human science has a far firmer hold upon the tiller of his story has a keen sense of character which he draws and scott often does so too in a rather abstract and academical manner and finally is quite as humorous and quite as good humoured as the great scotchman  with all these points of resemblance between the men it is astonishing that their work should be so different  the fact is that the english novel was looking one way and seeking one set of effects in the hands of fielding and in the hands of scott it was looking eagerly in all ways and searching for all the effects that by any possibility it could utilise  the difference between these two men marks a great enfranchisement  with scott the romantic movement the movement of an extended curiosity and an enfranchised imagination has begun  this is a trite thing to say but trite things are often very indefinitely comprehended and this enfranchisement in as far as it regards the technical change that came over modern prose romance has never perhaps been explained with any clearness  to do so it will be necessary roughly to compare the two sets of conventions upon which plays and romances are respectively based  the purposes of these two arts are so much alike and they deal so much with the same passions and interests that we are apt to forget the fundamental opposition of their methods  and yet such a fundamental opposition exists  in the drama the action is developed in great measure by means of things that remain outside of the art by means of real things that is and not artistic conventions for things  this is a sort of realism that is not to be confounded with that realism in painting of which we hear so much  the realism in painting is a thing of purposes this that we have to indicate in the drama is an affair of method  we have heard a story indeed of a painter in france who when he wanted to paint a seabeach carried realism from his ends to his means and plastered real sand upon his canvas and that is precisely what is done in the drama  the dramatic author has to paint his beaches with real sand real live men and women move about the stage we hear real voices what is feigned merely puts a sense upon what is we do actually see a woman go behind a screen as lady teazle and after a certain interval we do actually see her very shamefully produced again  now all these things that remain as they were in life and are not transmuted into any artistic convention are terribly stubborn and difficult to deal with and hence there are for the dramatist many resultant limitations in time and space these limitations in some sort approximate towards those of painting the dramatic author is tied down not indeed to a moment but to the duration of each scene or act he is confined to the stage almost as the painter is confined within his frame  but the great restriction is this that a dramatic author must deal with his actors and with his actors alone  certain moments of suspense certain significant dispositions of personages a certain logical growth of emotion these are the only means at the disposal of the playwright  it is true that with the assistance of the scenepainter the costumier and the conductor of the orchestra he may add to this something of pageant something of sound and fury but these are for the dramatic writer beside the mark and do not come under the vivifying touch of his genius  when we turn to romance we find this no longer here nothing is reproduced to our senses directly  not only the main conception of the work but the scenery the appliances the mechanism by which this conception is brought home to us have been put through the crucible of another mans mind and come out again one and all in the form of written words  with the loss of every degree of such realism as we have described there is for art a clear gain of liberty and largeness of competence  thus painting in which the round outlines of things are thrown on to a flat board is far more free than sculpture in which their solidity is preserved  it is by giving up these identities that art gains true strength  and so in the case of novels as compared with the stage  continuous narration is the flat board on to which the novelist throws everything  and from this there results for him a great loss of vividness but a great compensating gain in his power over the subject so that he can now subordinate one thing to another in importance and introduce all manner of very subtle detail to a degree that was before impossible  he can render just as easily the flourish of trumpets before a victorious emperor and the gossip of country market women the gradual decay of forty years of a mans life and the gesture of a passionate moment  he finds himself equally unable if he looks at it from one point of view  equally able if he looks at it from another point of view  to reproduce a colour a sound an outline a logical argument a physical action  he can show his readers behind and around the personages that for the moment occupy the foreground of his story the continual suggestion of the landscape the turn of the weather that will turn with it mens lives and fortunes dimly foreshadowed on the horizon the fatality of distant events the stream of national tendency the salient framework of causation  and all this thrown upon the flat board  all this entering naturally and smoothly into the texture of continuous intelligent narration  this touches the difference between fielding and scott  in the work of the latter true to his character of a modern and a romantic we become suddenly conscious of the background fielding on the other hand although he had recognised that the novel was nothing else than an epic in prose wrote in the spirit not of the epic but of the drama  this is not of course to say that the drama was in any way incapable of a regeneration similar in kind to that of which i am now speaking with regard to the novel  the notorious contrary fact is sufficient to guard the reader against such a misconstruction  all that is meant is that fielding remained ignorant of certain capabilities which the novel possesses over the drama or at least neglected and did not develop them  to the end he continued to see things as a playwright sees them  the world with which he dealt the world he had realised for himself and sought to realise and set before his readers was a world of exclusively human interest  as for landscape he was content to underline stage directions as it might be done in a playbook tom and molly retire into a practicable wood  as for nationality and public sentiment it is curious enough to think that tom jones is laid in the year fortyfive and that the only use he makes of the rebellion is to throw a troop of soldiers into his heros way  it is most really important however to remark the change which has been introduced into the conception of character by the beginning of the romantic movement and the consequent introduction into fiction of a vast amount of new material  fielding tells us as much as he thought necessary to account for the actions of his creatures he thought that each of these actions could be decomposed on the spot into a few simple personal elements as we decompose a force in a question of abstract dynamics the larger motives are all unknown to him he had not understood that the nature of the landscape or the spirit of the times could be for anything in a story and so naturally and rightly he said nothing about them  but scotts instinct the instinct of the man of an age profoundly different taught him otherwise and in his work the individual characters begin to occupy a comparatively small proportion of that canvas on which armies manoeuvre and great hills pile themselves upon each others shoulders fieldings characters were always great to the full stature of a perfectly arbitrary will  already in scott we begin to have a sense of the subtle influences that moderate and qualify a mans personality that personality is no longer thrown out in unnatural isolation but is resumed into its place in the constitution of things  it is this change in the manner of regarding men and their actions first exhibited in romance that has since renewed and vivified history  for art precedes philosophy and even science  people must have noticed things and interested themselves in them before they begin to debate upon their causes or influence  and it is in this way that art is the pioneer of knowledge those predilections of the artist he knows not why those irrational acceptations and recognitions reclaim out of the world that we have not yet realised ever another and another corner and after the facts have been thus vividly brought before us and have had time to settle and arrange themselves in our minds some day there will be found the man of science to stand up and give the explanation  scott took an interest in many things in which fielding took none and for this reason and no other he introduced them into his romances  if he had been told what would be the nature of the movement that he was so lightly initiating he would have been very incredulous and not a little scandalised  at the time when he wrote the real drift of this new manner of pleasing people in fiction was not yet apparent and even now it is only by looking at the romances of victor hugo that we are enabled to form any proper judgment in the matter  these books are not only descended by ordinary generation from the waverley novels but it is in them chiefly that we shall find the revolutionary tradition of scott carried farther that we shall find scott himself in so far as regards his conception of prose fiction and its purposes surpassed in his own spirit instead of tamely followed  we have here as i said before a line of literary tendency produced and by this production definitely separated from others  when we come to hugo we see that the deviation which seemed slight enough and not very serious between scott and fielding is indeed such a great gulph in thought and sentiment as only successive generations can pass over and it is but natural that one of the chief advances that hugo has made upon scott is an advance in selfconsciousness  both men follow the same road but where the one went blindly and carelessly the other advances with all deliberation and forethought  there never was artist much more unconscious than scott and there have been not many more conscious than hugo  the passage at the head of these pages shows how organically he had understood the nature of his own changes  he has underlying each of the five great romances which alone i purpose here to examine two deliberate designs one artistic the other consciously ethical and intellectual  this is a man living in a different world from scott who professes sturdily in one of his introductions that he does not believe in novels having any moral influence at all but still hugo is too much of an artist to let himself be hampered by his dogmas and the truth is that the artistic result seems in at least one great instance to have very little connection with the other or directly ethical result  the artistic result of a romance what is left upon the memory by any really powerful and artistic novel is something so complicated and refined that it is difficult to put a name upon it and yet something as simple as nature these two propositions may seem mutually destructive but they are so only in appearance  the fact is that art is working far ahead of language as well as of science realising for us by all manner of suggestions and exaggerations effects for which as yet we have no direct name nay for which we may never perhaps have a direct name for the reason that these effects do not enter very largely into the necessities of life  hence alone is that suspicion of vagueness that often hangs about the purpose of a romance it is clear enough to us in thought but we are not used to consider anything clear until we are able to formulate it in words and analytical language has not been sufficiently shaped to that end  we all know this difficulty in the case of a picture simple and strong as may be the impression that it has left with us and it is only because language is the medium of romance that we are prevented from seeing that the two cases are the same  it is not that there is anything blurred or indefinite in the impression left with us it is just because the impression is so very definite after its own kind that we find it hard to fit it exactly with the expressions of our philosophical speech  it is this idea which underlies and issues from a romance this something which it is the function of that form of art to create this epical value that i propose chiefly to seek and as far as may be to throw into relief in the present study  it is thus i believe that we shall see most clearly the great stride that hugo has taken beyond his predecessors and how no longer content with expressing more or less abstract relations of man to man he has set before himself the task of realising in the language of romance much of the involution of our complicated lives  this epical value is not to be found let it be understood in every socalled novel  the great majority are not works of art in anything but a very secondary signification  one might almost number on ones fingers the works in which such a supreme artistic intention has been in any way superior to the other and lesser aims themselves more or less artistic that generally go hand in hand with it in the conception of prose romance  the purely critical spirit is in most novels paramount  at the present moment we can recall one man only for whose works it would have been equally possible to accomplish our present design and that man is hawthorne there is a unity an unwavering creative purpose about some at least of hawthornes romances that impresses itself on the most indifferent reader and the very restrictions and weaknesses of the man served perhaps to strengthen the vivid and single impression of his works  there is nothing of this kind in hugo unity if he attains to it is indeed unity out of multitude and it is the wonderful power of subordination and synthesis thus displayed that gives us the measure of his talent  no amount of mere discussion and statement such as this could give a just conception of the greatness of this power  it must be felt in the books themselves and all that can be done in the present essay is to recall to the reader the more general features of each of the five great romances hurriedly and imperfectly as space will permit and rather as a suggestion than anything more complete  the moral end that the author had before him in the conception of notre dame de paris was he tells us to denounce the external fatality that hangs over men in the form of foolish and inflexible superstition  to speak plainly this moral purpose seems to have mighty little to do with the artistic conception moreover it is very questionably handled while the artistic conception is developed with the most consummate success  old paris lives for us with newness of life we have ever before our eyes the city cut into three by the two arms of the river the boat shaped island moored by five bridges to the different shores and the two unequal towns on either hand  we forget all that enumeration of palaces and churches and convents which occupies so many pages of admirable description and the thoughtless reader might be inclined to conclude from this that they were pages thrown away but this is not so we forget indeed the details as we forget or do not see the different layers of paint on a completed picture but the thing desired has been accomplished and we carry away with us a sense of the gothic profile of the city of the surprising forest of pinnacles and towers and belfries and we know not what of rich and intricate and quaint  and throughout notre dame has been held up over paris by a height far greater than that of its twin towers the cathedral is present to us from the first page to the last the title has given us the clue and already in the palace of justice the story begins to attach itself to that central building by character after character  it is purely an effect of mirage notre dame does not in reality thus dominate and stand out above the city and any one who should visit it in the spirit of the scotttourists to edinburgh or the trossachs would be almost offended at finding nothing more than this old church thrust away into a corner  it is purely an effect of mirage as we say but it is an effect that permeates and possesses the whole book with astonishing consistency and strength  and then hugo has peopled this gothic city and above all this gothic church with a race of men even more distinctly gothic than their surroundings we know this generation already we have seen them clustered about the worn capitals of pillars or craning forth over the churchleads with the open mouths of gargoyles  about them all there is that sort of stiff quaint unreality that conjunction of the grotesque and even of a certain bourgeois snugness with passionate contortion and horror that is so characteristic of gothic art  esmeralda is somewhat an exception she and the goat traverse the story like two children who have wandered in a dream  the finest moment of the book is when these two share with the two other leading characters dom claude and quasimodo the chill shelter of the old cathedral  it is here that we touch most intimately the generative artistic idea of the romance are they not all four taken out of some quaint moulding illustrative of the beatitudes or the ten commandments or the seven deadly sins  what is quasimodo but an animated gargoyle  what is the whole book but the reanimation of gothic art  it is curious that in this the earliest of the five great romances there should be so little of that extravagance that latterly we have come almost to identify with the authors manner  yet even here we are distressed by words thoughts and incidents that defy belief and alienate the sympathies the scene of the in pace for example in spite of its strength verges dangerously on the province of the penny novelist  i do not believe that quasimodo rode upon the bell i should as soon imagine that he swung by the clapper and again the following two sentences out of an otherwise admirable chapter surely surpass what it has ever entered into the heart of any other man to imagine vol ii p 180 il souffrait tant que par instants il sarrachait des poignees de cheveux pour voir sils ne blanchissaient pas and p 181 ses pensees etaient si insupportables quil prenait sa tete a deux mains et tachait de larracher de ses epaules pour la briser sur le pave  one other fault before we pass on  in spite of the horror and misery that pervade all of his later work there is in it much less of actual melodrama than here and rarely i should say never that sort of brutality that useless insufferable violence to the feelings which is the last distinction between melodrama and true tragedy  now in notre dame the whole story of esmeraldas passion for the worthless archer is unpleasant enough but when she betrays herself in her last hidingplace herself and her wretched mother by calling out to this sordid hero who has long since forgotten her  well that is just one of those things that readers will not forgive they do not like it and they are quite right life is hard enough for poor mortals without having it indefinitely embittered for them by bad art  we look in vain for any similar blemish in les miserables here on the other hand there is perhaps the nearest approach to literary restraint that hugo has ever made there is here certainly the ripest and most easy development of his powers  it is the moral intention of this great novel to awaken us a little if it may be  for such awakenings are unpleasant  to the great cost of this society that we enjoy and profit by to the labour and sweat of those who support the litter civilisation in which we ourselves are so smoothly carried forward  people are all glad to shut their eyes and it gives them a very simple pleasure when they can forget that our laws commit a million individual injustices to be once roughly just in the general that the bread that we eat and the quiet of the family and all that embellishes life and makes it worth having have to be purchased by death  by the deaths of animals and the deaths of men wearied out with labour and the deaths of those criminals called tyrants and revolutionaries and the deaths of those revolutionaries called criminals  it is to something of all this that victor hugo wishes to open mens eyes in les miserables and this moral lesson is worked out in masterly coincidence with the artistic effect  the deadly weight of civilisation to those who are below presses sensibly on our shoulders as we read a sort of mocking indignation grows upon us as we find society rejecting again and again the services of the most serviceable setting jean valjean to pick oakum casting galileo into prison even crucifying christ  there is a haunting and horrible sense of insecurity about the book the terror we thus feel is a terror for the machinery of law that we can hear tearing in the dark good and bad between its formidable wheels with the iron stolidity of all machinery human or divine  this terror incarnates itself sometimes and leaps horribly out upon us as when the crouching mendicant looks up and jean valjean in the light of the street lamp recognises the face of the detective as when the lantern of the patrol flashes suddenly through the darkness of the sewer or as when the fugitive comes forth at last at evening by the quiet riverside and finds the police there also waiting stolidly for vice and stolidly satisfied to take virtue instead  the whole book is full of oppression and full of prejudice which is the great cause of oppression  we have the prejudices of m gillenormand the prejudices of marius the prejudices in revolt that defend the barricade and the throned prejudices that carry it by storm  and then we have the admirable but illwritten character of javert the man who had made a religion of the police and would not survive the moment when he learned that there was another truth outside the truth of laws a just creation over which the reader will do well to ponder  with so gloomy a design this great work is still full of life and light and love  the portrait of the good bishop is one of the most agreeable things in modern literature  the whole scene at montfermeil is full of the charm that hugo knows so well how to throw about children  who can forget the passage where cosette sent out at night to draw water stands in admiration before the illuminated booth and the huckster behind lui faisait un peu leffet detre le pere eternel the pathos of the forlorn sabot laid trustingly by the chimney in expectation of the santa claus that was not takes us fairly by the throat there is nothing in shakespeare that touches the heart more nearly  the loves of cosette and marius are very pure and pleasant and we cannot refuse our affection to gavroche although we may make a mental reservation of our profound disbelief in his existence  take it for all in all there are few books in the world that can be compared with it  there is as much calm and serenity as hugo has ever attained to the melodramatic coarsenesses that disfigured notre dame are no longer present  there is certainly much that is painfully improbable and again the story itself is a little too well constructed it produces on us the effect of a puzzle and we grow incredulous as we find that every character fits again and again into the plot and is like the childs cube serviceable on six faces things are not so well arranged in life as all that comes to  some of the digressions also seem out of place and do nothing but interrupt and irritate  but when all is said the book remains of masterly conception and of masterly development full of pathos full of truth full of a high eloquence  superstition and social exigency having been thus dealt with in the first two members of the series it remained for les travailleurs de la mer to show man hand to hand with the elements the last form of external force that is brought against him  and here once more the artistic effect and the moral lesson are worked out together and are indeed one gilliat alone upon the reef at his herculean task offers a type of human industry in the midst of the vague diffusion of forces into the illimitable and the visionary development of wasted labour in the sea and the winds and the clouds  no character was ever thrown into such strange relief as gilliat  the great circle of seabirds that come wanderingly around him on the night of his arrival strikes at once the note of his preeminence and isolation  he fills the whole reef with his indefatigable toil this solitary spot in the ocean rings with the clamour of his anvil we see him as he comes and goes thrown out sharply against the clear background of the sea  and yet his isolation is not to be compared with the isolation of robinson crusoe for example indeed no two books could be more instructive to set side by side than les travailleurs and this other of the old days before art had learnt to occupy itself with what lies outside of human will  crusoe was one sole centre of interest in the midst of a nature utterly dead and utterly unrealised by the artist but this is not how we feel with gilliat we feel that he is opposed by a dark coalition of forces that an immense animosity surrounds him we are the witnesses of the terrible warfare that he wages with the silent inclemency of phenomena going their own way and the great general law implacable and passive a conspiracy of the indifferency of things is against him  there is not one interest on the reef but two  just as we recognise gilliat for the hero we recognise as implied by this indifferency of things this direction of forces to some purpose outside our purposes yet another character who may almost take rank as the villain of the novel and the two face up to one another blow for blow feint for feint until in the storm they fight it epically out and gilliat remains the victor  a victor however who has still to encounter the octopus  i need say nothing of the gruesome repulsive excellence of that famous scene it will be enough to remind the reader that gilliat is in pursuit of a crab when he is himself assaulted by the devil fish and that this in its way is the last touch to the inner significance of the book here indeed is the true position of man in the universe  but in les travailleurs with all its strength with all its eloquence with all the beauty and fitness of its main situations we cannot conceal from ourselves that there is a thread of something that will not bear calm scrutiny  there is much that is disquieting about the storm admirably as it begins  i am very doubtful whether it would be possible to keep the boat from foundering in such circumstances by any amount of breakwater and broken rock  i do not understand the way in which the waves are spoken of and prefer just to take it as a loose way of speaking and pass on  and lastly how does it happen that the sea was quite calm next day  is this great hurricane a piece of scenepainting after all and when we have forgiven gilliats prodigies of strength although in soberness he reminds us more of porthos in the vicomte de bragelonne than is quite desirable what is to be said to his suicide and how are we to condemn in adequate terms that unprincipled avidity after effect which tells us that the sloop disappeared over the horizon and the head under the water at one and the same moment  monsieur hugo may say what he will but we know better we know very well that they did not a thing like that raises up a despairing spirit of opposition in a mans readers they give him the lie fiercely as they read  lastly we have here already some beginning of that curious series of english blunders that makes us wonder if there are neither proofsheets nor judicious friends in the whole of france and affects us sometimes with a sickening uneasiness as to what may be our own exploits when we touch upon foreign countries and foreign tongues  it is here that we shall find the famous first of the fourth and many english words that may be comprehensible perhaps in paris  it is here that we learn that laird in scotland is the same title as lord in england  here also is an account of a highland soldiers equipment which we recommend to the lovers of genuine fun  in lhomme qui rit it was hugos object to denounce as he would say himself the aristocratic principle as it was exhibited in england and this purpose somewhat more unmitigatedly satiric than that of the two last must answer for much that is unpleasant in the book  the repulsiveness of the scheme of the story and the manner in which it is bound up with impossibilities and absurdities discourage the reader at the outset and it needs an effort to take it as seriously as it deserves  and yet when we judge it deliberately it will be seen that here again the story is admirably adapted to the moral  the constructive ingenuity exhibited throughout is almost morbid  nothing could be more happily imagined as a reductio ad absurdum of the aristocratic principle than the adventures of gwynplaine the itinerant mountebank snatched suddenly out of his little way of life and installed without preparation as one of the hereditary legislators of a great country  it is with a very bitter irony that the paper on which all this depends is left to float for years at the will of wind and tide  what again can be finer in conception than that voice from the people heard suddenly in the house of lords in solemn arraignment of the pleasures and privileges of its splendid occupants  the horrible laughter stamped for ever by order of the king upon the face of this strange spokesman of democracy adds yet another feature of justice to the scene in all time travesty has been the argument of oppression and in all time the oppressed might have made this answer if i am vile is it not your system that has made me so this ghastly laughter gives occasion moreover for the one strain of tenderness running through the web of this unpleasant story the love of the blind girl dea for the monster  it is a most benignant providence that thus harmoniously brings together these two misfortunes it is one of those compensations one of those afterthoughts of a relenting destiny that reconcile us from time to time to the evil that is in the world the atmosphere of the book is purified by the presence of this pathetic love it seems to be above the story somehow and not of it as the full moon over the night of some foul and feverish city  there is here a quality in the narration more intimate and particular than is general with hugo but it must be owned on the other hand that the book is wordy and even now and then a little wearisome  ursus and his wolf are pleasant enough companions but the former is nearly as much an abstract type as the latter  there is a beginning also of an abuse of conventional conversation such as may be quite pardonable in the drama where needs must but is without excuse in the romance  lastly i suppose one must say a word or two about the weak points of this not immaculate novel and if so it will be best to distinguish at once  the large family of english blunders to which we have alluded already in speaking of les travailleurs are of a sort that is really indifferent in art  if shakespeare makes his ships cast anchor by some seaport of bohemia if hugo imagines tomtim jack to be a likely nickname for an english sailor or if either shakespeare or hugo or scott for that matter be guilty of figments enough to confuse the march of a whole history  anachronisms enough to overset all chronology 1 the life of their creations the artistic truth and accuracy of their work is not so much as compromised  but when we come upon a passage like the sinking of the ourque in this romance we can do nothing but cover our face with our hands the conscientious reader feels a sort of disgrace in the very reading  for such artistic falsehoods springing from what i have called already an unprincipled avidity after effect no amount of blame can be exaggerated and above all when the criminal is such a man as victor hugo  we cannot forgive in him what we might have passed over in a thirdrate sensation novelist  little as he seems to know of the sea and nautical affairs he must have known very well that vessels do not go down as he makes the ourque go down he must have known that such a liberty with fact was against the laws of the game and incompatible with all appearance of sincerity in conception or workmanship  1 prefatory letter to peveril of the peak  in each of these books one after another there has been some departure from the traditional canons of romance but taking each separately one would have feared to make too much of these departures or to found any theory upon what was perhaps purely accidental  the appearance of quatre vingt treize has put us out of the region of such doubt like a doctor who has long been hesitating how to classify an epidemic malady we have come at last upon a case so well marked that our uncertainty is at an end  it is a novel built upon a sort of enigma which was at that date laid before revolutionary france and which is presented by hugo to tellmarch to lantenac to gauvain and very terribly to cimourdain each of whom gives his own solution of the question clement or stern according to the temper of his spirit  that enigma was this can a good action be a bad action  does not he who spares the wolf kill the sheep this question as i say meets with one answer after another during the course of the book and yet seems to remain undecided to the end  and something in the same way although one character or one set of characters after another comes to the front and occupies our attention for the moment we never identify our interest with any of these temporary heroes nor regret them after they are withdrawn we soon come to regard them somewhat as special cases of a general law what we really care for is something that they only imply and body forth to us  we know how history continues through century after century how this king or that patriot disappears from its pages with his whole generation and yet we do not cease to read nor do we even feel as if we had reached any legitimate conclusion because our interest is not in the men but in the country that they loved or hated benefited or injured  and so it is here gauvain and cimourdain pass away and we regard them no more than the lost armies of which we find the cold statistics in military annals what we regard is what remains behind it is the principle that put these men where they were that filled them for a while with heroic inspiration and has the power now that they are fallen to inspire others with the same courage  the interest of the novel centres about revolutionary france just as the plot is an abstract judicial difficulty the hero is an abstract historical force  and this has been done not as it would have been before by the cold and cumbersome machinery of allegory but with bold straightforward realism dealing only with the objective materials of art and dealing with them so masterfully that the palest abstractions of thought come before us and move our hopes and fears as if they were the young men and maidens of customary romance  the episode of the mother and children in quatre vingt treize is equal to anything that hugo has ever written  there is one chapter in the second volume for instance called sein gueri coeur saignant that is full of the very stuff of true tragedy and nothing could be more delightful than the humours of the three children on the day before the assault the passage on la vendee is really great and the scenes in paris have much of the same broad merit  the book is full as usual of pregnant and splendid sayings  but when thus much is conceded by way of praise we come to the other scale of the balance and find this also somewhat heavy  there is here a yet greater overemployment of conventional dialogue than in lhomme qui rit and much that should have been said by the author himself if it were to be said at all he has most unwarrantably put into the mouths of one or other of his characters  we should like to know what becomes of the main body of the troop in the wood of la saudraie during the thirty pages or so in which the foreguard lays aside all discipline and stops to gossip over a woman and some children  we have an unpleasant idea forced upon us at one place in spite of all the goodnatured incredulity that we can summon up to resist it  is it possible that monsieur hugo thinks they ceased to steer the corvette while the gun was loose  of the chapter in which lantenac and halmalho are alone together in the boat the less said the better of course if there were nothing else they would have been swamped thirty times over during the course of lantenacs harangue  again after lantenac has landed we have scenes of almost inimitable workmanship that suggest the epithet statuesque by their clear and trenchant outline but the tocsin scene will not do and the tocsin unfortunately pervades the whole passage ringing continually in our ears with a taunting accusation of falsehood  and then when we come to the place where lantenac meets the royalists under the idea that he is going to meet the republicans it seems as if there were a hitch in the stage mechanism  i have tried it over in every way and i cannot conceive any disposition that would make the scene possible as narrated  such then with their faults and their signal excellences are the five great novels  romance is a language in which many persons learn to speak with a certain appearance of fluency but there are few who can ever bend it to any practical need few who can ever be said to express themselves in it  it has become abundantly plain in the foregoing examination that victor hugo occupies a high place among those few  he has always a perfect command over his stories and we see that they are constructed with a high regard to some ulterior purpose and that every situation is informed with moral significance and grandeur  of no other man can the same thing be said in the same degree  his romances are not to be confused with the novel with a purpose as familiar to the english reader this is generally the model of incompetence and we see the moral clumsily forced into every hole and corner of the story or thrown externally over it like a carpet over a railing  now the moral significance with hugo is of the essence of the romance it is the organising principle  if you could somehow despoil les miserables or les travailleurs of their distinctive lesson you would find that the story had lost its interest and the book was dead  having thus learned to subordinate his story to an idea to make his art speak he went on to teach it to say things heretofore unaccustomed  if you look back at the five books of which we have now so hastily spoken you will be astonished at the freedom with which the original purposes of storytelling have been laid aside and passed by  where are now the two lovers who descended the main watershed of all the waverley novels and all the novels that have tried to follow in their wake  sometimes they are almost lost sight of before the solemn isolation of a man against the sea and sky as in les travailleurs sometimes as in les miserables they merely figure for awhile as a beautiful episode in the epic of oppression sometimes they are entirely absent as in quatre vingt treize  there is no hero in notre dame in les miserables it is an old man in lhomme qui rit it is a monster in quatre vingt treize it is the revolution  those elements that only began to show themselves timidly as adjuncts in the novels of walter scott have usurped ever more and more of the canvas until we find the whole interest of one of hugos romances centring around matter that fielding would have banished from his altogether as being out of the field of fiction  so we have elemental forces occupying nearly as large a place playing so to speak nearly as important a role as the man gilliat who opposes and overcomes them  so we find the fortunes of a nation put upon the stage with as much vividness as ever before the fortunes of a village maiden or a lost heir and the forces that oppose and corrupt a principle holding the attention quite as strongly as the wicked barons or dishonest attorneys of the past  hence those individual interests that were supreme in fielding and even in scott stood out over everything else and formed as it were the spine of the story figure here only as one set of interests among many sets one force among many forces one thing to be treated out of a whole world of things equally vivid and important  so that for hugo man is no longer an isolated spirit without antecedent or relation here below but a being involved in the action and reaction of natural forces himself a centre of such action and reaction or an unit in a great multitude chased hither and thither by epidemic terrors and aspirations and in all seriousness blown about by every wind of doctrine  this is a long way that we have travelled between such work and the work of fielding is there not indeed a great gulph in thought and sentiment  art thus conceived realises for men a larger portion of life and that portion one that it is more difficult for them to realise unaided and besides helping them to feel more intensely those restricted personal interests which are patent to all it awakes in them some consciousness of those more general relations that are so strangely invisible to the average man in ordinary moods  it helps to keep man in his place in nature and above all it helps him to understand more intelligently the responsibilities of his place in society  and in all this generalisation of interest we never miss those small humanities that are at the opposite pole of excellence in art and while we admire the intellect that could see life thus largely we are touched with another sentiment for the tender heart that slipped the piece of gold into cosettes sabot that was virginally troubled at the fluttering of her dress in the spring wind or put the blind girl beside the deformity of the laughing man  this then is the last praise that we can award to these romances  the author has shown a power of just subordination hitherto unequalled and as in reaching forward to one class of effects he has not been forgetful or careless of the other his work is more nearly complete work and his art with all its imperfections deals more comprehensively with the materials of life than that of any of his otherwise more sure and masterly predecessors  these five books would have made a very great fame for any writer and yet they are but one facade of the monument that victor hugo has erected to his genius  everywhere we find somewhat the same greatness somewhat the same infirmities in his poems and plays there are the same unaccountable protervities that have already astonished us in the romances there too is the same feverish strength welding the fiery iron of his idea under forgehammer repetitions  an emphasis that is somehow akin to weaknesses  strength that is a little epileptic  he stands so far above all his contemporaries and so incomparably excels them in richness breadth variety and moral earnestness that we almost feel as if he had a sort of right to fall oftener and more heavily than others but this does not reconcile us to seeing him profit by the privilege so freely  we like to have in our great men something that is above question we like to place an implicit faith in them and see them always on the platform of their greatness and this unhappily cannot be with hugo  as heine said long ago his is a genius somewhat deformed but deformed as it is we accept it gladly we shall have the wisdom to see where his foot slips but we shall have the justice also to recognise in him one of the greatest artists of our generation and in many ways one of the greatest artists of time  if we look back yet once upon these five romances we see blemishes such as we can lay to the charge of no other man in the number of the famous but to what other man can we attribute such sweeping innovations such a new and significant presentment of the life of man such an amount if we merely think of the amount of equally consummate performance    chapter ii  some aspects of robert burns    to write with authority about another man we must have fellowfeeling and some common ground of experience with our subject  we may praise or blame according as we find him related to us by the best or worst in ourselves but it is only in virtue of some relationship that we can be his judges even to condemn  feelings which we share and understand enter for us into the tissue of the mans character those to which we are strangers in our own experience we are inclined to regard as blots exceptions inconsistencies and excursions of the diabolic we conceive them with repugnance explain them with difficulty and raise our hands to heaven in wonder when we find them in conjunction with talents that we respect or virtues that we admire  david king of israel would pass a sounder judgment on a man than either nathaniel or david hume  now principal shairps recent volume although i believe no one will read it without respect and interest has this one capital defect  that there is imperfect sympathy between the author and the subject between the critic and the personality under criticism  hence an inorganic if not an incoherent presentation of both the poems and the man  of holy willies prayer principal shairp remarks that those who have loved most what was best in burnss poetry must have regretted that it was ever written  to the jolly beggars so far as my memory serves me he refers but once and then only to remark on the strange not to say painful circumstance that the same hand which wrote the cotters saturday night should have stooped to write the jolly beggars  the saturday night may or may not be an admirable poem but its significance is trebled and the power and range of the poet first appears when it is set beside the jolly beggars  to take a mans work piecemeal except with the design of elegant extracts is the way to avoid and not to perform the critics duty the same defect is displayed in the treatment of burns as a man which is broken apologetical and confused  the man here presented to us is not that burns teres atque rotundus  a burly figure in literature as from our present vantage of time we have begun to see him  this on the other hand is burns as he may have appeared to a contemporary clergyman whom we shall conceive to have been a kind and indulgent but orderly and orthodox person anxious to be pleased but too often hurt and disappointed by the behaviour of his redhot protege and solacing himself with the explanation that the poet was the most inconsistent of men  if you are so sensibly pained by the misconduct of your subject and so paternally delighted with his virtues you will always be an excellent gentleman but a somewhat questionable biographer indeed we can only be sorry and surprised that principal shairp should have chosen a theme so uncongenial  when we find a man writing on burns who likes neither holy willie nor the beggars nor the ordination nothing is adequate to the situation but the old cry of geronte que diable allait il faire dans cette galere  and every merit we find in the book which is sober and candid in a degree unusual with biographies of burns only leads us to regret more heartily that good work should be so greatly thrown away  it is far from my intention to tell over again a story that has been so often told but there are certainly some points in the character of burns that will bear to be brought out and some chapters in his life that demand a brief rehearsal the unity of the mans nature for all its richness has fallen somewhat out of sight in the pressure of new information and the apologetical ceremony of biographers mr carlyle made an inimitable bust of the poets head of gold may i not be forgiven if my business should have more to do with the feet which were of clay   youth   any view of burns would be misleading which passed over in silence the influences of his home and his father  that father william burnes after having been for many years a gardener took a farm married and like an emigrant in a new country built himself a house with his own hands poverty of the most distressing sort with sometimes the near prospect of a gaol embittered the remainder of his life chill backward and austere with strangers grave and imperious in his family he was yet a man of very unusual parts and of an affectionate nature  on his way through life he had remarked much upon other men with more result in theory than practice and he had reflected upon many subjects as he delved the garden  his great delight was in solid conversation he would leave his work to talk with the schoolmaster murdoch and robert when he came home late at night not only turned aside rebuke but kept his father two hours beside the fire by the charm of his merry and vigorous talk  nothing is more characteristic of the class in general and william burnes in particular than the pains he took to get proper schooling for his boys and when that was no longer possible the sense and resolution with which he set himself to supply the deficiency by his own influence for many years he was their chief companion he spoke with them seriously on all subjects as if they had been grown men at night when work was over he taught them arithmetic he borrowed books for them on history science and theology and he felt it his duty to supplement this last  the trait is laughably scottish  by a dialogue of his own composition where his own private shade of orthodoxy was exactly represented  he would go to his daughter as she stayed afield herding cattle to teach her the names of grasses and wild flowers or to sit by her side when it thundered distance to strangers deep family tenderness love of knowledge a narrow precise and formal reading of theology  everything we learn of him hangs well together and builds up a popular scotch type  if i mention the name of andrew fairservice it is only as i might couple for an instant dugald dalgetty with old marshal loudon to help out the readers comprehension by a popular but unworthy instance of a class  such was the influence of this good and wise man that his household became a school to itself and neighbours who came into the farm at mealtime would find the whole family father brothers and sisters helping themselves with one hand and holding a book in the other  we are surprised at the prose style of robert that of gilbert need surprise us no less even william writes a remarkable letter for a young man of such slender opportunities  one anecdote marks the taste of the family  murdoch brought titus andronicus and with such dominie elocution as we may suppose began to read it aloud before this rustic audience but when he had reached the passage where tamora insults lavinia with one voice and in an agony of distress they refused to hear it to an end  in such a father and with such a home robert had already the making of an excellent education and what murdoch added although it may not have been much in amount was in character the very essence of a literary training  schools and colleges for one great man whom they complete perhaps unmake a dozen the strong spirit can do well upon more scanty fare  robert steps before us almost from the first in his complete character  a proud headstrong impetuous lad greedy of pleasure greedy of notice in his own phrase panting after distinction and in his brothers cherishing a particular jealousy of people who were richer or of more consequence than himself with all this he was emphatically of the artist nature  already he made a conspicuous figure in tarbolton church with the only tied hair in the parish and his plaid which was of a particular colour wrapped in a particular manner round his shoulders  ten years later when a married man the father of a family a farmer and an officer of excise we shall find him out fishing in masquerade with foxskin cap belted greatcoat and great highland broadsword  he liked dressing up in fact for its own sake  this is the spirit which leads to the extravagant array of latin quarter students and the proverbial velveteen of the english landscapepainter and though the pleasure derived is in itself merely personal it shows a man who is to say the least of it not pained by general attention and remark  his father wrote the family name burnes robert early adopted the orthography burness from his cousin in the mearns and in his twentyeighth year changed it once more to burns  it is plain that the last transformation was not made without some qualm for in addressing his cousin he adheres in at least one more letter to spelling number two  and this again shows a man preoccupied about the manner of his appearance even down to the name and little willing to follow custom  again he was proud and justly proud of his powers in conversation  to no other mans have we the same conclusive testimony from different sources and from every rank of life  it is almost a commonplace that the best of his works was what he said in talk  robertson the historian scarcely ever met any man whose conversation displayed greater vigour the duchess of gordon declared that he carried her off her feet and when he came late to an inn the servants would get out of bed to hear him talk  but in these early days at least he was determined to shine by any means  he made himself feared in the village for his tongue he would crush weaker men to their faces or even perhaps  for the statement of sillar is not absolute  say cutting things of his acquaintances behind their back  at the church door between sermons he would parade his religious views amid hisses  these details stamp the man  he had no genteel timidities in the conduct of his life  he loved to force his personality upon the world  he would please himself and shine  had he lived in the paris of 1830 and joined his lot with the romantics we can conceive him writing jehan for jean swaggering in gautiers red waistcoat and horrifying bourgeois in a public cafe with paradox and gasconnade  a leading trait throughout his whole career was his desire to be in love  ne fait pas ce tour qui veut  his affections were often enough touched but perhaps never engaged  he was all his life on a voyage of discovery but it does not appear conclusively that he ever touched the happy isle  a man brings to love a deal of readymade sentiment and even from childhood obscurely prognosticates the symptoms of this vital malady  burns was formed for love he had passion tenderness and a singular bent in the direction he could foresee with the intuition of an artist what love ought to be and he could not conceive a worthy life without it  but he had illfortune and was besides so greedy after every shadow of the true divinity and so much the slave of a strong temperament that perhaps his nerve was relaxed and his heart had lost the power of selfdevotion before an opportunity occurred  the circumstances of his youth doubtless counted for something in the result  for the lads of ayrshire as soon as the days work was over and the beasts were stabled would take the road it might be in a winter tempest and travel perhaps miles by moss and moorland to spend an hour or two in courtship  rule 10 of the bachelors club at tarbolton provides that every man proper for a member of this society must be a professed lover of one or more of the female sex  the rich as burns himself points out may have a choice of pleasurable occupations but these lads had nothing but their cannie hour at een  it was upon love and flirtation that this rustic society was built gallantry was the essence of life among the ayrshire hills as well as in the court of versailles and the days were distinguished from each other by loveletters meetings tiffs reconciliations and expansions to the chosen confidant as in a comedy of marivaux  here was a field for a man of burnss indiscriminate personal ambition where he might pursue his voyage of discovery in quest of true love and enjoy temporary triumphs by the way  he was constantly the victim of some fair enslaver   at least when it was not the other way about and there were often underplots and secondary fair enslavers in the background  many  or may we not say most  of these affairs were entirely artificial one he tells us he began out of a vanity of showing his parts in courtship for he piqued himself on his ability at a loveletter  but however they began these flames of his were fanned into a passion ere the end and he stands unsurpassed in his power of selfdeception and positively without a competitor in the art to use his own words of battering himself into a warm affection  a debilitating and futile exercise  once he had worked himself into the vein the agitations of his mind and body were an astonishment to all who knew him  such a course as this however pleasant to a thirsty vanity was lowering to his nature  he sank more and more towards the professional don juan  with a leer of what the french call fatuity he bids the belles of mauchline beware of his seductions and the same cheap selfsatisfaction finds a yet uglier vent when he plumes himself on the scandal at the birth of his first bastard  we can well believe what we hear of his facility in striking up an acquaintance with women he would have conquering manners he would bear down upon his rustic game with the grace that comes of absolute assurance  the richelieu of lochlea or mossgiel  in yet another manner did these quaint ways of courtship help him into fame  if he were great as principal he was unrivalled as confidant  he could enter into a passion he could counsel wary moves being in his own phrase so old a hawk nay he could turn a letter for some unlucky swain or even string a few lines of verse that should clinch the business and fetch the hesitating fair one to the ground  nor perhaps was it only his curiosity zeal and intrepid dexterity that recommended him for a second in such affairs it must have been a distinction to have the assistance and advice of rab the ranter and one who was in no way formidable by himself might grow dangerous and attractive through the fame of his associate  i think we can conceive him in these early years in that rough moorland country poor among the poor with his seven pounds a year looked upon with doubt by respectable elders but for all that the best talker the best letterwriter the most famous lover and confidant the laureate poet and the only man who wore his hair tied in the parish  he says he had then as high a notion of himself as ever after and i can well believe it  among the youth he walked facile princeps an apparent god and even if from time to time the reverend mr auld should swoop upon him with the thunders of the church and in company with seven others rab the ranter must figure some fine sunday on the stool of repentance would there not be a sort of glory an infernal apotheosis in so conspicuous a shame  was not richelieu in disgrace more idolised than ever by the dames of paris and when was the highwayman most acclaimed but on his way to tyburn  or to take a simile from nearer home and still more exactly to the point what could even corporal punishment avail administered by a cold abstract unearthly schoolmaster against the influence and fame of the schools hero  and now we come to the culminating point of burnss early period  he began to be received into the unknown upper world  his fame soon spread from among his fellowrebels on the benches and began to reach the ushers and monitors of this great ayrshire academy  this arose in part from his lax views about religion for at this time that old war of the creeds and confessors which is always grumbling from end to end of our poor scotland brisked up in these parts into a hot and virulent skirmish and burns found himself identified with the opposition party  a clique of roaring lawyers and halfheretical divines with wit enough to appreciate the value of the poets help and not sufficient taste to moderate his grossness and personality  we may judge of their surprise when holy willie was put into their hand like the amorous lads of tarbolton they recognised in him the best of seconds  his satires began to go the round in manuscript mr aiken one of the lawyers read him into fame he himself was soon welcome in many houses of a better sort where his admirable talk and his manners which he had direct from his maker except for a brush he gave them at a country dancing school completed what his poems had begun we have a sight of him at his first visit to adamhill in his ploughmans shoes coasting around the carpet as though that were sacred ground  but he soon grew used to carpets and their owners and he was still the superior of all whom he encountered and ruled the roost in conversation  such was the impression made that a young clergyman himself a man of ability trembled and became confused when he saw robert enter the church in which he was to preach  it is not surprising that the poet determined to publish he had now stood the test of some publicity and under this hopeful impulse he composed in six winter months the bulk of his more important poems  here was a young man who from a very humble place was mounting rapidly from the cynosure of a parish he had become the talk of a county once the bard of rural courtships he was now about to appear as a bound and printed poet in the worlds bookshops  a few more intimate strokes are necessary to complete the sketch  this strong young ploughman who feared no competitor with the flail suffered like a fine lady from sleeplessness and vapours he would fall into the blackest melancholies and be filled with remorse for the past and terror for the future  he was still not perhaps devoted to religion but haunted by it and at a touch of sickness prostrated himself before god in what i can only call unmanly penitence  as he had aspirations beyond his place in the world so he had tastes thoughts and weaknesses to match he loved to walk under a wood to the sound of a winter tempest he had a singular tenderness for animals he carried a book with him in his pocket when he went abroad and wore out in this service two copies of the man of feeling  with young people in the field at work he was very longsuffering and when his brother gilbert spoke sharply to them  o man ye are no for young folk he would say and give the defaulter a helping hand and a smile  in the hearts of the men whom he met he read as in a book and what is yet more rare his knowledge of himself equalled his knowledge of others  there are no truer things said of burns than what is to be found in his own letters  country don juan as he was he had none of that blind vanity which values itself on what it is not he knew his own strength and weakness to a hair he took himself boldly for what he was and except in moments of hypochondria declared himself content   the love stories   on the night of mauchline races 1785 the young men and women of the place joined in a penny ball according to their custom  in the same set danced jean armour the master masons daughter and our darkeyed don juan  his dog not the immortal luath but a successor unknown to fame caret quia vate sacro apparently sensible of some neglect followed his master to and fro to the confusion of the dancers  some mirthful comments followed and jean heard the poet say to his partner  or as i should imagine laughingly launch the remark to the company at large  that he wished he could get any of the lasses to like him as well as his dog  some time after as the girl was bleaching clothes on mauchline green robert chanced to go by still accompanied by his dog and the dog scouring in long excursion scampered with four black paws across the linen  this brought the two into conversation when jean with a somewhat hoydenish advance inquired if he had yet got any of the lasses to like him as well as his dog  it is one of the misfortunes of the professional don juan that his honour forbids him to refuse battle he is in life like the roman soldier upon duty or like the sworn physician who must attend on all diseases  burns accepted the provocation hungry hope reawakened in his heart here was a girl  pretty simple at least if not honestly stupid and plainly not averse to his attentions it seemed to him once more as if love might here be waiting him  had he but known the truth for this facile and emptyheaded girl had nothing more in view than a flirtation and her heart from the first and on to the end of her story was engaged by another man burns once more commenced the celebrated process of battering himself into a warm affection and the proofs of his success are to be found in many verses of the period nor did he succeed with himself only jean with her heart still elsewhere succumbed to his fascination and early in the next year the natural consequence became manifest  it was a heavy stroke for this unfortunate couple  they had trifled with life and were now rudely reminded of lifes serious issues  jean awoke to the ruin of her hopes the best she had now to expect was marriage with a man who was a stranger to her dearest thoughts she might now be glad if she could get what she would never have chosen  as for burns at the stroke of the calamity he recognised that his voyage of discovery had led him into a wrong hemisphere  that he was not and never had been really in love with jean  hear him in the pressure of the hour  against two things he writes i am as fixed as fate  staying at home and owning her conjugally  the first by heaven i will not do  the last by hell i will never do  and then he adds perhaps already in a more relenting temper if you see jean tell her i will meet her so god help me in my hour of need they met accordingly and burns touched with her misery came down from these heights of independence and gave her a written acknowledgment of marriage  it is the punishment of don juanism to create continually false positions  relations in life which are wrong in themselves and which it is equally wrong to break or to perpetuate  this was such a case  worldly wiseman would have laughed and gone his way let us be glad that burns was better counselled by his heart when we discover that we can be no longer true the next best is to be kind  i daresay he came away from that interview not very content but with a glorious conscience and as he went homeward he would sing his favourite how are thy servants blest o lord jean on the other hand armed with her lines confided her position to the mastermason her father and his wife  burns and his brother were then in a fair way to ruin themselves in their farm the poet was an execrable match for any welltodo country lass and perhaps old armour had an inkling of a previous attachment on his daughters part  at least he was not so much incensed by her slip from virtue as by the marriage which had been designed to cover it  of this he would not hear a word jean who had besought the acknowledgment only to appease her parents and not at all from any violent inclination to the poet readily gave up the paper for destruction and all parties imagined although wrongly that the marriage was thus dissolved  to a proud man like burns here was a crushing blow  the concession which had been wrung from his pity was now publicly thrown back in his teeth  the armour family preferred disgrace to his connection  since the promise besides he had doubtless been busy battering himself back again into his affection for the girl and the blow would not only take him in his vanity but wound him at the heart  he relieved himself in verse but for such a smarting affront manuscript poetry was insufficient to console him  he must find a more powerful remedy in good flesh and blood and after this discomfiture set forth again at once upon his voyage of discovery in quest of love  it is perhaps one of the most touching things in human nature as it is a commonplace of psychology that when a man has just lost hope or confidence in one love he is then most eager to find and lean upon another  the universe could not be yet exhausted there must be hope and love waiting for him somewhere and so with his head down this poor insulted poet ran once more upon his fate  there was an innocent and gentle highland nurserymaid at service in a neighbouring family and he had soon battered himself and her into a warm affection and a secret engagement  jeans marriage lines had not been destroyed till march 13 1786 yet all was settled between burns and mary campbell by sunday may 14 when they met for the last time and said farewell with rustic solemnities upon the banks of ayr  they each wet their hands in a stream and standing one on either bank held a bible between them as they vowed eternal faith  then they exchanged bibles on one of which burns for greater security had inscribed texts as to the binding nature of an oath and surely if ceremony can do aught to fix the wandering affections here were two people united for life mary came of a superstitious family so that she perhaps insisted on these rites but they must have been eminently to the taste of burns at this period for nothing would seem superfluous and no oath great enough to stay his tottering constancy  events of consequence now happened thickly in the poets life  his book was announced the armours sought to summon him at law for the aliment of the child he lay here and there in hiding to correct the sheets he was under an engagement for jamaica where mary was to join him as his wife now he had orders within three weeks at latest to repair aboard the nancy captain smith now his chest was already on the road to greenock and now in the wild autumn weather on the moorland he measures verses of farewell   the bursting tears my heart declare farewell the bonny banks of ayr   but the great master dramatist had secretly another intention for the piece by the most violent and complicated solution in which death and birth and sudden fame all play a part as interposing deities the actdrop fell upon a scene of transformation  jean was brought to bed of twins and by an amicable arrangement the burnses took the boy to bring up by hand while the girl remained with her mother  the success of the book was immediate and emphatic it put 20 pounds at once into the authors purse and he was encouraged upon all hands to go to edinburgh and push his success in a second and larger edition  third and last in these series of interpositions a letter came one day to mossgiel farm for robert  he went to the window to read it a sudden change came over his face and he left the room without a word years afterwards when the story began to leak out his family understood that he had then learned the death of highland mary  except in a few poems and a few dry indications purposely misleading as to date burns himself made no reference to this passage of his life it was an adventure of which for i think sufficient reasons he desired to bury the details  of one thing we may be glad in after years he visited the poor girls mother and left her with the impression that he was a real warmhearted chield  perhaps a month after he received this intelligence he set out for edinburgh on a pony he had borrowed from a friend the town that winter was agog with the ploughman poet robertson dugald stewart blair duchess gordon and all the gay world were of his acquaintance  such a revolution is not to be found in literary history  he was now it must be remembered twentyseven years of age he had fought since his early boyhood an obstinate battle against poor soil bad seed and inclement seasons wading deep in ayrshire mosses guiding the plough in the furrow wielding the threshers weary flingintree and his education his diet and his pleasures had been those of a scotch countryman  now he stepped forth suddenly among the polite and learned  we can see him as he then was in his boots and buckskins his blue coat and waistcoat striped with buff and blue like a farmer in his sunday best the heavy ploughmans figure firmly planted on its burly legs his face full of sense and shrewdness and with a somewhat melancholy air of thought and his large dark eye literally glowing as he spoke  i never saw such another eye in a human head says walter scott though i have seen the most distinguished men of my time  with men whether they were lords or omnipotent critics his manner was plain dignified and free from bashfulness or affectation  if he made a slip he had the social courage to pass on and refrain from explanation  he was not embarrassed in this society because he read and judged the men he could spy snobbery in a titled lord and as for the critics he dismissed their system in an epigram these gentlemen said he remind me of some spinsters in my country who spin their thread so fine that it is neither fit for weft nor woof  ladies on the other hand surprised him he was scarce commander of himself in their society he was disqualified by his acquired nature as a don juan and he who had been so much at his ease with country lasses treated the town dames to an extreme of deference  one lady who met him at a ball gave chambers a speaking sketch of his demeanour  his manner was not prepossessing  scarcely she thinks manly or natural  it seemed as if he affected a rusticity or landertness so that when he said the music was bonnie bonnie it was like the expression of a child these would be company manners and doubtless on a slight degree of intimacy the affectation would grow less  and his talk to women had always a turn either to the pathetic or humorous which engaged the attention particularly  the edinburgh magnates to conclude this episode at once behaved well to burns from first to last  were heavenborn genius to revisit us in similar guise i am not venturing too far when i say that he need expect neither so warm a welcome nor such solid help  although burns was only a peasant and one of no very elegant reputation as to morals he was made welcome to their homes  they gave him a great deal of good advice helped him to some five hundred pounds of ready money and got him as soon as he asked it a place in the excise  burns on his part bore the elevation with perfect dignity and with perfect dignity returned when the time had come into a country privacy of life  his powerful sense never deserted him and from the first he recognised that his edinburgh popularity was but an ovation and the affair of a day  he wrote a few letters in a highflown bombastic vein of gratitude but in practice he suffered no man to intrude upon his selfrespect  on the other hand he never turned his back even for a moment on his old associates and he was always ready to sacrifice an acquaintance to a friend although the acquaintance were a duke  he would be a bold man who should promise similar conduct in equally exacting circumstances  it was in short an admirable appearance on the stage of life  socially successful intimately self respecting and like a gentleman from first to last  in the present study this must only be taken by the way while we return to burnss love affairs  even on the road to edinburgh he had seized upon the opportunity of a flirtation and had carried the battering so far that when next he moved from town it was to steal two days with this anonymous fair one  the exact importance to burns of this affair may be gathered from the song in which he commemorated its occurrence  i love the dear lassie he sings because she loves me or in the tongue of prose finding an opportunity i did not hesitate to profit by it and even now if it returned i should not hesitate to profit by it again  a love thus founded has no interest for mortal man meantime early in the winter and only once we find him regretting jean in his correspondence  because  such is his reason  because he does not think he will ever meet so delicious an armful again and then after a brief excursion into verse he goes straight on to describe a new episode in the voyage of discovery with the daughter of a lothian farmer for a heroine  i must ask the reader to follow all these references to his future wife they are essential to the comprehension of burnss character and fate  in june we find him back at mauchline a famous man  there the armour family greeted him with a mean servile compliance which increased his former disgust  jean was not less compliant a second time the poor girl submitted to the fascination of the man whom she did not love and whom she had so cruelly insulted little more than a year ago and though burns took advantage of her weakness it was in the ugliest and most cynical spirit and with a heart absolutely indifferent judge of this by a letter written some twenty days after his return  a letter to my mind among the most degrading in the whole collection  a letter which seems to have been inspired by a boastful libertine bagman  i am afraid it goes i have almost ruined one source the principal one indeed of my former happiness  the eternal propensity i always had to fall in love  my heart no more glows with feverish rapture i have no paradisiacal evening interviews  even the process of battering has failed him you perceive  still he had some one in his eye  a lady if you please with a fine figure and elegant manners and who had seen the politest quarters in europe  i frequently visited her he writes and after passing regularly the intermediate degrees between the distant formal bow and the familiar grasp round the waist i ventured in my careless way to talk of friendship in rather ambiguous terms and after her return to   i wrote her in the same terms  miss construing my remarks further than even i intended flew off in a tangent of female dignity and reserve like a mounting lark in an april morning and wrote me an answer which measured out very completely what an immense way i had to travel before i could reach the climate of her favours  but i am an old hawk at the sport and wrote her such a cool deliberate prudent reply as brought my bird from her aerial towerings pop down to my foot like corporal trims hat  i avow a carnal longing after this transcription to buffet the old hawk about the ears  there is little question that to this lady he must have repeated his addresses and that he was by her miss chalmers eventually though not at all unkindly rejected  one more detail to characterise the period  six months after the date of this letter burns back in edinburgh is served with a writ in meditatione fugae on behalf of some edinburgh fair one probably of humble rank who declared an intention of adding to his family  about the beginning of december 1787 a new period opens in the story of the poets random affections  he met at a tea party one mrs agnes mlehose a married woman of about his own age who with her two children had been deserted by an unworthy husband  she had wit could use her pen and had read werther with attention  sociable and even somewhat frisky there was a good sound human kernel in the woman a warmth of love strong dogmatic religious feeling and a considerable but not authoritative sense of the proprieties  of what biographers refer to daintily as her somewhat voluptuous style of beauty judging from the silhouette in mr scott douglass invaluable edition the reader will be fastidious if he does not approve  take her for all in all i believe she was the best woman burns encountered  the pair took a fancy for each other on the spot mrs mlehose in her turn invited him to tea but the poet in his character of the old hawk preferred a tetea tete excused himself at the last moment and offered a visit instead  an accident confined him to his room for nearly a month and this led to the famous clarinda and sylvander correspondence  it was begun in simple sport they are already at their fifth or sixth exchange when clarinda writes it is really curious so much fun passing between two persons who saw each other only once but it is hardly safe for a man and woman in the flower of their years to write almost daily and sometimes in terms too ambiguous sometimes in terms too plain and generally in terms too warm for mere acquaintance  the exercise partakes a little of the nature of battering and danger may be apprehended when next they meet  it is difficult to give any account of this remarkable correspondence it is too far away from us and perhaps not yet far enough in point of time and manner the imagination is baffled by these stilted literary utterances warming in bravura passages into downright truculent nonsense clarinda has one famous sentence in which she bids sylvander connect the thought of his mistress with the changing phases of the year it was enthusiastically admired by the swain but on the modern mind produces mild amazement and alarm oh clarinda writes burns shall we not meet in a state  some yet unknown state  of being where the lavish hand of plenty shall minister to the highest wish of benevolence and where the chill north wind of prudence shall never blow over the flowery field of enjoyment  the design may be that of an old hawk but the style is more suggestive of a bird of paradise  it is sometimes hard to fancy they are not gravely making fun of each other as they write  religion poetry love and charming sensibility are the current topics  i am delighted charming clarinda with your honest enthusiasm for religion writes burns and the pair entertained a fiction that this was their favourite subject  this is sunday writes the lady and not a word on our favourite subject  o fy divine clarinda   i suspect although quite unconsciously on the part of the lady who was bent on his redemption they but used the favourite subject as a stalkinghorse  in the meantime the sportive acquaintance was ripening steadily into a genuine passion  visits took place and then became frequent  clarindas friends were hurt and suspicious her clergyman interfered she herself had smart attacks of conscience but her heart had gone from her control it was altogether his and she counted all things but loss  heaven excepted  that she might win and keep him  burns himself was transported while in her neighbourhood but his transports somewhat rapidly declined during an absence  i am tempted to imagine that womanlike he took on the colour of his mistresss feeling that he could not but heat himself at the fire of her unaffected passion but that like one who should leave the hearth upon a winters night his temperature soon fell when he was out of sight and in a word though he could share the symptoms that he had never shared the disease  at the same time amid the fustian of the letters there are forcible and true expressions and the love verses that he wrote upon clarinda are among the most moving in the language  we are approaching the solution  in midwinter jean once more in the family way was turned out of doors by her family and burns had her received and cared for in the house of a friend  for he remained to the last imperfect in his character of don juan and lacked the sinister courage to desert his victim  about the middle of february 1788 he had to tear himself from his clarinda and make a journey into the southwest on business  clarinda gave him two shirts for his little son  they were daily to meet in prayer at an appointed hour  burns too late for the post at glasgow sent her a letter by parcel that she might not have to wait clarinda on her part writes this time with a beautiful simplicity i think the streets look desertedlike since monday and theres a certain insipidity in good kind folks i once enjoyed not a little  miss wardrobe supped here on monday  she once named you which kept me from falling asleep  i drank your health in a glass of ale  as the lasses do at halloween  in to mysel   arrived at mauchline burns installed jean armour in a lodging and prevailed on mrs armour to promise her help and countenance in the approaching confinement  this was kind at least but hear his expressions i have taken her a room i have taken her to my arms i have given her a mahogany bed i have given her a guinea    i swore her privately and solemnly never to attempt any claim on me as a husband even though anybody should persuade her she had such a claim  which she has not neither during my life nor after my death  she did all this like a good girl  and then he took advantage of the situation  to clarinda he wrote i this morning called for a certain woman  i am disgusted with her i cannot endure her and he accused her of tasteless insipidity vulgarity of soul and mercenary fawning  this was already in march by the thirteenth of that month he was back in edinburgh  on the 17th he wrote to clarinda your hopes your fears your cares my love are mine so dont mind them  i will take you in my hand through the dreary wilds of this world and scare away the ravening bird or beast that would annoy you again on the 21st will you open with satisfaction and delight a letter from a man who loves you who has loved you and who will love you to death through death and for ever    how rich am i to have such a treasure as you    the lord god knoweth and perhaps israel he shall know my love and your merit  adieu clarinda  i am going to remember you in my prayers  by the 7th of april seventeen days later he had already decided to make jean armour publicly his wife  a more astonishing stagetrick is not to be found  and yet his conduct is seen upon a nearer examination to be grounded both in reason and in kindness  he was now about to embark on a solid worldly career he had taken a farm the affair with clarinda however gratifying to his heart was too contingent to offer any great consolation to a man like burns to whom marriage must have seemed the very dawn of hope and selfrespect  this is to regard the question from its lowest aspect but there is no doubt that he entered on this new period of his life with a sincere determination to do right  he had just helped his brother with a loan of a hundred and eighty pounds should he do nothing for the poor girl whom he had ruined  it was true he could not do as he did without brutally wounding clarinda that was the punishment of his bygone fault he was as he truly says damned with a choice only of different species of error and misconduct  to be professional don juan to accept the provocation of any lively lass upon the village green may thus lead a man through a series of detestable words and actions and land him at last in an undesired and most unsuitable union for life  if he had been strong enough to refrain or bad enough to persevere in evil if he had only not been don juan at all or been don juan altogether there had been some possible road for him throughout this troublesome world but a man alas who is equally at the call of his worse and better instincts stands among changing events without foundation or resource 1  1 for the love affairs see in particular mr scott douglass edition under the different dates   downward course   it may be questionable whether any marriage could have tamed burns but it is at least certain that there was no hope for him in the marriage he contracted  he did right but then he had done wrong before it was as i said one of those relations in life which it seems equally wrong to break or to perpetuate  he neither loved nor respected his wife  god knows he writes my choice was as random as blind mans buff  he consoles himself by the thought that he has acted kindly to her that she has the most sacred enthusiasm of attachment to him that she has a good figure that she has a woodnote wild her voice rising with ease to b natural no less  the effect on the reader is one of unmingled pity for both parties concerned  this was not the wife who in his own words could enter into his favourite studies or relish his favourite authors this was not even a wife after the affair of the marriage lines in whom a husband could joy to place his trust  let her manage a farm with sense let her voice rise to b natural all day long she would still be a peasant to her lettered lord and an object of pity rather than of equal affection  she could now be faithful she could now be forgiving she could now be generous even to a pathetic and touching degree but coming from one who was unloved and who had scarce shown herself worthy of the sentiment these were all virtues thrown away which could neither change her husbands heart nor affect the inherent destiny of their relation  from the outset it was a marriage that had no root in nature and we find him ere long lyrically regretting highland mary renewing correspondence with clarinda in the warmest language on doubtful terms with mrs riddel and on terms unfortunately beyond any question with anne park  alas this was not the only ill circumstance in his future he had been idle for some eighteen months superintending his new edition hanging on to settle with the publisher travelling in the highlands with willie nichol or philandering with mrs mlehose and in this period the radical part of the man had suffered irremediable hurt  he had lost his habits of industry and formed the habit of pleasure  apologetical biographers assure us of the contrary but from the first he saw and recognised the danger for himself his mind he writes is enervated to an alarming degree by idleness and dissipation and again my mind has been vitiated with idleness  it never fairly recovered  to business he could bring the required diligence and attention without difficulty but he was thenceforward incapable except in rare instances of that superior effort of concentration which is required for serious literary work he may be said indeed to have worked no more and only amused himself with letters  the man who had written a volume of masterpieces in six months during the remainder of his life rarely found courage for any more sustained effort than a song  and the nature of the songs is itself characteristic of these idle later years for they are often as polished and elaborate as his earlier works were frank and headlong and colloquial and this sort of verbal elaboration in short flights is for a man of literary turn simply the most agreeable of pastimes  the change in manner coincides exactly with the edinburgh visit  in 1786 he had written the address to a louse which may be taken as an extreme instance of the first manner and already in 1787 we come upon the rosebud pieces to miss cruikshank which are extreme examples of the second  the change was therefore the direct and very natural consequence of his great change in life but it is not the less typical of his loss of moral courage that he should have given up all larger ventures nor the less melancholy that a man who first attacked literature with a hand that seemed capable of moving mountains should have spent his later years in whittling cherrystones  meanwhile the farm did not prosper he had to join to it the salary of an exciseman at last he had to give it up and rely altogether on the latter resource  he was an active officer and though he sometimes tempered severity with mercy we have local testimony oddly representing the public feeling of the period that while in everything else he was a perfect gentleman when he met with anything seizable he was no better than any other gauger  there is but one manifestation of the man in these last years which need delay us and that was the sudden interest in politics which arose from his sympathy with the great french revolution  his only political feeling had been hitherto a sentimental jacobitism not more or less respectable than that of scott aytoun and the rest of what george borrow has nicknamed the charlie over the water scotchmen  it was a sentiment almost entirely literary and picturesque in its origin built on ballads and the adventures of the young chevalier and in burns it is the more excusable because he lay out of the way of active politics in his youth  with the great french revolution something living practical and feasible appeared to him for the first time in this realm of human action  the young ploughman who had desired so earnestly to rise now reached out his sympathies to a whole nation animated with the same desire  already in 1788 we find the old jacobitism hand in hand with the new popular doctrine when in a letter of indignation against the zeal of a whig clergyman he writes i daresay the american congress in 1776 will be allowed to be as able and as enlightened as the english convention was in 1688 and that their posterity will celebrate the centenary of their deliverance from us as duly and sincerely as we do ours from the oppressive measures of the wrongheaded house of stuart as time wore on his sentiments grew more pronounced and even violent but there was a basis of sense and generous feeling to his hottest excess  what he asked was a fair chance for the individual in life an open road to success and distinction for all classes of men  it was in the same spirit that he had helped to found a public library in the parish where his farm was situated and that he sang his fervent snatches against tyranny and tyrants  witness were it alone this verse   heres freedom to him that wad read heres freedom to him that wad write theres nane ever feared that the truth should be heard but them wham the truth wad indite   yet his enthusiasm for the cause was scarce guided by wisdom many stories are preserved of the bitter and unwise words he used in country coteries how he proposed washingtons health as an amendment to pitts gave as a toast the last verse of the last chapter of kings and celebrated dumouriez in a doggrel impromptu full of ridicule and hate  now his sympathies would inspire him with scots wha hae now involve him in a drunken broil with a loyal officer and consequent apologies and explanations hard to offer for a man of burnss stomach  nor was this the front of his offending on february 27 1792 he took part in the capture of an armed smuggler bought at the subsequent sale four carronades and despatched them with a letter to the french assembly  letter and guns were stopped at dover by the english officials there was trouble for burns with his superiors he was reminded firmly however delicately that as a paid official it was his duty to obey and to be silent and all the blood of this poor proud and falling man must have rushed to his head at the humiliation  his letter to mr erskine subsequently earl of mar testifies in its turgid turbulent phrases to a perfect passion of alarmed self respect and vanity  he had been muzzled and muzzled when all was said by his paltry salary as an exciseman alas had he not a family to keep  already he wrote he looked forward to some such judgment from a hackney scribbler as this burns notwithstanding the fanfaronnade of independence to be found in his works and after having been held forth to view and to public estimation as a man of some genius yet quite destitute of resources within himself to support his borrowed dignity he dwindled into a paltry exciseman and shrunk out the rest of his insignificant existence in the meanest of pursuits and among the vilest of mankind  and then on he goes in a style of rhodomontade but filled with living indignation to declare his right to a political opinion and his willingness to shed his blood for the political birthright of his sons  poor perturbed spirit he was indeed exercised in vain those who share and those who differ from his sentiments about the revolution alike understand and sympathise with him in this painful strait for poetry and human manhood are lasting like the race and politics which are but a wrongful striving after right pass and change from year to year and age to age  the twa dogs has already outlasted the constitution of sieyes and the policy of the whigs and burns is better known among englishspeaking races than either pitt or fox  meanwhile whether as a man a husband or a poet his steps led downward  he knew knew bitterly that the best was out of him he refused to make another volume for he felt that it would be a disappointment he grew petulantly alive to criticism unless he was sure it reached him from a friend for his songs he would take nothing they were all that he could do the proposed scotch play the proposed series of scotch tales in verse all had gone to water and in a fling of pain and disappointment which is surely noble with the nobility of a viking he would rather stoop to borrow than to accept money for these last and inadequate efforts of his muse  and this desperate abnegation rises at times near to the height of madness as when he pretended that he had not written but only found and published his immortal auld lang syne  in the same spirit he became more scrupulous as an artist he was doing so little he would fain do that little well and about two months before his death he asked thomson to send back all his manuscripts for revisal saying that he would rather write five songs to his taste than twice that number otherwise  the battle of his life was lost in forlorn efforts to do well in desperate submissions to evil the last years flew by  his temper is dark and explosive launching epigrams quarrelling with his friends jealous of young puppy officers  he tries to be a good father he boasts himself a libertine  sick sad and jaded he can refuse no occasion of temporary pleasure no opportunity to shine and he who had once refused the invitations of lords and ladies is now whistled to the inn by any curious stranger  his death july 21 1796 in his thirtyseventh year was indeed a kindly dispensation  it is the fashion to say he died of drink many a man has drunk more and yet lived with reputation and reached a good age  that drink and debauchery helped to destroy his constitution and were the means of his unconscious suicide is doubtless true but he had failed in life had lost his power of work and was already married to the poor unworthy patient jean before he had shown his inclination to convivial nights or at least before that inclination had become dangerous either to his health or his selfrespect  he had trifled with life and must pay the penalty  he had chosen to be don juan he had grasped at temporary pleasures and substantial happiness and solid industry had passed him by  he died of being robert burns and there is no levity in such a statement of the case for shall we not one and all deserve a similar epitaph   works   the somewhat cruel necessity which has lain upon me throughout this paper only to touch upon those points in the life of burns where correction or amplification seemed desirable leaves me little opportunity to speak of the works which have made his name so famous  yet even here a few observations seem necessary  at the time when the poet made his appearance and great first success his work was remarkable in two ways  for first in an age when poetry had become abstract and conventional instead of continuing to deal with shepherds thunderstorms and personifications he dealt with the actual circumstances of his life however matteroffact and sordid these might be  and second in a time when english versification was particularly stiff lame and feeble and words were used with ultraacademical timidity he wrote verses that were easy racy graphic and forcible and used language with absolute tact and courage as it seemed most fit to give a clear impression  if you take even those english authors whom we know burns to have most admired and studied you will see at once that he owed them nothing but a warning  take shenstone for instance and watch that elegant author as he tries to grapple with the facts of life  he has a description i remember of a gentleman engaged in sliding or walking on thin ice which is a little miracle of incompetence  you see my memory fails me and i positively cannot recollect whether his hero was sliding or walking as though a writer should describe a skirmish and the reader at the end be still uncertain whether it were a charge of cavalry or a slow and stubborn advance of foot  there could be no such ambiguity in burns his work is at the opposite pole from such indefinite and stammering performances and a whole lifetime passed in the study of shenstone would only lead a man further and further from writing the address to a louse  yet burns like most great artists proceeded from a school and continued a tradition only the school and tradition were scotch and not english  while the english language was becoming daily more pedantic and inflexible and english letters more colourless and slack there was another dialect in the sister country and a different school of poetry tracing its descent through king james i from chaucer  the dialect alone accounts for much for it was then written colloquially which kept it fresh and supple and although not shaped for heroic flights it was a direct and vivid medium for all that had to do with social life hence whenever scotch poets left their laborious imitations of bad english verses and fell back on their own dialect their style would kindle and they would write of their convivial and somewhat gross existences with pith and point in ramsay and far more in the poor lad fergusson there was mettle humour literary courage and a power of saying what they wished to say definitely and brightly which in the latter case should have justified great anticipations  had burns died at the same age as fergusson he would have left us literally nothing worth remark  to ramsay and to fergusson then he was indebted in a very uncommon degree not only following their tradition and using their measures but directly and avowedly imitating their pieces  the same tendency to borrow a hint to work on some one elses foundation is notable in burns from first to last in the period of songwriting as well as in that of the early poems and strikes one oddly in a man of such deep originality who left so strong a print on all he touched and whose work is so greatly distinguished by that character of inevitability which wordsworth denied to goethe  when we remember burnss obligations to his predecessors we must never forget his immense advances on them  they had already discovered nature but burns discovered poetry  a higher and more intense way of thinking of the things that go to make up nature a higher and more ideal key of words in which to speak of them  ramsay and fergusson excelled at making a popular  or shall we say vulgar  sort of society verses comical and prosaic written you would say in taverns while a supper party waited for its laureates word but on the appearance of burns this coarse and laughing literature was touched to finer issues and learned gravity of thought and natural pathos  what he had gained from his predecessors was a direct speaking style and to walk on his own feet instead of on academical stilts  there was never a man of letters with more absolute command of his means and we may say of him without excess that his style was his slave  hence that energy of epithet so concise and telling that a foreigner is tempted to explain it by some special richness or aptitude in the dialect he wrote  hence that homeric justice and completeness of description which gives us the very physiognomy of nature in body and detail as nature is hence too the unbroken literary quality of his best pieces which keeps him from any slip into the weariful trade of wordpainting and presents everything as everything should be presented by the art of words in a clear continuous medium of thought  principal shairp for instance gives us a paraphrase of one tough verse of the original and for those who know the greek poets only by paraphrase this has the very quality they are accustomed to look for and admire in greek  the contemporaries of burns were surprised that he should visit so many celebrated mountains and waterfalls and not seize the opportunity to make a poem  indeed it is not for those who have a true command of the art of words but for peddling professional amateurs that these pointed occasions are most useful and inspiring  as those who speak french imperfectly are glad to dwell on any topic they may have talked upon or heard others talk upon before because they know appropriate words for it in french so the dabbler in verse rejoices to behold a waterfall because he has learned the sentiment and knows appropriate words for it in poetry  but the dialect of burns was fitted to deal with any subject and whether it was a stormy night a shepherds collie a sheep struggling in the snow the conduct of cowardly soldiers in the field the gait and cogitations of a drunken man or only a village cockcrow in the morning he could find language to give it freshness body and relief he was always ready to borrow the hint of a design as though he had a difficulty in commencing  a difficulty let us say in choosing a subject out of a world which seemed all equally living and significant to him but once he had the subject chosen he could cope with nature singlehanded and make every stroke a triumph  again his absolute mastery in his art enabled him to express each and all of his different humours and to pass smoothly and congruously from one to another  many men invent a dialect for only one side of their nature  perhaps their pathos or their humour or the delicacy of their senses  and for lack of a medium leave all the others unexpressed  you meet such an one and find him in conversation full of thought feeling and experience which he has lacked the art to employ in his writings  but burns was not thus hampered in the practice of the literary art he could throw the whole weight of his nature into his work and impregnate it from end to end  if doctor johnson that stilted and accomplished stylist had lacked the sacred boswell what should we have known of him and how should we have delighted in his acquaintance as we do  those who spoke with burns tell us how much we have lost who did not  but i think they exaggerate their privilege i think we have the whole burns in our possession set forth in his consummate verses  it was by his style and not by his matter that he affected wordsworth and the world  there is indeed only one merit worth considering in a man of letters  that he should write well and only one damning fault  that he should write ill we are little the better for the reflections of the sailors parrot in the story  and so if burns helped to change the course of literary history it was by his frank direct and masterly utterance and not by his homely choice of subjects that was imposed upon him not chosen upon a principle  he wrote from his own experience because it was his nature so to do and the tradition of the school from which he proceeded was fortunately not oppose to homely subjects  but to these homely subjects he communicated the rich commentary of his nature they were all steeped in burns and they interest us not in themselves but because they have been passed through the spirit of so genuine and vigorous a man such is the stamp of living literature and there was never any more alive than that of burns  what a gust of sympathy there is in him sometimes flowing out in byways hitherto unused upon mice and flowers and the devil himself sometimes speaking plainly between human hearts sometimes ringing out in exultation like a peal of beals  when we compare the farmers salutation to his auld mare maggie with the clever and inhumane production of half a century earlier the auld mans mares dead we see in a nutshell the spirit of the change introduced by burns  and as to its manner who that has read it can forget how the collie luath in the twa dogs describes and enters into the merrymaking in the cottage   the luntin pipe an sneeshin mill are handed round wi richt guid will the canty auld folks crackin crouse the young anes rantin through the house  my heart has been sae fain to see them that i for joy hae barkit wi them   it was this ardent power of sympathy that was fatal to so many women and through jean armour to himself at last his humour comes from him in a stream so deep and easy that i will venture to call him the best of humorous poets  he turns about in the midst to utter a noble sentiment or a trenchant remark on human life and the style changes and rises to the occasion  i think it is principal shairp who says happily that burns would have been no scotchman if he had not loved to moralise neither may we add would he have been his fathers son but what is worthy of note his moralisings are to a large extent the moral of his own career  he was among the least impersonal of artists except in the jolly beggars he shows no gleam of dramatic instinct  mr carlyle has complained that tam o shanter is from the absence of this quality only a picturesque and external piece of work and i may add that in the twa dogs it is precisely in the infringement of dramatic propriety that a great deal of the humour of the speeches depends for its existence and effect  indeed burns was so full of his identity that it breaks forth on every page and there is scarce an appropriate remark either in praise or blame of his own conduct but he has put it himself into verse  alas for the tenor of these remarks  they are indeed his own pitiful apology for such a marred existence and talents so misused and stunted and they seem to prove for ever how small a part is played by reason in the conduct of mans affairs  here was one at least who with unfailing judgment predicted his own fate yet his knowledge could not avail him and with open eyes he must fulfil his tragic destiny ten years before the end he had written his epitaph and neither subsequent events nor the critical eyes of posterity have shown us a word in it to alter  and lastly has he not put in for himself the last unanswerable plea    then gently scan your brother man still gentler sister woman though they may gang a kennin wrang to step aside is human one point must still be greatly dark    one  alas  i fear every man and woman of us is greatly dark to all their neighbours from the day of birth until death removes them in their greatest virtues as well as in their saddest faults and we who have been trying to read the character of burns may take home the lesson and be gentle in our thoughts    chapter iii  walt whitman    of late years the name of walt whitman has been a good deal bandied about in books and magazines  it has become familiar both in good and ill repute  his works have been largely bespattered with praise by his admirers and cruelly mauled and mangled by irreverent enemies  now whether his poetry is good or bad as poetry is a matter that may admit of a difference of opinion without alienating those who differ we could not keep the peace with a man who should put forward claims to taste and yet depreciate the choruses in samson agonistes but i think we may shake hands with one who sees no more in walt whitmans volume from a literary point of view than a farrago of incompetent essays in a wrong direction  that may not be at all our own opinion  we may think that when a work contains many unforgettable phrases it cannot be altogether devoid of literary merit  we may even see passages of a high poetry here and there among its eccentric contents  but when all is said walt whitman is neither a milton nor a shakespeare to appreciate his works is not a condition necessary to salvation and i would not disinherit a son upon the question nor even think much the worse of a critic for i should always have an idea what he meant  what whitman has to say is another affair from how he says it  it is not possible to acquit any one of defective intelligence or else stiff prejudice who is not interested by whitmans matter and the spirit it represents  not as a poet but as what we must call for lack of a more exact expression a prophet he occupies a curious and prominent position  whether he may greatly influence the future or not he is a notable symptom of the present  as a sign of the times it would be hard to find his parallel  i should hazard a large wager for instance that he was not unacquainted with the works of herbert spencer and yet where in all the history books shall we lay our hands on two more incongruous contemporaries  mr spencer so decorous  i had almost said so dandy  in dissent and whitman like a large shaggy dog just unchained scouring the beaches of the world and baying at the moon  and when was an echo more curiously like a satire than when mr spencer found his synthetic philosophy reverberated from the other shores of the atlantic in the barbaric yawp of whitman   i   whitman it cannot be too soon explained writes up to a system  he was a theoriser about society before he was a poet  he first perceived something wanting and then sat down squarely to supply the want  the reader running over his works will find that he takes nearly as much pleasure in critically expounding his theory of poetry as in making poems  this is as far as it can be from the case of the spontaneous village minstrel dear to elegy who has no theory whatever although sometimes he may have fully as much poetry as whitman  the whole of whitmans work is deliberate and preconceived  a man born into a society comparatively new full of conflicting elements and interests could not fail if he had any thoughts at all to reflect upon the tendencies around him  he saw much good and evil on all sides not yet settled down into some more or less unjust compromise as in older nations but still in the act of settlement  and he could not but wonder what it would turn out whether the compromise would be very just or very much the reverse and give great or little scope for healthy human energies  from idle wonder to active speculation is but a step and he seems to have been early struck with the inefficacy of literature and its extreme unsuitability to the conditions  what he calls feudal literature could have little living action on the tumult of american democracy what he calls the literature of wo meaning the whole tribe of werther and byron could have no action for good in any time or place both propositions if art had none but a direct moral influence would be true enough and as this seems to be whitmans view they were true enough for him  he conceived the idea of a literature which was to inhere in the life of the present which was to be first human and next american which was to be brave and cheerful as per contract to give culture in a popular and poetical presentment and in so doing catch and stereotype some democratic ideal of humanity which should be equally natural to all grades of wealth and education and suited in one of his favourite phrases to the average man  to the formation of some such literature as this his poems are to be regarded as so many contributions one sometimes explaining sometimes superseding the other and the whole together not so much a finished work as a body of suggestive hints  he does not profess to have built the castle but he pretends he has traced the lines of the foundation  he has not made the poetry but he flatters himself he has done something towards making the poets  his notion of the poetic function is ambitious and coincides roughly with what schopenhauer has laid down as the province of the metaphysician  the poet is to gather together for men and set in order the materials of their existence  he is the answerer he is to find some way of speaking about life that shall satisfy if only for the moment mans enduring astonishment at his own position  and besides having an answer ready it is he who shall provoke the question  he must shake people out of their indifference and force them to make some election in this world instead of sliding dully forward in a dream  life is a business we are all apt to mismanage either living recklessly from day to day or suffering ourselves to be gulled out of our moments by the inanities of custom  we should despise a man who gave as little activity and forethought to the conduct of any other business  but in this which is the one thing of all others since it contains them all we cannot see the forest for the trees  one brief impression obliterates another  there is something stupefying in the recurrence of unimportant things  and it is only on rare provocations that we can rise to take an outlook beyond daily concerns and comprehend the narrow limits and great possibilities of our existence  it is the duty of the poet to induce such moments of clear sight  he is the declared enemy of all living by reflex action of all that is done betwixt sleep and waking of all the pleasureless pleasurings and imaginary duties in which we coin away our hearts and fritter invaluable years he has to electrify his readers into an instant unflagging activity founded on a wide and eager observation of the world and make them direct their ways by a superior prudence which has little or nothing in common with the maxims of the copybook  that many of us lead such lives as they would heartily disown after two hours serious reflection on the subject is i am afraid a true and i am sure a very galling thought  the enchanted ground of dead alive respectability is next upon the map to the beulah of considerate virtue  but there they all slumber and take their rest in the middle of gods beautiful and wonderful universe the drowsy heads have nodded together in the same position since first their fathers fell asleep and not even the sound of the last trumpet can wake them to a single active thought  the poet has a hard task before him to stir up such fellows to a sense of their own and other peoples principles in life  and it happens that literature is in some ways but an indifferent means to such an end  language is but a poor bullseye lantern wherewith to show off the vast cathedral of the world and yet a particular thing once said in words is so definite and memorable that it makes us forget the absence of the many which remain unexpressed like a bright window in a distant view which dazzles and confuses our sight of its surroundings  there are not words enough in all shakespeare to express the merest fraction of a mans experience in an hour  the speed of the eyesight and the hearing and the continual industry of the mind produce in ten minutes what it would require a laborious volume to shadow forth by comparisons and roundabout approaches  if verbal logic were sufficient life would be as plain sailing as a piece of euclid  but as a matter of fact we make a travesty of the simplest process of thought when we put it into words for the words are all coloured and forsworn apply inaccurately and bring with them from former uses ideas of praise and blame that have nothing to do with the question in hand  so we must always see to it nearly that we judge by the realities of life and not by the partial terms that represent them in mans speech and at times of choice we must leave words upon one side and act upon those brute convictions unexpressed and perhaps inexpressible which cannot be flourished in an argument but which are truly the sum and fruit of our experience  words are for communication not for judgment  this is what every thoughtful man knows for himself for only fools and silly schoolmasters push definitions over far into the domain of conduct and the majority of women not learned in these scholastic refinements live allofapiece and unconsciously as a tree grows without caring to put a name upon their acts or motives  hence a new difficulty for whitmans scrupulous and argumentative poet he must do more than waken up the sleepers to his words he must persuade them to look over the book and at life with their own eyes  this side of truth is very present to whitman it is this that he means when he tells us that to glance with an eye confounds the learning of all times  but he is not unready he is never weary of descanting on the undebatable conviction that is forced upon our minds by the presence of other men of animals or of inanimate things  to glance with an eye were it only at a chair or a park railing is by far a more persuasive process and brings us to a far more exact conclusion than to read the works of all the logicians extant  if both by a large allowance may be said to end in certainty the certainty in the one case transcends the other to an incalculable degree  if people see a lion they run away if they only apprehend a deduction they keep wandering around in an experimental humour  now how is the poet to convince like nature and not like books  is there no actual piece of nature that he can show the man to his face as he might show him a tree if they were walking together  yes there is one the mans own thoughts  in fact if the poet is to speak efficaciously he must say what is already in his hearers mind  that alone the hearer will believe that alone he will be able to apply intelligently to the facts of life  any conviction even if it be a whole system or a whole religion must pass into the condition of commonplace or postulate before it becomes fully operative  strange excursions and highflying theories may interest but they cannot rule behaviour  our faith is not the highest truth that we perceive but the highest that we have been able to assimilate into the very texture and method of our thinking it is not therefore by flashing before a mans eyes the weapons of dialectic it is not by induction deduction or construction it is not by forcing him on from one stage of reasoning to another that the man will be effectually renewed  he cannot be made to believe anything but he can be made to see that he has always believed it  and this is the practical canon  it is when the reader cries oh i know and is perhaps half irritated to see how nearly the author has forestalled his own thoughts that he is on the way to what is called in theology a saving faith  here we have the key to whitmans attitude  to give a certain unity of ideal to the average population of america  to gather their activities about some conception of humanity that shall be central and normal if only for the moment  the poet must portray that population as it is  like human law human poetry is simply declaratory  if any ideal is possible it must be already in the thoughts of the people and by the same reason in the thoughts of the poet who is one of them  and hence whitmans own formula the poet is individual  he is complete in himself the others are as good as he only he sees it and they do not  to show them how good they are the poet must study his fellowcountrymen and himself somewhat like a traveller on the hunt for his book of travels  there is a sense of course in which all true books are books of travel and all genuine poets must run their risk of being charged with the travellers exaggeration for to whom are such books more surprising than to those whose own life is faithfully and smartly pictured but this danger is all upon one side and you may judiciously flatter the portrait without any likelihood of the sitters disowning it for a faithful likeness  and so whitman has reasoned that by drawing at first hand from himself and his neighbours accepting without shame the inconsistencies and brutalities that go to make up man and yet treating the whole in a high magnanimous spirit he would make sure of belief and at the same time encourage people forward by the means of praise   ii   we are accustomed nowadays to a great deal of puling over the circumstances in which we are placed  the great refinement of many poetical gentlemen has rendered them practically unfit for the jostling and ugliness of life and they record their unfitness at considerable length  the bold and awful poetry of jobs complaint produces too many flimsy imitators for there is always something consolatory in grandeur but the symphony transposed for the piano becomes hysterically sad  this literature of woe as whitman calls it this maladie de rene as we like to call it in europe is in many ways a most humiliating and sickly phenomenon  young gentlemen with three or four hundred a year of private means look down from a pinnacle of doleful experience on all the grown and hearty men who have dared to say a good word for life since the beginning of the world  there is no prophet but the melancholy jacques and the blue devils dance on all our literary wires  it would be a poor service to spread culture if this be its result among the comparatively innocent and cheerful ranks of men  when our little poets have to be sent to look at the ploughman and learn wisdom we must be careful how we tamper with our ploughmen  where a man in not the best of circumstances preserves composure of mind and relishes ale and tobacco and his wife and children in the intervals of dull and unremunerative labour where a man in this predicament can afford a lesson by the way to what are called his intellectual superiors there is plainly something to be lost as well as something to be gained by teaching him to think differently  it is better to leave him as he is than to teach him whining  it is better that he should go without the cheerful lights of culture if cheerless doubt and paralysing sentimentalism are to be the consequence  let us by all means fight against that hidebound stolidity of sensation and sluggishness of mind which blurs and decolorises for poor natures the wonderful pageant of consciousness let us teach people as much as we can to enjoy and they will learn for themselves to sympathise but let us see to it above all that we give these lessons in a brave vivacious note and build the man up in courage while we demolish its substitute indifference  whitman is alive to all this  he sees that if the poet is to be of any help he must testify to the livableness of life  his poems he tells us are to be hymns of the praise of things  they are to make for a certain high joy in living or what he calls himself a brave delight fit for freedoms athletes  and he has had no difficulty in introducing his optimism it fitted readily enough with his system for the average man is truly a courageous person and truly fond of living  one of whitmans remarks upon this head is worth quotation as he is there perfectly successful and does precisely what he designs to do throughout takes ordinary and even commonplace circumstances throws them out by a happy turn of thinking into significance and something like beauty and tacks a hopeful moral lesson to the end   the passionate tenacity of hunters woodmen early risers cultivators of gardens and orchards and fields he says the love of healthy women for the manly form seafaring persons drivers of horses the passion for light and the open air  all is an old unvaried sign of the unfailing perception of beauty and of a residence of the poetic in outdoor people   there seems to me something truly original in this choice of trite examples  you will remark how adroitly whitman begins hunters and woodmen being confessedly romantic  and one thing more  if he had said the love of healthy men for the female form he would have said almost a silliness for the thing has never been dissembled out of delicacy and is so obvious as to be a public nuisance  but by reversing it he tells us something not unlike news something that sounds quite freshly in words and if the reader be a man gives him a moment of great selfsatisfaction and spiritual aggrandisement  in many different authors you may find passages more remarkable for grammar but few of a more ingenious turn and none that could be more to the point in our connection  the tenacity of many ordinary people in ordinary pursuits is a sort of standing challenge to everybody else  if one man can grow absorbed in delving his garden others may grow absorbed and happy over something else  not to be upsides in this with any groom or gardener is to be very meanly organised  a man should be ashamed to take his food if he has not alchemy enough in his stomach to turn some of it into intense and enjoyable occupation  whitman tries to reinforce this cheerfulness by keeping up a sort of outdoor atmosphere of sentiment  his book he tells us should be read among the cooling influences of external nature and this recommendation like that other famous one which hawthorne prefixed to his collected tales is in itself a character of the work  every one who has been upon a walking or a boating tour living in the open air with the body in constant exercise and the mind in fallow knows true ease and quiet  the irritating action of the brain is set at rest we think in a plain unfeverish temper little things seem big enough and great things no longer portentous and the world is smilingly accepted as it is  this is the spirit that whitman inculcates and parades  he thinks very ill of the atmosphere of parlours or libraries  wisdom keeps school outdoors  and he has the art to recommend this attitude of mind by simply pluming himself upon it as a virtue so that the reader to keep the advantage over his author which most readers enjoy is tricked into professing the same view  and this spirit as it is his chief lesson is the greatest charm of his work  thence in spite of an uneven and emphatic key of expression something trenchant and straightforward something simple and surprising distinguishes his poems  he has sayings that come home to one like the bible  we fall upon whitman after the works of so many men who write better with a sense of relief from strain with a sense of touching nature as when one passes out of the flaring noisy thoroughfares of a great city into what he himself has called with unexcelled imaginative justice of language the huge and thoughtful night  and his book in consequence whatever may be the final judgment of its merit whatever may be its influence on the future should be in the hands of all parents and guardians as a specific for the distressing malady of being seventeen years old  greensickness yields to his treatment as to a charm of magic and the youth after a short course of reading ceases to carry the universe upon his shoulders   iii   whitman is not one of those who can be deceived by familiarity  he considers it just as wonderful that there are myriads of stars as that one man should rise from the dead  he declares a hair on the back of his hand just as curious as any special revelation  his whole life is to him what it was to sir thomas browne one perpetual miracle everything is strange everything unaccountable everything beautiful from a bug to the moon from the sight of the eyes to the appetite for food  he makes it his business to see things as if he saw them for the first time and professes astonishment on principle  but he has no leaning towards mythology avows his contempt for what he calls unregenerate poetry and does not mean by nature   the smooth walks trimmed hedges butterflies posies and nightingales of the english poets but the whole orb with its geologic history the kosmos carrying fire and snow that rolls through the illimitable areas light as a feather though weighing billions of tons   nor is this exhaustive for in his character of idealist all impressions all thoughts trees and people love and faith astronomy history and religion enter upon equal terms into his notion of the universe  he is not against religion not indeed against any religion  he wishes to drag with a larger net to make a more comprehensive synthesis than any or than all of them put together  in feeling after the central type of man he must embrace all eccentricities his cosmology must subsume all cosmologies and the feelings that gave birth to them his statement of facts must include all religion and all irreligion christ and boodha god and the devil  the world as it is and the whole world as it is physical and spiritual and historical with its good and bad with its manifold inconsistencies is what he wishes to set forth in strong picturesque and popular lineaments for the understanding of the average man  one of his favourite endeavours is to get the whole matter into a nutshell to knock the four corners of the universe one after another about his readers ears to hurry him in breathless phrases hither and thither back and forward in time and space to focus all this about his own momentary personality and then drawing the ground from under his feet as if by some cataclysm of nature to plunge him into the unfathomable abyss sown with enormous suns and systems and among the inconceivable numbers and magnitudes and velocities of the heavenly bodies  so that he concludes by striking into us some sense of that disproportion of things which shelley has illuminated by the ironical flash of these eight words the desire of the moth for the star  the same truth but to what a different purpose  whitmans moth is mightily at his ease about all the planets in heaven and cannot think too highly of our sublunary tapers  the universe is so large that imagination flags in the effort to conceive it but here in the meantime is the world under our feet a very warm and habitable corner the earth that is sufficient i do not want the constellations any nearer he remarks  and again let your soul stand cool and composed says he before a million universes  it is the language of a transcendental common sense such as thoreau held and sometimes uttered  but whitman who has a somewhat vulgar inclination for technical talk and the jargon of philosophy is not content with a few pregnant hints he must put the dots upon his is he must corroborate the songs of apollo by some of the darkest talk of human metaphysic  he tells his disciples that they must be ready to confront the growing arrogance of realism  each person is for himself the keystone and the occasion of this universal edifice nothing not god he says is greater to one than oneself is a statement with an irreligious smack at the first sight but like most startling sayings a manifest truism on a second  he will give effect to his own character without apology he sees that the elementary laws never apologise i reckon he adds with quaint colloquial arrogance i reckon i behave no prouder than the level i plant my house by after all  the level follows the law of its being so unrelentingly will he everything every person is good in his own place and way god is the maker of all and all are in one design  for he believes in god and that with a sort of blasphemous security  no array of terms quoth he no array of terms can say how much at peace i am about god and about death  there certainly never was a prophet who carried things with a higher hand he gives us less a body of dogmas than a series of proclamations by the grace of god and language you will observe positively fails him to express how far he stands above the highest human doubts and trepidations  but next in order of truths to a persons sublime conviction of himself comes the attraction of one person for another and all that we mean by the word love   the dear love of man for his comrade  the attraction of friend for friend of the wellmarried husband and wife of children and parents of city for city and land for land   the solitude of the most sublime idealist is broken in upon by other peoples faces he sees a look in their eyes that corresponds to something in his own heart there comes a tone in their voices which convicts him of a startling weakness for his fellowcreatures  while he is hymning the ego and commencing with god and the universe a woman goes below his window and at the turn of her skirt or the colour of her eyes icarus is recalled from heaven by the run  love is so startlingly real that it takes rank upon an equal footing of reality with the consciousness of personal existence  we are as heartily persuaded of the identity of those we love as of our own identity  and so sympathy pairs with selfassertion the two gerents of human life on earth and whitmans ideal man must not only be strong free and selfreliant in himself but his freedom must be bounded and his strength perfected by the most intimate eager and longsuffering love for others  to some extent this is taking away with the left hand what has been so generously given with the right morality has been ceremoniously extruded from the door only to be brought in again by the window  we are told on one page to do as we please and on the next we are sharply upbraided for not having done as the author pleases  we are first assured that we are the finest fellows in the world in our own right and then it appears that we are only fine fellows in so far as we practise a most quixotic code of morals  the disciple who saw himself in clear ether a moment before is plunged down again among the fogs and complications of duty  and this is all the more overwhelming because whitman insists not only on love between sex and sex and between friends of the same sex but in the field of the less intense political sympathies and his ideal man must not only be a generous friend but a conscientious voter into the bargain  his method somewhat lessens the difficulty  he is not the reader will remember to tell us how good we ought to be but to remind us how good we are  he is to encourage us to be free and kind by proving that we are free and kind already he passes our corporate life under review to show that it is upheld by the very virtues of which he makes himself the advocate  there is no object so soft he says somewhere in his big plain way there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeld universe  rightly understood it is on the softest of all objects the sympathetic heart that the wheel of society turns easily and securely as on a perfect axle  there is no room of course for doubt or discussion about conduct where every one is to follow the law of his being with exact compliance  whitman hates doubt deprecates discussion and discourages to his utmost the craving carping sensibilities of the conscience  we are to imitate to use one of his absurd and happy phrases the satisfaction and aplomb of animals  if he preaches a sort of ranting christianity in morals a fit consequent to the ranting optimism of his cosmology it is because he declares it to be the original deliverance of the human heart or at least for he would be honestly historical in method of the human heart as at present christianised  his is a morality without a prohibition his policy is one of encouragement all round  a man must be a born hero to come up to whitmans standard in the practice of any of the positive virtues but of a negative virtue such as temperance or chastity he has so little to say that the reader need not be surprised if he drops a word or two upon the other side  he would lay down nothing that would be a clog he would prescribe nothing that cannot be done ruddily in a heat  the great point is to get people under way  to the faithful whitmanite this would be justified by the belief that god made all and that all was good the prophet in this doctrine has only to cry tally ho and mankind will break into a gallop on the road to el dorado  perhaps to another class of minds it may look like the result of the somewhat cynical reflection that you will not make a kind man out of one who is unkind by any precepts under heaven tempered by the belief that in natural circumstances the large majority is well disposed  thence it would follow that if you can only get every one to feel more warmly and act more courageously the balance of results will be for good  so far you see the doctrine is pretty coherent as a doctrine as a picture of mans life it is incomplete and misleading although eminently cheerful  this he is himself the first to acknowledge for if he is prophetic in anything it is in his noble disregard of consistency  do i contradict myself he asks somewhere and then pat comes the answer the best answer ever given in print worthy of a sage or rather of a woman very well then i contradict myself with this addition not so feminine and perhaps not altogether so satisfactory i am large  i contain multitudes  life as a matter of fact partakes largely of the nature of tragedy  the gospel according to whitman even if it be not so logical has this advantage over the gospel according to pangloss that it does not utterly disregard the existence of temporal evil  whitman accepts the fact of disease and wretchedness like an honest man and instead of trying to qualify it in the interest of his optimism sets himself to spur people up to be helpful  he expresses a conviction indeed that all will be made up to the victims in the end that what is untried and afterward will fail no one not even the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it with bitterness worse than gall  but this is not to palliate our sense of what is hard or melancholy in the present  pangloss smarting under one of the worst things that ever was supposed to come from america consoled himself with the reflection that it was the price we have to pay for cochineal  and with that murderous parody logical optimism and the praises of the best of possible words went irrevocably out of season and have been no more heard of in the mouths of reasonable men  whitman spares us all allusions to the cochineal he treats evil and sorrow in a spirit almost as of welcome as an old seadog might have welcomed the sight of the enemys topsails off the spanish main  there at least he seems to say is something obvious to be done  i do not know many better things in literature than the brief pictures  brief and vivid like things seen by lightning  with which he tries to stir up the worlds heart upon the side of mercy  he braces us on the one hand with examples of heroic duty and helpfulness on the other he touches us with pitiful instances of people needing help he knows how to make the heart beat at a brave story to inflame us with just resentment over the hunted slave to stop our mouths for shame when he tells of the drunken prostitute  for all the afflicted all the weak all the wicked a good word is said in a spirit which i can only call one of ultrachristianity and however wild however contradictory it may be in parts this at least may be said for his book as it may be said of the christian gospels that no one will read it however respectable but he gets a knock upon his conscience no one however fallen but he finds a kindly and supporting welcome   iv   nor has he been content with merely blowing the trumpet for the battle of welldoing he has given to his precepts the authority of his own brave example  naturally a grave believing man with little or no sense of humour he has succeeded as well in life as in his printed performances the spirit that was in him has come forth most eloquently in his actions  many who have only read his poetry have been tempted to set him down as an ass or even as a charlatan but i never met any one who had known him personally who did not profess a solid affection and respect for the mans character  he practises as he professes he feels deeply that christian love for all men that toleration that cheerful delight in serving others which he often celebrates in literature with a doubtful measure of success  and perhaps out of all his writings the best and the most human and convincing passages are to be found in these soild and creasd little livraisons each composed of a sheet or two of paper folded small to carry in the pocket and fastened with a pin which he scribbled during the war by the bedsides of the wounded or in the excitement of great events  they are hardly literature in the formal meaning of the word he has left his jottings for the most part as he made them a homely detail a word from the lips of a dying soldier a business memorandum the copy of a lettershort straightforward to the point with none of the trappings of composition but they breathe a profound sentiment they give us a vivid look at one of the sides of life and they make us acquainted with a man whom it is an honour to love  whitmans intense americanism his unlimited belief in the future of these states as with reverential capitals he loves to call them made the war a period of great trial to his soul  the new virtue unionism of which he is the sole inventor seemed to have fallen into premature unpopularity all that he loved hoped or hated hung in the balance  and the game of war was not only momentous to him in its issues it sublimated his spirit by its heroic displays and tortured him intimately by the spectacle of its horrors  it was a theatre it was a place of education it was like a season of religious revival  he watched lincoln going daily to his work he studied and fraternised with young soldiery passing to the front above all he walked the hospitals reading the bible distributing clean clothes or apples or tobacco a patient helpful reverend man full of kind speeches  his memoranda of this period are almost bewildering to read from one point of view they seem those of a district visitor from another they look like the formless jottings of an artist in the picturesque  more than one woman on whom i tried the experiment immediately claimed the writer for a fellowwoman  more than one literary purist might identify him as a shoddy newspaper correspondent without the necessary faculty of style  and yet the story touches home and if you are of the weeping order of mankind you will certainly find your eyes fill with tears of which you have no reason to be ashamed  there is only one way to characterise a work of this order and that is to quote  here is a passage from a letter to a mother unknown to whitman whose son died in hospital   frank as far as i saw had everything requisite in surgical treatment nursing etc  he had watches much of the time he was so good and wellbehaved and affectionate i myself liked him very much  i was in the habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by him and he liked to have me  liked to put out his arm and lay his hand on my knee  would keep it so a long while  toward the last he was more restless and flighty at night  often fancied himself with his regiment  by his talk sometimes seemd as if his feelings were hurt by being blamed by his officers for something he was entirely innocent of  said i never in my life was thought capable of such a thing and never was  at other times he would fancy himself talking as it seemd to children or such like his relatives i suppose and giving them good advice would talk to them a long while  all the time he was out of his head not one single bad word or thought or idea escaped him  it was remarkd that many a mans conversation in his senses was not half so good as franks delirium  he was perfectly willing to die  he had become very weak and had sufferd a good deal and was perfectly resignd poor boy  i do not know his past life but i feel as if it must have been good  at any rate what i saw of him here under the most trying circumstances with a painful wound and among strangers i can say that he behaved so brave so composed and so sweet and affectionate it could not be surpassed  and now like many other noble and good men after serving his country as a soldier he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service  such things are gloomy  yet there is a text god doeth all things well the meaning of which after due time appears to the soul  i thought perhaps a few words though from a stranger about your son from one who was with him at the last might be worth while for i loved the young man though i but saw him immediately to lose him   it is easy enough to pick holes in the grammar of this letter but what are we to say of its profound goodness and tenderness  it is written as though he had the mothers face before his eyes and saw her wincing in the flesh at every word  and what again are we to say of its sober truthfulness not exaggerating not running to phrases not seeking to make a hero out of what was only an ordinary but good and brave young man  literary reticence is not whitmans stronghold and this reticence is not literary but humane it is not that of a good artist but that of a good man  he knew that what the mother wished to hear about was frank and he told her about her frank as he was   v   something should be said of whitmans style for style is of the essence of thinking  and where a man is so critically deliberate as our author and goes solemnly about his poetry for an ulterior end every indication is worth notice  he has chosen a rough unrhymed lyrical verse sometimes instinct with a fine processional movement often so rugged and careless that it can only be described by saying that he has not taken the trouble to write prose  i believe myself that it was selected principally because it was easy to write although not without recollections of the marching measures of some of the prose in our english old testament according to whitman on the other hand the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry    for the most cogent purposes of those great inland states and for texas and california and oregon  a statement which is among the happiest achievements of american humour  he calls his verses recitatives in easily followed allusion to a musical form easilywritten loosefingered chords he cries i feel the thrum of your climax and close  too often i fear he is the only one who can perceive the rhythm and in spite of mr swinburne a great part of his work considered as verses is poor bald stuff  considered not as verse but as speech a great part of it is full of strange and admirable merits the right detail is seized the right word bold and trenchant is thrust into its place  whitman has small regard to literary decencies and is totally free from literary timidities  he is neither afraid of being slangy nor of being dull nor let me add of being ridiculous  the result is a most surprising compound of plain grandeur sentimental affectation and downright nonsense  it would be useless to follow his detractors and give instances of how bad he can be at his worst and perhaps it would be not much wiser to give extracted specimens of how happily he can write when he is at his best  these come in to most advantage in their own place owing something it may be to the offset of their curious surroundings  and one thing is certain that no one can appreciate whitmans excellences until he has grown accustomed to his faults  until you are content to pick poetry out of his pages almost as you must pick it out of a greek play in bohns translation your gravity will be continually upset your ears perpetually disappointed and the whole book will be no more to you than a particularly flagrant production by the poet close  a writer of this uncertain quality was perhaps unfortunate in taking for thesis the beauty of the world as it now is not only on the hilltops but in the factory not only by the harbour full of stately ships but in the magazine of the hopelessly prosaic hatter  to show beauty in common things is the work of the rarest tact  it is not to be done by the wishing  it is easy to posit as a theory but to bring it home to mens minds is the problem of literature and is only accomplished by rare talent and in comparatively rare instances  to bid the whole world stand and deliver with a dogma in ones right hand by way of pistol to cover reams of paper in a galloping headstrong vein to cry louder and louder over everything as it comes up and make no distinction in ones enthusiasm over the most incomparable matters to prove ones entire want of sympathy for the jaded literary palate by calling not a spade a spade but a hatter a hatter in a lyrical apostrophe  this in spite of all the airs of inspiration is not the way to do it  it may be very wrong and very wounding to a respectable branch of industry but the word hatter cannot be used seriously in emotional verse not to understand this is to have no literary tact and i would for his own sake that this were the only inadmissible expression with which whitman had bedecked his pages  the book teems with similar comicalities and to a reader who is determined to take it from that side only presents a perfect carnival of fun  a good deal of this is the result of theory playing its usual vile trick upon the artist  it is because he is a democrat that whitman must have in the hatter  if you may say admiral he reasons why may you not say hatter  one man is as good as another and it is the business of the great poet to show poetry in the life of the one as well as the other  a most incontrovertible sentiment surely and one which nobody would think of controverting where  and here is the point  where any beauty has been shown  but how where that is not the case where the hatter is simply introduced as god made him and as his fellowmen have miscalled him at the crisis of a highflown rhapsody  and what are we to say where a man of whitmans notable capacity for putting things in a bright picturesque and novel way simply gives up the attempt and indulges with apparent exultation in an inventory of trades or implements with no more colour or coherence than so many indexwords out of a dictionary  i do not know that we can say anything but that it is a prodigiously amusing exhibition for a line or so the worst of it is that whitman must have known better  the man is a great critic and so far as i can make out a good one and how much criticism does it require to know that capitulation is not description or that fingering on a dumb keyboard with whatever show of sentiment and execution is not at all the same thing as discoursing music  i wish i could believe he was quite honest with us but indeed who was ever quite honest who wrote a book for a purpose  it is a flight beyond the reach of human magnanimity  one other point where his means failed him must be touched upon however shortly  in his desire to accept all facts loyally and simply it fell within his programme to speak at some length and with some plainness on what is for i really do not know what reason the most delicate of subjects seeing in that one of the most serious and interesting parts of life he was aggrieved that it should be looked upon as ridiculous or shameful  no one speaks of maternity with his tongue in his cheek and whitman made a bold push to set the sanctity of fatherhood beside the sanctity of motherhood and introduce this also among the things that can be spoken of without either a blush or a wink  but the philistines have been too strong and to say truth whitman has rather played the fool  we may be thoroughly conscious that his end is improving that it would be a good thing if a window were opened on these close privacies of life that on this subject as on all others he now and then lets fall a pregnant saying  but we are not satisfied  we feel that he was not the man for so difficult an enterprise  he loses our sympathy in the character of a poet by attracting too much of our attention in that of a bull in a china shop  and where by a little more art we might have been solemnised ourselves it is too often whitman alone who is solemn in the face of an audience somewhat indecorously amused   vi   lastly as most important after all to human beings in our disputable state what is that higher prudence which was to be the aim and issue of these deliberate productions  whitman is too clever to slip into a succinct formula  if he could have adequately said his say in a single proverb it is to be presumed he would not have put himself to the trouble of writing several volumes  it was his programme to state as much as he could of the world with all its contradictions and leave the upshot with god who planned it  what he has made of the world and the worlds meanings is to be found at large in his poems  these altogether give his answers to the problems of belief and conduct in many ways righteous and highspirited in some ways loose and contradictory  and yet there are two passages from the preface to the leaves of grass which do pretty well condense his teaching on all essential points and yet preserve a measure of his spirit   this is what you shall do he says in the one love the earth and sun and animals despise riches give alms to every one that asks stand up for the stupid and crazy devote your income and labour to others hate tyrants argue not concerning god have patience and indulgence towards the people take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and mothers of families read these leaves his own works in the open air every season of every year of your life reexamine all you have been told at school or church or in any book and dismiss whatever insults your own soul  the prudence of the greatest poet he adds in the other  and the greatest poet is of course himself  knows that the young man who composedly perilled his life and lost it has done exceeding well for himself while the man who has not perilled his life and retains it to old age in riches and ease has perhaps achieved nothing for himself worth mentioning and that only that person has no great prudence to learn who has learnt to prefer real longlived things and favours body and soul the same and perceives the indirect surely following the direct and what evil or good he does leaping onward and waiting to meet him again and who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor avoids death   there is much that is christian in these extracts startlingly christian  any reader who bears in mind whitmans own advice and dismisses whatever insults his own soul will find plenty that is bracing brightening and chastening to reward him for a little patience at first  it seems hardly possible that any being should get evil from so healthy a book as the leaves of grass which is simply comical wherever it falls short of nobility but if there be any such who cannot both take and leave who cannot let a single opportunity pass by without some unworthy and unmanly thought i should have as great difficulty and neither more nor less in recommending the works of whitman as in lending them shakespeare or letting them go abroad outside of the grounds of a private asylum    chapter iv  henry david thoreau his character and opinions    i   thoreaus thin penetrating bignosed face even in a bad woodcut conveys some hint of the limitations of his mind and character  with his almost acid sharpness of insight with his almost animal dexterity in act there went none of that large unconscious geniality of the worlds heroes  he was not easy not ample not urbane not even kind his enjoyment was hardly smiling or the smile was not broad enough to be convincing he had no waste lands nor kitchenmidden in his nature but was all improved and sharpened to a point  he was bred to no profession says emerson he never married he lived alone he never went to church he never voted he refused to pay a tax to the state he ate no flesh he drank no wine he never knew the use of tobacco and though a naturalist he used neither trap nor gun  when asked at dinner what dish he preferred he answered the nearest so many negative superiorities begin to smack a little of the prig  from his later works he was in the habit of cutting out the humorous passages under the impression that they were beneath the dignity of his moral muse and there we see the prig stand public and confessed  it was much easier says emerson acutely much easier for thoreau to say no than yes and that is a characteristic which depicts the man  it is a useful accomplishment to be able to say no but surely it is the essence of amiability to prefer to say yes where it is possible  there is something wanting in the man who does not hate himself whenever he is constrained to say no  and there was a great deal wanting in this born dissenter  he was almost shockingly devoid of weaknesses he had not enough of them to be truly polar with humanity whether you call him demigod or demiman he was at least not altogether one of us for he was not touched with a feeling of our infirmities the worlds heroes have room for all positive qualities even those which are disreputable in the capacious theatre of their dispositions  such can live many lives while a thoreau can live but one and that only with perpetual foresight  he was no ascetic rather an epicurean of the nobler sort and he had this one great merit that he succeeded so far as to be happy  i love my fate to the core and rind he wrote once and even while he lay dying here is what he dictated for it seems he was already too feeble to control the pen you ask particularly after my health  i suppose that i have not many months to live but of course know nothing about it i may say that i am enjoying existence as much as ever and regret nothing  it is not given to all to bear so clear a testimony to the sweetness of their fate nor to any without courage and wisdom for this world in itself is but a painful and uneasy place of residence and lasting happiness at least to the selfconscious comes only from within  now thoreaus content and ecstasy in living was we may say like a plant that he had watered and tended with womanish solicitude for there is apt to be something unmanly something almost dastardly in a life that does not move with dash and freedom and that fears the bracing contact of the world  in one word thoreau was a skulker  he did not wish virtue to go out of him among his fellowmen but slunk into a corner to hoard it for himself  he left all for the sake of certain virtuous selfindulgences  it is true that his tastes were noble that his ruling passion was to keep himself unspotted from the world and that his luxuries were all of the same healthy order as cold tubs and early rising but a man may be both coldly cruel in the pursuit of goodness and morbid even in the pursuit of health  i cannot lay my hands on the passage in which he explains his abstinence from tea and coffee but i am sure i have the meaning correctly  it is this he thought it bad economy and worthy of no true virtuoso to spoil the natural rapture of the morning with such muddy stimulants let him but see the sun rise and he was already sufficiently inspirited for the labours of the day  that may be reason good enough to abstain from tea but when we go on to find the same man on the same or similar grounds abstain from nearly everything that his neighbours innocently and pleasurably use and from the rubs and trials of human society itself into the bargain we recognise that valetudinarian healthfulness which is more delicate than sickness itself  we need have no respect for a state of artificial training  true health is to be able to do without it  shakespeare we can imagine might begin the day upon a quart of ale and yet enjoy the sunrise to the full as much as thoreau and commemorate his enjoyment in vastly better verses  a man who must separate himself from his neighbours habits in order to be happy is in much the same case with one who requires to take opium for the same purpose  what we want to see is one who can breast into the world do a mans work and still preserve his first and pure enjoyment of existence  thoreaus faculties were of a piece with his moral shyness for they were all delicacies  he could guide himself about the woods on the darkest night by the touch of his feet  he could pick up at once an exact dozen of pencils by the feeling pace distances with accuracy and gauge cubic contents by the eye  his smell was so dainty that he could perceive the foetor of dwellinghouses as he passed them by at night his palate so unsophisticated that like a child he disliked the taste of wine  or perhaps living in america had never tasted any that was good and his knowledge of nature was so complete and curious that he could have told the time of year within a day or so by the aspect of the plants  in his dealings with animals he was the original of hawthornes donatello he pulled the woodchuck out of its hole by the tail the hunted fox came to him for protection wild squirrels have been seen to nestle in his waistcoat he would thrust his arm into a pool and bring forth a bright panting fish lying undismayed in the palm of his hand  there were few things that he could not do  he could make a house a boat a pencil or a book  he was a surveyor a scholar a natural historian  he could run walk climb skate swim and manage a boat  the smallest occasion served to display his physical accomplishment and a manufacturer from merely observing his dexterity with the window of a railway carriage offered him a situation on the spot  the only fruit of much living he observes is the ability to do some slight thing better  but such was the exactitude of his senses so alive was he in every fibre that it seems as if the maxim should be changed in his case for he could do most things with unusual perfection  and perhaps he had an approving eye to himself when he wrote though the youth at last grows indifferent the laws of the universe are not indifferent but are for ever on the side of the most sensitive   ii   thoreau had decided it would seem from the very first to lead a life of selfimprovement the needle did not tremble as with richer natures but pointed steadily north and as he saw duty and inclination in one he turned all his strength in that direction  he was met upon the threshold by a common difficulty  in this world in spite of its many agreeable features even the most sensitive must undergo some drudgery to live  it is not possible to devote your time to study and meditation without what are quaintly but happily denominated private means these absent a man must contrive to earn his bread by some service to the public such as the public cares to pay him for or as thoreau loved to put it apollo must serve admetus  this was to thoreau even a sourer necessity than it is to most there was a love of freedom a strain of the wild man in his nature that rebelled with violence against the yoke of custom and he was so eager to cultivate himself and to be happy in his own society that he could consent with difficulty even to the interruptions of friendship  such are my engagements to myself that i dare not promise he once wrote in answer to an invitation and the italics are his own  marcus aurelius found time to study virtue and between whiles to conduct the imperial affairs of rome but thoreau is so busy improving himself that he must think twice about a morning call  and now imagine him condemned for eight hours a day to some uncongenial and unmeaning business  he shrank from the very look of the mechanical in life all should if possible be sweetly spontaneous and swimmingly progressive  thus he learned to make leadpencils and when he had gained the best certificate and his friends began to congratulate him on his establishment in life calmly announced that he should never make another  why should i said he i would not do again what i have done once  for when a thing has once been done as well as it wants to be it is of no further interest to the selfimprover  yet in after years and when it became needful to support his family he returned patiently to this mechanical art  a step more than worthy of himself  the pencils seem to have been apollos first experiment in the service of admetus but others followed  i have thoroughly tried schoolkeeping he writes and found that my expenses were in proportion or rather out of proportion to my income for i was obliged to dress and train not to say think and believe accordingly and i lost my time into the bargain  as i did not teach for the benefit of my fellowmen but simply for a livelihood this was a failure i have tried trade but i found that it would take ten years to get under way in that and that then i should probably be on my way to the devil  nothing indeed can surpass his scorn for all socalled business  upon that subject gall squirts from him at a touch  the whole enterprise of this nation is not illustrated by a thought he writes it is not warmed by a sentiment there is nothing in it for which a man should lay down his life nor even his gloves  and again if our merchants did not most of them fail and the banks too my faith in the old laws of this world would be staggered  the statement that ninetysix in a hundred doing such business surely break down is perhaps the sweetest fact that statistics have revealed  the wish was probably father to the figures but there is something enlivening in a hatred of so genuine a brand hot as corsican revenge and sneering like voltaire  pencils schoolkeeping and trade being thus discarded one after another thoreau with a stroke of strategy turned the position  he saw his way to get his board and lodging for practically nothing and admetus never got less work out of any servant since the world began  it was his ambition to be an oriental philosopher but he was always a very yankee sort of oriental  even in the peculiar attitude in which he stood to money his system of personal economics as we may call it he displayed a vast amount of truly downeast calculation and he adopted poverty like a piece of business yet his system is based on one or two ideas which i believe come naturally to all thoughtful youths and are only pounded out of them by city uncles  indeed something essentially youthful distinguishes all thoreaus knockdown blows at current opinion  like the posers of a child they leave the orthodox in a kind of speechless agony  these know the thing is nonsense  they are sure there must be an answer yet somehow cannot find it  so it is with his system of economy he cuts through the subject on so new a plane that the accepted arguments apply no longer he attacks it in a new dialect where there are no catchwords ready made for the defender after you have been boxing for years on a polite gladiatorial convention here is an assailant who does not scruple to hit below the belt  the cost of a thing says he is the amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run  i have been accustomed to put it to myself perhaps more clearly that the price we have to pay for money is paid in liberty  between these two ways of it at least the reader will probably not fail to find a third definition of his own and it follows on one or other that a man may pay too dearly for his livelihood by giving in thoreaus terms his whole life for it or in mine bartering for it the whole of his available liberty and becoming a slave till death  there are two questions to be considered  the quality of what we buy and the price we have to pay for it  do you want a thousand a year a two thousand a year or a ten thousand a year livelihood and can you afford the one you want  it is a matter of taste it is not in the least degree a question of duty though commonly supposed so  but there is no authority for that view anywhere  it is nowhere in the bible  it is true that we might do a vast amount of good if we were wealthy but it is also highly improbable not many do and the art of growing rich is not only quite distinct from that of doing good but the practice of the one does not at all train a man for practising the other  money might be of great service to me writes thoreau but the difficulty now is that i do not improve my opportunities and therefore i am not prepared to have my opportunities increased  it is a mere illusion that above a certain income the personal desires will be satisfied and leave a wider margin for the generous impulse it is as difficult to be generous or anything else except perhaps a member of parliament on thirty thousand as on two hundred a year  now thoreaus tastes were well defined  he loved to be free to be master of his times and seasons to indulge the mind rather than the body he preferred long rambles to rich dinners his own reflections to the consideration of society and an easy calm unfettered active life among green trees to dull toiling at the counter of a bank  and such being his inclination he determined to gratify it  a poor man must save off something he determined to save off his livelihood when a man has attained those things which are necessary to life he writes there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities he may adventure on life now his vacation from humbler toil having commenced  thoreau would get shelter some kind of covering for his body and necessary daily bread even these he should get as cheaply as possible and then his vacation from humbler toil having commenced devote himself to oriental philosophers the study of nature and the work of selfimprovement  prudence which bids us all go to the ant for wisdom and hoard against the day of sickness was not a favourite with thoreau  he preferred that other whose name is so much misappropriated faith  when he had secured the necessaries of the moment he would not reckon up possible accidents or torment himself with trouble for the future  he had no toleration for the man who ventures to live only by the aid of the mutual insurance company which has promised to bury him decently  he would trust himself a little to the world we may safely trust a good deal more than we do says he how much is not done by us or what if we had been taken sick  and then with a stab of satire he describes contemporary mankind in a phrase all the day long on the alert at night we unwillingly say our prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties  it is not likely that the public will be much affected by thoreau when they blink the direct injunctions of the religion they profess and yet whether we will or no we make the same hazardous ventures we back our own health and the honesty of our neighbours for all that we are worth and it is chilling to think how many must lose their wager  in 1845 twentyeight years old an age by which the liveliest have usually declined into some conformity with the world thoreau with a capital of something less than five pounds and a borrowed axe walked forth into the woods by walden pond and began his new experiment in life  he built himself a dwelling and returned the axe he says with characteristic and workmanlike pride sharper than when he borrowed it he reclaimed a patch where he cultivated beans peas potatoes and sweet corn he had his bread to bake his farm to dig and for the matter of six weeks in the summer he worked at surveying carpentry or some other of his numerous dexterities for hire  for more than five years this was all that he required to do for his support and he had the winter and most of the summer at his entire disposal  for six weeks of occupation a little cooking and a little gentle hygienic gardening the man you may say had as good as stolen his livelihood  or we must rather allow that he had done far better for the thief himself is continually and busily occupied and even one born to inherit a million will have more calls upon his time than thoreau  well might he say what old people tell you you cannot do you try and find you can  and how surprising is his conclusion i am convinced that to maintain oneself on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime if we will live simply and wisely as the pursuits of simpler nations are still the sports of the more artificial  when he had enough of that kind of life he showed the same simplicity in giving it up as in beginning it  there are some who could have done the one but vanity forbidding not the other and that is perhaps the story of the hermits but thoreau made no fetish of his own example and did what he wanted squarely  and five years is long enough for an experiment and to prove the success of transcendental yankeeism  it is not his frugality which is worthy of note for to begin with that was inborn and therefore inimitable by others who are differently constituted and again it was no new thing but has often been equalled by poor scotch students at the universities  the point is the sanity of his view of life and the insight with which he recognised the position of money and thought out for himself the problem of riches and a livelihood  apart from his eccentricities he had perceived and was acting on a truth of universal application  for money enters in two different characters into the scheme of life  a certain amount varying with the number and empire of our desires is a true necessary to each one of us in the present order of society but beyond that amount money is a commodity to be bought or not to be bought a luxury in which we may either indulge or stint ourselves like any other  and there are many luxuries that we may legitimately prefer to it such as a grateful conscience a country life or the woman of our inclination trite flat and obvious as this conclusion may appear we have only to look round us in society to see how scantily it has been recognised and perhaps even ourselves after a little reflection may decide to spend a trifle less for money and indulge ourselves a trifle more in the article of freedom   iii   to have done anything by which you earned money merely says thoreau is to be have been he means idle and worse  there are two passages in his letters both oddly enough relating to firewood which must be brought together to be rightly understood  so taken they contain between them the marrow of all good sense on the subject of work in its relation to something broader than mere livelihood  here is the first i suppose i have burned up a goodsized tree tonight  and for what  i settled with mr tarbell for it the other day but that wasnt the final settlement  i got off cheaply from him  at last one will say let us see how much wood did you burn sir  and i shall shudder to think that the next question will be what did you do while you were warm  even after we have settled with admetus in the person of mr tarbell there comes you see a further question  it is not enough to have earned our livelihood either the earning itself should have been serviceable to mankind or something else must follow  to live is sometimes very difficult but it is never meritorious in itself and we must have a reason to allege to our own conscience why we should continue to exist upon this crowded earth  if thoreau had simply dwelt in his house at walden a lover of trees birds and fishes and the open air and virtue a reader of wise books an idle selfish selfimprover he would have managed to cheat admetus but to cling to metaphor the devil would have had him in the end  those who can avoid toil altogether and dwell in the arcadia of private means and even those who can by abstinence reduce the necessary amount of it to some six weeks a year having the more liberty have only the higher moral obligation to be up and doing in the interest of man  the second passage is this there is a far more important and warming heat commonly lost which precedes the burning of the wood  it is the smoke of industry which is incense i had been so thoroughly warmed in body and spirit that when at length my fuel was housed i came near selling it to the ashman as if i had extracted all its heat  industry is in itself and when properly chosen delightful and profitable to the worker and when your toil has been a pleasure you have not as thoreau says earned money merely but money health delight and moral profit all in one  we must heap up a great pile of doing for a small diameter of being he says in another place and then exclaims how admirably the artist is made to accomplish his selfculture by devotion to his art  we may escape uncongenial toil only to devote ourselves to that which is congenial  it is only to transact some higher business that even apollo dare play the truant from admetus  we must all work for the sake of work we must all work as thoreau says again in any absorbing pursuit  it does not much matter what so it be honest but the most profitable work is that which combines into one continued effort the largest proportion of the powers and desires of a mans nature that into which he will plunge with ardour and from which he will desist with reluctance in which he will know the weariness of fatigue but not that of satiety and which will be ever fresh pleasing and stimulating to his taste  such work holds a man together braced at all points it does not suffer him to doze or wander it keeps him actively conscious of himself yet raised among superior interests it gives him the profit of industry with the pleasures of a pastime  this is what his art should be to the true artist and that to a degree unknown in other and less intimate pursuits  for other professions stand apart from the human business of life but an art has its seat at the centre of the artists doings and sufferings deals directly with his experiences teaches him the lessons of his own fortunes and mishaps and becomes a part of his biography  so says goethe   spat erklingt was fruh erklang gluck und ungluck wird gesang   now thoreaus art was literature and it was one of which he had conceived most ambitiously  he loved and believed in good books  he said well life is not habitually seen from any common platform so truly and unexaggerated as in the light of literature  but the literature he loved was of the heroic order  books not which afford us a cowering enjoyment but in which each thought is of unusual daring such as an idle man cannot read and a timid one would not be entertained by which even make us dangerous to existing institutions  such i call good books  he did not think them easy to be read  the heroic books he says even if printed in the character of our mothertongue will always be in a language dead to degenerate times and we must laboriously seek the meaning of each word and line conjecturing a larger sense than common use permits out of what wisdom and valour and generosity we have  nor does he suppose that such books are easily written  great prose of equal elevation commands our respect more than great verse says he since it implies a more permanent and level height a life more pervaded with the grandeur of the thought  the poet often only makes an irruption like the parthian and is off again shooting while he retreats but the prose writer has conquered like a roman and settled colonies  we may ask ourselves almost with dismay whether such works exist at all but in the imagination of the student  for the bulk of the best of books is apt to be made up with ballast and those in which energy of thought is combined with any stateliness of utterance may be almost counted on the fingers  looking round in english for a book that should answer thoreaus two demands of a style like poetry and sense that shall be both original and inspiriting i come to miltons areopagitica and can name no other instance for the moment  two things at least are plain that if a man will condescend to nothing more commonplace in the way of reading he must not look to have a large library and that if he proposes himself to write in a similar vein he will find his work cut out for him  thoreau composed seemingly while he walked or at least exercise and composition were with him intimately connected for we are told that the length of his walk uniformly made the length of his writing  he speaks in one place of plainness and vigour the ornaments of style which is rather too paradoxical to be comprehensively true  in another he remarks as for style of writing if one has anything to say it drops from him simply as a stone falls to the ground  we must conjecture a very large sense indeed for the phrase if one has anything to say  when truth flows from a man fittingly clothed in style and without conscious effort it is because the effort has been made and the work practically completed before he sat down to write it is only out of fulness of thinking that expression drops perfect like a ripe fruit and when thoreau wrote so nonchalantly at his desk it was because he had been vigorously active during his walk  for neither clearness compression nor beauty of language come to any living creature till after a busy and a prolonged acquaintance with the subject on hand  easy writers are those who like walter scott choose to remain contented with a less degree of perfection than is legitimately within the compass of their powers  we hear of shakespeare and his clean manuscript but in face of the evidence of the style itself and of the various editions of hamlet this merely proves that messrs hemming and condell were unacquainted with the common enough phenomenon called a fair copy  he who would recast a tragedy already given to the world must frequently and earnestly have revised details in the study  thoreau himself and in spite of his protestations is an instance of even extreme research in one direction and his effort after heroic utterance is proved not only by the occasional finish but by the determined exaggeration of his style  i trust you realise what an exaggerator i am  that i lay myself out to exaggerate he writes  and again hinting at the explanation who that has heard a strain of music feared lest he should speak extravagantly any more for ever  and yet once more in his essay on carlyle and this time with his meaning well in hand no truth we think was ever expressed but with this sort of emphasis that for the time there seemed to be no other  thus thoreau was an exaggerative and a parabolical writer not because he loved the literature of the east but from a desire that people should understand and realise what he was writing  he was near the truth upon the general question but in his own particular method it appears to me he wandered  literature is not less a conventional art than painting or sculpture and it is the least striking as it is the most comprehensive of the three  to hear a strain of music to see a beautiful woman a river a great city or a starry night is to make a man despair of his lilliputian arts in language  now to gain that emphasis which seems denied to us by the very nature of the medium the proper method of literature is by selection which is a kind of negative exaggeration  it is the right of the literary artist as thoreau was on the point of seeing to leave out whatever does not suit his purpose thus we extract the pure gold and thus the wellwritten story of a noble life becomes by its very omissions more thrilling to the reader  but to go beyond this like thoreau and to exaggerate directly is to leave the saner classical tradition and to put the reader on his guard  and when you write the whole for the half you do not express your thought more forcibly but only express a different thought which is not yours  thoreaus true subject was the pursuit of selfimprovement combined with an unfriendly criticism of life as it goes on in our societies it is there that he best displays the freshness and surprising trenchancy of his intellect it is there that his style becomes plain and vigorous and therefore according to his own formula ornamental  yet he did not care to follow this vein singly but must drop into it by the way in books of a different purport  walden or life in the woods a week on the concord and merrimack rivers the maine woods  such are the titles he affects he was probably reminded by his delicate critical perception that the true business of literature is with narrative in reasoned narrative and there alone that art enjoys all its advantages and suffers least from its defects  dry precept and disembodied disquisition as they can only be read with an effort of abstraction can never convey a perfectly complete or a perfectly natural impression  truth even in literature must be clothed with flesh and blood or it cannot tell its whole story to the reader  hence the effect of anecdote on simple minds and hence good biographies and works of high imaginative art are not only far more entertaining but far more edifying than books of theory or precept  now thoreau could not clothe his opinions in the garment of art for that was not his talent but he sought to gain the same elbowroom for himself and to afford a similar relief to his readers by mingling his thoughts with a record of experience  again he was a lover of nature  the quality which we should call mystery in a painting and which belongs so particularly to the aspect of the external world and to its influence upon our feelings was one which he was never weary of attempting to reproduce in his books  the seeming significance of natures appearances their unchanging strangeness to the senses and the thrilling response which they waken in the mind of man continued to surprise and stimulate his spirits it appeared to him i think that if we could only write near enough to the facts and yet with no pedestrian calm but ardently we might transfer the glamour of reality direct upon our pages and that if it were once thus captured and expressed a new and instructive relation might appear between mens thoughts and the phenomena of nature  this was the eagle that he pursued all his life long like a schoolboy with a butterfly net  hear him to a friend let me suggest a theme for you  to state to yourself precisely and completely what that walk over the mountains amounted to for you returning to this essay again and again until you are satisfied that all that was important in your experience is in it  dont suppose that you can tell it precisely the first dozen times you try but at em again especially when after a sufficient pause you suspect that you are touching the heart or summit of the matter reiterate your blows there and account for the mountain to yourself  not that the story need be long but it will take a long while to make it short  such was the method not consistent for a man whose meanings were to drop from him as a stone falls to the ground  perhaps the most successful work that thoreau ever accomplished in this direction is to be found in the passages relating to fish in the week  these are remarkable for a vivid truth of impression and a happy suitability of language not frequently surpassed  whatever thoreau tried to do was tried in fair square prose with sentences solidly built and no help from bastard rhythms  moreover there is a progression  i cannot call it a progress  in his work towards a more and more strictly prosaic level until at last he sinks into the bathos of the prosy  emerson mentions having once remarked to thoreau who would not like to write something which all can read like robinson crusoe and who does not see with regret that his page is not solid with a right materialistic treatment which delights everybody  i must say in passing that it is not the right materialistic treatment which delights the world in robinson but the romantic and philosophic interest of the fable  the same treatment does quite the reverse of delighting us when it is applied in colonel jack to the management of a plantation  but i cannot help suspecting thoreau to have been influenced either by this identical remark or by some other closely similar in meaning  he began to fall more and more into a detailed materialistic treatment he went into the business doggedly as one who should make a guidebook he not only chronicled what had been important in his own experience but whatever might have been important in the experience of anybody else not only what had affected him but all that he saw or heard  his ardour had grown less or perhaps it was inconsistent with a right materialistic treatment to display such emotions as he felt and to complete the eventful change he chose from a sense of moral dignity to gut these later works of the saving quality of humour  he was not one of those authors who have learned in his own words to leave out their dulness  he inflicts his full quantity upon the reader in such books as cape cod or the yankee in canada  of the latter he confessed that he had not managed to get much of himself into it  heaven knows he had not nor yet much of canada we may hope  nothing he says somewhere can shock a brave man but dulness  well there are few spots more shocking to the brave than the pages of yankee in canada  there are but three books of his that will be read with much pleasure the week walden and the collected letters  as to his poetry emersons word shall suffice for us it is so accurate and so prettily said the thyme and majoram are not yet honey  in this as in his prose he relied greatly on the goodwill of the reader and wrote throughout in faith it was an exercise of faith to suppose that many would understand the sense of his best work or that any could be exhilarated by the dreary chronicling of his worst  but as he says the gods do not hear any rude or discordant sound as we learn from the echo and i know that the nature towards which i launch these sounds is so rich that it will modulate anew and wonderfully improve my rudest strain   iv   what means the fact he cries that a soul which has lost all hope for itself can inspire in another listening soul such an infinite confidence in it even while it is expressing its despair  the question is an echo and an illustration of the words last quoted and it forms the key note of his thoughts on friendship  no one else to my knowledge has spoken in so high and just a spirit of the kindly relations and i doubt whether it be a drawback that these lessons should come from one in many ways so unfitted to be a teacher in this branch  the very coldness and egoism of his own intercourse gave him a clearer insight into the intellectual basis of our warm mutual tolerations and testimony to their worth comes with added force from one who was solitary and obliging and of whom a friend remarked with equal wit and wisdom i love henry but i cannot like him  he can hardly be persuaded to make any distinction between love and friendship in such rarefied and freezing air upon the mountaintops of meditation had he taught himself to breathe  he was indeed too accurate an observer not to have remarked that there exists already a natural disinterestedness and liberality between men and women yet he thought friendship is no respecter of sex  perhaps there is a sense in which the words are true but they were spoken in ignorance and perhaps we shall have put the matter most correctly if we call love a foundation for a nearer and freer degree of friendship than can be possible without it for there are delicacies eternal between persons of the same sex which are melted and disappear in the warmth of love  to both if they are to be right he attributes the same nature and condition  we are not what we are says he nor do we treat or esteem each other for such but for what we are capable of being  a friend is one who incessantly pays us the compliment of expecting all the virtues from us and who can appreciate them in us  the friend asks no return but that his friend will religiously accept and wear and not disgrace his apotheosis of him  it is the merit and preservation of friendship that it takes place on a level higher than the actual characters of the parties would seem to warrant  this is to put friendship on a pedestal indeed and yet the root of the matter is there and the last sentence in particular is like a light in a dark place and makes many mysteries plain  we are different with different friends yet if we look closely we shall find that every such relation reposes on some particular apotheosis of oneself with each friend although we could not distinguish it in words from any other we have at least one special reputation to preserve and it is thus that we run when mortified to our friend or the woman that we love not to hear ourselves called better but to be better men in point of fact  we seek this society to flatter ourselves with our own good conduct  and hence any falsehood in the relation any incomplete or perverted understanding will spoil even the pleasure of these visits  thus says thoreau again only lovers know the value of truth  and yet again they ask for words and deeds when a true relation is word and deed  but it follows that since they are neither of them so good as the other hopes and each is in a very honest manner playing a part above his powers such an intercourse must often be disappointing to both  we may bid farewell sooner than complain says thoreau for our complaint is too well grounded to be uttered  we have not so good a right to hate any as our friend   it were treason to our love and a sin to god above one iota to abate of a pure impartial hate   love is not blind nor yet forgiving  o yes believe me as the song says love has eyes  the nearer the intimacy the more cuttingly do we feel the unworthiness of those we love and because you love one and would die for that love tomorrow you have not forgiven and you never will forgive that friends misconduct  if you want a persons faults go to those who love him  they will not tell you but they know  and herein lies the magnanimous courage of love that it endures this knowledge without change  it required a cold distant personality like that of thoreau perhaps to recognise and certainly to utter this truth for a more human love makes it a point of honour not to acknowledge those faults of which it is most conscious  but his point of view is both high and dry  he has no illusions he does not give way to love any more than to hatred but preserves them both with care like valuable curiosities  a more baldheaded picture of life if i may so express myself has seldom been presented  he is an egoist he does not remember or does not think it worth while to remark that in these near intimacies we are ninetynine times disappointed in our beggarly selves for once that we are disappointed in our friend that it is we who seem most frequently undeserving of the love that unites us and that it is by our friends conduct that we are continually rebuked and yet strengthened for a fresh endeavour  thoreau is dry priggish and selfish  it is profit he is after in these intimacies moral profit certainly but still profit to himself  if you will be the sort of friend i want he remarks naively my education cannot dispense with your society  his education as though a friend were a dictionary  and with all this not one word about pleasure or laughter or kisses or any quality of flesh and blood it was not inappropriate surely that he had such close relations with the fish  we can understand the friend already quoted when he cried as for taking his arm i would as soon think of taking the arm of an elmtree  as a matter of fact he experienced but a broken enjoyment in his intimacies  he says he has been perpetually on the brink of the sort of intercourse he wanted and yet never completely attained it  and what else had he to expect when he would not in a happy phrase of carlyles nestle down into it  truly so it will be always if you only stroll in upon your friends as you might stroll in to see a cricket match and even then not simply for the pleasure of the thing but with some afterthought of selfimprovement as though you had come to the cricket match to bet  it was his theory that people saw each other too frequently so that their curiosity was not properly whetted nor had they anything fresh to communicate but friendship must be something else than a society for mutual improvement  indeed it must only be that by the way and to some extent unconsciously and if thoreau had been a man instead of a manner of elmtree he would have felt that he saw his friends too seldom and have reaped benefits unknown to his philosophy from a more sustained and easy intercourse  we might remind him of his own words about love we should have no reserve we should give the whole of ourselves to that business  but commonly men have not imagination enough to be thus employed about a human being but must be coopering a barrel forsooth  ay or reading oriental philosophers  it is not the nature of the rival occupation it is the fact that you suffer it to be a rival that renders loving intimacy impossible  nothing is given for nothing in this world there can be no true love even on your own side without devotion devotion is the exercise of love by which it grows but if you will give enough of that if you will pay the price in a sufficient amount of what you call life why then indeed whether with wife or comrade you may have months and even years of such easy natural pleasurable and yet improving intercourse as shall make time a moment and kindness a delight  the secret of his retirement lies not in misanthropy of which he had no tincture but part in his engrossing design of selfimprovement and part in the real deficiencies of social intercourse  he was not so much difficult about his fellow human beings as he could not tolerate the terms of their association  he could take to a man for any genuine qualities as we see by his admirable sketch of the canadian woodcutter in walden but he would not consent in his own words to feebly fabulate and paddle in the social slush it seemed to him i think that society is precisely the reverse of friendship in that it takes place on a lower level than the characters of any of the parties would warrant us to expect  the society talk of even the most brilliant man is of greatly less account than what you will get from him in as the french say a little committee  and thoreau wanted geniality he had not enough of the superficial even at command he could not swoop into a parlour and in the naval phrase cut out a human being from that dreary port nor had he inclination for the task  i suspect he loved books and nature as well and near as warmly as he loved his fellowcreatures  a melancholy lean degeneration of the human character  as for the dispute about solitude and society he thus sums up any comparison is impertinent  it is an idling down on the plain at the base of the mountain instead of climbing steadily to its top  of course you will be glad of all the society you can get to go up with  will you go to glory with me is the burden of the song  it is not that we love to be alone but that we love to soar and when we do soar the company grows thinner and thinner till there is none at all it is either the tribune on the plain a sermon on the mount or a very private ecstasy still higher up  use all the society that will abet you  but surely it is no very extravagant opinion that it is better to give than to receive to serve than to use our companions and above all where there is no question of service upon either side that it is good to enjoy their company like a natural man  it is curious and in some ways dispiriting that a writer may be always best corrected out of his own mouth and so to conclude here is another passage from thoreau which seems aimed directly at himself do not be too moral you may cheat yourself out of much life so     all fables indeed have their morals but the innocent enjoy the story   v   the only obligation says he which i have a right to assume is to do at any time what i think right  why should we ever go abroad even across the way to ask a neighbours advice  there is a nearer neighbour within who is incessantly telling us how we should behave  but we wait for the neighbour without to tell us of some false easier way the greater part of what my neighbours call good i believe in my soul to be bad  to be what we are and to become what we are capable of becoming is the only end of life  it is when we fall behind ourselves that we are cursed with duties and the neglect of duties  i love the wild he says not less than the good  and again the life of a good man will hardly improve us more than the life of a freebooter for the inevitable laws appear as plainly in the infringement as in the observance and mark this our lives are sustained by a nearly equal expense of virtue of some kind  even although he were a prig it will be owned he could announce a startling doctrine  as for doing good he writes elsewhere that is one of the professions that are full  moreover i have tried it fairly and strange as it may seem am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution  probably i should not conscientiously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do the good which society demands of me to save the universe from annihilation and i believe that a like but infinitely greater steadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it if you should ever be betrayed into any of these philanthropies do not let your left hand know what your right hand does for it is not worth knowing  elsewhere he returns upon the subject and explains his meaning thus if i ever did a man any good in their sense of course it was something exceptional and insignificant compared with the good or evil i am constantly doing by being what i am  there is a rude nobility like that of a barbarian king in this unshaken confidence in himself and indifference to the wants thoughts or sufferings of others  in his whole works i find no trace of pity  this was partly the result of theory for he held the world too mysterious to be criticised and asks conclusively what right have i to grieve who have not ceased to wonder  but it sprang still more from constitutional indifference and superiority and he grew up healthy composed and unconscious from among lifes horrors like a green baytree from a field of battle  it was from this lack in himself that he failed to do justice to the spirit of christ for while he could glean more meaning from individual precepts than any score of christians yet he conceived life in such a different hope and viewed it with such contrary emotions that the sense and purport of the doctrine as a whole seems to have passed him by or left him unimpressed  he could understand the idealism of the christian view but he was himself so unaffectedly unhuman that he did not recognise the human intention and essence of that teaching  hence he complained that christ did not leave us a rule that was proper and sufficient for this world not having conceived the nature of the rule that was laid down for things of that character that are sufficiently unacceptable become positively nonexistent to the mind  but perhaps we shall best appreciate the defect in thoreau by seeing it supplied in the case of whitman  for the one i feel confident is the disciple of the other it is what thoreau clearly whispered that whitman so uproariously bawls it is the same doctrine but with how immense a difference the same argument but used to what a new conclusion thoreau had plenty of humour until he tutored himself out of it and so forfeited that best birthright of a sensible man whitman in that respect seems to have been sent into the world naked and unashamed and yet by a strange consummation it is the theory of the former that is arid abstract and claustral  of these two philosophies so nearly identical at bottom the one pursues selfimprovement  a churlish mangy dog the other is up with the morning in the best of health and following the nymph happiness buxom blithe and debonair  happiness at least is not solitary it joys to communicate it loves others for it depends on them for its existence it sanctions and encourages to all delights that are not unkind in themselves if it lived to a thousand it would not make excision of a single humorous passage and while the selfimprover dwindles towards the prig and if he be not of an excellent constitution may even grow deformed into an obermann the very name and appearance of a happy man breathe of goodnature and help the rest of us to live  in the case of thoreau so great a show of doctrine demands some outcome in the field of action  if nothing were to be done but build a shanty beside walden pond we have heard altogether too much of these declarations of independence that the man wrote some books is nothing to the purpose for the same has been done in a suburban villa  that he kept himself happy is perhaps a sufficient excuse but it is disappointing to the reader  we may be unjust but when a man despises commerce and philanthropy alike and has views of good so soaring that he must take himself apart from mankind for their cultivation we will not be content without some striking act  it was not thoreaus fault if he were not martyred had the occasion come he would have made a noble ending  as it is he did once seek to interfere in the worlds course he made one practical appearance on the stage of affairs and a strange one it was and strangely characteristic of the nobility and the eccentricity of the man  it was forced on him by his calm but radical opposition to negro slavery  voting for the right is doing nothing for it he saw it is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail  for his part he would not for an instant recognise that political organisation for his government which is the slaves government also  i do not hesitate to say he adds that those who call themselves abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support both in person and property from the government of massachusetts  that is what he did in 1843 he ceased to pay the polltax  the highwaytax he paid for he said he was as desirous to be a good neighbour as to be a bad subject but no more polltax to the state of massachusetts thoreau had now seceded and was a polity unto himself or as he explains it with admirable sense in fact i quietly declare war with the state after my fashion though i will still make what use and get what advantage of her i can as is usual in such cases  he was put in prison but that was a part of his design  under a government which imprisons any unjustly the true place for a just man is also a prison i know this well that if one thousand if one hundred if ten men whom i could name  ay if one honest man in this state of massachusetts ceasing to hold slaves were actually to withdraw from this copartnership and be locked up in the county gaol therefor it would be the abolition of slavery in america  for it matters not how small the beginning may seem to be what is once well done is done for ever  such was his theory of civil disobedience  and the upshot  a friend paid the tax for him continued year by year to pay it in the sequel and thoreau was free to walk the woods unmolested  it was a fiasco but to me it does not seem laughable even those who joined in the laughter at the moment would be insensibly affected by this quaint instance of a good mans horror for injustice  we may compute the worth of that one nights imprisonment as outweighing half a hundred voters at some subsequent election and if thoreau had possessed as great a power of persuasion as let us say falstaff if he had counted a party however small if his example had been followed by a hundred or by thirty of his fellows i cannot but believe it would have greatly precipitated the era of freedom and justice  we feel the misdeeds of our country with so little fervour for we are not witnesses to the suffering they cause but when we see them wake an active horror in our fellowman when we see a neighbour prefer to lie in prison rather than be so much as passively implicated in their perpetration even the dullest of us will begin to realise them with a quicker pulse  not far from twenty years later when captain john brown was taken at harpers ferry thoreau was the first to come forward in his defence  the committees wrote to him unanimously that his action was premature  i did not send to you for advice said he but to announce that i was to speak  i have used the word defence in truth he did not seek to defend him even declared it would be better for the good cause that he should die but he praised his action as i think brown would have liked to hear it praised  thus this singularly eccentric and independent mind wedded to a character of so much strength singleness and purity pursued its own path of selfimprovement for more than half a century part gymnosophist part backwoodsman and thus did it come twice though in a subaltern attitude into the field of political history   note  for many facts in the above essay among which i may mention the incident of the squirrel i am indebted to thoreau his life and aims by j a page or as is well known dr japp    chapter v  yoshidatorajiro    the name at the head of this page is probably unknown to the english reader and yet i think it should become a household word like that of garibaldi or john brown  some day soon we may expect to hear more fully the details of yoshidas history and the degree of his influence in the transformation of japan even now there must be englishmen acquainted with the subject and perhaps the appearance of this sketch may elicit something more complete and exact  i wish to say that i am not rightly speaking the author of the present paper i tell the story on the authority of an intelligent japanese gentleman mr taiso masaki who told it me with an emotion that does honour to his heart and though i have taken some pains and sent my notes to him to be corrected this can be no more than an imperfect outline  yoshidatorajiro was son to the hereditary military instructor of the house of choshu   the name you are to pronounce with an equality of accent on the different syllables almost as in french the vowels as in italian but the consonants in the english manner  except the j which has the french sound or as it has been cleverly proposed to write it the sound of zh  yoshida was very learned in chinese letters or as we might say in the classics and in his fathers subject fortification was among his favourite studies and he was a poet from his boyhood  he was born to a lively and intelligent patriotism the condition of japan was his great concern and while he projected a better future he lost no opportunity of improving his knowledge of her present state  with this end he was continually travelling in his youth going on foot and sometimes with three days provision on his back in the brave selfhelpful manner of all heroes  he kept a full diary while he was thus upon his journeys but it is feared that these notes have been destroyed  if their value were in any respect such as we have reason to expect from the mans character this would be a loss not easy to exaggerate  it is still wonderful to the japanese how far he contrived to push these explorations a cultured gentleman of that land and period would leave a complimentary poem wherever he had been hospitably entertained and a friend of mr masaki who was likewise a great wanderer has found such traces of yoshidas passage in very remote regions of japan  politics is perhaps the only profession for which no preparation is thought necessary but yoshida considered otherwise and he studied the miseries of his fellow countrymen with as much attention and research as though he had been going to write a book instead of merely to propose a remedy  to a man of his intensity and singleness there is no question but that this survey was melancholy in the extreme  his dissatisfaction is proved by the eagerness with which he threw himself into the cause of reform and what would have discouraged another braced yoshida for his task as he professed the theory of arms it was firstly the defences of japan that occupied his mind  the external feebleness of that country was then illustrated by the manners of overriding barbarians and the visit of big barbarian war ships she was a country beleaguered  thus the patriotism of yoshida took a form which may be said to have defeated itself he had it upon him to keep out these all powerful foreigners whom it is now one of his chief merits to have helped to introduce but a man who follows his own virtuous heart will be always found in the end to have been fighting for the best  one thing leads naturally to another in an awakened mind and that with an upward progress from effect to cause  the power and knowledge of these foreigners were things inseparable by envying them their military strength yoshida came to envy them their culture from the desire to equal them in the first sprang his desire to share with them in the second and thus he is found treating in the same book of a new scheme to strengthen the defences of kioto and of the establishment in the same city of a university of foreign teachers  he hoped perhaps to get the good of other lands without their evil to enable japan to profit by the knowledge of the barbarians and still keep her inviolate with her own arts and virtues  but whatever was the precise nature of his hope the means by which it was to be accomplished were both difficult and obvious  some one with eyes and understanding must break through the official cordon escape into the new world and study this other civilisation on the spot  and who could be better suited for the business  it was not without danger but he was without fear  it needed preparation and insight and what had he done since he was a child but prepare himself with the best culture of japan and acquire in his excursions the power and habit of observing  he was but twentytwo and already all this was clear in his mind when news reached choshu that commodore perry was lying near to yeddo  here then was the patriots opportunity among the samurai of choshu and in particular among the councillors of the daimio his general culture his views which the enlightened were eager to accept and above all the prophetic charm the radiant persuasion of the man had gained him many and sincere disciples  he had thus a strong influence at the provincial court and so he obtained leave to quit the district and by way of a pretext a privilege to follow his profession in yeddo  thither he hurried and arrived in time to be too late perry had weighed anchor and his sails had vanished from the waters of japan  but yoshida having put his hand to the plough was not the man to go back he had entered upon this business and please god he would carry it through and so he gave up his professional career and remained in yeddo to be at hand against the next opportunity  by this behaviour he put himself into an attitude towards his superior the daimio of choshu which i cannot thoroughly explain  certainly he became a ronyin a broken man a feudal outlaw certainly he was liable to be arrested if he set foot upon his native province yet i am cautioned that he did not really break his allegiance but only so far separated himself as that the prince could no longer be held accountable for his late vassals conduct  there is some nicety of feudal custom here that escapes my comprehension  in yeddo with this nondescript political status and cut off from any means of livelihood he was joyfully supported by those who sympathised with his design  one was sakuma shozan hereditary retainer of one of the shoguns councillors and from him he got more than money or than moneys worth  a steady respectable man with an eye to the worlds opinion sakuma was one of those who if they cannot do great deeds in their own person have yet an ardour of admiration for those who can that recommends them to the gratitude of history  they aid and abet greatness more perhaps than we imagine  one thinks of them in connection with nicodemus who visited our lord by night  and sakuma was in a position to help yoshida more practically than by simple countenance for he could read dutch and was eager to communicate what he knew  while the young ronyin thus lay studying in yeddo news came of a russian ship at nangasaki  no time was to be lost sakuma contributed a long copy of encouraging verses and off set yoshida on foot for nangasaki  his way lay through his own province of choshu but as the highroad to the south lay apart from the capital he was able to avoid arrest  he supported himself like a trouvere by his proficiency in verse  he carried his works along with him to serve as an introduction  when he reached a town he would inquire for the house of any one celebrated for swordsmanship or poetry or some of the other acknowledged forms of culture and there on giving a taste of his skill he would be received and entertained and leave behind him when he went away a compliment in verse  thus he travelled through the middle ages on his voyage of discovery into the nineteenth century when he reached nangasaki he was once more too late  the russians were gone  but he made a profit on his journey in spite of fate and stayed awhile to pick up scraps of knowledge from the dutch interpreters  a low class of men but one that had opportunities and then still full of purpose returned to yeddo on foot as he had come  it was not only his youth and courage that supported him under these successive disappointments but the continual affluence of new disciples  the man had the tenacity of a bruce or a columbus with a pliability that was all his own he did not fight for what the world would call success but for the wages of going on  check him off in a dozen directions he would find another outlet and break forth  he missed one vessel after another and the main work still halted but so long as he had a single japanese to enlighten and prepare for the better future he could still feel that he was working for japan  now he had scarce returned from nangasaki when he was sought out by a new inquirer the most promising of all  this was a common soldier of the hemming class a dyer by birth who had heard vaguely 1 of yoshidas movements and had become filled with wonder as to their design  this was a far different inquirer from sakuma shozan or the councillors of the daimio of choshu  this was no twosworded gentleman but the common stuff of the country born in low traditions and unimproved by books and yet that influence that radiant persuasion that never failed yoshida in any circumstance of his short life enchanted enthralled and converted the common soldier as it had done already with the elegant and learned  the man instantly burned up into a true enthusiasm his mind had been only waiting for a teacher he grasped in a moment the profit of these new ideas he too would go to foreign outlandish parts and bring back the knowledge that was to strengthen and renew japan and in the meantime that he might be the better prepared yoshida set himself to teach and he to learn the chinese literature  it is an episode most honourable to yoshida and yet more honourable still to the soldier and to the capacity and virtue of the common people of japan  1 yoshida when on his way to nangasaki met the soldier and talked with him by the roadside they then parted but the soldier was so much struck by the words he heard that on yoshidas return he sought him out and declared his intention of devoting his life to the good cause  i venture in the absence of the writer to insert this correction having been present when the story was told by mr masaki  f j  and i there being none to settle the difference must reproduce both versions  r l s  and now at length commodore perry returned to simoda friends crowded round yoshida with help counsels and encouragement  one presented him with a great sword three feet long and very heavy which in the exultation of the hour he swore to carry throughout all his wanderings and to bring back  a fartravelled weapon  to japan  a long letter was prepared in chinese for the american officers it was revised and corrected by sakuma and signed by yoshida under the name of urinakimanji and by the soldier under that of ichigikoda  yoshida had supplied himself with a profusion of materials for writing his dress was literally stuffed with paper which was to come back again enriched with his observations and make a great and happy kingdom of japan  thus equipped this pair of emigrants set forward on foot from yeddo and reached simoda about nightfall  at no period within history can travel have presented to any european creature the same face of awe and terror as to these courageous japanese  the descent of ulysses into hell is a parallel more near the case than the boldest expedition in the polar circles  for their act was unprecedented it was criminal and it was to take them beyond the pale of humanity into a land of devils  it is not to be wondered at if they were thrilled by the thought of their unusual situation and perhaps the soldier gave utterance to the sentiment of both when he sang in chinese singing so that we see he had already profited by his lessons these two appropriate verses   we do not know where we are to sleep tonight in a thousand miles of desert where we can see no human smoke   in a little temple hard by the seashore they lay down to repose sleep overtook them as they lay and when they awoke the east was already white for their last morning in japan they seized a fishermans boat and rowed out  perry lying far to sea because of the two tides  their very manner of boarding was significant of determination for they had no sooner caught hold upon the ship than they kicked away their boat to make return impossible  and now you would have thought that all was over  but the commodore was already in treaty with the shoguns government it was one of the stipulations that no japanese was to be aided in escaping from japan and yoshida and his followers were handed over as prisoners to the authorities at simoda  that night he who had been to explore the secrets of the barbarian slept if he might sleep at all in a cell too short for lying down at full length and too low for standing upright  there are some disappointments too great for commentary  sakuma implicated by his handwriting was sent into his own province in confinement from which he was soon released yoshida and the soldier suffered a long and miserable period of captivity and the latter indeed died while yet in prison of a skin disease  but such a spirit as that of yoshidatorajiro is not easily made or kept a captive and that which cannot be broken by misfortune you shall seek in vain to confine in a bastille  he was indefatigably active writing reports to government and treatises for dissemination  these latter were contraband and yet he found no difficulty in their distribution for he always had the jailor on his side  it was in vain that they kept changing him from one prison to another government by that plan only hastened the spread of new ideas for yoshida had only to arrive to make a convert  thus though he himself has laid by the heels he confirmed and extended his party in the state  at last after many lesser transferences he was given over from the prisons of the shogun to those of his own superior the daimio of choshu  i conceive it possible that he may then have served out his time for the attempt to leave japan and was now resigned to the provincial government on a lesser count as a ronyin or feudal rebel  but however that may be the change was of great importance to yoshida for by the influence of his admirers in the daimios council he was allowed the privilege underhand of dwelling in his own house  and there as well to keep up communication with his fellowreformers as to pursue his work of education he received boys to teach  it must not be supposed that he was free he was too marked a man for that he was probably assigned to some small circle and lived as we should say under police surveillance but to him who had done so much from under lock and key this would seem a large and profitable liberty  it was at this period that mr masaki was brought into personal contact with yoshida and hence through the eyes of a boy of thirteen we get one good look at the character and habits of the hero  he was ugly and laughably disfigured with the smallpox and while nature had been so niggardly with him from the first his personal habits were even sluttish  his clothes were wretched when he ate or washed he wiped his hands upon his sleeves and as his hair was not tied more than once in the two months it was often disgusting to behold  with such a picture it is easy to believe that he never married  a good teacher gentle in act although violent and abusive in speech his lessons were apt to go over the heads of his scholars and to leave them gaping or more often laughing  such was his passion for study that he even grudged himself natural repose and when he grew drowsy over his books he would if it was summer put mosquitoes up his sleeve and if it was winter take off his shoes and run barefoot on the snow  his handwriting was exceptionally villainous poet though he was he had no taste for what was elegant and in a country where to write beautifully was not the mark of a scrivener but an admired accomplishment for gentlemen he suffered his letters to be jolted out of him by the press of matter and the heat of his convictions  he would not tolerate even the appearance of a bribe for bribery lay at the root of much that was evil in japan as well as in countries nearer home and once when a merchant brought him his son to educate and added as was customary 1 a little private sweetener yoshida dashed the money in the givers face and launched into such an outbreak of indignation as made the matter public in the school  he was still when masaki knew him much weakened by his hardships in prison and the presentation sword three feet long was too heavy for him to wear without distress yet he would always gird it on when he went to dig in his garden that is a touch which qualifies the man  a weaker nature would have shrunk from the sight of what only commemorated a failure  but he was of thoreaus mind that if you can make your failure tragical by courage it will not differ from success  he could look back without confusion to his enthusiastic promise  if events had been contrary and he found himself unable to carry out that purpose  well there was but the more reason to be brave and constant in another if he could not carry the sword into barbarian lands it should at least be witness to a life spent entirely for japan  1 i understood that the merchant was endeavouring surreptitiously to obtain for his son instruction to which he was not entitled  f j  this is the sight we have of him as he appeared to schoolboys but not related in the schoolboy spirit  a man so careless of the graces must be out of court with boys and women  and indeed as we have all been more or less to school it will astonish no one that yoshida was regarded by his scholars as a laughingstock  the schoolboy has a keen sense of humour  heroes he learns to understand and to admire in books but he is not forward to recognise the heroic under the traits of any contemporary man and least of all in a brawling dirty and eccentric teacher  but as the years went by and the scholars of yoshida continued in vain to look around them for the abstractly perfect and began more and more to understand the drift of his instructions they learned to look back upon their comic schoolmaster as upon the noblest of mankind  the last act of this brief and full existence was already near at hand  some of his work was done for already there had been dutch teachers admitted into nangasaki and the country at large was keen for the new learning  but though the renaissance had begun it was impeded and dangerously threatened by the power of the shogun  his minister  the same who was afterwards assassinated in the snow in the very midst of his bodyguard  not only held back pupils from going to the dutchmen but by spies and detectives by imprisonment and death kept thinning out of japan the most intelligent and active spirits  it is the old story of a power upon its last legs  learning to the bastille and courage to the block when there are none left but sheep and donkeys the state will have been saved  but a man must not think to cope with a revolution nor a minister however fortified with guards to hold in check a country that had given birth to such men as yoshida and his soldierfollower  the violence of the ministerial tarquin only served to direct attention to the illegality of his masters rule and people began to turn their allegiance from yeddo and the shogun to the long forgotten mikado in his seclusion at kioto  at this juncture whether in consequence or not the relations between these two rulers became strained and the shoguns minister set forth for kioto to put another affront upon the rightful sovereign  the circumstance was well fitted to precipitate events  it was a piece of religion to defend the mikado it was a plain piece of political righteousness to oppose a tyrannical and bloody usurpation  to yoshida the moment for action seemed to have arrived  he was himself still confined in choshu  nothing was free but his intelligence but with that he sharpened a sword for the shoguns minister  a party of his followers were to waylay the tyrant at a village on the yeddo and kioto road present him with a petition and put him to the sword  but yoshida and his friends were closely observed and the too great expedition of two of the conspirators a boy of eighteen and his brother wakened the suspicion of the authorities and led to a full discovery of the plot and the arrest of all who were concerned  in yeddo to which he was taken yoshida was thrown again into a strict confinement  but he was not left destitute of sympathy in this last hour of trial  in the next cell lay one kusakabe a reformer from the southern highlands of satzuma  they were in prison for different plots indeed but for the same intention they shared the same beliefs and the same aspirations for japan many and long were the conversations they held through the prison wall and dear was the sympathy that soon united them  it fell first to the lot of kusakabe to pass before the judges and when sentence had been pronounced he was led towards the place of death below yoshidas window  to turn the head would have been to implicate his fellowprisoner but he threw him a look from his eye and bade him farewell in a loud voice with these two chinese verses   it is better to be a crystal and be broken than to remain perfect like a tile upon the housetop   so kusakabe from the highlands of satzuma passed out of the theatre of this world  his death was like an antique worthys  a little after and yoshida too must appear before the court his last scene was of a piece with his career and fitly crowned it  he seized on the opportunity of a public audience confessed and gloried in his design and reading his auditors a lesson in the history of their country told at length the illegality of the shoguns power and the crimes by which its exercise was sullied  so having said his say for once he was led forth and executed thirtyone years old  a military engineer a bold traveller at least in wish a poet a patriot a schoolmaster a friend to learning a martyr to reform  there are not many men dying at seventy who have served their country in such various characters  he was not only wise and provident in thought but surely one of the fieriest of heroes in execution  it is hard to say which is most remarkable  his capacity for command which subdued his very jailors his hot unflagging zeal or his stubborn superiority to defeat  he failed in each particular enterprise that he attempted and yet we have only to look at his country to see how complete has been his general success his friends and pupils made the majority of leaders in that final revolution now some twelve years old and many of them are or were until the other day high placed among the rulers of japan  and when we see all round us these brisk intelligent students with their strange foreign air we should never forget how yoshida marched afoot from choshu to yeddo and from yeddo to nangasaki and from nangasaki back again to yeddo how he boarded the american ship his dress stuffed with writing material nor how he languished in prison and finally gave his death as he had formerly given all his life and strength and leisure to gain for his native land that very benefit which she now enjoys so largely  it is better to be yoshida and perish than to be only sakuma and yet save the hide  kusakabe of satzuma has said the word it is better to be a crystal and be broken  i must add a word for i hope the reader will not fail to perceive that this is as much the story of a heroic people as that of a heroic man  it is not enough to remember yoshida we must not forget the common soldier nor kusakabe nor the boy of eighteen nomura of choshu whose eagerness betrayed the plot  it is exhilarating to have lived in the same days with these greathearted gentlemen  only a few miles from us to speak by the proportion of the universe while i was droning over my lessons yoshida was goading himself to be wakeful with the stings of the mosquito and while you were grudging a penny income tax kusakabe was stepping to death with a noble sentence on his lips    chapter vi  francois villon student poet and housebreaker    perhaps one of the most curious revolutions in literary history is the sudden bullseye light cast by m longnon on the obscure existence of francois villon 1   his book is not remarkable merely as a chapter of biography exhumed after four centuries  to readers of the poet it will recall with a flavour of satire that characteristic passage in which he bequeaths his spectacles  with a humorous reservation of the case  to the hospital for blind paupers known as the fifteenscore  thus equipped let the blind paupers go and separate the good from the bad in the cemetery of the innocents  for his own part the poet can see no distinction much have the dead people made of their advantages  what does it matter now that they have lain in state beds and nourished portly bodies upon cakes and cream  here they all lie to be trodden in the mud the large estate and the small sounding virtue and adroit or powerful vice in very much the same condition and a bishop not to be distinguished from a lamplighter with even the strongest spectacles  1 etude biographique sur francois villon  paris h menu  such was villons cynical philosophy  four hundred years after his death when surely all danger might be considered at an end a pair of critical spectacles have been applied to his own remains and though he left behind him a sufficiently ragged reputation from the first it is only after these four hundred years that his delinquencies have been finally tracked home and we can assign him to his proper place among the good or wicked  it is a staggering thought and one that affords a fine figure of the imperishability of mens acts that the stealth of the private inquiry office can be carried so far back into the dead and dusty past  we are not so soon quit of our concerns as villon fancied  in the extreme of dissolution when not so much as a mans name is remembered when his dust is scattered to the four winds and perhaps the very grave and the very graveyard where he was laid to rest have been forgotten desecrated and buried under populous towns  even in this extreme let an antiquary fall across a sheet of manuscript and the name will be recalled the old infamy will pop out into daylight like a toad out of a fissure in the rock and the shadow of the shade of what was once a man will be heartily pilloried by his descendants  a little while ago and villon was almost totally forgotten then he was revived for the sake of his verses and now he is being revived with a vengeance in the detection of his misdemeanours  how unsubstantial is this projection of a mans existence which can lie in abeyance for centuries and then be brushed up again and set forth for the consideration of posterity by a few dips in an antiquarys inkpot  this precarious tenure of fame goes a long way to justify those and they are not few who prefer cakes and cream in the immediate present   a wild youth   francois de montcorbier alias francois des loges alias francois villon alias michel mouton  master of arts in the university of paris was born in that city in the summer of 1431  it was a memorable year for france on other and higher considerations  a greathearted girl and a poorhearted boy made the one her last the other his first appearance on the public stage of that unhappy country  on the 30th of may the ashes of joan of arc were thrown into the seine and on the 2d of december our henry sixth made his joyous entry dismally enough into disaffected and depopulating paris  sword and fire still ravaged the open country  on a single april saturday twelve hundred persons besides children made their escape out of the starving capital  the hangman as is not uninteresting to note in connection with master francis was kept hard at work in 1431 on the last of april and on the 4th of may alone sixtytwo bandits swung from paris gibbets 1  a more confused or troublous time it would have been difficult to select for a start in life  not even a mans nationality was certain for the people of paris there was no such thing as a frenchman  the english were the english indeed but the french were only the armagnacs whom with joan of arc at their head they had beaten back from under their ramparts not two years before  such public sentiment as they had centred about their dear duke of burgundy and the dear duke had no more urgent business than to keep out of their neighbourhood     at least and whether he liked it or not our disreputable troubadour was tubbed and swaddled as a subject of the english crown  1 bougeois de paris ed  pantheon pp 688 689  we hear nothing of villons father except that he was poor and of mean extraction  his mother was given piously which does not imply very much in an old frenchwoman and quite uneducated  he had an uncle a monk in an abbey at angers who must have prospered beyond the family average and was reported to be worth five or six hundred crowns  of this uncle and his moneybox the reader will hear once more  in 1448 francis became a student of the university of paris in 1450 he took the degree of bachelor and in 1452 that of master of arts  his bourse or the sum paid weekly for his board was of the amount of two sous  now two sous was about the price of a pound of salt butter in the bad times of 1417 it was the price of halfapound in the worse times of 1419 and in 1444 just four years before villon joined the university it seems to have been taken as the average wage for a days manual labour 1  in short it cannot have been a very profuse allowance to keep a sharpset lad in breakfast and supper for seven mortal days and villons share of the cakes and pastry and general good cheer to which he is never weary of referring must have been slender from the first  1 bourgeois pp 627 636 and 725  the educational arrangements of the university of paris were to our way of thinking somewhat incomplete  worldly and monkish elements were presented in a curious confusion which the youth might disentangle for himself  if he had an opportunity on the one hand of acquiring much hairdrawn divinity and a taste for formal disputation he was put in the way of much gross and flaunting vice upon the other  the lecture room of a scholastic doctor was sometimes under the same roof with establishments of a very different and peculiarly unedifying order  the students had extraordinary privileges which by all accounts they abused extraordinarily  and while some condemned themselves to an almost sepulchral regularity and seclusion others fled the schools swaggered in the street with their thumbs in their girdle passed the night in riot and behaved themselves as the worthy forerunners of jehan frollo in the romance of notre dame de paris  villon tells us himself that he was among the truants but we hardly needed his avowal  the burlesque erudition in which he sometimes indulged implies no more than the merest smattering of knowledge whereas his acquaintance with blackguard haunts and industries could only have been acquired by early and consistent impiety and idleness  he passed his degrees it is true but some of us who have been to modern universities will make their own reflections on the value of the test  as for his three pupils colin laurent girard gossouyn and jehan marceau  if they were really his pupils in any serious sense  what can we say but god help them  and sure enough by his own description they turned out as ragged rowdy and ignorant as was to be looked for from the views and manners of their rare preceptor  at some time or other before or during his university career the poet was adopted by master guillaume de villon chaplain of saint benoitlebetourne near the sorbonne  from him he borrowed the surname by which he is known to posterity  it was most likely from his house called the porte rouge and situated in a garden in the cloister of st benoit that master francis heard the bell of the sorbonne ring out the angelus while he was finishing his small testament at christmastide in 1546  towards this benefactor he usually gets credit for a respectable display of gratitude  but with his trap and pitfall style of writing it is easy to make too sure  his sentiments are about as much to be relied on as those of a professional beggar and in this as in so many other matters he comes towards us whining and piping the eye and goes off again with a whoop and his finger to his nose  thus he calls guillaume de villon his more than father thanks him with a great show of sincerity for having helped him out of many scrapes and bequeaths him his portion of renown  but the portion of renown which belonged to a young thief distinguished if at the period when he wrote this legacy he was distinguished at all for having written some more or less obscene and scurrilous ballads must have been little fitted to gratify the selfrespect or increase the reputation of a benevolent ecclesiastic  the same remark applies to a subsequent legacy of the poets library with specification of one work which was plainly neither decent nor devout  we are thus left on the horns of a dilemma  if the chaplain was a godly philanthropic personage who had tried to graft good principles and good behaviour on this wild slip of an adopted son these jesting legacies would obviously cut him to the heart  the position of an adopted son towards his adoptive father is one full of delicacy where a man lends his name he looks for great consideration  and this legacy of villons portion of renown may be taken as the mere fling of an unregenerate scapegrace who has wit enough to recognise in his own shame the readiest weapon of offence against a prosy benefactors feelings  the gratitude of master francis figures on this reading as a frightful minus quantity  if on the other hand those jests were given and taken in good humour the whole relation between the pair degenerates into the unedifying complicity of a debauched old chaplain and a witty and dissolute young scholar  at this rate the house with the red door may have rung with the most mundane minstrelsy and it may have been below its roof that villon through a hole in the plaster studied as he tells us the leisures of a rich ecclesiastic  it was perhaps of some moment in the poets life that he should have inhabited the cloister of saint benoit  three of the most remarkable among his early acquaintances are catherine de vausselles for whom he entertained a short lived affection and an enduring and most unmanly resentment regnier de montigny a young blackguard of good birth and colin de cayeux a fellow with a marked aptitude for picking locks  now we are on a foundation of mere conjecture but it is at least curious to find that two of the canons of saint benoit answered respectively to the names of pierre de vaucel and etienne de montigny and that there was a householder called nicolas de cayeux in a street  the rue des poirees  in the immediate neighbourhood of the cloister  m longnon is almost ready to identify catherine as the niece of pierre regnier as the nephew of etienne and colin as the son of nicolas  without going so far it must be owned that the approximation of names is significant  as we go on to see the part played by each of these persons in the sordid melodrama of the poets life we shall come to regard it as even more notable  is it not clough who has remarked that after all everything lies in juxtaposition  many a mans destiny has been settled by nothing apparently more grave than a pretty face on the opposite side of the street and a couple of bad companions round the corner  catherine de vausselles or de vaucel  the change is within the limits of villons licence had plainly delighted in the poets conversation near neighbours or not they were much together and villon made no secret of his court and suffered himself to believe that his feeling was repaid in kind  this may have been an error from the first or he may have estranged her by subsequent misconduct or temerity  one can easily imagine villon an impatient wooer  one thing at least is sure that the affair terminated in a manner bitterly humiliating to master francis  in presence of his ladylove perhaps under her window and certainly with her connivance he was unmercifully thrashed by one noe le joly  beaten as he says himself like dirty linen on the washing board  it is characteristic that his malice had notably increased between the time when he wrote the small testament immediately on the back of the occurrence and the time when he wrote the large testament five years after  on the latter occasion nothing is too bad for his damsel with the twisted nose as he calls her  she is spared neither hint nor accusation and he tells his messenger to accost her with the vilest insults  villon it is thought was out of paris when these amenities escaped his pen or perhaps the strong arm of noe le joly would have been again in requisition  so ends the love story if love story it may properly be called poets are not necessarily fortunate in love but they usually fall among more romantic circumstances and bear their disappointment with a better grace  the neighbourhood of regnier de montigny and colin de cayeux was probably more influential on his after life than the contempt of catherine  for a man who is greedy of all pleasures and provided with little money and less dignity of character we may prophesy a safe and speedy voyage downward humble or even truckling virtue may walk unspotted in this life  but only those who despise the pleasures can afford to despise the opinion of the world  a man of a strong heady temperament like villon is very differently tempted  his eyes lay hold on all provocations greedily and his heart flames up at a look into imperious desire he is snared and broachedto by anything and everything from a pretty face to a piece of pastry in a cookshop window he will drink the rinsing of the wine cup stay the latest at the tavern party tap at the lit windows follow the sound of singing and beat the whole neighbourhood for another reveller as he goes reluctantly homeward and grudge himself every hour of sleep as a black empty period in which he cannot follow after pleasure  such a person is lost if he have not dignity or failing that at least pride which is its shadow and in many ways its substitute  master francis i fancy would follow his own eager instincts without much spiritual struggle  and we soon find him fallen among thieves in sober literal earnest and counting as acquaintances the most disreputable people he could lay his hands on fellows who stole ducks in paris moat sergeants of the criminal court and archers of the watch blackguards who slept at night under the butchers stalls and for whom the aforesaid archers peered about carefully with lanterns regnier de montigny colin de cayeux and their crew all bound on a favouring breeze towards the gallows the disorderly abbess of port royal who went about at fair time with soldiers and thieves and conducted her abbey on the queerest principles and most likely perette mauger the great paris receiver of stolen goods not yet dreaming poor woman of the last scene of her career when henry cousin executor of the high justice shall bury her alive and most reluctant in front of the new montigny gibbet 1  nay our friend soon began to take a foremost rank in this society  he could string off verses which is always an agreeable talent and he could make himself useful in many other ways  the whole ragged army of bohemia and whosoever loved good cheer without at all loving to work and pay for it are addressed in contemporary verses as the subjects of francois villon  he was a good genius to all hungry and unscrupulous persons and became the hero of a whole legendary cycle of tavern tricks and cheateries at best these were doubtful levities rather too thievish for a schoolboy rather too gamesome for a thief  but he would not linger long in this equivocal border land  he must soon have complied with his surroundings  he was one who would go where the cannikin clinked not caring who should pay and from supping in the wolves den there is but a step to hunting with the pack  and here as i am on the chapter of his degradation i shall say all i mean to say about its darkest expression and be done with it for good  some charitable critics see no more than a jeu desprit a graceful and trifling exercise of the imagination in the grimy ballad of fat peg grosse margot  i am not able to follow these gentlemen to this polite extreme  out of all villons works that ballad stands forth in flaring reality gross and ghastly as a thing written in a contraction of disgust  m longnon shows us more and more clearly at every page that we are to read our poet literally that his names are the names of real persons and the events he chronicles were actual events  but even if the tendency of criticism had run the other way this ballad would have gone far to prove itself  i can well understand the reluctance of worthy persons in this matter for of course it is unpleasant to think of a man of genius as one who held in the words of marina to boult   a place for which the painedst fiend of hell would not in reputation change   but beyond this natural unwillingness the whole difficulty of the case springs from a highly virtuous ignorance of life paris now is not so different from the paris of then and the whole of the doings of bohemia are not written in the sugar candy pastorals of murger  it is really not at all surprising that a young man of the fifteenth century with a knack of making verses should accept his bread upon disgraceful terms  the race of those who do is not extinct and some of them to this day write the prettiest verses imaginable     after this it were impossible for master francis to fall lower to go and steal for himself would be an admirable advance from every point of view divine or human  1 chronique scandaleuse ed  pantheon p 237  and yet it is not as a thief but as a homicide that he makes his first appearance before angry justice  on june 5 1455 when he was about twentyfour and had been master of arts for a matter of three years we behold him for the first time quite definitely  angry justice had as it were photographed him in the act of his homicide and m longnon rummaging among old deeds has turned up the negative and printed it off for our instruction  villon had been supping  copiously we may believe  and sat on a stone bench in front of the church of st benoit in company with a priest called gilles and a woman of the name of isabeau  it was nine oclock a mighty late hour for the period and evidently a fine summers night  master francis carried a mantle like a prudent man to keep him from the dews serain and had a sword below it dangling from his girdle so these three dallied in front of st benoit taking their pleasure pour soy esbatre  suddenly there arrived upon the scene a priest philippe chermoye or sermaise also with sword and cloak and accompanied by one master jehan le mardi  sermaise according to villons account which is all we have to go upon came up blustering and denying god as villon rose to make room for him upon the bench thrust him rudely back into his place and finally drew his sword and cut open his lower lip by what i should imagine was a very clumsy stroke  up to this point villon professes to have been a model of courtesy even of feebleness and the brawl in his version reads like the fable of the wolf and the lamb  but now the lamb was roused he drew his sword stabbed sermaise in the groin knocked him on the head with a big stone and then leaving him to his fate went away to have his own lip doctored by a barber of the name of fouquet in one version he says that gilles isabeau and le mardi ran away at the first high words and that he and sermaise had it out alone in another le mardi is represented as returning and wresting villons sword from him the reader may please himself  sermaise was picked up lay all that night in the prison of saint benoit where he was examined by an official of the chatelet and expressly pardoned villon and died on the following saturday in the hotel dieu  this as i have said was in june  not before january of the next year could villon extract a pardon from the king but while his hand was in he got two  one is for francois des loges alias autrement dit de villon and the other runs in the name of francois de montcorbier  nay it appears there was a further complication for in the narrative of the first of these documents it is mentioned that he passed himself off upon fouquet the barbersurgeon as one michel mouton  m longnon has a theory that this unhappy accident with sermaise was the cause of villons subsequent irregularities and that up to that moment he had been the pink of good behaviour  but the matter has to my eyes a more dubious air  a pardon necessary for des loges and another for montcorbier and these two the same person and one or both of them known by the alias of villon however honestly come by and lastly in the heat of the moment a fourth name thrown out with an assured countenance  a ship is not to be trusted that sails under so many colours  this is not the simple bearing of innocence  no  the young master was already treading crooked paths already he would start and blench at a hand upon his shoulder with the look we know so well in the face of hogarths idle apprentice already in the blue devils he would see henry cousin the executor of high justice going in dolorous procession towards montfaucon and hear the wind and the birds crying around paris gibbet   a gang of thieves   in spite of the prodigious number of people who managed to get hanged the fifteenth century was by no means a bad time for criminals  a great confusion of parties and great dust of fighting favoured the escape of private housebreakers and quiet fellows who stole ducks in paris moat  prisons were leaky and as we shall see a man with a few crowns in his pocket and perhaps some acquaintance among the officials could easily slip out and become once more a free marauder there was no want of a sanctuary where he might harbour until troubles blew by and accomplices helped each other with more or less good faith  clerks above all had remarkable facilities for a criminal way of life for they were privileged except in cases of notorious incorrigibility to be plucked from the hands of rude secular justice and tried by a tribunal of their own  in 1402 a couple of thieves both clerks of the university were condemned to death by the provost of paris  as they were taken to montfaucon they kept crying high and clearly for their benefit of clergy but were none the less pitilessly hanged and gibbeted indignant alma mater interfered before the king and the provost was deprived of all royal offices and condemned to return the bodies and erect a great stone cross on the road from paris to the gibbet graven with the effigies of these two holy martyrs 1  we shall hear more of the benefit of clergy for after this the reader will not be surprised to meet with thieves in the shape of tonsured clerks or even priests and monks  1 monstrelet pantheon litteraire p 26  to a knot of such learned pilferers our poet certainly belonged and by turning over a few more of m longnons negatives we shall get a clear idea of their character and doings  montigny and de cayeux are names already known guy tabary petitjehan dom nicolas little thibault who was both clerk and goldsmith and who made picklocks and melted plate for himself and his companions  with these the reader has still to become acquainted  petitjehan and de cayeux were handy fellows and enjoyed a useful preeminence in honour of their doings with the picklock  dictus des cahyeus est fortis operator crochetorum says tabarys interrogation sed dictus petitjehan ejus socius est forcius operator  but the flower of the flock was little thibault it was reported that no lock could stand before him he had a persuasive hand let us salute capacity wherever we may find it  perhaps the term gang is not quite properly applied to the persons whose fortunes we are now about to follow rather they were independent malefactors socially intimate and occasionally joining together for some serious operation just as modern stockjobbers form a syndicate for an important loan  nor were they at all particular to any branch of misdoing  they did not scrupulously confine themselves to a single sort of theft as i hear is common among modern thieves  they were ready for anything from pitchandtoss to manslaughter  montigny for instance had neglected neither of these extremes and we find him accused of cheating at games of hazard on the one hand and on the other of the murder of one thevenin pensete in a house by the cemetery of st john  if time had only spared us some particulars might not this last have furnished us with the matter of a grisly winters tale  at christmastime in 1456 readers of villon will remember that he was engaged on the small testament  about the same period circa festum nativitatis domini he took part in a memorable supper at the mule tavern in front of the church of st mathurin  tabary who seems to have been very much villons creature had ordered the supper in the course of the afternoon  he was a man who had had troubles in his time and languished in the bishop of pariss prisons on a suspicion of picking locks confiding convivial not very astute  who had copied out a whole improper romance with his own right hand  this supperparty was to be his first introduction to de cayeux and petitjehan which was probably a matter of some concern to the poor mans muddy wits in the sequel at least he speaks of both with an undisguised respect based on professional inferiority in the matter of picklocks  dom nicolas a picardy monk was the fifth and last at table  when supper had been despatched and fairly washed down we may suppose with white baigneux or red beaune which were favourite wines among the fellowship tabary was solemnly sworn over to secrecy on the nights performances and the party left the mule and proceeded to an unoccupied house belonging to robert de saintsimon  this over a low wall they entered without difficulty  all but tabary took off their upper garments a ladder was found and applied to the high wall which separated saintsimons house from the court of the college of navarre the four fellows in their shirtsleeves as we might say clambered over in a twinkling and master guy tabary remained alone beside the overcoats  from the court the burglars made their way into the vestry of the chapel where they found a large chest strengthened with iron bands and closed with four locks  one of these locks they picked and then by levering up the corner forced the other three  inside was a small coffer of walnut wood also barred with iron but fastened with only three locks which were all comfortably picked by way of the keyhole  in the walnut coffer  a joyous sight by our thieves lantern  were five hundred crowns of gold  there was some talk of opening the aumries where if they had only known a booty eight or nine times greater lay ready to their hand but one of the party i have a humorous suspicion it was dom nicolas the picardy monk hurried them away  it was ten oclock when they mounted the ladder it was about midnight before tabary beheld them coming back  to him they gave ten crowns and promised a share of a twocrown dinner on the morrow whereat we may suppose his mouth watered  in course of time he got wind of the real amount of their booty and understood how scurvily he had been used but he seems to have borne no malice  how could he against such superb operators as petitjehan and de cayeux or a person like villon who could have made a new improper romance out of his own head instead of merely copying an old one with mechanical right hand  the rest of the winter was not uneventful for the gang first they made a demonstration against the church of st mathurin after chalices and were ignominiously chased away by barking dogs  then tabary fell out with casin chollet one of the fellows who stole ducks in paris moat who subsequently became a sergeant of the chatelet and distinguished himself by misconduct followed by imprisonment and public castigation during the wars of louis eleventh the quarrel was not conducted with a proper regard to the kings peace and the pair publicly belaboured each other until the police stepped in and master tabary was cast once more into the prisons of the bishop  while he still lay in durance another job was cleverly executed by the band in broad daylight at the augustine monastery  brother guillaume coiffier was beguiled by an accomplice to st mathurin to say mass and during his absence his chamber was entered and five or six hundred crowns in money and some silver plate successfully abstracted  a melancholy man was coiffier on his return  eight crowns from this adventure were forwarded by little thibault to the incarcerated tabary and with these he bribed the jailor and reappeared in paris taverns  some time before or shortly after this villon set out for angers as he had promised in the small testament the object of this excursion was not merely to avoid the presence of his cruel mistress or the strong arm of noe le joly but to plan a deliberate robbery on his uncle the monk as soon as he had properly studied the ground the others were to go over in force from paris  picklocks and all  and away with my uncles strongbox  this throws a comical sidelight on his own accusation against his relatives that they had forgotten natural duty and disowned him because he was poor  a poor relation is a distasteful circumstance at the best but a poor relation who plans deliberate robberies against those of his blood and trudges hundreds of weary leagues to put them into execution is surely a little on the wrong side of toleration  the uncle at angers may have been monstrously undutiful but the nephew from paris was upsides with him  on the 23d april that venerable and discreet person master pierre marchand curate and prior of paraylemonial in the diocese of chartres arrived in paris and put up at the sign of the three chandeliers in the rue de la huchette  next day or the day after as he was breakfasting at the sign of the armchair he fell into talk with two customers one of whom was a priest and the other our friend tabary  the idiotic tabary became mighty confidential as to his past life  pierre marchand who was an acquaintance of guillaume coiffiers and had sympathised with him over his loss pricked up his ears at the mention of picklocks and led on the transcriber of improper romances from one thing to another until they were fast friends  for picklocks the prior of paray professed a keen curiosity but tabary upon some late alarm had thrown all his into the seine  let that be no difficulty however for was there not little thibault who could make them of all shapes and sizes and to whom tabary smelling an accomplice would be only too glad to introduce his new acquaintance  on the morrow accordingly they met and tabary after having first wet his whistle at the priors expense led him to notre dame and presented him to four or five young companions who were keeping sanctuary in the church  they were all clerks recently escaped like tabary himself from the episcopal prisons among these we may notice thibault the operator a little fellow of twentysix wearing long hair behind  the prior expressed through tabary his anxiety to become their accomplice and altogether such as they were de leur sorts et de leurs complices  mighty polite they showed themselves and made him many fine speeches in return  but for all that perhaps because they had longer heads than tabary perhaps because it is less easy to wheedle men in a body they kept obstinately to generalities and gave him no information as to their exploits past present or to come  i suppose tabary groaned under this reserve for no sooner were he and the prior out of the church than he fairly emptied his heart to him gave him full details of many hanging matters in the past and explained the future intentions of the band  the scheme of the hour was to rob another augustine monk robert de la porte and in this the prior agreed to take a hand with simulated greed  thus in the course of two days he had turned this wineskin of a tabary inside out  for a while longer the farce was carried on the prior was introduced to petitjehan whom he describes as a little very smart man of thirty with a black beard and a short jacket an appointment was made and broken in the de la porte affair tabary had some breakfast at the priors charge and leaked out more secrets under the influence of wine and friendship and then all of a sudden on the 17th of may an alarm sprang up the prior picked up his skirts and walked quietly over to the chatelet to make a deposition and the whole band took to their heels and vanished out of paris and the sight of the police  vanish as they like they all go with a clog about their feet  sooner or later here or there they will be caught in the fact and ignominiously sent home  from our vantage of four centuries afterwards it is odd and pitiful to watch the order in which the fugitives are captured and dragged in  montigny was the first  in august of that same year he was laid by the heels on many grievous counts sacrilegious robberies frauds incorrigibility and that bad business about thevenin pensete in the house by the cemetery of st john  he was reclaimed by the ecclesiastical authorities as a clerk but the claim was rebutted on the score of incorrigibility and ultimately fell to the ground and he was condemned to death by the provost of paris  it was a very rude hour for montigny but hope was not yet over  he was a fellow of some birth his father had been kings pantler his sister probably married to some one about the court was in the family way and her health would be endangered if the execution was proceeded with  so down comes charles the seventh with letters of mercy commuting the penalty to a year in a dungeon on bread and water and a pilgrimage to the shrine of st james in galicia  alas the document was incomplete it did not contain the full tale of montignys enormities it did not recite that he had been denied benefit of clergy and it said nothing about thevenin pensete  montignys hour was at hand  benefit of clergy honourable descent from kings pantler sister in the family way royal letters of commutation  all were of no avail  he had been in prison in rouen in tours in bordeaux and four times already in paris and out of all these he had come scatheless but now he must make a little excursion as far as montfaucon with henry cousin executor of high justice there let him swing among the carrion crows  about a year later in july 1458 the police laid hands on tabary  before the ecclesiastical commissary he was twice examined and on the latter occasion put to the question ordinary and extraordinary  what a dismal change from pleasant suppers at the mule where he sat in triumph with expert operators and great wits  he is at the lees of life poor rogue and those fingers which once transcribed improper romances are now agonisingly stretched upon the rack  we have no sure knowledge but we may have a shrewd guess of the conclusion  tabary the admirer would go the same way as those whom he admired  the last we hear of is colin de cayeux  he was caught in autumn 1460 in the great church of st leu desserens which makes so fine a figure in the pleasant oise valley between creil and beaumont  he was reclaimed by no less than two bishops but the procureur for the provost held fast by incorrigible colin  1460 was an illstarred year for justice was making a clean sweep of poor and indigent persons thieves cheats and lockpickers in the neighbourhood of paris 1 and colin de cayeux with many others was condemned to death and hanged 2  1 chron  scand ut supra 2 here and there principally in the order of events this article differs from m longnons own reading of his material  the ground on which he defers the execution of montigny and de cayeux beyond the date of their trials seems insufficient  there is a law of parsimony for the construction of historical documents simplicity is the first duty of narration and hanged they were   villon and the gallows   villon was still absent on the angers expedition when the prior of paray sent such a bombshell among his accomplices and the dates of his return and arrest remain undiscoverable m campaux plausibly enough opined for the autumn of 1457 which would make him closely follow on montigny and the first of those denounced by the prior to fall into the toils we may suppose at least that it was not long thereafter we may suppose him competed for between lay and clerical courts and we may suppose him alternately pert and impudent humble and fawning in his defence  but at the end of all supposing we come upon some nuggets of fact  for first he was put to the question by water  he who had tossed off so many cups of white baigneux or red beaune now drank water through linen folds until his bowels were flooded and his heart stood still  after so much raising of the elbow so much outcry of fictitious thirst here at last was enough drinking for a lifetime  truly of our pleasant vices the gods make whips to scourge us  and secondly he was condemned to be hanged  a man may have been expecting a catastrophe for years and yet find himself unprepared when it arrives certainly villon found in this legitimate issue of his career a very staggering and grave consideration  every beast as he says clings bitterly to a whole skin  if everything is lost and even honour life still remains nay and it becomes like the ewe lamb in nathans parable as dear as all the rest  do you fancy he asks in a lively ballad that i had not enough philosophy under my hood to cry out i appeal  if i had made any bones about the matter i should have been planted upright in the fields the st denis road  montfaucon being on the way to st denis an appeal to parliament as we saw in the case of colin de cayeux did not necessarily lead to an acquittal or a commutation and while the matter was pending our poet had ample opportunity to reflect on his position  hanging is a sharp argument and to swing with many others on the gibbet adds a horrible corollary for the imagination  with the aspect of montfaucon he was well acquainted indeed as the neighbourhood appears to have been sacred to junketing and nocturnal picnics of wild young men and women he had probably studied it under all varieties of hour and weather and now as he lay in prison waiting the mortal push these different aspects crowded back on his imagination with a new and startling significance and he wrote a ballad by way of epitaph for himself and his companions which remains unique in the annals of mankind  it is in the highest sense a piece of his biography   la pluye nous a debuez et lavez et le soleil dessechez et noirciz pies corbeaulx nous ont les yeux cavez et arrachez la barbe et les sourcilz jamais nul temps nous ne sommes rassis puis ca puis la comme le vent varie a son plaisir sans cesser nous charie plus becquetez doiscaulx que dez a couldre ne soyez donc de nostre confrairie mais priez dieu que tous nous vueille absouldre   here is some genuine thieves literature after so much that was spurious sharp as an etching written with a shuddering soul  there is an intensity of consideration in the piece that shows it to be the transcript of familiar thoughts  it is the quintessence of many a doleful nightmare on the straw when he felt himself swing helpless in the wind and saw the birds turn about him screaming and menacing his eyes  and after all the parliament changed his sentence into one of banishment and to roussillon in dauphiny our poet must carry his woes without delay  travellers between lyons and marseilles may remember a station on the line some way below vienne where the rhone fleets seaward between vineclad hills  this was villons siberia  it would be a little warm in summer perhaps and a little cold in winter in that draughty valley between two great mountain fields but what with the hills and the racing river and the fiery rhone wines he was little to be pitied on the conditions of his exile  villon in a remarkably bad ballad written in a breath heartily thanked and fulsomely belauded the parliament the envoi like the proverbial postscript of a ladys letter containing the pith of his performance in a request for three days delay to settle his affairs and bid his friends farewell  he was probably not followed out of paris like antoine fradin the popular preacher another exile of a few years later by weeping multitudes 1 but i daresay one or two rogues of his acquaintance would keep him company for a mile or so on the south road and drink a bottle with him before they turned  for banished people in those days seem to have set out on their own responsibility in their own guard and at their own expense  it was no joke to make ones way from paris to roussillon alone and penniless in the fifteenth century  villon says he left a rag of his tails on every bush  indeed he must have had many a weary tramp many a slender meal and many a todo with blustering captains of the ordonnance  but with one of his light fingers we may fancy that he took as good as he gave for every rag of his tail he would manage to indemnify himself upon the population in the shape of food or wine or ringing money and his route would be traceable across france and burgundy by housewives and innkeepers lamenting over petty thefts like the track of a single human locust  a strange figure he must have cut in the eyes of the good country people this ragged blackguard city poet with a smack of the paris student and a smack of the paris street arab posting along the highways in rain or sun among the green fields and vineyards  for himself he had no taste for rural loveliness green fields and vineyards would be mighty indifferent to master francis but he would often have his tongue in his cheek at the simplicity of rustic dupes and often at city gates he might stop to contemplate the gibbet with its swinging bodies and hug himself on his escape  1 chron scand p 338  how long he stayed at roussillon how far he became the protege of the bourbons to whom that town belonged or when it was that he took part under the auspices of charles of orleans in a rhyming tournament to be referred to once again in the pages of the present volume are matters that still remain in darkness in spite of m longnons diligent rummaging among archives  when we next find him in summer 1461 alas he is once more in durance this time at meun surloire in the prisons of thibault daussigny bishop of orleans  he had been lowered in a basket into a noisome pit where he lay all summer gnawing hard crusts and railing upon fate  his teeth he says were like the teeth of a rake a touch of haggard portraiture all the more real for being excessive and burlesque and all the more proper to the man for being a caricature of his own misery  his eyes were bandaged with thick walls  it might blow hurricanes overhead the lightning might leap in high heaven but no word of all this reached him in his noisome pit  il nentre ou gist nescler ni tourbillon  above all he was fevered with envy and anger at the freedom of others and his heart flowed over into curses as he thought of thibault daussigny walking the streets in gods sunlight and blessing people with extended fingers  so much we find sharply lined in his own poems  why he was cast again into prison  how he had again managed to shave the gallows  this we know not nor from the destruction of authorities are we ever likely to learn  but on october 2d 1461 or some day immediately preceding the new king louis eleventh made his joyous entry into meun  now it was a part of the formality on such occasions for the new king to liberate certain prisoners and so the basket was let down into villons pit and hastily did master francis scramble in and was most joyfully hauled up and shot out blinking and tottering but once more a free man into the blessed sun and wind  now or never is the time for verses  such a happy revolution would turn the head of a stockingweaver and set him jingling rhymes  and so  after a voyage to paris where he finds montigny and de cayeux clattering their bones upon the gibbet and his three pupils roystering in paris streets with their thumbs under their girdles  down sits master francis to write his large testament and perpetuate his name in a sort of glorious ignominy   the large testament   of this capital achievement and with it of villons style in general it is here the place to speak  the large testament is a hurlyburly of cynical and sentimental reflections about life jesting legacies to friends and enemies and interspersed among these many admirable ballades both serious and absurd  with so free a design no thought that occurred to him would need to be dismissed without expression and he could draw at full length the portrait of his own bedevilled soul and of the bleak and blackguardly world which was the theatre of his exploits and sufferings  if the reader can conceive something between the slapdash inconsequence of byrons don juan and the racy humorous gravity and brief noble touches that distinguish the vernacular poems of burns he will have formed some idea of villons style  to the latter writer  except in the ballades which are quite his own and can be paralleled from no other language known to me  he bears a particular resemblance  in common with burns he has a certain rugged compression a brutal vivacity of epithet a homely vigour a delight in local personalities and an interest in many sides of life that are often despised and passed over by more effete and cultured poets  both also in their strong easy colloquial way tend to become difficult and obscure the obscurity in the case of villon passing at times into the absolute darkness of cant language  they are perhaps the only two great masters of expression who keep sending their readers to a glossary  shall we not dare to say of a thief asks montaigne that he has a handsome leg  it is a far more serious claim that we have to put forward in behalf of villon  beside that of his contemporaries his writing so full of colour so eloquent so picturesque stands out in an almost miraculous isolation  if only one or two of the chroniclers could have taken a leaf out of his book history would have been a pastime and the fifteenth century as present to our minds as the age of charles second  this gallowsbird was the one great writer of his age and country and initiated modern literature for france  boileau long ago in the period of perukes and snuffboxes recognised him as the first articulate poet in the language and if we measure him not by priority of merit but living duration of influence not on a comparison with obscure forerunners but with great and famous successors we shall instal this ragged and disreputable figure in a far higher niche in glorys temple than was ever dreamed of by the critic  it is in itself a memorable fact that before 1542 in the very dawn of printing and while modern france was in the making the works of villon ran through seven different editions  out of him flows much of rabelais and through rabelais directly and indirectly a deep permanent and growing inspiration not only his style but his callous pertinent way of looking upon the sordid and ugly sides of life becomes every day a more specific feature in the literature of france  and only the other year a work of some power appeared in paris and appeared with infinite scandal which owed its whole inner significance and much of its outward form to the study of our rhyming thief  the world to which he introduces us is as before said blackguardly and bleak  paris swarms before us full of famine shame and death monks and the servants of great lords hold high wassail upon cakes and pastry the poor man licks his lips before the bakers window people with patched eyes sprawl all night under the stalls chuckling tabary transcribes an improper romance barebosomed lasses and ruffling students swagger in the streets the drunkard goes stumbling homewards the graveyard is full of bones and away on montfaucon colin de cayeux and montigny hang draggled in the rain  is there nothing better to be seen than sordid misery and worthless joys  only where the poor old mother of the poet kneels in church below painted windows and makes tremulous supplication to the mother of god  in our mixed world full of green fields and happy lovers where not long before joan of arc had led one of the highest and noblest lives in the whole story of mankind this was all worth chronicling that our poet could perceive  his eyes were indeed sealed with his own filth  he dwelt all his life in a pit more noisome than the dungeon at meun  in the moral world also there are large phenomena not cognisable out of holes and corners  loud winds blow speeding home deepladen ships and sweeping rubbish from the earth the lightning leaps and cleans the face of heaven high purposes and brave passions shake and sublimate mens spirits and meanwhile in the narrow dungeon of his soul villon is mumbling crusts and picking vermin  along with this deadly gloom of outlook we must take another characteristic of his work its unrivalled insincerity  i can give no better similitude of this quality than i have given already that he comes up with a whine and runs away with a whoop and his finger to his nose  his pathos is that of a professional mendicant who should happen to be a man of genius his levity that of a bitter street arab full of bread  on a first reading the pathetic passages preoccupy the reader and he is cheated out of an alms in the shape of sympathy  but when the thing is studied the illusion fades away in the transitions above all we can detect the evil ironical temper of the man and instead of a flighty work where many crude but genuine feelings tumble together for the mastery as in the lists of tournament we are tempted to think of the large testament as of one longdrawn epical grimace pulled by a merryandrew who has found a certain despicable eminence over human respect and human affections by perching himself astride upon the gallows  between these two views at best all temperate judgments will be found to fall and rather as i imagine towards the last  there were two things on which he felt with perfect and in one case even threatening sincerity  the first of these was an undisguised envy of those richer than himself  he was for ever drawing a parallel already exemplified from his own words between the happy life of the welltodo and the miseries of the poor  burns too proud and honest not to work continued through all reverses to sing of poverty with a light defiant note  beranger waited till he was himself beyond the reach of want before writing the old vagabond or jacques  samuel johnson although he was very sorry to be poor was a great arguer for the advantages of poverty in his ill days  thus it is that brave men carry their crosses and smile with the fox burrowing in their vitals  but villon who had not the courage to be poor with honesty now whiningly implores our sympathy now shows his teeth upon the dungheap with an ugly snarl  he envies bitterly envies passionately  poverty he protests drives men to steal as hunger makes the wolf sally from the forest the poor he goes on will always have a carping word to say or if that outlet be denied nourish rebellious thoughts it is a calumny on the noble army of the poor  thousands in a small way of life ay and even in the smallest go through life with tenfold as much honour and dignity and peace of mind as the rich gluttons whose dainties and statebeds awakened villons covetous temper  and every mornings sun sees thousands who pass whistling to their toil  but villon was the mauvais pauvre defined by victor hugo and in its english expression so admirably stereotyped by dickens  he was the first wicked sansculotte  he is the man of genius with the moleskin cap  he is mighty pathetic and beseeching here in the street but i would not go down a dark road with him for a large consideration  the second of the points on which he was genuine and emphatic was common to the middle ages a deep and somewhat snivelling conviction of the transitory nature of this life and the pity and horror of death  old age and the grave with some dark and yet halfsceptical terror of an afterworld  these were ideas that clung about his bones like a disease  an old ape as he says may play all the tricks in its repertory and none of them will tickle an audience into good humour tousjours vieil synge est desplaisant  it is not the old jester who receives most recognition at a tavern party but the young fellow fresh and handsome who knows the new slang and carries off his vice with a certain air  of this as a tavern jester himself he would be pointedly conscious as for the women with whom he was best acquainted his reflections on their old age in all their harrowing pathos shall remain in the original for me  horace has disgraced himself to something the same tune but what horace throws out with an illfavoured laugh villon dwells on with an almost maudlin whimper  it is in death that he finds his truest inspiration in the swift and sorrowful change that overtakes beauty in the strange revolution by which great fortunes and renowns are diminished to a handful of churchyard dust and in the utter passing away of what was once lovable and mighty  it is in this that the mixed texture of his thought enables him to reach such poignant and terrible effects and to enchance pity with ridicule like a man cutting capers to a funeral march  it is in this also that he rises out of himself into the higher spheres of art  so in the ballade by which he is best known he rings the changes on names that once stood for beautiful and queenly women and are now no more than letters and a legend  where are the snows of yester year runs the burden  and so in another not so famous he passes in review the different degrees of bygone men from the holy apostles and the golden emperor of the east down to the heralds pursuivants and trumpeters who also bore their part in the worlds pageantries and ate greedily at great folks tables all this to the refrain of so much carry the winds away  probably there was some melancholy in his mind for a yet lower grade and montigny and colin de cayeux clattering their bones on paris gibbet  alas and with so pitiful an experience of life villon can offer us nothing but terror and lamentation about death  no one has ever more skilfully communicated his own disenchantment no one ever blown a more earpiercing note of sadness  this unrepentant thief can attain neither to christian confidence nor to the spirit of the bright greek saying that whom the gods love die early  it is a poor heart and a poorer age that cannot accept the conditions of life with some heroic readiness       the date of the large testament is the last date in the poets biography  after having achieved that admirable and despicable performance he disappears into the night from whence he came  how or when he died whether decently in bed or trussed up to a gallows remains a riddle for foolhardy commentators  it appears his health had suffered in the pit at meun he was thirty years of age and quite bald with the notch in his under lip where sermaise had struck him with the sword and what wrinkles the reader may imagine  in default of portraits this is all i have been able to piece together and perhaps even the baldness should be taken as a figure of his destitution  a sinister dog in all likelihood but with a look in his eye and the loose flexile mouth that goes with wit and an overweening sensual temperament  certainly the sorriest figure on the rolls of fame    chapter vii  charles of orleans    for one who was no great politician nor as men go especially wise capable or virtuous charles of orleans is more than usually enviable to all who love that better sort of fame which consists in being known not widely but intimately  to be content that time to come should know there was such a man not caring whether they knew more of him or to subsist under naked denominations without deserts or noble acts is says sir thomas browne a frigid ambition  it is to some more specific memory that youth looks forward in its vigils  old kings are sometimes disinterred in all the emphasis of life the hands untainted by decay the beard that had so often wagged in camp or senate still spread upon the royal bosom and in busts and pictures some similitude of the great and beautiful of former days is handed down  in this way public curiosity may be gratified but hardly any private aspiration after fame  it is not likely that posterity will fall in love with us but not impossible that it may respect or sympathise and so a man would rather leave behind him the portrait of his spirit than a portrait of his face figura animi magis quam corporis of those who have thus survived themselves most completely left a sort of personal seduction behind them in the world and retained after death the art of making friends montaigne and samuel johnson certainly stand first but we have portraits of all sorts of men from august caesar to the kings dwarf and all sorts of portraits from a titian treasured in the louvre to a profile over the grocers chimney shelf  and so in a less degree but no less truly than the spirit of montaigne lives on in the delightful essays that of charles of orleans survives in a few old songs and old accountbooks and it is still in the choice of the reader to make this dukes acquaintance and if their humours suit become his friend   i   his birth  if we are to argue from a mans parents  was above his merit  it is not merely that he was the grandson of one king the father of another and the uncle of a third but something more specious was to be looked for from the son of his father louis de valois duke of orleans brother to the mad king charles vi lover of queen isabel and the leading patron of art and one of the leading politicians in france  and the poet might have inherited yet higher virtues from his mother valentina of milan a very pathetic figure of the age the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband and the friend of a most unhappy king  the father beautiful eloquent and accomplished exercised a strange fascination over his contemporaries and among those who dip nowadays into the annals of the time there are not many  and these few are little to be envied  who can resist the fascination of the mother  all mankind owe her a debt of gratitude because she brought some comfort into the life of the poor madman who wore the crown of france  born may 1391 of such a noble stock charles was to know from the first all favours of nature and art  his fathers gardens were the admiration of his contemporaries his castles were situated in the most agreeable parts of france and sumptuously adorned  we have preserved in an inventory of 1403 the description of tapestried rooms where charles may have played in childhood 1  a green room with the ceiling full of angels and the dossier of shepherds and shepherdesses seeming faisant contenance to eat nuts and cherries  a room of gold silk and worsted with a device of little children in a river and the sky full of birds  a room of green tapestry showing a knight and lady at chess in a pavilion  another green room with shepherdesses in a trellised garden worked in gold and silk  a carpet representing cherrytrees where there is a fountain and a lady gathering cherries in a basin  these were some of the pictures over which his fancy might busy itself of an afternoon or at morning as he lay awake in bed  with our deeper and more logical sense of life we can have no idea how large a space in the attention of mediaeval men might be occupied by such figured hangings on the wall  there was something timid and purblind in the view they had of the world  morally they saw nothing outside of traditional axioms and little of the physical aspect of things entered vividly into their mind beyond what was to be seen on church windows and the walls and floors of palaces  the reader will remember how villons mother conceived of heaven and hell and took all her scanty stock of theology from the stained glass that threw its light upon her as she prayed  and there is scarcely a detail of external effect in the chronicles and romances of the time but might have been borrowed at second hand from a piece of tapestry  it was a stage in the history of mankind which we may see paralleled to some extent in the first infant school where the representations of lions and elephants alternate round the wall with moral verses and trite presentments of the lesser virtues  so that to live in a house of many pictures was tantamount for the time to a liberal education in itself  1 champollionfigeacs louis et charles dorleans p 348  at charless birth an order of knighthood was inaugurated in his honour  at nine years old he was a squire at eleven he had the escort of a chaplain and a schoolmaster at twelve his uncle the king made him a pension of twelve thousand livres dor 1  he saw the most brilliant and the most learned persons of france in his fathers court and would not fail to notice that these brilliant and learned persons were one and all engaged in rhyming  indeed if it is difficult to realise the part played by pictures it is perhaps even more difficult to realise that played by verses in the polite and active history of the age  at the siege of pontoise english and french exchanged defiant ballades over the walls 2  if a scandal happened as in the loathsome thirtythird story of the cent nouvelles nouvelles all the wits must make rondels and chansonettes which they would hand from one to another with an unmanly sneer  ladies carried their favourites ballades in their girdles 3 margaret of scotland all the world knows already kissed alain chartiers lips in honour of the many virtuous thoughts and golden sayings they had uttered but it is not so well known that this princess was herself the most industrious of poetasters that she is supposed to have hastened her death by her literary vigils and sometimes wrote as many as twelve rondels in the day 4  it was in rhyme even that the young charles should learn his lessons  he might get all manner of instruction in the truly noble art of the chase not without a smack of ethics by the way from the compendious didactic poem of gace de la bigne  nay and it was in rhyme that he should learn rhyming in the verses of his fathers maitre dhotel eustache deschamps which treated of lart de dictier et de faire chancons ballades virelais et rondeaux along with many other matters worth attention from the courts of heaven to the misgovernment of france 5  at this rate all knowledge is to be had in a goody and the end of it is an old song  we need not wonder when we hear from monstrelet that charles was a very well educated person  he could string latin texts together by the hour and make ballades and rondels better than eustache deschamps himself  he had seen a mad king who would not change his clothes and a drunken emperor who could not keep his hand from the winecup  he had spoken a great deal with jesters and fiddlers and with the profligate lords who helped his father to waste the revenues of france  he had seen ladies dance on into broad daylight and much burning of torches and waste of dainties and good wine 6  and when all is said it was no very helpful preparation for the battle of life  i believe louis xi writes comines would not have saved himself if he had not been very differently brought up from such other lords as i have seen educated in this country for these were taught nothing but to play the jackanapes with finery and fine words 7  i am afraid charles took such lessons to heart and conceived of life as a season principally for junketing and war  his view of the whole duty of man so empty vain and wearisome to us was yet sincerely and consistently held  when he came in his ripe years to compare the glory of two kingdoms england and france it was on three points only  pleasures valour and riches  that he cared to measure them and in the very outset of that tract he speaks of the life of the great as passed whether in arms as in assaults battles and sieges or in jousts and tournaments in high and stately festivities and in funeral solemnities 8  1 dhericaults admirable memoir prefixed to his edition of charless works vol i p xi 2 vallet de viriville charles

facts cited and expressions borrowed in this paragraph from a period extending over almost the whole of charless life instead of being confined entirely to his boyhood  as i do not believe there was any change so i do not believe there is any anachronism involved 8 the debate between the heralds of france and england translated and admirably edited by mr henry pyne  for the attribution of this tract to charles the reader is referred to mr pynes conclusive argument  when he was no more than thirteen his father had him affianced to isabella virginwidow of our richard ii and daughter of his uncle charles vi and two years after june 29 1406 the cousins were married at compiegne he fifteen she seventeen years of age  it was in every way a most desirable match  the bride brought five hundred thousand francs of dowry  the ceremony was of the utmost magnificence louis of orleans figuring in crimson velvet adorned with no less than seven hundred and ninetyfive pearls gathered together expressly for this occasion  and no doubt it must have been very gratifying for a young gentleman of fifteen to play the chief part in a pageant so gaily put upon the stage  only the bridegroom might have been a little older and as illluck would have it the bride herself was of this way of thinking and would not be consoled for the loss of her title as queen or the contemptible age of her new husband  pleuroit fort ladite isabeau the said isabella wept copiously 1  it is fairly debatable whether charles was much to be pitied when three years later september 1409 this odd marriage was dissolved by death  short as it was however this connection left a lasting stamp upon his mind and we find that in the last decade of his life and after he had remarried for perhaps the second time he had not yet forgotten or forgiven the violent death of richard ii  ce mauvais cas  that ugly business he writes has yet to be avenged  1 des ursins  the marriage festivity was on the threshold of evil days the great rivalry between louis of orleans and john the fearless duke of burgundy had been forsworn with the most reverend solemnities  but the feud was only in abeyance and john of burgundy still conspired in secret  on november 23 1407  in that black winter when the frost lasted sixand sixty days on end  a summons from the king reached louis of orleans at the hotel barbette where he had been supping with queen isabel  it was seven or eight in the evening and the inhabitants of the quarter were abed  he set forth in haste accompanied by two squires riding on one horse a page and a few varlets running with torches  as he rode he hummed to himself and trifled with his glove  and so riding he was beset by the bravoes of his enemy and slain  my lord of burgundy set an ill precedent in this deed as he found some years after on the bridge of montereau and even in the meantime he did not profit quietly by his rivals death  the horror of the other princes seems to have perturbed himself he avowed his guilt in the council tried to brazen it out finally lost heart and fled at full gallop cutting bridges behind him towards bapaume and lille  and so there we have the head of one faction who had just made himself the most formidable man in france engaged in a remarkably hurried journey with black care on the pillion  and meantime on the other side the widowed duchess came to paris in appropriate mourning to demand justice for her husbands death  charles vi who was then in a lucid interval did probably all that he could when he raised up the kneeling suppliant with kisses and smooth words  things were at a deadlock  the criminal might be in the sorriest fright but he was still the greatest of vassals  justice was easy to ask and not difficult to promise how it was to be executed was another question  no one in france was strong enough to punish john of burgundy and perhaps no one except the widow very sincere in wishing to punish him  she indeed was eaten up of zeal but the intensity of her eagerness wore her out and she died about a year after the murder of grief and indignation unrequited love and unsatisfied resentment  it was during the last months of her life that this fiery and generous woman seeing the soft hearts of her own children looked with envy on a certain natural son of her husbands destined to become famous in the sequel as the bastard of orleans or the brave dunois  you were stolen from me she said it is you who are fit to avenge your father  these are not the words of ordinary mourning or of an ordinary woman  it is a saying over which balzac would have rubbed his episcopal hands  that the child who was to avenge her husband had not been born out of her body was a thing intolerable to valentina of milan and the expression of this singular and tragic jealousy is preserved to us by a rare chance in such straightforward and vivid words as we are accustomed to hear only on the stress of actual life or in the theatre  in history  where we see things as in a glass darkly and the fashion of former times is brought before us deplorably adulterated and defaced fitted to very vague and pompous words and strained through many mens minds of everything personal or precise  this speech of the widowed duchess startles a reader somewhat as the footprint startled robinson crusoe  a human voice breaks in upon the silence of the study and the student is aware of a fellowcreature in his world of documents  with such a clue in hand one may imagine how this wounded lioness would spur and exasperate the resentment of her children and what would be the last words of counsel and command she left behind her  with these instancies of his dying mother  almost a voice from the tomb  still tingling in his ears the position of young charles of orleans when he was left at the head of that great house was curiously similar to that of shakspeares hamlet  the times were out of joint here was a murdered father to avenge on a powerful murderer and here in both cases a lad of inactive disposition born to set these matters right  valentinas commendation of dunois involved a judgment on charles and that judgment was exactly correct  whoever might be charles was not the man to avenge his father  like hamlet this son of a dear father murdered was sincerely grieved at heart  like hamlet too he could unpack his heart with words and wrote a most eloquent letter to the king complaining that what was denied to him would not be denied to the lowest born and poorest man on earth even in his private hours he strove to preserve a lively recollection of his injury and keep up the native hue of resolution  he had gems engraved with appropriate legends hortatory or threatening dieu le scet god knows it or souvenezvous de   remember 1  it is only towards the end that the two stories begin to differ and in some points the historical version is the more tragic  hamlet only stabbed a silly old councillor behind the arras charles of orleans trampled france for five years under the hoofs of his banditti  the miscarriage of hamlets vengeance was confined at widest to the palace the ruin wrought by charles of orleans was as broad as france  1 michelet iv  app  179 p 337  yet the first act of the young duke is worthy of honourable mention  prodigal louis had made enormous debts and there is a story extant to illustrate how lightly he himself regarded these commercial obligations  it appears that louis after a narrow escape he made in a thunderstorm had a smart access of penitence and announced he would pay his debts on the following sunday  more than eight hundred creditors presented themselves but by that time the devil was well again and they were shown the door with more gaiety than politeness  a time when such cynical dishonesty was possible for a man of culture is not it will be granted a fortunate epoch for creditors  when the original debtor was so lax we may imagine how an heir would deal with the incumbrances of his inheritance  on the death of philip the forward father of that john the fearless whom we have seen at work the widow went through the ceremony of a public renunciation of goods taking off her purse and girdle she left them on the grave and thus by one notable act cancelled her husbands debts and defamed his honour  the conduct of young charles of orleans was very different  to meet the joint liabilities of his father and mother for valentina also was lavish he had to sell or pledge a quantity of jewels and yet he would not take advantage of a pretext even legally valid to diminish the amount  thus one godefroi lefevre having disbursed many odd sums for the late duke and received or kept no vouchers charles ordered that he should be believed upon his oath 1  to a modern mind this seems as honourable to his fathers memory as if john the fearless had been hanged as high as haman  and as things fell out except a recantation from the university of paris which had justified the murder out of party feeling and various other purely paper reparations this was about the outside of what charles was to effect in that direction he lived five years and grew up from sixteen to twentyone in the midst of the most horrible civil war or series of civil wars that ever devastated france and from first to last his wars were illstarred or else his victories useless  two years after the murder march 1409 john the fearless having the upper hand for the moment a shameful and useless reconciliation took place by the kings command in the church of our lady at chartres  the advocate of the duke of burgundy stated that louis of orleans had been killed for the good of the kings person and realm  charles and his brothers with tears of shame under protest pour ne pas desobeir au roi forgave their fathers murderer and swore peace upon the missal  it was as i say a shameful and useless ceremony the very greffier entering it in his register wrote in the margin pax pax inquit propheta et non est pax 2  charles was soon after allied with the abominable bernard darmagnac even betrothed or married to a daughter of his called by a name that sounds like a contradiction in terms bonne darmagnac  from that time forth throughout all this monstrous period  a very nightmare in the history of france  he is no more than a stalkinghorse for the ambitious gascon  sometimes the smoke lifts and you can see him for the twinkling of an eye a very pale figure at one moment there is a rumour he will be crowned king at another when the uproar has subsided he will be heard still crying out for justice and the next 1412 he is showing himself to the applauding populace on the same horse with john of burgundy  but these are exceptional seasons and for the most part he merely rides at the gascons bridle over devastated france  his very party go not by the name of orleans but by the name of armagnac paris is in the hands of the butchers the peasants have taken to the woods  alliances are made and broken as if in a country dance the english called in now by this one now by the other  poor people sing in church with white faces and lamentable music domine jesu parce populo tuo dirige in viam pacis principes  and the end and upshot of the whole affair for charles of orleans is another peace with john the fearless  france is once more tranquil with the tranquillity of ruin he may ride home again to blois and look with what countenance he may on those gems he had got engraved in the early days of his resentment souvenezvous de    remember  he has killed polonius to be sure but the king is never a penny the worse  1 champollionfigeac pp 27982 2 michelet iv pp 1234   ii   from the battle of agincourt oct 1415 dates the second period of charless life  the english reader will remember the name of orleans in the play of henry v and it is at least odd that we can trace a resemblance between the puppet and the original  the interjection i have heard a sonnet begin so to ones mistress act iii scene 7 may very well indicate one who was already an expert in that sort of trifle and the game of proverbs he plays with the constable in the same scene would be quite in character for a man who spent many years of his life capping verses with his courtiers  certainly charles was in the great battle with five hundred lances say three thousand men and there he was made prisoner as he led the van  according to one story some ragged english archer shot him down and some diligent english pistol hunting ransoms on the field of battle extracted him from under a heap of bodies and retailed him to our king henry  he was the most important capture of the day and used with all consideration  on the way to calais henry sent him a present of bread and wine and bread you will remember was an article of luxury in the english camp but charles would neither eat nor drink  thereupon henry came to visit him in his quarters  noble cousin said he how are you  charles replied that he was well  why then do you neither eat nor drink  and then with some asperity as i imagine the young duke told him that truly he had no inclination for food  and our henry improved the occasion with something of a snuffle assuring his prisoner that god had fought against the french on account of their manifold sins and transgressions  upon this there supervened the agonies of a rough sea passage and many french lords charles certainly among the number declared they would rather endure such another defeat than such another sore trial on shipboard  charles indeed never forgot his sufferings  long afterwards he declared his hatred to a seafaring life and willingly yielded to england the empire of the seas because there is danger and loss of life and god knows what pity when it storms and seasickness is for many people hard to bear and the rough life that must be led is little suitable for the nobility 1 which of all babyish utterances that ever fell from any public man may surely bear the bell  scarcely disembarked he followed his victor with such wry face as we may fancy through the streets of holiday london  and then the doors closed upon his last day of garish life for more than a quarter of a century  after a boyhood passed in the dissipations of a luxurious court or in the camp of war his ears still stunned and his cheeks still burning from his enemies jubilations out of all this ringing of english bells and singing of english anthems from among all these shouting citizens in scarlet cloaks and beautiful virgins attired in white he passed into the silence and solitude of a political prison 2  1 debate between the heralds 2 sir h nicholas agincourt  his captivity was not without alleviations  he was allowed to go hawking and he found england an admirable country for the sport he was a favourite with english ladies and admired their beauty and he did not lack for money wine or books he was honourably imprisoned in the strongholds of great nobles in windsor castle and the tower of london  but when all is said he was a prisoner for fiveandtwenty years  for fiveandtwenty years he could not go where he would or do what he liked or speak with any but his gaolers  we may talk very wisely of alleviations there is only one alleviation for which the man would thank you he would thank you to open the door  with what regret scottish james i bethought him in the next room perhaps to charles of the time when he rose as early as the day  what would he not have given to wet his boots once more with morning dew and follow his vagrant fancy among the meadows  the only alleviation to the misery of constraint lies in the disposition of the prisoner  to each one this place of discipline brings his own lesson  it stirs latude or baron trenck into heroic action it is a hermitage for pious and conformable spirits  beranger tells us he found prison life with its regular hours and long evenings both pleasant and profitable  the pilgrims progress and don quixote were begun in prison  it was after they were become to use the words of one of them oh worst imprisonment  the dungeon of themselves that homer and milton worked so hard and so well for the profit of mankind  in the year 1415 henry v had two distinguished prisoners french charles of orleans and scottish james i who whiled away the hours of their captivity with rhyming  indeed there can be no better pastime for a lonely man than the mechanical exercise of verse  such intricate forms as charles had been used to from childhood the ballade with its scanty rhymes the rondel with the recurrence first of the whole then of half the burthen in thirteen verses seem to have been invented for the prison and the sick bed  the common scotch saying on the sight of anything operose and finical he must have had little to do that made that might be put as epigraph on all the song books of old france  making such sorts of verse belongs to the same class of pleasures as guessing acrostics or burying proverbs  it is almost purely formal almost purely verbal  it must be done gently and gingerly  it keeps the mind occupied a long time and never so intently as to be distressing for anything like strain is against the very nature of the craft  sometimes things go easily the refrains fall into their place as if of their own accord and it becomes something of the nature of an intellectual tennis you must make your poem as the rhymes will go just as you must strike your ball as your adversary played it  so that these forms are suitable rather for those who wish to make verses than for those who wish to express opinions sometimes on the other hand difficulties arise rival verses come into a mans head and fugitive words elude his memory  then it is that he enjoys at the same time the deliberate pleasures of a connoisseur comparing wines and the ardour of the chase  he may have been sitting all day long in prison with folded hands but when he goes to bed the retrospect will seem animated and eventful  besides confirming himself as an habitual maker of verses charles acquired some new opinions during his captivity  he was perpetually reminded of the change that had befallen him he found the climate of england cold and prejudicial to the human frame he had a great contempt for english fruit and english beer even the coal fires were unpleasing in his eyes 1  he was rooted up from among his friends and customs and the places that had known him  and so in this strange land he began to learn the love of his own  sad people all the world over are like to be moved when the wind is in some particular quarter  so burns preferred when it was in the west and blew to him from his mistress so the girl in the ballade looking south to yarrow thought it might carry a kiss betwixt her and her gallant and so we find charles singing of the pleasant wind that comes from france 2  one day at doveronthesea he looked across the straits and saw the sandhills about calais  and it happened to him he tells us in a ballade to remember his happiness over there in the past and he was both sad and merry at the recollection and could not have his fill of gazing on the shores of france 3  although guilty of unpatriotic acts he had never been exactly unpatriotic in feeling  but his sojourn in england gave for the time at least some consistency to what had been a very weak and ineffectual prejudice  he must have been under the influence of more than usually solemn considerations when he proceeded to turn henrys puritanical homily after agincourt into a ballade and reproach france and himself by implication with pride gluttony idleness unbridled covetousness and sensuality 4  for the moment he must really have been thinking more of france than of charles of orleans  1 debate between the heralds 2 works ed dhericault i 43 3 ibid 143 4 works ed dhericault i 190  and another lesson he learned  he who was only to be released in case of peace begins to think upon the disadvantages of war pray for peace is his refrain a strange enough subject for the ally of bernard darmagnac 1  but this lesson was plain and practical it had one side in particular that was specially attractive for charles and he did not hesitate to explain it in so many words everybody he writes  i translate roughly  everybody should be much inclined to peace for everybody has a deal to gain by it 2  1 ibid 144 2 ibid 158  charles made laudable endeavours to acquire english and even learned to write a rondel in that tongue of quite average mediocrity 1  he was for some time billeted on the unhappy suffolk who received fourteen shillings and fourpence a day for his expenses and from the fact that suffolk afterwards visited charles in france while he was negotiating the marriage of henry vi as well as the terms of that noblemans impeachment we may believe there was some not unkindly intercourse between the prisoner and his gaoler a fact of considerable interest when we remember that suffolks wife was the granddaughter of the poet geoffrey chaucer 2 apart from this and a mere catalogue of dates and places only one thing seems evident in the story of charless captivity  it seems evident that as these fiveandtwenty years drew on he became less and less resigned circumstances were against the growth of such a feeling  one after another of his fellowprisoners was ransomed and went home  more than once he was himself permitted to visit france where he worked on abortive treaties and showed himself more eager for his own deliverance than for the profit of his native land  resignation may follow after a reasonable time upon despair but if a man is persecuted by a series of brief and irritating hopes his mind no more attains to a settled frame of resolution than his eye would grow familiar with a night of thunder and lightning  years after when he was speaking at the trial of that duke of alencon who began life so hopefully as the boyish favourite of joan of arc he sought to prove that captivity was a harder punishment than death  for i have had experience myself he said and in my prison of england for the weariness danger and displeasure in which i then lay i have many a time wished i had been slain at the battle where they took me 3  this is a flourish if you will but it is something more  his spirit would sometimes rise up in a fine anger against the petty desires and contrarieties of life  he would compare his own condition with the quiet and dignified estate of the dead and aspire to lie among his comrades on the field of agincourt as the psalmist prayed to have the wings of a dove and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea  but such high thoughts came to charles only in a flash  1 m champollionfigeac gives many in his editions of charless works most as i should think of very doubtful authenticity or worse 2 rymer x 564  dhericaults memoir p xli  gairdners paston letters i 27 99 3 champollionfigeac 377  john the fearless had been murdered in his turn on the bridge of montereau so far back as 1419  his son philip the good  partly to extinguish the feud partly that he might do a popular action and partly in view of his ambitious schemes to detach another great vassal from the throne of france  had taken up the cause of charles of orleans and negotiated diligently for his release  in 1433 a burgundian embassy was admitted to an interview with the captive duke in the presence of suffolk  charles shook hands most affectionately with the ambassadors  they asked after his health  i am well enough in body he replied but far from well in mind i am dying of grief at having to pass the best days of my life in prison with none to sympathise  the talk falling on the chances of peace charles referred to suffolk if he were not sincere and constant in his endeavours to bring it about  if peace depended on me he said i should procure it gladly were it to cost me my life seven days after  we may take this as showing what a large price he set not so much on peace as on seven days of freedom  seven days  he would make them seven years in the employment  finally he assured the ambassadors of his good will to philip of burgundy squeezed one of them by the hand and nipped him twice in the arm to signify things unspeakable before suffolk and two days after sent them suffolks barber one jean carnet a native of lille to testify more freely of his sentiments  as i speak french said this emissary the duke of orleans is more familiar with me than with any other of the household and i can bear witness he never said anything against duke philip 1  it will be remembered that this person with whom he was so anxious to stand well was no other than his hereditary enemy the son of his fathers murderer  but the honest fellow bore no malice indeed not he  he began exchanging ballades with philip whom he apostrophises as his companion his cousin and his brother  he assures him that soul and body he is altogether burgundian and protests that he has given his heart in pledge to him  regarded as the history of a vendetta it must be owned that charless life has points of some originality  and yet there is an engaging frankness about these ballades which disarms criticism 2  you see charles throwing himself headforemost into the trap you hear burgundy in his answers begin to inspire him with his own prejudices and draw melancholy pictures of the misgovernment of france  but charless own spirits are so high and so amiable and he is so thoroughly convinced his cousin is a fine fellow that ones scruples are carried away in the torrent of his happiness and gratitude  and his would be a sordid spirit who would not clap hands at the consummation nov 1440 when charles after having sworn on the sacrament that he would never again bear arms against england and pledged himself body and soul to the unpatriotic faction in his own country set out from london with a light heart and a damaged integrity  1 dom plancher iv 1789 2 works i 15763  in the magnificent copy of charless poems given by our henry vii to elizabeth of york on the occasion of their marriage a large illumination figures at the head of one of the pages which in chronological perspective is almost a history of his imprisonment  it gives a view of london with all its spires the river passing through the old bridge and busy with boats  one side of the white tower has been taken out and we can see as under a sort of shrine the paved room where the duke sits writing  he occupies a highbacked bench in front of a great chimney red and black ink are before him and the upper end of the apartment is guarded by many halberdiers with the red cross of england on their breast  on the next side of the tower he appears again leaning out of window and gazing on the river doubtless there blows just then a pleasant wind from out the land of france and some ship comes up the river the ship of good news  at the door we find him yet again this time embracing a messenger while a groom stands by holding two saddled horses  and yet further to the left a cavalcade defiles out of the tower the duke is on his way at last towards the sunshine of france   iii   during the fiveandtwenty years of his captivity charles had not lost in the esteem of his fellowcountrymen  for so young a man the head of so great a house and so numerous a party to be taken prisoner as he rode in the vanguard of france and stereotyped for all men in this heroic attitude was to taste untimeously the honours of the grave  of him as of the dead it would be ungenerous to speak evil what little energy he had displayed would be remembered with piety when all that he had done amiss was courteously forgotten  as english folk looked for arthur as danes awaited the coming of ogier as somersetshire peasants or sergeants of the old guard expected the return of monmouth or napoleon the countrymen of charles of orleans looked over the straits towards his english prison with desire and confidence  events had so fallen out while he was rhyming ballades that he had become the type of all that was most truly patriotic  the remnants of his old party had been the chief defenders of the unity of france  his enemies of burgundy had been notoriously favourers and furtherers of english domination  people forgot that his brother still lay by the heels for an unpatriotic treaty with england because charles himself had been taken prisoner patriotically fighting against it  that henry v had left special orders against his liberation served to increase the wistful pity with which he was regarded  and when in defiance of all contemporary virtue and against express pledges the english carried war into their prisoners fief not only france but all thinking men in christendom were roused to indignation against the oppressors and sympathy with the victim  it was little wonder if he came to bulk somewhat largely in the imagination of the best of those at home  charles le boutteillier when as the story goes he slew clarence at beauge was only seeking an exchange for charles of orleans 1  it was one of joan of arcs declared intentions to deliver the captive duke  if there was no other way she meant to cross the seas and bring him home by force  and she professed before her judges a sure knowledge that charles of orleans was beloved of god 2  1 vallets charles vii i 251 2 proces de jeanne darc i 13355  alas it was not at all as a deliverer that charles returned to france  he was nearly fifty years old  many changes had been accomplished since at twentythree he was taken on the field of agincourt  but of all these he was profoundly ignorant or had only heard of them in the discoloured reports of philip of burgundy  he had the ideas of a former generation and sought to correct them by the scandal of a factious party  with such qualifications he came back eager for the domination the pleasures and the display that befitted his princely birth  a long disuse of all political activity combined with the flatteries of his new friends to fill him with an overweening conceit of his own capacity and influence  if aught had gone wrong in his absence it seemed quite natural men should look to him for its redress  was not king arthur come again  the duke of burgundy received him with politic honours  he took his guest by his foible for pageantry all the easier as it was a foible of his own and charles walked right out of prison into much the same atmosphere of trumpeting and bell ringing as he had left behind when he went in  fifteen days after his deliverance he was married to mary of cleves at st omer  the marriage was celebrated with the usual pomp of the burgundian court there were joustings and illuminations and animals that spouted wine and many nobles dined together comme en brigade and were served abundantly with many rich and curious dishes 1  it must have reminded charles not a little of his first marriage at compiegne only then he was two years the junior of his bride and this time he was fiveandthirty years her senior  it will be a fine question which marriage promises more for a boy of fifteen to lead off with a lass of seventeen or a man of fifty to make a match of it with a child of fifteen  but there was something bitter in both  the lamentations of isabella will not have been forgotten  as for mary she took up with one jaquet de la lain a sort of muscular methody of the period with a huge appetite for tournaments and a habit of confessing himself the last thing before he went to bed 2 with such a hero the young duchesss amours were most likely innocent and in all other ways she was a suitable partner for the duke and well fitted to enter into his pleasures  1 monstrelet 2 vallets charles vii iii chap i   but see the chronicle that bears jaquets name a lean and dreary book  when the festivities at saint omer had come to an end charles and his wife set forth by ghent and tourney  the towns gave him offerings of money as he passed through to help in the payment of his ransom  from all sides ladies and gentlemen thronged to offer him their services some gave him their sons for pages some archers for a bodyguard and by the time he reached tournay he had a following of 300 horse  everywhere he was received as though he had been the king of france 1  if he did not come to imagine himself something of the sort he certainly forgot the existence of any one with a better claim to the title  he conducted himself on the hypothesis that charles vii was another charles vi  he signed with enthusiasm that treaty of arras which left france almost at the discretion of burgundy  on december 18 he was still no farther than bruges where he entered into a private treaty with philip and it was not until january 14 ten weeks after he disembarked in france and attended by a ruck of burgundian gentlemen that he arrived in paris and offered to present himself before charles vii  the king sent word that he might come if he would with a small retinue but not with his present following and the duke who was mightily on his high horse after all the ovations he had received took the kings attitude amiss and turned aside into touraine to receive more welcome and more presents and be convoyed by torchlight into faithful cities  1 monstrelet  and so you see here was king arthur home again and matters nowise mended in consequence  the best we can say is that this last stage of charless public life was of no long duration  his confidence was soon knocked out of him in the contact with others  he began to find he was an earthen vessel among many vessels of brass he began to be shrewdly aware that he was no king arthur  in 1442 at limoges he made himself the spokesman of the malcontent nobility  the king showed himself humiliatingly indifferent to his counsels and humiliatingly generous towards his necessities and there with some blushes he may be said to have taken farewell of the political stage  a feeble attempt on the county of asti is scarce worth the name of exception thenceforward let ambition wile whom she may into the turmoil of events our duke will walk cannily in his wellordered garden or sit by the fire to touch the slender reed 1  1 dhericaults memoir xl xli  vallet charles vi ii 435   iv   if it were given each of us to transplant his life wherever he pleased in time or space with all the ages and all the countries of the world to choose from there would be quite an instructive diversity of taste  a certain sedentary majority would prefer to remain where they were  many would choose the renaissance many some stately and simple period of grecian life and still more elect to pass a few years wandering among the villages of palestine with an inspired conductor  for some of our quaintly vicious contemporaries we have the decline of the roman empire and the reign of henry iii of france  but there are others not quite so vicious who yet cannot look upon the world with perfect gravity who have never taken the categorical imperative to wife and have more taste for what is comfortable than for what is magnanimous and high and i can imagine some of these casting their lot in the court of blois during the last twenty years of the life of charles of orleans  the duke and duchess their staff of officers and ladies and the highborn and learned persons who were attracted to blois on a visit formed a society for killing time and perfecting each other in various elegant accomplishments such as we might imagine for an ideal wateringplace in the delectable mountains  the company hunted and went on pleasureparties they played chess tables and many other games  what we now call the history of the period passed i imagine over the heads of these good people much as it passes over our own news reached them indeed of great and joyful import william peel received eight livres and five sous from the duchess when he brought the first tidings that rouen was recaptured from the english 1  a little later and the duke sang in a truly patriotic vein the deliverance of guyenne and normandy 2  they were liberal of rhymes and largesse and welcomed the prosperity of their country much as they welcomed the coming of spring and with no more thought of collaborating towards the event  religion was not forgotten in the court of blois  pilgrimages were agreeable and picturesque excursions  in those days a wellserved chapel was something like a good vinery in our own an opportunity for display and the source of mild enjoyments  there was probably something of his rooted delight in pageantry as well as a good deal of gentle piety in the feelings with which charles gave dinner every friday to thirteen poor people served them himself and washed their feet with his own hands 3  solemn affairs would interest charles and his courtiers from their trivial side  the duke perhaps cared less for the deliverance of guyenne and normandy than for his own verses on the occasion just as dr russells correspondence in the times was among the most material parts of the crimean war for that talented correspondent  and i think it scarcely cynical to suppose that religion as well as patriotism was principally cultivated as a means of filling up the day  1 champollionfigeac 368 2 works i 115 3 dhericaults memoir xlv  it was not only messengers fiery red with haste and charged with the destiny of nations who were made welcome at the gates of blois  if any man of accomplishment came that way he was sure of an audience and something for his pocket the courtiers would have received ben jonson like drummond of hawthornden and a good pugilist like captain barclay  they were catholic as none but the entirely idle can be catholic it might be pierre called dieu damours the juggler or it might be three high english minstrels or the two men players of ghitterns from the kingdom of scotland who sang the destruction of the turks or again jehan rognelet player of instruments of music who played and danced with his wife and two children they would each be called into the castle to give a taste of his proficiency before my lord the duke 1  sometimes the performance was of a more personal interest and produced much the same sensations as are felt on an english green on the arrival of a professional cricketer or round an english billiard table during a match between roberts and cooke  this was when jehan negre the lombard came to blois and played chess against all these chessplayers and won much money from my lord and his intimates or when baudet harenc of chalons made ballades before all these ballademakers 2  1 champoilionfigeac 381 361 381 2 champollionfigeac 359361  it will not surprise the reader to learn they were all makers of ballades and rondels  to write verses for may day seems to have been as much a matter of course as to ride out with the cavalcade that went to gather hawthorn  the choice of valentines was a standing challenge and the courtiers pelted each other with humorous and sentimental verses as in a literary carnival  if an indecorous adventure befell our friend maistre estienne le gout my lord the duke would turn it into the funniest of rondels all the rhymes being the names of the cases of nouns or the moods of verbs and maistre estienne would make reply in similar fashion seeking to prune the story of its more humiliating episodes  if fredet was too long away from court a rondel went to upbraid him and it was in a rondel that fredet would excuse himself sometimes two or three or as many as a dozen would set to work on the same refrain the same idea or in the same macaronic jargon  some of the poetasters were heavy enough others were not wanting in address and the duchess herself was among those who most excelled  on one occasion eleven competitors made a ballade on the idea   i die of thirst beside the fountains edge je meurs de soif empres de la fontaine   these eleven ballades still exist and one of them arrests the attention rather from the name of the author than from any special merit in itself  it purports to be the work of francois villon and so far as a foreigner can judge which is indeed a small way it may very well be his  nay and if any one thing is more probable than another in the great tabula rasa or unknown land which we are fain to call the biography of villon it seems probable enough that he may have gone upon a visit to charles of orleans  where master baudet harenc of chalons found a sympathetic or perhaps a derisive audience for who can tell nowadays the degree of baudets excellence in his art favour would not be wanting for the greatest ballademaker of all time  great as would seem the incongruity it may have pleased charles to own a sort of kinship with ragged singers and whimsically regard himself as one of the confraternity of poets  and he would have other grounds of intimacy with villon  a room looking upon windsor gardens is a different matter from villons dungeon at meun yet each in his own degree had been tried in prison  each in his own way also loved the good things of this life and the service of the muses  but the same gulf that separated burns from his edinburgh patrons would separate the singer of bohemia from the rhyming duke  and it is hard to imagine that villons training amongst thieves loose women and vagabond students had fitted him to move in a society of any dignity and courtliness  ballades are very admirable things and a poet is doubtless a most interesting visitor  but among the courtiers of charles there would be considerable regard for the proprieties of etiquette and even a duke will sometimes have an eye to his teaspoons moreover as a poet i can conceive he may have disappointed expectation  it need surprise nobody if villons ballade on the theme  i die of thirst beside the fountains edge  was but a poor performance  he would make better verses on the leeside of a flagon at the sign of the pomme du pin than in a cushioned settle in the halls of blois  charles liked change of place  he was often not so much travelling as making a progress now to join the king for some great tournament now to visit king rene at tarascon where he had a study of his own and saw all manner of interesting things  oriental curios king rene painting birds and what particularly pleased him triboulet the dwarf jester whose skullcap was no bigger than an orange 1  sometimes the journeys were set about on horseback in a large party with the fourriers sent forward to prepare a lodging at the next stage  we find almost gargantuan details of the provision made by these officers against the dukes arrival of eggs and butter and bread cheese and peas and chickens pike and bream and barbel and wine both white and red 2  sometimes he went by water in a barge playing chess or tables with a friend in the pavilion or watching other vessels as they went before the wind 3  children ran along the bank as they do to this day on the crinan canal and when charles threw in money they would dive and bring it up 4  as he looked on at their exploits i wonder whether that room of gold and silk and worsted came back into his memory with the device of little children in a river and the sky full of birds  1 lecoy de la marche roi rene ii 155 177 2 champollionfigeac chaps v and vi 3 ibid 364 works i 172 4 champollionfigeac 364 jeter de largent aux petis enfans qui estoient au long de bourbon pour les faire nonner en leau et aller querre largent au fond  he was a bit of a bookfancier and had vied with his brother angouleme in bringing back the library of their grandfather charles v when bedford put it up for sale in london 1 the duchess had a library of her own and we hear of her borrowing romances from ladies in attendance on the blue stocking margaret of scotland 2  not only were books collected but new books were written at the court of blois the widow of one jean fougere a bookbinder seems to have done a number of odd commissions for the bibliophilous count she it was who received three vellumskins to bind the duchesss book of hours and who was employed to prepare parchment for the use of the dukes scribes  and she it was who bound in vermilion leather the great manuscript of charless own poems which was presented to him by his secretary anthony astesan with the text in one column and astesans latin version in the other 3  1 champollionfigeac 387 2 nouvelle biographie didot art marie de cleves vallet charles vii iii 85 note 1 3 champollionfigeac 383 384386  such tastes with the coming of years would doubtless take the place of many others  we find in charless verse much semiironical regret for other days and resignation to growing infirmities  he who had been nourished in the schools of love now sees nothing either to please or displease him  old age has imprisoned him within doors where he means to take his ease and let younger fellows bestir themselves in life  he had written in earlier days we may presume a bright and defiant little poem in praise of solitude  if they would but leave him alone with his own thoughts and happy recollections he declared it was beyond the power of melancholy to affect him  but now when his animal strength has so much declined that he sings the discomforts of winter instead of the inspirations of spring and he has no longer any appetite for life he confesses he is wretched when alone and to keep his mind from grievous thoughts he must have many people around him laughing talking and singing 1  1 works ii 57 258  while charles was thus falling into years the order of things of which he was the outcome and ornament was growing old along with him  the semiroyalty of the princes of the blood was already a thing of the past and when charles vii was gathered to his fathers a new king reigned in france who seemed every way the opposite of royal  louis xi had aims that were incomprehensible and virtues that were inconceivable to his contemporaries  but his contemporaries were able enough to appreciate his sordid exterior and his cruel and treacherous spirit  to the whole nobility of france he was a fatal and unreasonable phenomenon  all such courts as that of charles at blois or his friend renes in provence would soon be made impossible interference was the order of the day hunting was already abolished and who should say what was to go next  louis in fact must have appeared to charles primarily in the light of a killjoy  i take it when missionaries land in south sea islands and lay strange embargo on the simplest things in life the islanders will not be much more puzzled and irritated than charles of orleans at the policy of the eleventh louis  there was one thing i seem to apprehend that had always particularly moved him and that was any proposal to punish a person of his acquaintance  no matter what treason he may have made or meddled with an alencon or an armagnac was sure to find charles reappear from private life and do his best to get him pardoned  he knew them quite well  he had made rondels with them  they were charming people in every way  there must certainly be some mistake  had not he himself made antinational treaties almost before he was out of his nonage  and for the matter of that had not every one else done the like  such are some of the thoughts by which he might explain to himself his aversion to such extremities but it was on a deeper basis that the feeling probably reposed  a man of his temper could not fail to be impressed at the thought of disastrous revolutions in the fortunes of those he knew  he would feel painfully the tragic contrast when those who had everything to make life valuable were deprived of life itself  and it was shocking to the clemency of his spirit that sinners should be hurried before their judge without a fitting interval for penitence and satisfaction  it was this feeling which brought him at last a poor purblind bluebottle of the later autumn into collision with the universal spider louis xi  he took up the defence of the duke of brittany at tours  but louis was then in no humour to hear charless texts and latin sentiments he had his back to the wall the future of france was at stake and if all the old men in the world had crossed his path they would have had the rough side of his tongue like charles of orleans  i have found nowhere what he said but it seems it was monstrously to the point and so rudely conceived that the old duke never recovered the indignity he got home as far as amboise sickened and died two days after jan 4 1465 in the seventyfourth year of his age and so a whiff of pungent prose stopped the issue of melodious rondels to the end of time   v   the futility of charless public life was of a piece throughout  he never succeeded in any single purpose he set before him for his deliverance from england after twenty five years of failure and at the cost of dignity and consistency it would be ridiculously hyperbolical to treat as a success  during the first part of his life he was the stalking horse of bernard darmagnac during the second he was the passive instrument of english diplomatists and before he was well entered on the third he hastened to become the dupe and catspaw of burgundian treason  on each of these occasions a strong and not dishonourable personal motive determined his behaviour  in 1407 and the following years he had his fathers murder uppermost in his mind during his english captivity that thought was displaced by a more immediate desire for his own liberation  in 1440 a sentiment of gratitude to philip of burgundy blinded him to all else and led him to break with the tradition of his party and his own former life  he was born a great vassal and he conducted himself like a private gentleman  he began life in a showy and brilliant enough fashion by the light of a petty personal chivalry  he was not without some tincture of patriotism but it was resolvable into two parts a preference for life among his fellowcountrymen and a barren point of honour  in england he could comfort himself by the reflection that he had been taken while loyally doing his devoir without any misgiving as to his conduct in the previous years when he had prepared the disaster of agincourt by wasteful feud  this unconsciousness of the larger interests is perhaps most happily exampled out of his own mouth  when alencon stood accused of betraying normandy into the hands of the english charles made a speech in his defence from which i have already quoted more than once alencon he said had professed a great love and trust towards him yet did he give no great proof thereof when he sought to betray normandy whereby he would have made me lose an estate of 100000 livres a year and might have occasioned the destruction of the kingdom and of all us frenchmen these are the words of one mark you against whom gloucester warned the english council because of his great subtility and cautelous disposition  it is not hard to excuse the impatience of louis xi if such stuff was foisted on him by way of political deliberation  this incapacity to see things with any greatness this obscure and narrow view was fundamentally characteristic of the man as well as of the epoch  it is not even so striking in his public life where he failed as in his poems where he notably succeeded  for wherever we might expect a poet to be unintelligent it certainly would not be in his poetry and charles is unintelligent even there  of all authors whom a modern may still read and read over again with pleasure he has perhaps the least to say  his poems seem to bear testimony rather to the fashion of rhyming which distinguished the age than to any special vocation in the man himself  some of them are drawingroom exercises and the rest seem made by habit  great writers are struck with something in nature or society with which they become pregnant and longing they are possessed with an idea and cannot be at peace until they have put it outside of them in some distinct embodiment  but with charles literature was an object rather than a mean he was one who loved bandying words for its own sake the rigidity of intricate metrical forms stood him in lieu of precise thought instead of communicating truth he observed the laws of a game and when he had no one to challenge at chess or rackets he made verses in a wager against himself  from the very idleness of the mans mind and not from intensity of feeling it happens that all his poems are more or less autobiographical  but they form an autobiography singularly bald and uneventful little is therein recorded beside sentiments  thoughts in any true sense he had none to record  and if we can gather that he had been a prisoner in england that he had lived in the orleannese and that he hunted and went in parties of pleasure i believe it is about as much definite experience as is to be found in all these five hundred pages of autobiographical verse  doubtless we find here and there a complaint on the progress of the infirmities of age doubtless he feels the great change of the year and distinguishes winter from spring winter as the time of snow and the fireside spring as the return of grass and flowers the time of st valentines day and a beating heart  and he feels love after a fashion  again and again we learn that charles of orleans is in love and hear him ring the changes through the whole gamut of dainty and tender sentiment  but there is never a spark of passion and heaven alone knows whether there was any real woman in the matter or the whole thing was an exercise in fancy  if these poems were indeed inspired by some living mistress one would think he had never seen never heard and never touched her  there is nothing in any one of these so numerous lovesongs to indicate who or what the lady was  was she dark or fair passionate or gentle like himself witty or simple  was it always one woman or are there a dozen here immortalised in cold indistinction  the old english translator mentions gray eyes in his version of one of the amorous rondels so far as i remember he was driven by some emergency of the verse but in the absence of all sharp lines of character and anything specific we feel for the moment a sort of surprise as though the epithet were singularly happy and unusual or as though we had made our escape from cloudland into something tangible and sure  the measure of charless indifference to all that now preoccupies and excites a poet is best given by a positive example  if besides the coming of spring any one external circumstance may be said to have struck his imagination it was the despatch of fourriers while on a journey to prepare the nights lodging  this seems to be his favourite image it reappears like the upastree in the early work of coleridge we may judge with what childish eyes he looked upon the world if one of the sights which most impressed him was that of a man going to order dinner  although they are not inspired by any deeper motive than the common run of contemporaneous drawingroom verses those of charles of orleans are executed with inimitable lightness and delicacy of touch  they deal with floating and colourless sentiments and the writer is never greatly moved but he seems always genuine  he makes no attempt to set off thin conceptions with a multiplicity of phrases  his ballades are generally thin and scanty of import for the ballade presented too large a canvas and he was preoccupied by technical requirements  but in the rondel he has put himself before all competitors by a happy knack and a prevailing distinction of manner  he is very much more of a duke in his verses than in his absurd and inconsequential career as a statesman and how he shows himself a duke is precisely by the absence of all pretension turgidity or emphasis  he turns verses as he would have come into the kings presence with a quiet accomplishment of grace  theodore de banville the youngest poet of a famous generation now nearly extinct and himself a sure and finished artist knocked off in his happiest vein a few experiments in imitation of charles of orleans  i would recommend these modern rondels to all who care about the old duke not only because they are delightful in themselves but because they serve as a contrast to throw into relief the peculiarities of their model  when de banville revives a forgotten form of verse  and he has already had the honour of reviving the ballade  he does it in the spirit of a workman choosing a good tool wherever he can find one and not at all in that of the dilettante who seeks to renew bygone forms of thought and make historic forgeries  with the ballade this seemed natural enough for in connection with ballades the mind recurs to villon and villon was almost more of a modern than de banville himself  but in the case of the rondel a comparison is challenged with charles of orleans and the difference between two ages and two literatures is illustrated in a few poems of thirteen lines something certainly has been retained of the old movement the refrain falls in time like a wellplayed bass and the very brevity of the thing by hampering and restraining the greater fecundity of the modern mind assists the imitation but de banvilles poems are full of form and colour they smack racily of modern life and own small kindred with the verse of other days when it seems as if men walked by twilight seeing little and that with distracted eyes and instead of blood some thin and spectral fluid circulated in their veins  they might gird themselves for battle make love eat and drink and acquit themselves manfully in all the external parts of life but of the life that is within and those processes by which we render ourselves an intelligent account of what we feel and do and so represent experience that we for the first time make it ours they had only a loose and troubled possession  they beheld or took part in great events but there was no answerable commotion in their reflective being and they passed throughout turbulent epochs in a sort of ghostly quiet and abstraction feeling seems to have been strangely disproportioned to the occasion and words were laughably trivial and scanty to set forth the feeling even such as it was  juvenal des ursins chronicles calamity after calamity with but one comment for them all that it was great pity  perhaps after too much of our florid literature we find an adventitious charm in what is so different and while the big drums are beaten every day by perspiring editors over the loss of a cockboat or the rejection of a clause and nothing is heard that is not proclaimed with sound of trumpet it is not wonderful if we retire with pleasure into old books and listen to authors who speak small and clear as if in a private conversation truly this is so with charles of orleans  we are pleased to find a small man without the buskin and obvious sentiments stated without affectation  if the sentiments are obvious there is all the more chance we may have experienced the like  as we turn over the leaves we may find ourselves in sympathy with some one or other of these staid joys and smiling sorrows  if we do we shall be strangely pleased for there is a genuine pathos in these simple words and the lines go with a lilt and sing themselves to music of their own    chapter viii  samuel pepys    in two books a fresh light has recently been thrown on the character and position of samuel pepys  mr mynors bright has given us a new transcription of the diary increasing it in bulk by near a third correcting many errors and completing our knowledge of the man in some curious and important points  we can only regret that he has taken liberties with the author and the public  it is no part of the duties of the editor of an established classic to decide what may or may not be tedious to the reader  the book is either an historical document or not and in condemning lord braybrooke mr bright condemns himself  as for the time honoured phrase unfit for publication without being cynical we may regard it as the sign of a precaution more or less commercial and we may think without being sordid that when we purchase six huge and distressingly expensive volumes we are entitled to be treated rather more like scholars and rather less like children  but mr bright may rest assured while we complain we are still grateful  mr wheatley to divide our obligation brings together clearly and with no lost words a body of illustrative material sometimes we might ask a little more never i think less and as a matter of fact a great part of mr wheatleys volume might be transferred by a good editor of pepys to the margin of the text for it is precisely what the reader wants  in the light of these two books at least we have now to read our author  between them they contain all we can expect to learn for it may be many years  now if ever we should be able to form some notion of that unparalleled figure in the annals of mankind  unparalleled for three good reasons first because he was a man known to his contemporaries in a halo of almost historical pomp and to his remote descendants with an indecent familiarity like a taproom comrade second because he has outstripped all competitors in the art or virtue of a conscious honesty about oneself and third because being in many ways a very ordinary person he has yet placed himself before the public eye with such a fulness and such an intimacy of detail as might be envied by a genius like montaigne  not then for his own sake only but as a character in a unique position endowed with a unique talent and shedding a unique light upon the lives of the mass of mankind he is surely worthy of prolonged and patient study   the diary   that there should be such a book as pepyss diary is incomparably strange  pepys in a corrupt and idle period played the man in public employments toiling hard and keeping his honour bright  much of the little good that is set down to james the second comes by right to pepys and if it were little for a king it is much for a subordinate  to his clear capable head was owing somewhat of the greatness of england on the seas  in the exploits of hawke rodney or nelson this dead mr pepys of the navy office had some considerable share  he stood well by his business in the appalling plague of 1666  he was loved and respected by some of the best and wisest men in england  he was president of the royal society and when he came to die people said of his conduct in that solemn hour  thinking it needless to say more  that it was answerable to the greatness of his life thus he walked in dignity guards of soldiers sometimes attending him in his walks subalterns bowing before his periwig and when he uttered his thoughts they were suitable to his state and services  on february 8 1668 we find him writing to evelyn his mind bitterly occupied with the late dutch war and some thoughts of the different story of the repulse of the great armada sir you will not wonder at the backwardness of my thanks for the present you made me so many days since of the prospect of the medway while the hollander rode master in it when i have told you that the sight of it hath led me to such reflections on my particular interest by my employment in the reproach due to that miscarriage as have given me little less disquiet than he is fancied to have who found his face in michael angelos hell the same should serve me also in excuse for my silence in celebrating your mastery shown in the design and draught did not indignation rather than courtship urge me so far to commend them as to wish the furniture of our house of lords changed from the story of 88 to that of 67 of evelyns designing till the pravity of this were reformed to the temper of that age wherein god almighty found his blessings more operative than i fear he doth in ours his judgments  this is a letter honourable to the writer where the meaning rather than the words is eloquent  such was the account he gave of himself to his contemporaries such thoughts he chose to utter and in such language giving himself out for a grave and patriotic public servant  we turn to the same date in the diary by which he is known after two centuries to his descendants  the entry begins in the same key with the letter blaming the madness of the house of commons and the base proceedings just the epitome of all our public proceedings in this age of the house of lords and then without the least transition this is how our diarist proceeds to the strand to my booksellers and there bought an idle rogueish french book lescholle des filles which i have bought in plain binding avoiding the buying of it better bound because i resolve as soon as i have read it to burn it that it may not stand in the list of books nor among them to disgrace them if it should be found even in our day when responsibility is so much more clearly apprehended the man who wrote the letter would be notable but what about the man i do not say who bought a roguish book but who was ashamed of doing so yet did it and recorded both the doing and the shame in the pages of his daily journal  we all whether we write or speak must somewhat drape ourselves when we address our fellows at a given moment we apprehend our character and acts by some particular side we are merry with one grave with another as befits the nature and demands of the relation  pepyss letter to evelyn would have little in common with that other one to mrs knipp which he signed by the pseudonym of dapper dicky yet each would be suitable to the character of his correspondent  there is no untruth in this for man being a protean animal swiftly shares and changes with his company and surroundings and these changes are the better part of his education in the world  to strike a posture once for all and to march through life like a drummajor is to be highly disagreeable to others and a fool for oneself into the bargain  to evelyn and to knipp we understand the double facing but to whom was he posing in the diary and what in the name of astonishment was the nature of the pose  had he suppressed all mention of the book or had he bought it gloried in the act and cheerfully recorded his glorification in either case we should have made him out  but no he is full of precautions to conceal the disgrace of the purchase and yet speeds to chronicle the whole affair in pen and ink  it is a sort of anomaly in human action which we can exactly parallel from another part of the diary  mrs pepys had written a paper of her too just complaints against her husband and written it in plain and very pungent english  pepys in an agony lest the world should come to see it brutally seizes and destroys the telltale document and then  you disbelieve your eyes  down goes the whole story with unsparing truth and in the cruellest detail  it seems he has no design but to appear respectable and here he keeps a private book to prove he was not  you are at first faintly reminded of some of the vagaries of the morbid religious diarist but at a moments thought the resemblance disappears  the design of pepys is not at all to edify it is not from repentance that he chronicles his peccadilloes for he tells us when he does repent and to be just to him there often follows some improvement  again the sins of the religious diarist are of a very formal pattern and are told with an elaborate whine  but in pepys you come upon good substantive misdemeanours beams in his eye of which he alone remains unconscious healthy outbreaks of the animal nature and laughable subterfuges to himself that always command belief and often engage the sympathies  pepys was a young man for his age came slowly to himself in the world sowed his wild oats late took late to industry and preserved till nearly forty the headlong gusto of a boy so to come rightly at the spirit in which the diary was written we must recall a class of sentiments which with most of us are over and done before the age of twelve  in our tender years we still preserve a freshness of surprise at our prolonged existence events make an impression out of all proportion to their consequence we are unspeakably touched by our own past adventures and look forward to our future personality with sentimental interest  it was something of this i think that clung to pepys  although not sentimental in the abstract he was sweetly sentimental about himself his own past clung about his heart an evergreen  he was the slave of an association  he could not pass by islington where his father used to carry him to cakes and ale but he must light at the kings head and eat and drink for remembrance of the old house sake  he counted it good fortune to lie a night at epsom to renew his old walks where mrs hely and i did use to walk and talk with whom i had the first sentiments of love and pleasure in a womans company discourse and taking her by the hand she being a pretty woman  he goes about weighing up the assurance which lay near woolwich underwater and cries in a parenthesis poor ship that i have been twice merry in in captain hollands time and after revisiting the naseby now changed into the charles he confesses it was a great pleasure to myself to see the ship that i began my good fortune in  the stone that he was cut for he preserved in a case and to the turners he kept alive such gratitude for their assistance that for years and after he had begun to mount himself into higher zones he continued to have that family to dinner on the anniversary of the operation  not hazlitt nor rousseau had a more romantic passion for their past although at times they might express it more romantically and if pepys shared with them this childish fondness did not rousseau who left behind him the confessions or hazlitt who wrote the liber amoris and loaded his essays with loving personal detail share with pepys in his unwearied egotism  for the two things go hand in hand or to be more exact it is the first that makes the second either possible or pleasing  but to be quite in sympathy with pepys we must return once more to the experience of children  i can remember to have written in the flyleaf of more than one book the date and the place where i then was  if for instance i was ill in bed or sitting in a certain garden these were jottings for my future self if i should chance on such a note in after years i thought it would cause me a particular thrill to recognise myself across the intervening distance  indeed i might come upon them now and not be moved one tittle  which shows that i have comparatively failed in life and grown older than samuel pepys  for in the diary we can find more than one such note of perfect childish egotism as when he explains that his candle is going out which makes me write thus slobberingly or as in this incredible particularity to my study where i only wrote thus much of this days passages to this  and so out again or lastly as here with more of circumstance i staid up till the bellman came by with his bell under my window as i was writing of this very line and cried past one of the clock and a cold frosty windy morning  such passages are not to be misunderstood  the appeal to samuel pepys years hence is unmistakable  he desires that dear though unknown gentleman keenly to realise his predecessor to remember why a passage was uncleanly written to recall let us fancy with a sigh the tones of the bellman the chill of the early windy morning and the very line his own romantic self was scribing at the moment  the man you will perceive was making reminiscences  a sort of pleasure by ricochet which comforts many in distress and turns some others into sentimental libertines and the whole book if you will but look at it in that way is seen to be a work of art to pepyss own address  here then we have the key to that remarkable attitude preserved by him throughout his diary to that unflinching  i had almost said that unintelligent  sincerity which makes it a miracle among human books  he was not unconscious of his errors  far from it he was often startled into shame often reformed often made and broke his vows of change  but whether he did ill or well he was still his own unequalled self still that entrancing ego of whom alone he cared to write and still sure of his own affectionate indulgence when the parts should be changed and the writer come to read what he had written  whatever he did or said or thought or suffered it was still a trait of pepys a character of his career and as to himself he was more interesting than moses or than alexander so all should be faithfully set down  i have called his diary a work of art  now when the artist has found something word or deed exactly proper to a favourite character in play or novel he will neither suppress nor diminish it though the remark be silly or the act mean  the hesitation of hamlet the credulity of othello the baseness of emma bovary or the irregularities of mr swiveller caused neither disappointment nor disgust to their creators  and so with pepys and his adored protagonist adored not blindly but with trenchant insight and enduring human toleration  i have gone over and over the greater part of the diary and the points where to the most suspicious scrutiny he has seemed not perfectly sincere are so few so doubtful and so petty that i am ashamed to name them  it may be said that we all of us write such a diary in airy characters upon our brain but i fear there is a distinction to be made i fear that as we render to our consciousness an account of our daily fortunes and behaviour we too often weave a tissue of romantic compliments and dull excuses and even if pepys were the ass and cowardly that men call him we must take rank as sillier and more cowardly than he  the bald truth about oneself what we are all too timid to admit when we are not too dull to see it that was what he saw clearly and set down unsparingly  it is improbable that the diary can have been carried on in the same single spirit in which it was begun  pepys was not such an ass but he must have perceived as he went on the extraordinary nature of the work he was producing  he was a great reader and he knew what other books were like  it must at least have crossed his mind that some one might ultimately decipher the manuscript and he himself with all his pains and pleasures be resuscitated in some later day and the thought although discouraged must have warmed his heart  he was not such an ass besides but he must have been conscious of the deadly explosives the guncotton and the giant powder he was hoarding in his drawer  let some contemporary light upon the journal and pepys was plunged for ever in social and political disgrace  we can trace the growth of his terrors by two facts  in 1660 while the diary was still in its youth he tells about it as a matter of course to a lieutenant in the navy but in 1669 when it was already near an end he could have bitten his tongue out as the saying is because he had let slip his secret to one so grave and friendly as sir william coventry  and from two other facts i think we may infer that he had entertained even if he had not acquiesced in the thought of a far distant publicity  the first is of capital importance the diary was not destroyed  the second  that he took unusual precautions to confound the cipher in rogueish passages  proves beyond question that he was thinking of some other reader besides himself  perhaps while his friends were admiring the greatness of his behaviour at the approach of death he may have had a twinkling hope of immortality  mens cujusque is est quisque said his chosen motto and as he had stamped his mind with every crook and foible in the pages of the diary he might feel that what he left behind him was indeed himself  there is perhaps no other instance so remarkable of the desire of man for publicity and an enduring name  the greatness of his life was open yet he longed to communicate its smallness also and while contemporaries bowed before him he must buttonhole posterity with the news that his periwig was once alive with nits  but this thought although i cannot doubt he had it was neither his first nor his deepest it did not colour one word that he wrote and the diary for as long as he kept it remained what it was when he began a private pleasure for himself  it was his bosom secret it added a zest to all his pleasures he lived in and for it and might well write these solemn words when he closed that confidant for ever and so i betake myself to that course which is almost as much as to see myself go into the grave for which and all the discomforts that will accompany my being blind the good god prepare me   a liberal genius   pepys spent part of a certain winter sunday when he had taken physic composing a song in praise of a liberal genius such as i take my own to be to all studies and pleasures the song was unsuccessful but the diary is in a sense the very song that he was seeking and his portrait by hales so admirably reproduced in mynors brights edition is a confirmation of the diary  hales it would appear had known his business and though he put his sitter to a deal of trouble almost breaking his neck to have the portrait full of shadows and draping him in an indian gown hired expressly for the purpose he was preoccupied about no merely picturesque effects but to portray the essence of the man whether we read the picture by the diary or the diary by the picture we shall at least agree that hales was among the number of those who can surprise the manners in the face here we have a mouth pouting moist with desires eyes greedy protuberant and yet apt for weeping too a nose great alike in character and dimensions and altogether a most fleshly melting countenance  the face is attractive by its promise of reciprocity  i have used the word greedy but the reader must not suppose that he can change it for that closely kindred one of hungry for there is here no aspiration no waiting for better things but an animal joy in all that comes  it could never be the face of an artist it is the face of a viveur  kindly pleased and pleasing protected from excess and upheld in contentment by the shifting versatility of his desires  for a single desire is more rightly to be called a lust but there is health in a variety where one may balance and control another  the whole world town or country was to pepys a garden of armida  wherever he went his steps were winged with the most eager expectation whatever he did it was done with the most lively pleasure  an insatiable curiosity in all the shows of the world and all the secrets of knowledge filled him brimful of the longing to travel and supported him in the toils of study  rome was the dream of his life he was never happier than when he read or talked of the eternal city  when he was in holland he was with child to see any strange thing  meeting some friends and singing with them in a palace near the hague his pen fails him to express his passion of delight the more so because in a heaven of pleasure and in a strange country  he must go to see all famous executions  he must needs visit the body of a murdered man defaced with a broad wound he says that makes my hand now shake to write of it  he learned to dance and was like to make a dancer  he learned to sing and walked about grays inn fields humming to myself which is now my constant practice the trillo  he learned to play the lute the flute the flageolet and the theorbo and it was not the fault of his intention if he did not learn the harpsichord or the spinet  he learned to compose songs and burned to give forth a scheme and theory of music not yet ever made in the world  when he heard a fellow whistle like a bird exceeding well he promised to return another day and give an angel for a lesson in the art  once he writes i took the bezan back with me and with a brave gale and tide reached up that night to the hope taking great pleasure in learning the seamens manner of singing when they sound the depths  if he found himself rusty in his latin grammar he must fall to it like a schoolboy  he was a member of harringtons club till its dissolution and of the royal society before it had received the name  boyles hydrostatics was of infinite delight to him walking in barnes elms  we find him comparing bible concordances a captious judge of sermons deep in descartes and aristotle we find him in a single year studying timber and the measurement of timber tar and oil hemp and the process of preparing cordage mathematics and accounting the hull and the rigging of ships from a model and looking and improving himself of the naval stores with  hark to the fellow  great delight  his familiar spirit of delight was not the same with shelleys but how true it was to him through life he is only copying something and behold he takes great pleasure to rule the lines and have the capital words wrote with red ink he has only had his coalcellar emptied and cleaned and behold it do please him exceedingly  a hogs harslett is a piece of meat he loves  he cannot ride home in my lord sandwichs coach but he must exclaim with breathless gusto his noble rich coach  when he is bound for a supper party he anticipates a glut of pleasure when he has a new watch to see my childishness says he i could not forbear carrying it in my hand and seeing what oclock it was an hundred times  to go to vauxhall he says and to hear the nightingales and other birds hear fiddles and there a harp and here a jews trump and here laughing and there fine people walking is mighty divertising  and the nightingales i take it were particularly dear to him and it was again with great pleasure that he paused to hear them as he walked to woolwich while the fog was rising and the april sun broke through  he must always be doing something agreeable and by preference two agreeable things at once  in his house he had a box of carpenters tools two dogs an eagle a canary and a blackbird that whistled tunes lest even in that full life he should chance upon an empty moment  if he had to wait for a dish of poached eggs he must put in the time by playing on the flageolet if a sermon were dull he must read in the book of tobit or divert his mind with sly advances on the nearest women  when he walked it must be with a book in his pocket to beguile the way in case the nightingales were silent and even along the streets of london with so many pretty faces to be spied for and dignitaries to be saluted his trail was marked by little debts for wine pictures etc the true headmark of a life intolerant of any joyless passage  he had a kind of idealism in pleasure like the princess in the fairy story he was conscious of a roseleaf out of place  dearly as he loved to talk he could not enjoy nor shine in a conversation when he thought himself unsuitably dressed  dearly as he loved eating he knew not how to eat alone pleasure for him must heighten pleasure and the eye and ear must be flattered like the palate ere he avow himself content  he had no zest in a good dinner when it fell to be eaten in a bad street and in a periwigmakers house and a collation was spoiled for him by indifferent music  his body was indefatigable doing him yeomans service in this breathless chase of pleasures  on april 11 1662 he mentions that he went to bed weary which i seldom am and already over thirty he would sit up all night cheerfully to see a comet  but it is never pleasure that exhausts the pleasureseeker for in that career as in all others it is failure that kills  the man who enjoys so wholly and bears so impatiently the slightest widowhood from joy is just the man to lose a nights rest over some paltry question of his right to fiddle on the leads or to be vexed to the blood by a solecism in his wifes attire and we find in consequence that he was always peevish when he was hungry and that his head aked mightily after a dispute  but nothing could divert him from his aim in life his remedy in care was the same as his delight in prosperity it was with pleasure and with pleasure only that he sought to drive out sorrow and whether he was jealous of his wife or skulking from a bailiff he would equally take refuge in the theatre there if the house be full and the company noble if the songs be tunable the actors perfect and the play diverting this odd hero of the secret diary this private selfadorer will speedily be healed of his distresses  equally pleased with a watch a coach a piece of meat a tune upon the fiddle or a fact in hydrostatics pepys was pleased yet more by the beauty the worth the mirth or the mere scenic attitude in life of his fellowcreatures  he shows himself throughout a sterling humanist  indeed he who loves himself not in idle vanity but with a plenitude of knowledge is the best equipped of all to love his neighbours  and perhaps it is in this sense that charity may be most properly said to begin at home  it does not matter what quality a person has pepys can appreciate and love him for it  he fills his eyes with the beauty of lady castlemaine indeed he may be said to dote upon the thought of her for years if a woman be goodlooking and not painted he will walk miles to have another sight of her and even when a lady by a mischance spat upon his clothes he was immediately consoled when he had observed that she was pretty  but on the other hand he is delighted to see mrs pett upon her knees and speaks thus of his aunt james a poor religious wellmeaning good soul talking of nothing but god almighty and that with so much innocence that mightily pleased me  he is taken with pens merriment and loose songs but not less taken with the sterling worth of coventry  he is jolly with a drunken sailor but listens with interest and patience as he rides the essex roads to the story of a quakers spiritual trials and convictions  he lends a critical ear to the discourse of kings and royal dukes  he spends an evening at vauxhall with killigrew and young newport  loose company says he but worth a mans being in for once to know the nature of it and their manner of talk and lives  and when a ragboy lights him home he examines him about his business and other ways of livelihood for destitute children  this is almost halfway to the beginning of philanthropy had it only been the fashion as it is at present pepys had perhaps been a man famous for good deeds  and it is through this quality that he rises at times superior to his surprising egotism his interest in the love affairs of others is indeed impersonal he is filled with concern for my lady castlemaine whom he only knows by sight shares in her very jealousies joys with her in her successes and it is not untrue however strange it seems in his abrupt presentment that he loved his maid jane because she was in love with his man tom  let us hear him for once at length so the women and w hewer and i walked upon the downes where a flock of sheep was and the most pleasant and innocent sight that ever i saw in my life  we found a shepherd and his little boy reading far from any houses or sight of people the bible to him so i made the boy read to me which he did with the forced tone that children do usually read that was mighty pretty and then i did give him something and went to the father and talked with him  he did content himself mightily in my liking his boys reading and did bless god for him the most like one of the old patriarchs that ever i saw in my life and it brought those thoughts of the old age of the world in my mind for two or three days after  we took notice of his woolen knit stockings of two colours mixed and of his shoes shod with iron both at the toe and heels and with great nails in the soles of his feet which was mighty pretty and taking notice of them why says the poor man the downes you see are full of stones and we are faine to shoe ourselves thus and these says he will make the stones fly till they ring before me  i did give the poor man something for which he was mighty thankful and i tried to cast stones with his horne crooke  he values his dog mightily that would turn a sheep any way which he would have him when he goes to fold them told me there was about eighteen score sheep in his flock and that he hath four shillings a week the year round for keeping of them and mrs turner in the common fields here did gather one of the prettiest nosegays that ever i saw in my life  and so the story rambles on to the end of that days pleasuring with cups of milk and glowworms and people walking at sundown with their wives and children and all the way home pepys still dreaming of the old age of the world and the early innocence of man  this was how he walked through life his eyes and ears wide open and his hand you will observe not shut and thus he observed the lives the speech and the manners of his fellowmen with prose fidelity of detail and yet a lingering glamour of romance  it was two or three days after that he extended this passage in the pages of his journal and the style has thus the benefit of some reflection  it is generally supposed that as a writer pepys must rank at the bottom of the scale of merit  but a style which is indefatigably lively telling and picturesque through six large volumes of everyday experience which deals with the whole matter of a life and yet is rarely wearisome which condescends to the most fastidious particulars and yet sweeps all away in the forthright current of the narrative  such a style may be ungrammatical it may be inelegant it may be one tissue of mistakes but it can never be devoid of merit  the first and the true function of the writer has been thoroughly performed throughout and though the manner of his utterance may be childishly awkward the matter has been transformed and assimilated by his unfeigned interest and delight  the gusto of the man speaks out fierily after all these years  for the difference between pepys and shelley to return to that half whimsical approximation is one of quality but not one of degree in his sphere pepys felt as keenly and his is the true prose of poetry  prose because the spirit of the man was narrow and earthly but poetry because he was delightedly alive  hence in such a passage as this about the epsom shepherd the result upon the readers mind is entire conviction and unmingled pleasure  so you feel the thing fell out not otherwise and you would no more change it than you would change a sublimity of shakespeares a homely touch of bunyans or a favoured reminiscence of your own  there never was a man nearer being an artist who yet was not one  the tang was in the family while he was writing the journal for our enjoyment in his comely house in navy gardens no fewer than two of his cousins were tramping the fens kit under arm to make music to the country girls  but he himself though he could play so many instruments and pass judgment in so many fields of art remained an amateur  it is not given to any one so keenly to enjoy without some greater power to understand  that he did not like shakespeare as an artist for the stage may be a fault but it is not without either parallel or excuse  he certainly admired him as a poet he was the first beyond mere actors on the rolls of that innumerable army who have got to be or not to be by heart  nor was he content with that it haunted his mind he quoted it to himself in the pages of the diary and rushing in where angels fear to tread he set it to music  nothing indeed is more notable than the heroic quality of the verses that our little sensualist in a periwig chose out to marry with his own mortal strains  some gust from brave elizabethan times must have warmed his spirit as he sat tuning his sublime theorbo  to be or not to be whether tis nobler  beauty retire thou dost my pity move  it is decreed nor shall thy fate o rome  open and dignified in the sound various and majestic in the sentiment it was no inapt as it was certainly no timid spirit that selected such a range of themes  of gaze not on swans i know no more than these four words yet that also seems to promise well  it was however on a probable suspicion the work of his master mr berkenshaw  as the drawings that figure at the breaking up of a young ladies seminary are the work of the professor attached to the establishment  mr berkenshaw was not altogether happy in his pupil  the amateur cannot usually rise into the artist some leaven of the world still clogging him and we find pepys behaving like a pickthank to the man who taught him composition  in relation to the stage which he so warmly loved and understood he was not only more hearty but more generous to others  thus he encounters colonel reames a man says he who understands and loves a play as well as i and i love him for it  and again when he and his wife had seen a most ridiculous insipid piece glad we were he writes that betterton had no part in it  it is by such a zeal and loyalty to those who labour for his delight that the amateur grows worthy of the artist  and it should be kept in mind that not only in art but in morals pepys rejoiced to recognise his betters  there was not one speck of envy in the whole humanhearted egotist   respectability   when writers inveigh against respectability in the present degraded meaning of the word they are usually suspected of a taste for clay pipes and beer cellars and their performances are thought to hail from the owls nest of the comedy  they have something more however in their eye than the dulness of a round million dinner parties that sit down yearly in old england  for to do anything because others do it and not because the thing is good or kind or honest in its own right is to resign all moral control and captaincy upon yourself and go posthaste to the devil with the greater number  we smile over the ascendency of priests but i had rather follow a priest than what they call the leaders of society  no life can better than that of pepys illustrate the dangers of this respectable theory of living  for what can be more untoward than the occurrence at a critical period and while the habits are still pliable of such a sweeping transformation as the return of charles the second round went the whole fleet of england on the other tack and while a few tall pintas milton or pen still sailed a lonely course by the stars and their own private compass the cock boat pepys must go about with the majority among the stupid starers and the loud huzzas  the respectable are not led so much by any desire of applause as by a positive need for countenance  the weaker and the tamer the man the more will he require this support and any positive quality relieves him by just so much of this dependence  in a dozen ways pepys was quite strong enough to please himself without regard for others but his positive qualities were not coextensive with the field of conduct and in many parts of life he followed with gleeful precision in the footprints of the contemporary mrs grundy in morals particularly he lived by the countenance of others felt a slight from another more keenly than a meanness in himself and then first repented when he was found out  you could talk of religion or morality to such a man and by the artist side of him by his lively sympathy and apprehension he could rise as it were dramatically to the significance of what you said  all that matter in religion which has been nicknamed otherworldliness was strictly in his gamut but a rule of life that should make a man rudely virtuous following right in good report and ill report was foolishness and a stumblingblock to pepys  he was much thrown across the friends and nothing can be more instructive than his attitude towards these most interesting people of that age  i have mentioned how he conversed with one as he rode when he saw some brought from a meeting under arrest i would to god said he they would either conform or be more wise and not be catched and to a quaker in his own office he extended a timid though effectual protection  meanwhile there was growing up next door to him that beautiful nature william pen  it is odd that pepys condemned him for a fop odd though natural enough when you see pens portrait that pepys was jealous of him with his wife  but the cream of the story is when pen publishes his sandy foundation shaken and pepys has it read aloud by his wife  i find it he says so well writ as i think it is too good for him ever to have writ it and it is a serious sort of book and not fit for everybody to read  nothing is more galling to the merely respectable than to be brought in contact with religious ardour  pepys had his own foundation sandy enough but dear to him from practical considerations and he would read the book with true uneasiness of spirit for conceive the blow if by some plaguy accident this pen were to convert him  it was a different kind of doctrine that he judged profitable for himself and others  a good sermon of mr giffords at our church upon seek ye first the kingdom of heaven  a very excellent and persuasive good and moral sermon  he showed like a wise man that righteousness is a surer moral way of being rich than sin and villainy  it is thus that respect able people desire to have their greathearts address them telling in mild accents how you may make the best of both worlds and be a moral hero without courage kindness or troublesome reflection and thus the gospel cleared of eastern metaphor becomes a manual of worldly prudence and a handybook for pepys and the successful merchant  the respectability of pepys was deeply grained  he has no idea of truth except for the diary  he has no care that a thing shall be if it but appear gives out that he has inherited a good estate when he has seemingly got nothing but a lawsuit and is pleased to be thought liberal when he knows he has been mean  he is conscientiously ostentatious i say conscientiously with reason  he could never have been taken for a fop like pen but arrayed himself in a manner nicely suitable to his position  for long he hesitated to assume the famous periwig for a public man should travel gravely with the fashions not foppishly before nor dowdily behind the central movement of his age  for long he durst not keep a carriage that in his circumstances would have been improper but a time comes with the growth of his fortune when the impropriety has shifted to the other side and he is ashamed to be seen in a hackney  pepys talked about being a quaker or some very melancholy thing for my part i can imagine nothing so melancholy because nothing half so silly as to be concerned about such problems  but so respectability and the duties of society haunt and burden their poor devotees and what seems at first the very primrose path of life proves difficult and thorny like the rest  and the time comes to pepys as to all the merely respectable when he must not only order his pleasures but even clip his virtuous movements to the public pattern of the age  there was some juggling among officials to avoid direct taxation and pepys with a noble impulse growing ashamed of this dishonesty designed to charge himself with 1000 pounds but finding none to set him an example nobody of our ablest merchants with this moderate liking for clean hands he judged it not decent he feared it would be thought vain glory and rather than appear singular cheerfully remained a thief  one able merchants countenance and pepys had dared to do an honest act  had he found one brave spirit properly recognised by society he might have gone far as a disciple  mrs turner it is true can fill him full of sordid scandal and make him believe against the testimony of his senses that pens venison pasty stank like the devil but on the other hand sir william coventry can raise him by a word into another being  pepys when he is with coventry talks in the vein of an old roman what does he care for office or emolument  thank god i have enough of my own says he to buy me a good book and a good fiddle and i have a good wife  and again we find this pair projecting an old age when an ungrateful country shall have dismissed them from the field of public service coventry living retired in a fine house and pepys dropping in it may be to read a chapter of seneca  under this influence the only good one in his life pepys continued zealous and for the period pure in his employment  he would not be bribed to be unjust he says though he was not so squeamish as to refuse a present after suppose the king to have received no wrong  his new arrangement for the victualling of tangier he tells us with honest complacency will save the king a thousand and gain pepys three hundred pounds a year  a statement which exactly fixes the degree of the ages enlightenment  but for his industry and capacity no praise can be too high  it was an unending struggle for the man to stick to his business in such a garden of armida as he found this life and the story of his oaths so often broken so courageously renewed is worthy rather of admiration that the contempt it has received  elsewhere and beyond the sphere of coventrys influence we find him losing scruples and daily complying further with the age  when he began the journal he was a trifle prim and puritanic merry enough to be sure over his private cups and still remembering magdalene ale and his acquaintance with mrs ainsworth of cambridge  but youth is a hot season with all when a man smells april and may he is apt at times to stumble and in spite of a disordered practice pepyss theory the better things that he approved and followed after we may even say were strict  where there was tag rag and bobtail dancing singing and drinking he felt ashamed and went away and when he slept in church he prayed god forgive him  in but a little while we find him with some ladies keeping each other awake from spite as though not to sleep in church were an obvious hardship and yet later he calmly passes the time of service looking about him with a perspective glass on all the pretty women  his favourite ejaculation lord occurs but once that i have observed in 1660 never in 61 twice in 62 and at least five times in 63 after which the lords may be said to pullulate like herrings with here and there a solitary damned as it were a whale among the shoal  he and his wife once filled with dudgeon by some innocent freedoms at a marriage are soon content to go pleasuring with my lord brounckers mistress who was not even by his own account the most discreet of mistresses  tag rag and bobtail dancing singing and drinking become his natural element actors and actresses and drunken roaring courtiers are to be found in his society until the man grew so involved with saturnalian manners and companions that he was shot almost unconsciously into the grand domestic crash of 1668  that was the legitimate issue and punishment of years of staggering walk and conversation  the man who has smoked his pipe for half a century in a powder magazine finds himself at last the author and the victim of a hideous disaster  so with our pleasantminded pepys and his peccadilloes  all of a sudden as he still trips dexterously enough among the dangers of a doublefaced career thinking no great evil humming to himself the trillo fate takes the further conduct of that matter from his hands and brings him face to face with the consequences of his acts  for a man still after so many years the lover although not the constant lover of his wife  for a man besides who was so greatly careful of appearances  the revelation of his infidelities was a crushing blow  the tears that he shed the indignities that he endured are not to be measured  a vulgar woman and now justly incensed mrs pepys spared him no detail of suffering  she was violent threatening him with the tongs she was careless of his honour driving him to insult the mistress whom she had driven him to betray and to discard worst of all she was hopelessly inconsequent in word and thought and deed now lulling him with reconciliations and anon flaming forth again with the original anger  pepys had not used his wife well he had wearied her with jealousies even while himself unfaithful he had grudged her clothes and pleasures while lavishing both upon himself he had abused her in words he had bent his fist at her in anger he had once blacked her eye and it is one of the oddest particulars in that odd diary of his that while the injury is referred to once in passing there is no hint as to the occasion or the manner of the blow  but now when he is in the wrong nothing can exceed the longsuffering affection of this impatient husband  while he was still sinning and still undiscovered he seems not to have known a touch of penitence stronger than what might lead him to take his wife to the theatre or for an airing or to give her a new dress by way of compensation  once found out however and he seems to himself to have lost all claim to decent usage  it is perhaps the strongest instance of his externality  his wife may do what she pleases and though he may groan it will never occur to him to blame her he has no weapon left but tears and the most abject submission  we should perhaps have respected him more had he not given way so utterly  above all had he refused to write under his wifes dictation an insulting letter to his unhappy fellowculprit miss willet but somehow i believe we like him better as he was  the death of his wife following so shortly after must have stamped the impression of this episode upon his mind  for the remaining years of his long life we have no diary to help us and we have seen already how little stress is to be laid upon the tenor of his correspondence but what with the recollection of the catastrophe of his married life what with the natural influence of his advancing years and reputation it seems not unlikely that the period of gallantry was at an end for pepys and it is beyond a doubt that he sat down at last to an honoured and agreeable old age among his books and music the correspondent of sir isaac newton and in one instance at least the poetical counsellor of dryden  through all this period that diary which contained the secret memoirs of his life with all its inconsistencies and escapades had been religiously preserved nor when he came to die does he appear to have provided for its destruction  so we may conceive him faithful to the end to all his dear and early memories still mindful of mrs hely in the woods at epsom still lighting at islington for a cup of kindness to the dead still if he heard again that air that once so much disturbed him thrilling at the recollection of the love that bound him to his wife    chapter ix  john knox and his relations to women    i  the controversy about female rule   when first the idea became widely spread among men that the word of god instead of being truly the foundation of all existing institutions was rather a stone which the builders had rejected it was but natural that the consequent havoc among received opinions should be accompanied by the generation of many new and lively hopes for the future somewhat as in the early days of the french revolution men must have looked for an immediate and universal improvement in their condition  christianity up to that time had been somewhat of a failure politically  the reason was now obvious the capital flaw was detected the sickness of the body politic traced at last to its efficient cause  it was only necessary to put the bible thoroughly into practice to set themselves strenuously to realise in life the holy commonwealth and all abuses and iniquities would surely pass away  thus in a pageant played at geneva in the year 1523 the world was represented as a sick man at the end of his wits for help to whom his doctor recommends lutheran specifics 1  the reformers themselves had set their affections in a different world and professed to look for the finished result of their endeavours on the other side of death  they took no interest in politics as such they even condemned political action as antichristian notably luther in the case of the peasants war  and yet as the purely religious question was inseparably complicated with political difficulties and they had to make opposition from day to day against principalities and powers they were led one after another and again and again to leave the sphere which was more strictly their own and meddle for good and evil with the affairs of state  not much was to be expected from interference in such a spirit  whenever a minister found himself galled or hindered he would be inclined to suppose some contravention of the bible  whenever christian liberty was restrained and christian liberty for each individual would be about coextensive with what he wished to do it was obvious that the state was antichristian  the great thing and the one thing was to push the gospel and the reformers own interpretation of it  whatever helped was good whatever hindered was evil and if this simple classification proved inapplicable over the whole field it was no business of his to stop and reconcile incongruities  he had more pressing concerns on hand he had to save souls he had to be about his fathers business  this shortsighted view resulted in a doctrine that was actually jesuitical in application  they had no serious ideas upon politics and they were ready nay they seemed almost bound to adopt and support whichever ensured for the moment the greatest benefit to the souls of their fellowmen  they were dishonest in all sincerity thus labitte in the introduction to a book 2 in which he exposes the hypocritical democracy of the catholics under the league steps aside for a moment to stigmatise the hypocritical democracy of the protestants  and nowhere was this expediency in political questions more apparent than about the question of female sovereignty  so much was this the case that one james thomasius of leipsic wrote a little paper 3 about the religious partialities of those who took part in the controversy in which some of these learned disputants cut a very sorry figure  1 gaberels eglist de geneve i 88 2 la democratie chez les predicateurs de la ligue 3 historia affectuum se immiscentium controversiae de gynaecocratia  it is in his collected prefaces leipsic 1683  now knox has been from the first a man well hated and it is somewhat characteristic of his luck that he figures here in the very forefront of the list of partial scribes who trimmed their doctrine with the wind in all good conscience and were political weathercocks out of conviction  not only has thomasius mentioned him but bayle has taken the hint from thomasius and dedicated a long note to the matter at the end of his article on the scotch reformer  this is a little less than fair  if any one among the evangelists of that period showed more serious political sense than another it was assuredly knox and even in this very matter of female rule although i do not suppose any one nowadays will feel inclined to endorse his sentiments i confess i can make great allowance for his conduct  the controversy besides has an interest of its own in view of later controversies  john knox from 1556 to 1559 was resident in geneva as minister jointly with goodman of a little church of english refugees  he and his congregation were banished from england by one woman mary tudor and proscribed in scotland by another the regent mary of guise  the coincidence was tempting here were many abuses centring about one abuse here was christs gospel persecuted in the two kingdoms by one anomalous power  he had not far to go to find the idea that female government was anomalous  it was an age indeed in which women capable and incapable played a conspicuous part upon the stage of european history and yet their rule whatever may have been the opinion of here and there a wise man or enthusiast was regarded as an anomaly by the great bulk of their contemporaries  it was defended as an anomaly it and all that accompanied and sanctioned it was set aside as a single exception and no one thought of reasoning down from queens and extending their privileges to ordinary women great ladies as we know had the privilege of entering into monasteries and cloisters otherwise forbidden to their sex as with one thing so with another  thus margaret of navarre wrote books with great acclamation and no one seemingly saw fit to call her conduct in question but mademoiselle de gournay montaignes adopted daughter was in a controversy with the world as to whether a woman might be an author without incongruity  thus too we have theodore agrippa daubigne writing to his daughters about the learned women of his century and cautioning them in conclusion that the study of letters was unsuited to ladies of a middling station and should be reserved for princesses 1 and once more if we desire to see the same principle carried to ludicrous extreme we shall find that reverend father in god the abbot of brantome claiming on the authority of some lord of his acquaintance a privilege or rather a duty of free love for great princesses and carefully excluding other ladies from the same gallant dispensation 2  one sees the spirit in which these immunities were granted and how they were but the natural consequence of that awe for courts and kings that made the last writer tell us with simple wonder how catherine de medici would laugh her fill just like another over the humours of pantaloons and zanies  and such servility was of all things what would touch most nearly the republican spirit of knox  it was not difficult for him to set aside this weak scruple of loyalty  the lantern of his analysis did not always shine with a very serviceable light but he had the virtue at least to carry it into many places of fictitious holiness and was not abashed by the tinsel divinity that hedged kings and queens from his contemporaries  and so he could put the proposition in the form already mentioned there was christs gospel persecuted in the two kingdoms by one anomalous power plainly then the regiment of women was antichristian  early in 1558 he communicated this discovery to the world by publishing at geneva his notorious book  the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women 3  1 oeuvres de daubigne i 449 2 dames illustres pp 358360 3 works of john knox iv 349  as a whole it is a dull performance but the preface as is usual with knox is both interesting and morally fine  knox was not one of those who are humble in the hour of triumph he was aggressive even when things were at their worst  he had a grim reliance in himself or rather in his mission if he were not sure that he was a great man he was at least sure that he was one set apart to do great things  and he judged simply that whatever passed in his mind whatever moved him to flee from persecution instead of constantly facing it out or as here to publish and withhold his name from the titlepage of a critical work would not fail to be of interest perhaps of benefit to the world  there may be something more finely sensitive in the modern humour that tends more and more to withdraw a mans personality from the lessons he inculcates or the cause that he has espoused but there is a loss herewith of wholesome responsibility and when we find in the works of knox as in the epistles of paul the man himself standing nakedly forward courting and anticipating criticism putting his character as it were in pledge for the sincerity of his doctrine we had best waive the question of delicacy and make our acknowledgments for a lesson of courage not unnecessary in these days of anonymous criticism and much light otherwise unattainable on the spirit in which great movements were initiated and carried forward  knoxs personal revelations are always interesting and in the case of the first blast as i have said there is no exception to the rule  he begins by stating the solemn responsibility of all who are watchmen over gods flock and all are watchmen he goes on to explain with that fine breadth of spirit that characterises him even when as here he shows himself most narrow all are watchmen whose eyes god doth open and whose conscience he pricketh to admonish the ungodly  and with the full consciousness of this great duty before him he sets himself to answer the scruples of timorous or worldlyminded people  how can a man repent he asks unless the nature of his transgression is made plain to him  and therefore i say he continues that of necessity it is that this monstriferous empire of women which among all enormities that this day do abound upon the face of the whole earth is most detestable and damnable be openly and plainly declared to the world to the end that some may repent and be saved  to those who think the doctrine useless because it cannot be expected to amend those princes whom it would dispossess if once accepted he makes answer in a strain that shows him at his greatest  after having instanced how the rumour of christs censures found its way to herod in his own court even so he continues may the sound of our weak trumpet by the support of some wind blow it from the south or blow it from the north it is of no matter come to the ears of the chief offenders  but whether it do or not yet dare we not cease to blow as god will give strength  for we are debtors to more than to princes to wit to the great multitude of our brethren of whom no doubt a great number have heretofore offended by error and ignorance  it is for the multitude then he writes he does not greatly hope that his trumpet will be audible in palaces or that crowned women will submissively discrown themselves at his appeal what he does hope in plain english is to encourage and justify rebellion and we shall see before we have done that he can put his purpose into words as roundly as i can put it for him  this he sees to be a matter of much hazard he is not altogether so brutish and insensible but that he has laid his account what the finishing of the work may cost  he knows that he will find many adversaries since to the most part of men lawful and godly appeareth whatsoever antiquity hath received  he looks for opposition not only of the ignorant multitude but of the wise politic and quiet spirits of the earth  he will be called foolish curious despiteful and a sower of sedition and one day perhaps for all he is now nameless he may be attainted of treason  yet he has determined to obey god notwithstanding that the world shall rage thereat  finally he makes some excuse for the anonymous appearance of this first instalment it is his purpose thrice to blow the trumpet in this matter if god so permit twice he intends to do it without name but at the last blast to take the odium upon himself that all others may be purged  thus he ends the preface and enters upon his argument with a secondary title the first blast to awake women degenerate we are in the land of assertion without delay  that a woman should bear rule superiority dominion or empire over any realm nation or city he tells us is repugnant to nature contumely to god and a subversion of good order  women are weak frail impatient feeble and foolish  god has denied to woman wisdom to consider or providence to foresee what is profitable to a commonwealth  women have been ever lightly esteemed they have been denied the tutory of their own sons and subjected to the unquestionable sway of their husbands and surely it is irrational to give the greater where the less has been withheld and suffer a woman to reign supreme over a great kingdom who would be allowed no authority by her own fireside  he appeals to the bible but though he makes much of the first transgression and certain strong texts in genesis and pauls epistles he does not appeal with entire success  the cases of deborah and huldah can be brought into no sort of harmony with his thesis indeed i may say that logically he left his bones there and that it is but the phantom of an argument that he parades thenceforward to the end  well was it for knox that he succeeded no better it is under this very ambiguity about deborah that we shall find him fain to creep for shelter before he is done with the regiment of women  after having thus exhausted scripture and formulated its teaching in the somewhat blasphemous maxim that the man is placed above the woman even as god above the angels he goes on triumphantly to adduce the testimonies of tertullian augustine ambrose basil chrysostom and the pandects and having gathered this little cloud of witnesses about him like pursuivants about a herald he solemnly proclaims all reigning women to be traitoresses and rebels against god discharges all men thenceforward from holding any office under such monstrous regiment and calls upon all the lieges with one consent to study to repress the inordinate pride and tyranny of queens  if this is not treasonable teaching one would be glad to know what is and yet as if he feared he had not made the case plain enough against himself he goes on to deduce the startling corollary that all oaths of allegiance must be incontinently broken  if it was sin thus to have sworn even in ignorance it were obstinate sin to continue to respect them after fuller knowledge  then comes the peroration in which he cries aloud against the cruelties of that cursed jezebel of england  that horrible monster jezebel of england and after having predicted sudden destruction to her rule and to the rule of all crowned women and warned all men that if they presume to defend the same when any noble heart shall be raised up to vindicate the liberty of his country they shall not fail to perish themselves in the ruin he concludes with a last rhetorical flourish and therefore let all men be advertised for the trumpet hath once blown  the capitals are his own  in writing he probably felt the want of some such reverberation of the pulpit under strong hands as he was wont to emphasise his spoken utterances withal there would seem to him a want of passion in the orderly lines of type and i suppose we may take the capitals as a mere substitute for the great voice with which he would have given it forth had we heard it from his own lips indeed as it is in this little strain of rhetoric about the trumpet this current allusion to the fall of jericho that alone distinguishes his bitter and hasty production he was probably right according to all artistic canon thus to support and accentuate in conclusion the sustained metaphor of a hostile proclamation  it is curious by the way to note how favourite an image the trumpet was with the reformer  he returns to it again and again it is the alpha and omega of his rhetoric it is to him what a ship is to the stage sailor and one would almost fancy he had begun the world as a trumpeters apprentice  the partiality is surely characteristic  all his life long he was blowing summonses before various jerichos some of which fell duly but not all  wherever he appears in history his speech is loud angry and hostile there is no peace in his life and little tenderness he is always sounding hopefully to the front for some rough enterprise  and as his voice had something of the trumpets hardness it had something also of the trumpets warlike inspiration  so randolph possibly fresh from the sound of the reformers preaching writes of him to cecil where your honour exhorteth us to stoutness i assure you the voice of one man is able in an hour to put more life in us than six hundred trumpets continually blustering in our ears 1  1 mcries life of knox ii 41  thus was the proclamation made  nor was it long in wakening all the echoes of europe  what success might have attended it had the question decided been a purely abstract question it is difficult to say  as it was it was to stand or fall not by logic but by political needs and sympathies  thus in france his doctrine was to have some future because protestants suffered there under the feeble and treacherous regency of catherine de medici and thus it was to have no future anywhere else because the protestant interest was bound up with the prosperity of queen elizabeth  this stumblingblock lay at the very threshold of the matter and knox in the text of the first blast had set everybody the wrong example and gone to the ground himself  he finds occasion to regret the blood of innocent lady jane dudley but lady jane dudley or lady jane grey as we call her was a wouldbe traitoress and rebel against god to use his own expressions  if therefore political and religious sympathy led knox himself into so grave a partiality what was he to expect from his disciples  if the trumpet gave so ambiguous a sound who could heartily prepare himself for the battle  the question whether lady jane dudley was an innocent martyr or a traitoress against god whose inordinate pride and tyranny had been effectually repressed was thus left altogether in the wind and it was not perhaps wonderful if many of knoxs readers concluded that all right and wrong in the matter turned upon the degree of the sovereigns orthodoxy and possible helpfulness to the reformation  he should have been the more careful of such an ambiguity of meaning as he must have known well the lukewarm indifference and dishonesty of his fellowreformers in political matters  he had already in 1556 or 1557 talked the matter over with his great master calvin in a private conversation and the interview 1 must have been truly distasteful to both parties  calvin indeed went a far way with him in theory and owned that the government of women was a deviation from the original and proper order of nature to be ranked no less than slavery among the punishments consequent upon the fall of man  but in practice their two roads separated  for the man of geneva saw difficulties in the way of the scripture proof in the cases of deborah and huldah and in the prophecy of isaiah that queens should be the nursing mothers of the church  and as the bible was not decisive he thought the subject should be let alone because by custom and public consent and long practice it has been established that realms and principalities may descend to females by hereditary right and it would not be lawful to unsettle governments which are ordained by the peculiar providence of god  i imagine knoxs ears must have burned during this interview  think of him listening dutifully to all this  how it would not do to meddle with anointed kings  how there was a peculiar providence in these great affairs and then think of his own peroration and the noble heart whom he looks for to vindicate the liberty of his country or his answer to queen mary when she asked him who he was to interfere in the affairs of scotland madam a subject born within the same  indeed the two doctors who differed at this private conversation represented at the moment two principles of enormous import in the subsequent history of europe  in calvin we have represented that passive obedience that toleration of injustice and absurdity that holding back of the hand from political affairs as from something unclean which lost france if we are to believe m michelet for the reformation a spirit necessarily fatal in the long run to the existence of any sect that may profess it a suicidal doctrine that survives among us to this day in narrow views of personal duty and the low political morality of many virtuous men  in knox on the other hand we see foreshadowed the whole puritan revolution and the scaffold of charles i  1 described by calvin in a letter to cecil knoxs works vol iv  there is little doubt in my mind that this interview was what caused knox to print his book without a name 1  it was a dangerous thing to contradict the man of geneva and doubly so surely when one had had the advantage of correction from him in a private conversation and knox had his little flock of english refugees to consider  if they had fallen into bad odour at geneva where else was there left to flee to  it was printed as i said in 1558 and by a singular mala propos in that same year mary died and elizabeth succeeded to the throne of england  and just as the accession of catholic queen mary had condemned female rule in the eyes of knox the accession of protestant queen elizabeth justified it in the eyes of his colleagues  female rule ceases to be an anomaly not because elizabeth can reply to eight ambassadors in one day in their different languages but because she represents for the moment the political future of the reformation  the exiles troop back to england with songs of praise in their mouths  the bright accidental star of which we have all read in the preface to the bible has risen over the darkness of europe  there is a thrill of hope through the persecuted churches of the continent  calvin writes to cecil washing his hands of knox and his political heresies  the sale of the first blast is prohibited in geneva and along with it the bold book of knoxs colleague goodman  a book dear to milton  where female rule was briefly characterised as a monster in nature and disorder among men 2  any who may ever have doubted or been for a moment led away by knox or goodman or their own wicked imaginations are now more than convinced  they have seen the accidental star  aylmer with his eye set greedily on a possible bishopric and the better to obtain the favour of the new queen 3 sharpens his pen to confound knox by logic  what need  he has been confounded by facts  thus what had been to the refugees of geneva as the very word of god no sooner were they back in england than behold it was the word of the devil 4  1 it was anonymously published but no one seems to have been in doubt about its authorship he might as well have set his name to it for all the good he got by holding it back 2 knoxs works iv 358 3 strypes aylmer p 16 4 it may interest the reader to know that these so says thomasius are the ipsissima verba schlusselburgii  now what of the real sentiments of these loyal subjects of elizabeth  they professed a holy horror for knoxs position let us see if their own would please a modern audience any better or was in substance greatly different  john aylmer afterwards bishop of london published an answer to knox under the title of an harbour for faithful and true subjects against the late blown blast concerning the government of women 1  and certainly he was a thought more acute a thought less precipitate and simple than his adversary  he is not to be led away by such captious terms as natural and unnatural  it is obvious to him that a womans disability to rule is not natural in the same sense in which it is natural for a stone to fall or fire to burn he is doubtful on the whole whether this disability be natural at all nay when he is laying it down that a woman should not be a priest he shows some elementary conception of what many of us now hold to be the truth of the matter the bringingup of women he says is commonly such that they cannot have the necessary qualifications for they are not brought upon learning in schools nor trained in disputation  and even so he can ask are there not in england women think you that for learning and wisdom could tell their household and neighbours as good a tale as any sir john there  for all that his advocacy is weak  if womens rule is not unnatural in a sense preclusive of its very existence it is neither so convenient nor so profitable as the government of men  he holds england to be specially suitable for the government of women because there the governor is more limited and restrained by the other members of the constitution than in other places and this argument has kept his book from being altogether forgotten  it is only in hereditary monarchies that he will offer any defence of the anomaly  if rulers were to be chosen by lot or suffrage he would not that any women should stand in the election but men only  the law of succession of crowns was a law to him in the same sense as the law of evolution is a law to mr herbert spencer and the one and the other counsels his readers in a spirit suggestively alike not to kick against the pricks or seek to be more wise than he who made them 2  if god has put a female child into the direct line of inheritance it is gods affair  his strength will be perfected in her weakness  he makes the creator address the objectors in this not very flattering vein i that could make daniel a sucking babe to judge better than the wisest lawyers a brute beast to reprehend the folly of a prophet and poor fishers to confound the great clerks of the world  cannot i make a woman to be a good ruler over you this is the last word of his reasoning  although he was not altogether without puritanic leaven shown particularly in what he says of the incomes of bishops yet it was rather loyalty to the old order of things than any generous belief in the capacity of women that raised up for them this clerical champion  his courtly spirit contrasts singularly with the rude bracing republicanism of knox  thy knee shall bow he says thy cap shall off thy tongue shall speak reverently of thy sovereign  for himself his tongue is even more than reverent  nothing can stay the issue of his eloquent adulation  again and again the remembrance of elizabeths virtues carries him away and he has to hark back again to find the scent of his argument  he is repressing his vehement adoration throughout until when the end comes and he feels his business at an end he can indulge himself to his hearts content in indiscriminate laudation of his royal mistress  it is humorous to think that this illustrious lady whom he here praises among many other excellences for the simplicity of her attire and the marvellous meekness of her stomach threatened him years after in no very meek terms for a sermon against female vanity in dress which she held as a reflection on herself 3  1 i am indebted for a sight of this book to the kindness of mr david laing the editor of knoxs works 2 social statics p 64 etc 3 hallams const  hist of england i 225 note m  whatever was wanting here in respect for women generally there was no want of respect for the queen and one cannot very greatly wonder if these devoted servants looked askance not upon knox only but on his little flock as they came back to england tainted with disloyal doctrine  for them as for him the accidental star rose somewhat red and angry  as for poor knox his position was the saddest of all  for the juncture seemed to him of the highest importance it was the nick of time the floodwater of opportunity  not only was there an opening for him in scotland a smouldering brand of civil liberty and religious enthusiasm which it should be for him to kindle into flame with his powerful breath but he had his eye seemingly on an object of even higher worth  for now when religious sympathy ran so high that it could be set against national aversion he wished to begin the fusion together of england and scotland and to begin it at the sore place  if once the open wound were closed at the border the work would be half done  ministers placed at berwick and such places might seek their converts equally on either side of the march old enemies would sit together to hear the gospel of peace and forget the inherited jealousies of many generations in the enthusiasm of a common faith or  let us say better  a common heresy  for people are not most conscious of brotherhood when they continue languidly together in one creed but when with some doubt with some danger perhaps and certainly not without some reluctance they violently break with the tradition of the past and go forth from the sanctuary of their fathers to worship under the bare heaven  a new creed like a new country is an unhomely place of sojourn but it makes men lean on one another and join hands  it was on this that knox relied to begin the union of the english and the scotch  and he had perhaps better means of judging than any even of his contemporaries  he knew the temper of both nations and already during his two years chaplaincy at berwick he had seen his scheme put to the proof  but whether practicable or not the proposal does him much honour  that he should thus have sought to make a lovematch of it between the two peoples and tried to win their inclination towards a union instead of simply transferring them like so many sheep by a marriage or testament or private treaty is thoroughly characteristic of what is best in the man  nor was this all he had besides to assure himself of english support secret or avowed for the reformation party in scotland a delicate affair trenching upon treason  and so he had plenty to say to cecil plenty that he did not care to commit to paper neither yet to the knowledge of many  but his miserable publication had shut the doors of england in his face summoned to edinburgh by the confederate lords he waited at dieppe anxiously praying for leave to journey through england  the most dispiriting tidings reach him  his messengers coming from so obnoxious a quarter narrowly escape imprisonment  his old congregation are coldly received and even begin to look back again to their place of exile with regret  my first blast he writes ruefully has blown from me all my friends of england  and then he adds with a snarl the second blast i fear shall sound somewhat more sharp except men be more moderate than i hear they are 1  but the threat is empty there will never be a second blast  he has had enough of that trumpet  nay he begins to feel uneasily that unless he is to be rendered useless for the rest of his life unless he is to lose his right arm and go about his great work maimed and impotent he must find some way of making his peace with england and the indignant queen  the letter just quoted was written on the 6th of april 1559 and on the 10th after he had cooled his heels for four days more about the streets of dieppe he gave in altogether and writes a letter of capitulation to cecil in this letter 2 which he kept back until the 22d still hoping that things would come right of themselves he censures the great secretary for having followed the world in the way of perdition characterises him as worthy of hell and threatens him if he be not found simple sincere and fervent in the cause of christs gospel that he shall taste of the same cup that politic heads have drunken in before him  this is all i take it out of respect for the reformers own position if he is going to be humiliated let others be humiliated first like a child who will not take his medicine until he has made his nurse and his mother drink of it before him  but i have say you written a treasonable book against the regiment and empire of women    the writing of that book i will not deny but to prove it treasonable i think it shall be hard    it is hinted that my book shall be written against  if so be sir i greatly doubt they shall rather hurt nor than mend the matter and here come the terms of capitulation for he does not surrender unconditionally even in this sore strait and yet if any he goes on think me enemy to the person or yet to the regiment of her whom god hath now promoted they are utterly deceived in me for the miraculous work of god comforting his afflicted by means of an infirm vessel i do acknowledge and the power of his most potent hand i will obey  more plainly to speak if queen elizabeth shall confess that the extraordinary dispensation of gods great mercy maketh that lawful unto her which both nature and gods law do deny to all women then shall none in england be more willing to maintain her lawful authority than i shall be but if gods wondrous work set aside she ground as god forbid the justness of her title upon consuetude laws or ordinances of men then  then knox will denounce her  not so he is more politic nowadays  then he greatly fears that her ingratitude to god will not go long without punishment  1 knox to mrs locke 6th april 1559  works vi 14 2 knox to sir william cecil 10th april 1559  works ii 16 or vi 15  his letter to elizabeth written some few months later was a mere amplification of the sentences quoted above  she must base her title entirely upon the extraordinary providence of god but if she does this if thus in gods presence she humbles herself so will he with tongue and pen justify her authority as the holy ghost hath justified the same in deborah that blessed mother in israel 1  and so you see his consistency is preserved he is merely applying the doctrine of the first blast  the argument goes thus the regiment of women is as before noted in our work repugnant to nature contumely to god and a subversion of good order it has nevertheless pleased god to raise up as exceptions to this law first deborah and afterward elizabeth tudor  whose regiment we shall proceed to celebrate  1 knox to queen elizabeth july 20th 1559  works vi 47 or ii 26  there is no evidence as to how the reformers explanations were received and indeed it is most probable that the letter was never shown to elizabeth at all  for it was sent under cover of another to cecil and as it was not of a very courtly conception throughout and was of all things what would most excite the queens uneasy jealousy about her title it is like enough that the secretary exercised his discretion he had knoxs leave in this case and did not always wait for that it is reputed to put the letter harmlessly away beside other valueless or unpresentable state papers  i wonder very much if he did the same with another 1 written two years later after mary had come into scotland in which knox almost seeks to make elizabeth an accomplice with him in the matter of the first blast  the queen of scotland is going to have that work refuted he tells her and though it were but foolishness in him to prescribe unto her majesty what is to be done he would yet remind her that mary is neither so much alarmed about her own security nor so generously interested in elizabeths that she would take such pains unless her crafty counsel in so doing shot at a further mark  there is something really ingenious in this letter it showed knox in the double capacity of the author of the first blast and the faithful friend of elizabeth and he combines them there so naturally that one would scarcely imagine the two to be incongruous  1 knox to queen elizabeth august 6th 1561  works vi 126  twenty days later he was defending his intemperate publication to another queen  his own queen mary stuart this was on the first of those three interviews which he has preserved for us with so much dramatic vigour in the picturesque pages of his history  after he had avowed the authorship in his usual haughty style mary asked you think then that i have no just authority  the question was evaded  please your majesty he answered that learned men in all ages have had their judgments free and most commonly disagreeing from the common judgment of the world such also have they published by pen and tongue and yet notwithstanding they themselves have lived in the common society with others and have borne patiently with the errors and imperfections which they could not amend  thus did plato the philosopher thus will do john knox  i have communicated my judgment to the world if the realm finds no inconvenience from the regiment of a woman that which they approve shall i not further disallow than within my own breast but shall be as well content to live under your grace as paul was to live under nero  and my hope is that so long as ye defile not your hands with the blood of the saints of god neither i nor my book shall hurt either you or your authority  all this is admirable in wisdom and moderation and except that he might have hit upon a comparison less offensive than that with paul and nero hardly to be bettered  having said thus much he feels he needs say no more and so when he is further pressed he closes that part of the discussion with an astonishing sally if he has been content to let this matter sleep he would recommend her grace to follow his example with thankfulness of heart it is grimly to be understood which of them has most to fear if the question should be reawakened  so the talk wandered to other subjects  only when the queen was summoned at last to dinner for it was afternoon knox made his salutation in this form of words i pray god madam that you may be as much blessed within the commonwealth of scotland if it be the pleasure of god as ever deborah was in the commonwealth of israel 1  deborah again  1 knoxs works ii 278280  but he was not yet done with the echoes of his own first blast  in 1571 when he was already near his end the old controversy was taken up in one of a series of anonymous libels against the reformer affixed sunday after sunday to the church door  the dilemma was fairly enough stated either his doctrine is false in which case he is a false doctor and seditious or if it be true why does he avow and approve the contrare i mean that regiment in the queen of englands person which he avoweth and approveth not only praying for the maintenance of her estate but also procuring her aid and support against his own native country  knox answered the libel as his wont was next sunday from the pulpit  he justified the first blast with all the old arrogance there is no drawing back there  the regiment of women is repugnant to nature contumely to god and a subversion of good order as before  when he prays for the maintenance of elizabeths estate he is only following the example of those prophets of god who warned and comforted the wicked kings of israel or of jeremiah who bade the jews pray for the prosperity of nebuchadnezzar  as for the queens aid there is no harm in that quia these are his own words quia omnia munda mundis because to the pure all things are pure  one thing in conclusion he may not pretermit to give the lie in the throat to his accuser where he charges him with seeking support against his native country  what i have been to my country said the old reformer what i have been to my country albeit this unthankful age will not know yet the ages to come will be compelled to bear witness to the truth  and thus i cease requiring of all men that have anything to oppone against me that he may they may do it so plainly as that i may make myself and all my doings manifest to the world  for to me it seemeth a thing unreasonable that in this my decrepit age i shall be compelled to fight against shadows and howlets that dare not abide the light 1  1 calderwoods history of the kirk of scotland edition of the wodrow society iii 5154  now in this which may be called his last blast there is as sharp speaking as any in the first blast itself  he is of the same opinion to the end you see although he has been obliged to cloak and garble that opinion for political ends he has been tacking indeed and he has indeed been seeking the favour of a queen but what man ever sought a queens favour with a more virtuous purpose or with as little courtly policy  the question of consistency is delicate and must be made plain  knox never changed his opinion about female rule but lived to regret that he had published that opinion  doubtless he had many thoughts so far out of the range of public sympathy that he could only keep them to himself and in his own words bear patiently with the errors and imperfections that he could not amend  for example i make no doubt myself that in his own heart he did hold the shocking dogma attributed to him by more than one calumniator and that had the time been ripe had there been aught to gain by it instead of all to lose he would have been the first to assert that scotland was elective instead of hereditary  elective as in the days of paganism as one thevet says in holy horror 1  and yet because the time was not ripe i find no hint of such an idea in his collected works  now the regiment of women was another matter that he should have kept to himself right or wrong his opinion did not fit the moment right or wrong as aylmer puts it the blast was blown out of season  and this it was that he began to perceive after the accession of elizabeth not that he had been wrong and that female rule was a good thing for he had said from the first that the felicity of some women in their empires could not change the law of god and the nature of created things not this but that the regiment of women was one of those imperfections of society which must be borne with because yet they cannot be remedied  the thing had seemed so obvious to him in his sense of unspeakable masculine superiority and his fine contempt for what is only sanctioned by antiquity and common consent he had imagined that at the first hint men would arise and shake off the debasing tyranny  he found himself wrong and he showed that he could be moderate in his own fashion and understood the spirit of true compromise  he came round to calvins position in fact but by a different way  and it derogates nothing from the merit of this wise attitude that it was the consequence of a change of interest we are all taught by interest and if the interest be not merely selfish there is no wiser preceptor under heaven and perhaps no sterner  1 bayles historical dictionary art knox remark g  such is the history of john knoxs connection with the controversy about female rule  in itself this is obviously an incomplete study not fully to be understood without a knowledge of his private relations with the other sex and what he thought of their position in domestic life  this shall be dealt with in another paper   ii  private life   to those who know knox by hearsay only i believe the matter of this paper will be somewhat astonishing  for the hard energy of the man in all public mattress has possessed the imagination of the world he remains for posterity in certain traditional phrases browbeating queen mary or breaking beautiful carved work in abbeys and cathedrals that had long smoked themselves out and were no more than sorry ruins while he was still quietly teaching children in a country gentlemans family  it does not consist with the common acceptation of his character to fancy him much moved except with anger  and yet the language of passion came to his pen as readily whether it was a passion of denunciation against some of the abuses that vexed his righteous spirit or of yearning for the society of an absent friend  he was vehement in affection as in doctrine  i will not deny that there may have been along with his vehemence something shifty and for the moment only that like many men and many scotchmen he saw the world and his own heart not so much under any very steady equable light as by extreme flashes of passion true for the moment but not true in the long run  there does seem to me to be something of this traceable in the reformers utterances precipitation and repentance hardy speech and action somewhat circumspect a strong tendency to see himself in a heroic light and to place a ready belief in the disposition of the moment  withal he had considerable confidence in himself and in the uprightness of his own disciplined emotions underlying much sincere aspiration after spiritual humility  and it is this confidence that makes his intercourse with women so interesting to a modern  it would be easy of course to make fun of the whole affair to picture him strutting vaingloriously among these inferior creatures or compare a religious friendship in the sixteenth century with what was called i think a literary friendship in the eighteenth but it is more just and profitable to recognise what there is sterling and human underneath all his theoretical affectations of superiority  women he has said in his first blast are weak frail impatient feeble and foolish and yet it does not appear that he was himself any less dependent than other men upon the sympathy and affection of these weak frail impatient feeble and foolish creatures it seems even as if he had been rather more dependent than most  of those who are to act influentially on their fellows we should expect always something large and public in their way of life something more or less urbane and comprehensive in their sentiment for others  we should not expect to see them spend their sympathy in idyls however beautiful  we should not seek them among those who if they have but a wife to their bosom ask no more of womankind just as they ask no more of their own sex if they can find a friend or two for their immediate need  they will be quick to feel all the pleasures of our association  not the great ones alone but all  they will know not love only but all those other ways in which man and woman mutually make each other happy  by sympathy by admiration by the atmosphere they bear about them  down to the mere impersonal pleasure of passing happy faces in the street  for through all this gradation the difference of sex makes itself pleasurably felt  down to the most lukewarm courtesies of life there is a special chivalry due and a special pleasure received when the two sexes are brought ever so lightly into contact  we love our mothers otherwise than we love our fathers a sister is not as a brother to us and friendship between man and woman be it never so unalloyed and innocent is not the same as friendship between man and man  such friendship is not even possible for all  to conjoin tenderness for a woman that is not far short of passionate with such disinterestedness and beautiful gratuity of affection as there is between friends of the same sex requires no ordinary disposition in the man for either it would presuppose quite womanly delicacy of perception and as it were a curiosity in shades of differing sentiment or it would mean that he had accepted the large simple divisions of society a strong and positive spirit robustly virtuous who has chosen a better part coarsely and holds to it steadfastly with all its consequences of pain to himself and others as one who should go straight before him on a journey neither tempted by wayside flowers nor very scrupulous of small lives under foot  it was in virtue of this latter disposition that knox was capable of those intimacies with women that embellished his life and we find him preserved for us in old letters as a man of many women friends a man of some expansion toward the other sex a man ever ready to comfort weeping women and to weep along with them  of such scraps and fragments of evidence as to his private life and more intimate thoughts as have survived to us from all the perils that environ written paper an astonishingly large proportion is in the shape of letters to women of his familiarity  he was twice married but that is not greatly to the purpose for the turk who thinks even more meanly of women than john knox is none the less given to marrying what is really significant is quite apart from marriage  for the man knox was a true man and woman the ewigweibliche was as necessary to him in spite of all low theories as ever she was to goethe  he came to her in a certain halo of his own as the minister of truth just as goethe came to her in a glory of art he made himself necessary to troubled hearts and minds exercised in the painful complications that naturally result from all changes in the worlds way of thinking and those whom he had thus helped became dear to him and were made the chosen companions of his leisure if they were at hand or encouraged and comforted by letter if they were afar  it must not be forgotten that knox had been a presbyter of the old church and that the many women whom we shall see gathering around him as he goes through life had probably been accustomed while still in the communion of rome to rely much upon some chosen spiritual director so that the intimacies of which i propose to offer some account while testifying to a good heart in the reformer testify also to a certain survival of the spirit of the confessional in the reformed church and are not properly to be judged without this idea  there is no friendship so noble but it is the product of the time and a world of little finical observances and little frail proprieties and fashions of the hour go to make or to mar to stint or to perfect the union of spirits the most loving and the most intolerant of such interference  the trick of the country and the age steps in even between the mother and her child counts out their caresses upon niggardly fingers and says in the voice of authority that this one thing shall be a matter of confidence between them and this other thing shall not  and thus it is that we must take into reckoning whatever tended to modify the social atmosphere in which knox and his women friends met and loved and trusted each other  to the man who had been their priest and was now their minister women would be able to speak with a confidence quite impossible in these latter days the women would be able to speak and the man to hear  it was a beaten road just then and i daresay we should be no less scandalised at their plain speech than they if they could come back to earth would be offended at our waltzes and worldly fashions  this then was the footing on which knox stood with his many women friends  the reader will see as he goes on how much of warmth of interest and of that happy mutual dependence which is the very gist of friendship he contrived to ingraft upon this somewhat dry relationship of penitent and confessor  it must be understood that we know nothing of his intercourse with women as indeed we know little at all about his life until he came to berwick in 1549 when he was already in the fortyfifth year of his age  at the same time it is just possible that some of a little group at edinburgh with whom he corresponded during his last absence may have been friends of an older standing  certainly they were of all his female correspondents the least personally favoured  he treats them throughout in a comprehensive sort of spirit that must at times have been a little wounding  thus he remits one of them to his former letters which i trust be common betwixt you and the rest of our sisters for to me ye are all equal in christ 1  another letter is a gem in this way albeit it begins albeit i have no particular matter to write unto you beloved sister yet i could not refrain to write these few lines to you in declaration of my remembrance of you  true it is that i have many whom i bear in equal remembrance before god with you to whom at present i write nothing either for that i esteem them stronger than you and therefore they need the less my rude labours or else because they have not provoked me by their writing to recompense their remembrance 2  his sisters in edinburgh had evidently to provoke his attention pretty constantly nearly all his letters are on the face of them answers to questions and the answers are given with a certain crudity that i do not find repeated when he writes to those he really cares for  so when they consult him about womens apparel a subject on which his opinion may be pretty correctly imagined by the ingenious reader for himself he takes occasion to anticipate some of the most offensive matter of the first blast in a style of real brutality 3  it is not merely that he tells them the garments of women do declare their weakness and inability to execute the office of man though that in itself is neither very wise nor very opportune in such a correspondence one would think but if the reader will take the trouble to wade through the long tedious sermon for himself he will see proof enough that knox neither loved nor very deeply respected the women he was then addressing in very truth i believe these edinburgh sisters simply bored him  he had a certain interest in them as his children in the lord they were continually provoking him by their writing and if they handed his letters about writing to them was as good a form of publication as was then open to him in scotland  there is one letter however in this budget addressed to the wife of clerkregister mackgil which is worthy of some further mention  the clerkregister had not opened his heart it would appear to the preaching of the gospel and mrs mackgil has written seeking the reformers prayers in his behalf  your husband he answers is dear to me for that he is a man indued with some good gifts but more dear for that he is your husband charity moveth me to thirst his illumination both for his comfort and for the trouble which you sustain by his coldness which justly may be called infidelity  he wishes her however not to hope too much he can promise that his prayers will be earnest but not that they will be effectual it is possible that this is to be her cross in life that her head appointed by god for her comfort should be her enemy  and if this be so well there is nothing for it with patience she must abide gods merciful deliverance taking heed only that she does not obey manifest iniquity for the pleasure of any mortal man 4  i conceive this epistle would have given a very modified sort of pleasure to the clerkregister had it chanced to fall into his hands compare its tenor  the dry resignation not without a hope of merciful deliverance therein recommended  with these words from another letter written but the year before to two married women of london call first for grace by jesus and thereafter communicate with your faithful husbands and then shall god i doubt not conduct your footsteps and direct your counsels to his glory 5  here the husbands are put in a very high place we can recognise here the same hand that has written for our instruction how the man is set above the woman even as god above the angels  but the point of the distinction is plain  for clerkregister mackgil was not a faithful husband displayed indeed towards religion a coldness which justly might be called infidelity  we shall see in more notable instances how much knoxs conception of the duty of wives varies according to the zeal and orthodoxy of the husband  1 works iv 244 2 works iv 246 3 ib iv 225 4 works iv 245 5 ib iv 221  as i have said he may possibly have made the acquaintance of mrs mackgil mrs guthrie or some other or all of these edinburgh friends while he was still douglas of longniddrys private tutor  but our certain knowledge begins in 1549  he was then but newly escaped from his captivity in france after pulling an oar for nineteen months on the benches of the galley nostre dame now up the rivers holding stealthy intercourse with other scottish prisoners in the castle of rouen now out in the north sea raising his sick head to catch a glimpse of the faroff steeples of st andrews  and now he was sent down by the english privy council as a preacher to berwickupontweed somewhat shaken in health by all his hardships full of pains and agues and tormented by gravel that sorrow of great men altogether what with his romantic story his weak health and his great faculty of eloquence a very natural object for the sympathy of devout women  at this happy juncture he fell into the company of a mrs elizabeth bowes wife of richard bowes of aske in yorkshire to whom she had borne twelve children  she was a religious hypochondriac a very weariful woman full of doubts and scruples and giving no rest on earth either to herself or to those whom she honoured with her confidence from the first time she heard knox preach she formed a high opinion of him and was solicitous ever after of his society 1  nor was knox unresponsive i have always delighted in your company he writes and when labours would permit you know i have not spared hours to talk and commune with you often when they had met in depression he reminds her god hath sent great comfort unto both 2  we can gather from such letters as are yet extant how close and continuous was their intercourse  i think it best you remain till the morrow he writes once and so shall we commune at large at afternoon  this day you know to be the day of my study and prayer unto god yet if your trouble be intolerable or if you think my presence may release your pain do as the spirit shall move you    your messenger found me in bed after a sore trouble and most dolorous night and so dolour may complain to dolour when we two meet    and this is more plain than ever i spoke to let you know you have a companion in trouble 3  once we have the curtain raised for a moment and can look at the two together for the length of a phrase  after the writing of this preceding writes knox your brother and mine harrie wycliffe did advertise me by writing that our adversary the devil took occasion to trouble you because that i did start back from you rehearsing your infirmities  i remember myself so to have done and that is my common on consuetude when anything pierceth or toucheth my heart  call to your mind what i did standing at the cupboard at alnwick  in very deed i thought that no creature had been tempted as i was and when i heard proceed from your mouth the very same words that he troubles me with i did wonder and from my heart lament your sore trouble knowing in myself the dolour thereof 4 now intercourse of so very close a description whether it be religious intercourse or not is apt to displease and disquiet a husband and we know incidentally from knox himself that there was some little scandal about his intimacy with mrs bowes  the slander and fear of men he writes has impeded me to exercise my pen so oft as i would yea very shame hath holden me from your company when i was most surely persuaded that god had appointed me at that time to comfort and feed your hungry and afflicted soul god in his infinite mercy  he goes on remove not only from me all fear that tendeth not to godliness but from others suspicion to judge of me otherwise than it becometh one member to judge of another 5  and the scandal such as it was would not be allayed by the dissension in which mrs bowes seems to have lived with her family upon the matter of religion and the countenance shown by knox to her resistance  talking of these conflicts and her courage against her own flesh and most inward affections yea against some of her most natural friends he writes it to the praise of god he has wondered at the bold constancy which he has found in her when his own heart was faint 6  1 works vi 514 2 ib iii 338 3 ib iii 352 353 4 works iii 350 5 ib iii 390 391 6 works iii  142  now perhaps in order to stop scandalous mouths perhaps out of a desire to bind the muchloved evangelist nearer to her in the only manner possible mrs bowes conceived the scheme of marrying him to her fifth daughter marjorie and the reformer seems to have fallen in with it readily enough  it seems to have been believed in the family that the whole matter had been originally made up between these two with no very spontaneous inclination on the part of the bride 1 knoxs idea of marriage as i have said was not the same for all men but on the whole it was not lofty  we have a curious letter of his written at the request of queen mary to the earl of argyle on very delicate household matters which as he tells us was not well accepted of the said earl 2  we may suppose however that his own home was regulated in a similar spirit  i can fancy that for such a man emotional and with a need now and again to exercise parsimony in emotions not strictly needful something a little mechanical something hard and fast and clearly understood would enter into his ideal of a home  there were storms enough without and equability was to be desired at the fireside even at a sacrifice of deeper pleasures  so from a wife of all women he would not ask much  one letter to her which has come down to us is i had almost said conspicuous for coldness 3  he calls her as he called other female correspondents dearly beloved sister the epistle is doctrinal and nearly the half of it bears not upon her own case but upon that of her mother  however we know what heine wrote in his wifes album and there is after all one passage that may be held to intimate some tenderness although even that admits of an amusingly opposite construction  i think he says i think this be the first letter i ever wrote to you  this if we are to take it literally may pair off with the two or three children whom montaigne mentions having lost at nurse the one is as eccentric in a lover as the other in a parent nevertheless he displayed more energy in the course of his troubled wooing than might have been expected  the whole bowes family angry enough already at the influence he had obtained over the mother set their faces obdurately against the match  and i daresay the opposition quickened his inclination  i find him writing to mrs bowes that she need no further trouble herself about the marriage it should now be his business altogether it behoved him now to jeopard his life for the comfort of his own flesh both fear and friendship of all earthly creature laid aside 4  this is a wonderfully chivalrous utterance for a reformer fortyeight years old and it compares well with the leaden coquetries of calvin not much over thirty taking this and that into consideration weighing together dowries and religious qualifications and the instancy of friends and exhibiting what m bungener calls an honourable and christian difficulty of choice in frigid indecisions and insincere proposals  but knoxs next letter is in a humbler tone he has not found the negotiation so easy as he fancied he despairs of the marriage altogether and talks of leaving england  regards not what country consumes his wicked carcass  you shall understand he says that this sixth of november i spoke with sir robert bowes the head of the family his brides uncle in the matter you know according to your request whose disdainful yea despiteful words hath so pierced my heart that my life is bitter to me  i bear a good countenance with a sore troubled heart because he that ought to consider matters with a deep judgment is become not only a despiser but also a taunter of gods messengers  god be merciful unto him  amongst others his most unpleasing words while that i was about to have declared my heart in the whole matter he said away with your rhetorical reasons for i will not be persuaded with them  god knows i did use no rhetoric nor coloured speech but would have spoken the truth and that in most simple manner  i am not a good orator in my own cause but what he would not be content to hear of me god shall declare to him one day to his displeasure unless he repent 5  poor knox you see is quite commoved  it has been a very unpleasant interview  and as it is the only sample that we have of how things went with him during his courtship we may infer that the period was not as agreeable for knox as it has been for some others  1 ib iii 378 2 lb ii 379 3 works iii 394 4 works iii 376 5 works iii 378  however when once they were married i imagine he and marjorie bowes hit it off together comfortably enough  the little we know of it may be brought together in a very short space  she bore him two sons  he seems to have kept her pretty busy and depended on her to some degree in his work so that when she fell ill his papers got at once into disorder 1  certainly she sometimes wrote to his dictation and in this capacity he calls her his left hand 2  in june 1559 at the headiest moment of the reformation in scotland he writes regretting the absence of his helpful colleague goodman whose presence this is the not very grammatical form of his lament whose presence i more thirst than she that is my own flesh 3  and this considering the source and the circumstances may be held as evidence of a very tender sentiment  he tells us himself in his history on the occasion of a certain meeting at the kirk of field that he was in no small heaviness by reason of the late death of his dear bedfellow marjorie bowes 4 calvin condoling with him speaks of her as a wife whose like is not to be found everywhere that is very like calvin and again as the most delightful of wives  we know what calvin thought desirable in a wife good humour chastity thrift patience and solicitude for her husbands health and so we may suppose that the first mrs knox fell not far short of this ideal  1 works vi 104 2 ib v 5 3 ib vi 27 4 ib ii 138  the actual date of the marriage is uncertain but by september 1566 at the latest the reformer was settled in geneva with his wife  there is no fear either that he will be dull even if the chaste thrifty patient marjorie should not altogether occupy his mind he need not go out of the house to seek more female sympathy for behold  mrs bowes is duly domesticated with the young couple  dr mcrie imagined that richard bowes was now dead and his widow consequently free to live where she would and where could she go more naturally than to the house of a married daughter  this however is not the case  richard bowes did not die till at least two years later  it is impossible to believe that he approved of his wifes desertion after so many years of marriage after twelve children had been born to them and accordingly we find in his will dated 1558 no mention either of her or of knoxs wife 1  this is plain sailing it is easy enough to understand the anger of bowes against this interloper who had come into a quiet family married the daughter in spite of the fathers opposition alienated the wife from the husband and the husbands religion supported her in a long course of resistance and rebellion and after years of intimacy already too close and tender for any jealous spirit to behold without resentment carried her away with him at last into a foreign land  but it is not quite easy to understand how except out of sheer weariness and disgust he was ever brought to agree to the arrangement nor is it easy to square the reformers conduct with his public teaching  we have for instance a letter by him craig and spottiswood to the archbishops of canterbury and york anent a wicked and rebellious woman one anne good spouse to john barron a minister of christ jesus his evangel who after great rebellion shown unto him and divers admonitions given as well by himself as by others in his name that she should in no wise depart from this realm nor from his house without his license hath not the less stubbornly and rebelliously departed separated herself from his society left his house and withdrawn herself from this realm 2  perhaps some sort of license was extorted as i have said from richard bowes weary with years of domestic dissension but setting that aside the words employed with so much righteous indignation by knox craig and spottiswood to describe the conduct of that wicked and rebellious woman mrs barron would describe nearly as exactly the conduct of the religious mrs bowes  it is a little bewildering until we recollect the distinction between faithful and unfaithful husbands for barron was a minister of christ jesus his evangel while richard bowes besides being own brother to a despiser and taunter of gods messengers is shrewdly suspected to have been a bigoted adherent of the roman catholic faith or as know himself would have expressed it a rotten papist  1 mr laings preface to the sixth volume of knoxs works p lxii 2 works vi 534  you would have thought that know was now pretty well supplied with female society  but we are not yet at the end of the roll  the last year of his sojourn in england had been spent principally in london where he was resident as one of the chaplains of edward the sixth and here he boasts although a stranger he had by gods grace found favour before many 1  the godly women of the metropolis made much of him once he writes to mrs bowes that her last letter had found him closeted with three and he and the three women were all in tears 2  out of all however he had chosen two god he writes to them brought us in such familiar acquaintance that your hearts were incensed and kindled with a special care over me as a mother useth to be over her natural child and my heart was opened and compelled in your presence to be more plain than ever i was to any 3  and out of the two even he had chosen one mrs anne locke wife to mr harry locke merchant nigh to bow kirk cheapside in london as the address runs  if one may venture to judge upon such imperfect evidence this was the woman he loved best  i have a difficulty in quite forming to myself an idea of her character  she may have been one of the three tearful visitors before alluded to she may even have been that one of them who was so profoundly moved by some passages of mrs bowess letter which the reformer opened and read aloud to them before they went  o would to god cried this impressionable matron would to god that i might speak with that person for i perceive there are more tempted than i 4  this may have been mrs locke as i say but even if it were we must not conclude from this one fact that she was such another as mrs bowes  all the evidence tends the other way  she was a woman of understanding plainly who followed political events with interest and to whom knox thought it worth while to write in detail the history of his trials and successes  she was religious but without that morbid perversity of spirit that made religion so heavy a burden for the poorhearted mrs bowes  more of her i do not find save testimony to the profound affection that united her to the reformer  so we find him writing to her from geneva in such terms as these you write that your desire is earnest to see me  dear sister if i should express the thirst and languor which i have had for your presence i should appear to pass measure   yea i weep and rejoice in remembrance of you but that would evanish by the comfort of your presence which i assure you is so dear to me that if the charge of this little flock here gathered together in christs name did not impede me my coming should prevent my letter 5  i say that this was written from geneva and yet you will observe that it is no consideration for his wife or motherinlaw only the charge of his little flock that keeps him from setting out forthwith for london to comfort himself with the dear presence of mrs locke  remember that was a certain plausible enough pretext for mrs locke to come to geneva  the most perfect school of christ that ever was on earth since the days of the apostles  for we are now under the reign of that horrible monster jezebel of england when a lady of good orthodox sentiments was better out of london  it was doubtful however whether this was to be  she was detained in england partly by circumstances unknown partly by empire of her head mr harry locke the cheapside merchant  it is somewhat humorous to see knox struggling for resignation now that he has to do with a faithful husband for mr harry locke was faithful  had it been otherwise in my heart he says i could have wished  yea here he breaks out yea and cannot cease to wish  that god would guide you to this place 6  and after all he had not long to wait for whether mr harry locke died in the interval or was wearied he too into giving permission five months after the date of the letter last quoted mrs anne locke harry her son and anne her daughter and katherine her maid arrived in that perfect school of christ the presbyterian paradise geneva  so now and for the next two years the cup of knoxs happiness was surely full  of an afternoon when the bells rang out for the sermon the shops closed and the good folk gathered to the churches psalmbook in hand we can imagine him drawing near to the english chapel in quite patriarchal fashion with mrs knox and mrs bowes and mrs locke james his servant patrick his pupil and a due following of children and maids he might be alone at work all morning in his study for he wrote much during these two years but at night you may be sure there was a circle of admiring women eager to hear the new paragraph and not sparing of applause  and what work among others was he elaborating at this time but the notorious first blast  so that he may have rolled out in his big pulpit voice how women were weak frail impatient feeble foolish inconstant variable cruel and lacking the spirit of counsel and how men were above them even as god is above the angels in the ears of his own wife and the two dearest friends he had on earth  but he had lost the sense of incongruity and continued to despise in theory the sex he honoured so much in practice of whom he chose his most intimate associates and whose courage he was compelled to wonder at when his own heart was faint  1 works iv 220 2 ib iii 380 3 ib iv 220 4 works iii 380 5 works iv 238 6 works iv 240  we may say that such a man was not worthy of his fortune and so as he would not learn he was taken away from that agreeable school and his fellowship of women was broken up not to be reunited  called into scotland to take at last that strange position in history which is his best claim to commemoration he was followed thither by his wife and his motherinlaw  the wife soon died  the death of her daughter did not altogether separate mrs bowes from knox but she seems to have come and gone between his house and england  in 1562 however we find him characterised as a sole man by reason of the absence of his motherinlaw mrs bowes and a passport is got for her her man a maid and three horses whereof two shall return as well as liberty to take all her own money with her into scotland  this looks like a definite arrangement but whether she died at edinburgh or went back to england yet again i cannot find  with that great family of hers unless in leaving her husband she had quarrelled with them all there must have been frequent occasion for her presence one would think  knox at least survived her and we possess his epigraph to their long intimacy given to the world by him in an appendix to his latest publication  i have said in a former paper that knox was not shy of personal revelations in his published works and the trick seems to have grown on him  to this last tract a controversial onslaught on a scottish jesuit he prefixed a prayer not very pertinent to the matter in hand and containing references to his family which were the occasion of some wit in his adversarys answer and appended what seems equally irrelevant one of his devout letters to mrs bowes with an explanatory preface  to say truth i believe he had always felt uneasily that the circumstances of this intimacy were very capable of misconstruction and now when he was an old man taking his good night of all the faithful in both realms and only desirous that without any notable sclander to the evangel of jesus christ he might end his battle for as the world was weary of him so was he of it  in such a spirit it was not perhaps unnatural that he should return to this old story and seek to put it right in the eyes of all men ere he died  because that god he says because that god now in his mercy hath put an end to the battle of my dear mother mistress elizabeth bowes before that he put an end to my wretched life i could not cease but declare to the world what was the cause of our great familiarity and long acquaintance which was neither flesh nor blood but a troubled conscience upon her part which never suffered her to rest but when she was in the company of the faithful of whom from the first hearing of the word at my mouth she judged me to be one    her company to me was comfortable yea honourable and profitable for she was to me and mine a mother but yet it was not without some cross for besides trouble and fashery of body sustained for her my mind was seldom quiet for doing somewhat for the comfort of her troubled conscience 1  he had written to her years before from his first exile in dieppe that only gods hand could withhold him from once more speaking with her face to face and now when gods hand has indeed interposed when there lies between them instead of the voyageable straits that great gulf over which no man can pass this is the spirit in which he can look back upon their long acquaintance  she was a religious hypochondriac it appears whom not without some cross and fashery of mind and body he was good enough to tend  he might have given a truer character of their friendship had he thought less of his own standing in public estimation and more of the dead woman  but he was in all things as burke said of his son in that ever memorable passage a public creature  he wished that even into this private place of his affections posterity should follow him with a complete approval and he was willing in order that this might be so to exhibit the defects of his lost friend and tell the world what weariness he had sustained through her unhappy disposition  there is something here that reminds one of rousseau  1 works vi 513 514  i do not think he ever saw mrs locke after he left geneva but his correspondence with her continued for three years it may have continued longer of course but i think the last letters we possess read like the last that would be written perhaps mrs locke was then remarried for there is much obscurity over her subsequent history  for as long as their intimacy was kept up at least the human element remains in the reformers life  here is one passage for example the most likable utterance of knoxs that i can quote mrs locke has been upbraiding him as a bad correspondent  my remembrance of you he answers is not so dead but i trust it shall be fresh enough albeit it be renewed by no outward token for one year  of nature i am churlish yet one thing i ashame not to affirm that familiarity once thoroughly contracted was never yet broken on my default  the cause may be that i have rather need of all than that any have need of me  however it that be it cannot be as i say the corporal absence of one year or two that can quench in my heart that familiar acquaintance in christ jesus which half a year did engender and almost two years did nourish and confirm  and therefore whether i write or no be assuredly persuaded that i have you in such memory as becometh the faithful to have of the faithful 1  this is the truest touch of personal humility that i can remember to have seen in all the five volumes of the reformers collected works it is no small honour to mrs locke that his affection for her should have brought home to him this unwonted feeling of dependence upon others  everything else in the course of the correspondence testifies to a good sound downright sort of friendship between the two less ecstatic than it was at first perhaps but serviceable and very equal  he gives her ample details is to the progress of the work of reformation sends her the sheets of the confession of faith in quairs as he calls it asks her to assist him with her prayers to collect money for the good cause in scotland and to send him books for himself  books by calvin especially one on isaiah and a new revised edition of the institutes  i must be bold on your liberality he writes not only in that but in greater things as i shall need 2  on her part she applies to him for spiritual advice not after the manner of the drooping mrs bowes but in a more positive spirit  advice as to practical points advice as to the church of england for instance whose ritual he condemns as a minglemangle 3  just at the end she ceases to write sends him a token without writing  i understand your impediment he answers and therefore i cannot complain yet if you understood the variety of my temptations i doubt not but you would have written somewhat 4  one letter more and then silence  1 works vi ii 2 works vi pp 21 101 108 130 3 ib vi 83 4 ib vi 129  and i think the best of the reformer died out with that correspondence  it is after this of course that he wrote that ungenerous description of his intercourse with mrs bowes  it is after this also that we come to the unlovely episode of his second marriage  he had been left a widower at the age of fiftyfive  three years after it occurred apparently to yet another pious parent to sacrifice a child upon the altar of his respect for the reformer  in january 1563 randolph writes to cecil your honour will take it for a great wonder when i shall write unto you that mr knox shall marry a very near kinswoman of the dukes a lords daughter a young lass not above sixteen years of age 1 he adds that he fears he will be laughed at for reporting so mad a story  and yet it was true and on palm sunday 1564 margaret stewart daughter of andrew lord stewart of ochiltree aged seventeen was duly united to john knox minister of st giless kirk edinburgh aged fiftynine  to the great disgust of queen mary from family pride and i would fain hope of many others for more humane considerations  in this as randolph says i wish he had done otherwise  the consistory of geneva that most perfect school of christ that ever was on earth since the days of the apostles were wont to forbid marriages on the ground of too great a disproportion in age  i cannot help wondering whether the old reformers conscience did not uneasily remind him now and again of this good custom of his religious metropolis as he thought of the twoandforty years that separated him from his poor bride  fitly enough we hear nothing of the second mrs knox until she appears at her husbands deathbed eight years after  she bore him three daughters in the interval and i suppose the poor childs martyrdom was made as easy for her as might be  she was extremely attentive to him at the end we read and he seems to have spoken to her with some confidence  moreover and this is very characteristic he had copied out for her use a little volume of his own devotional letters to other women  1 works vi 532  this is the end of the roll unless we add to it mrs adamson who had delighted much in his company by reason that she had a troubled conscience and whose deathbed is commemorated at some length in the pages of his history 1  1 works i 246  and now looking back it cannot be said that knoxs intercourse with women was quite of the highest sort  it is characteristic that we find him more alarmed for his own reputation than for the reputation of the women with whom he was familiar  there was a fatal preponderance of self in all his intimacies many women came to learn from him but he never condescended to become a learner in his turn  and so there is not anything idyllic in these intimacies of his and they were never so renovating to his spirit as they might have been  but i believe they were good enough for the women  i fancy the women knew what they were about when so many of them followed after knox  it is not simply because a man is always fully persuaded that he knows the right from the wrong and sees his way plainly through the maze of life great qualities as these are that people will love and follow him and write him letters full of their earnest desire for him when he is absent  it is not over a man whose one characteristic is grim fixity of purpose that the hearts of women are incensed and kindled with a special care as it were over their natural children  in the strong quiet patience of all his letters to the weariful mrs bowes we may perhaps see one cause of the fascination he possessed for these religious women  here was one whom you could besiege all the year round with inconsistent scruples and complaints you might write to him on thursday that you were so elated it was plain the devil was deceiving you and again on friday that you were so depressed it was plain god had cast you off for ever and he would read all this patiently and sympathetically and give you an answer in the most reassuring polysyllables and all divided into heads  who knows  like a treatise on divinity  and then those easy tears of his  there are some women who like to see men crying and here was this greatvoiced bearded man of god who might be seen beating the solid pulpit every sunday and casting abroad his clamorous denunciations to the terror of all and who on the monday would sit in their parlours by the hour and weep with them over their manifold trials and temptations  nowadays he would have to drink a dish of tea with all these penitents    it sounds a little vulgar as the past will do if we look into it too closely  we could not let these great folk of old into our drawingrooms queen elizabeth would positively not be eligible for a housemaid  the old manners and the old customs go sinking from grade to grade until if some mighty emperor revisited the glimpses of the moon he would not find any one of his way of thinking any one he could strike hands with and talk to freely and without offence save perhaps the porter at the end of the street or the fellow with his elbows out who loafs all day before the publichouse  so that this little note of vulgarity is not a thing to be dwelt upon it is to be put away from us as we recall the fashion of these old intimacies so that we may only remember knox as one who was very longsuffering with women kind to them in his own way loving them in his own way  and that not the worst way if it was not the best  and once at least if not twice moved to his heart of hearts by a woman and giving expression to the yearning he had for her society in words that none of us need be ashamed to borrow  and let us bear in mind always that the period i have gone over in this essay begins when the reformer was already beyond the middle age and already broken in bodily health it has been the story of an old mans friendships  this it is that makes knox enviable  unknown until past forty he had then before him fiveandthirty years of splendid and influential life passed through uncommon hardships to an uncommon degree of power lived in his own country as a sort of king and did what he would with the sound of his voice out of the pulpit  and besides all this such a following of faithful women  one would take the first forty years gladly if one could be sure of the last thirty  most of us even if by reason of great strength and the dignity of gray hairs we retain some degree of public respect in the latter days of our existence will find a falling away of friends and a solitude making itself round about us day by day until we are left alone with the hired sicknurse  for the attraction of a mans character is apt to be outlived like the attraction of his body and the power to love grows feeble in its turn as well as the power to inspire love in others  it is only with a few rare natures that friendship is added to friendship love to love and the man keeps growing richer in affection  richer i mean as a bank may be said to grow richer both giving and receiving more  after his head is white and his back weary and he prepares to go down into the dust of death
