m winfield edward stratemeyer  author of the rover boys at school the rover boys on the ocean the putnam hall series etc  illustrated     introduction   my dear boys this volume the rover boys on the great lakes is a complete story in itself but forms the fifth volume of the rover boys series for young americans  when first i started this series with the rover boys at school i had no idea of extending the line beyond three or four volumes but the second book the rover boys on the ocean immediately called for a third the rover boys in the jungle and this finished many boys wanted to know what would happen next and so i must needs give them the rover boys out west still they were not satisfied hence the volume now in your hands  so far we have followed the doings of dick tom and sam at dear old putnam hall with many larks and sports then out upon the broad atlantic in a daring chase which came pretty close to ending in sad disaster next into the interior of africa on a quest of grave importance and lastly out into the mountainous regions of the wild west to locate a mining claim belonging to mr anderson rover  in the present tale the scene is shifted to the great lakes the three boys go on a pleasure tour and while on lake erie fall in with an old enemy who concocts a scheme for kidnapping dick who had fallen overboard from his yacht in a storm this scheme leads to many adventures the outcome of which will be found in the pages that follow  in placing this volume in my young readers hands i can but repeat what i have said before that i am extremely grateful to all for the kind reception given the other rover boys stories i sincerely trust the present tale meets with equal commendation  affectionately and sincerely yours  edward stratemeyer  april 12 1901

dick do you notice how the wind is freshening  yes sam ive been watching it for ten minutes i think we are in for a storm  exactly my idea and i shouldnt be surprised if it proved a heavy one too how far are we from shore  not over three miles to my reckoning  perhaps we had better turn back and sam rover the youngest of the three rover brothers shook his head doubtfully  oh i reckon well be safe enough responded dick rover who was several years older i know more about sailing a yacht than i did when we followed up the baxters on the atlantic ocean  the poor baxters put in tom rover who stood close by also watching the wind and the heavy clouds rolling up from the westward who ever supposed that they would be buried alive in that landslide on the mountain in colorado  it was a terrible fate came with a shudder from dick rover but nevertheless i am glad we are rid of those rascals they caused father and us trouble enough goodness knows  and they brought trouble enough to dora stanhope and her mother too observed sam by the way dick werent dora and her mother going to take a trip on these lakes this summer  of course dora was put in tom with a sly wink if she wasnt what do you suppose would bring dick here he got a letter only last week  oh stow it tom cried the elder rover his face growing red you wanted to take a trip on the great lakes as much as anybodysaid you wouldnt like anything better and told all the fellows at putnam hall so too  well i dont know as i would like anything better rattled on tom the swallow seems to be a firstclass craft and ive no doubt but what well see lots to interest us in this trip from buffalo to lake superior  when are the stanhopes coming out asked sam  i cant say exactly replied dick i expect another letter from them when we reach cleveland in the last letter dora said her mother was not feeling as well as before  a trip on the lakes ought to do her good  wonder if old josiah crabtree has been bothering her with his attentions came from tom gosh how anxious he was to marry her and get hold of the money she is holding in trust for dora  crabtrees term of imprisonment ran out only last week tom he couldnt annoy her while he was in jail  he ought to have been given five years for the way he used them and us its strange what an influence he had over mrs stanhope  hes something of a hypnotist and she seems to be just the right kind of a subject for him his coming from prison is one reason why dora wanted to get her mother away she isnt going to let outsiders know of the trip so old crabtree wont know where they are  hell find out if he can remarked sam he always was a nosy old chap  if he tries any game on ill settle him in short order came from dick with determination weve put up with enough from him in the past and i dont intend to give him any leeway in the future  leeway burst out tom not a foot not an inch i havent forgotten how he treated me when he was a teacher at putnam hall i wonder that captain putnam didnt kick him out long before he was made to go  a sudden rush of wind cut the conversation short at this point sending the swallow bowling along merrily the clouds were increasing rapidly and dick ordered that all the sails be closely reefed  we dont want to lose our mast he observed  we dont want to lose anything answered sam for my part i wish we were back in buffalo harbor  oh well run along all right came from tom dont get scared before you are hurt he looked at his watch halfpast five i didnt think it was so late  it will be dark before long said dick perhaps the blow will go down with the setting of the sun  well never know when the sun setsexcepting by the almanac murmured sam its as black as ink already over to the westward  to keep up his courage tom rover began to whistle but soon the sound was drowned out by the high piping of the wind as it tore over the deck and through the rigging of the swallow they were certainly in for a storm and a heavy one at that  it was the middle of july and the rover boys had journeyed from valley brook their country home to buffalo a week before for a sixweeks outing upon the great lakes previous to their returning to putnam hall for the fall and winter term their thrilling adventures in colorado as told in the rover boys out west had taxed them severely and their father mr anderson rover felt that they needed the recreation at first he had wished them to remain at the farm and so had their uncle randolph rover and their motherly aunt martha but this had been voted too slow by the three brothers and it was decided that they should go to buffalo charter a small yacht and do as they pleased until the opening of school  only please keep out of danger had been mr rovers pleading words you have been in peril enough and the boys had promised to do their best little dreaming of the many adventures and dangers ahead  the boys knew very little about the lakes and at the last moment had invited larry colby an old schoolmate to accompany them on the outing larry had spent two summers on lake huron and lake superior and knew both bodies of water fairly well but the lad could not come on at once and so had sent word that he would join the party at sandusky some time later larrys father was rich so the expense of traveling counted for nothing  with the boys however went one individual with whom all our old readers are well acquainted this was alexander pop the colored man who had once been a waiter at putnam hall and who was now a servant to the rovers in general and the three boys in particular the boys had done much in the past for aleck as they called him and pop was so greatly attached to the youths that he was ready at all times to do anything they desired  i dun lub dem rober boys aint no ust ter talk pop would say dem is de most uptodate boys in de world dats wot and da did dis yeah niggah a good turn wot he aint forgittin in a hurry too what that good turn was has already been related in full in the rover boys in the jungle pop was now installed on board the swallow as cook and general helper a position he was well fitted to fill  the boys had laid out a grand trip and one which certainly promised a good deal of pleasure the first stop was to be at cleveland and from that city they were to go to sandusky and then up the lake and through the detroit river to detroit here a short stay was to be made and then the journey was to be resumed through lake st clair and the st clair river to lake huron once on lake huron they expected to skirt the eastern coast of michigan stopping whenever they pleased and thus gradually make their way to whitefish bay and lake superior what they would do when lake superior was reached would depend upon how much time was left for the outing  the swallow was a wellbuilt sturdy craft fifty feet long and correspondingly broad of beam she had been constructed for a pleasure boat and had all of the latest improvements she belonged to a rich man of buffalo who had known the rovers for years the rich man was now traveling in europe and had been only too glad to charter the yacht for a period of six weeks when the rover boys were through with her she was to be placed in charge of the rich mans boatman who was to take her back to buffalo  the start on lake erie had been full of pleasure the yacht had a good supply of provisions on board and everybody was in the best of spirits aleck pop had brought along his banjo and on the first evening out had given them half a dozen plantation songs for he was a good singer as well as player on the day following the breeze had died away and they had all gone fishing with fair success this was the third day out and since noon the wind had been blowing at a lively rate helping them to make good time on their course toward cleveland now the wind was blowing little short of a gale and the sky was growing blacker each instant  we are in for it beyond a doubt said dick with a serious shake of his head  every inch of canvas had been taken in yet the swallow spun along before the wind rapidly ever and anon dipping her bow deeply into the whitecaps which now showed themselves upon all sides  here she comes burst out tom suddenly hold hard everybody  and then the storm burst upon them in all of its furya storm which lasted all night and one which the rover boys never forgot     chapter ii  the disappearance of dick   oh my but this is a corker  it was tom who uttered the words half an hour after he had cautioned everybody to hold fast he was standing at the wheel helping dick to make the swallow keep her bow up to the waves which rolled fiercely on every side of the craft he cried out at the top of his lungs yet his elder brother understood him with difficulty  i wish we were out of it returned dick did sam go below as i ordered  yes  what of aleck  he is in the galley trying to keep his dishes from being smashed to bits he is scared i can tell you and said he was sure we were going to the bottom  if i was sure of the course i would steer for shore tom im afraid myself that this is going to be more than we bargained for  pooh dick weve been in as bad a storm before and you know it  but not on lake erie this lake has a reputation for turning out some nasty ones that do tremendous damage light up will youor we may be smashing into some other boat before we know it  i will if you can hold the wheel alone  i can get along for a few minutes but its enough to pull a fellows arms out by the sockets concluded dick  with extreme caution for the deck was as wet and slippery as it was unsteady tom made his way to the tiny cabin of the yacht here he found sam lighting the ships lanterns four in number  i thought youd be wanting them said the youngest rover is it letting up do you think  no if anything it is growing worse  dont you want me to help on deck i hate to stay down here alone  you can do nothing sam dick and i are tending the wheel and there is nothing else to be done  i might go on the lookout you cant watch very well from the stern added the youngest rover who did not relish being kept back by his older brothers  we can watch good enough stay hereits safer if the yacht should swing aroundgreat scott  tom rover broke off short and with good reason a strange creaking and cracking sound had reached his ears followed by a bump and a jar which nearly pitched him headlong sam was thrown down on his back  something is wrong burst out sam as soon as he could speak we must have struck something  tom did not answer for the reason that he was already on his way to the deck with a lantern slung in the crook of his right elbow sam followed with another lantern leaving the remaining ones wildly swinging on the hooks in the cabins ceiling  help help  the cry came from out of the darkness somewhere in the wake of the swallow a cry cut partly short by the piping gale with his heart thumping violently tom leaped over the deck toward the wheel  dick what is the matter  help repeated the voice but now further off than ever then tom made a discovery which thrilled him with horror  the position at the wheel was vacant dick was gone  dick dick where are you he shouted hoarsely dick  help came more faintly the cry was repeated several times but nothing more reached toms ears nor the hearing of his younger brother who was now beside him his round face as pale as death itself  dicks overboard the words came from both and each looked at the other in consternation  both held up their lanterns the glasses of which were speedily covered with flying spray the lanterns made a small semicircle of light at the stern but dick was beyond that circle and could not be seen  take the wheelill get a lifepreserver said tom and ran for the article he had mentioned  shall i try to turn the yacht around questioned his brother as he after several unsuccessful attempts caught the spokes of the wheel which was flying back and forth with every pitch of the craft  no no we will be swamped if you do that keep her up to the wind  regardless of the danger tom flew across the deck to where there was a lifepreserver attached to a hundred feet of small but strong rope once at the stern again he threw the lifepreserver as far out as possible  catch the lifeline he shrieked but if dick heard he gave no answer  cant we fire a rocket said sam we ought to do something he added half desperately  lashing the end of the lifeline to the stern tom ran down into the cabin and brought forth several rockets with trembling hands he set off first one and then another the blaze was a short one yet it revealed to them a large mass of lumber rising and falling on the bosom of the turbulent waters  a lumber raft it is going to pieces in the storm  did you see dick  i saw two persons on the lumber but i dont know who they were they looked more dead than alive  oh i hope dick isnt dead burst out sam and the tears stood in his eyes as he spoke  wots dat you dun said came from out of the darkness  dicks overboard answered tom  no a groan of genuine regret came from aleck pop how it dun happen  we must have struck a lumber raft and the shock knocked him over answered sam oh tom what shall we do  ill try another rocket sami dont know of anything else  it took fully a minute to obtain another rocket and some red fire as well the red fire made quite an illumination in spite of the storm  i dont see nuffin said pop  nor i added tom the raft has disappeared  as the light died out all set up a loud shout but only the howling wind answered them and now sam noticed that the lifeline was drifting idly at the stern and there was nothing to do but to haul it in again  the hours which followed were full of agony to tom and sam and the warmhearted colored man was scarcely less affected  what if dick is drowned whispered the youngest rover father will never forgive us for coming on this trip  let us hope for the best was his brothers answer dick has been in a tight fix before hell come out all right if he has any show at all  nobuddy kin lib in sech a storm as dis put in pop why its most as bad as dat dar hurricane we perienced in africa jest see how its beginnin to rain  pop was right so far the rain had held off for the most part but now it came down steadily and soon turned into little short of a deluge all were speedily soaked to the skin but this was a discomfort to which under the circumstances no one paid attention  the swallow heaved and pitched and fearful that sam would be lost overboard tom told him he had better go below again  you can do nothing up here he said if anything turns up ill call you  but you must be careful pleaded sam if i were you id tie myself to the wheel and this is what tom did  slowly the night wore away and with the coming of morning the storm abated somewhat although the waves still lashed angrily around the swallow with the first streak of dawn all were on deck watching anxiously for some sign of the lumber raft or of dick  nothing in sight groaned sam and he was right the raft had disappeared completely and all around them was a dreary waste of water with a cloudy sky overhead  feeling that he must do something aleck pop prepared a breakfast of broiled fish and hot coffee but when summoned to the repast both of the rovers shook their heads  i couldnt eat a mouthful sighed sam it would choke me  we must find dick first aleck said tom go ahead yourself and have breakfast dont mind us  deed i aint no hungrier dan youse is replied the colored man soberly but youse had bettah drink sum ob dat coffee or youse might cotch a chill and he made each sip some of the beverage bringing it on deck for that purpose  at halfpast seven tom espied a cloud of smoke on the horizon i think its a lake steamer he said to his brother and he proved to be right it was a freighter known as the captain rallow running between detroit and buffalo soon the steamer came closer and they hailed her  seen anything of a lumber wreck with some men on it questioned tom eagerly  havent seen any wreck was the answer from the captain of the freighter whose raft was it  i dont know the raft hit us in the darkness and a young man on our yacht was knocked overboard we lit some red fire and saw two people on the raft which seemed to be going to pieces  this news interested the owner of the freight steamer greatly since he had a brother who was in the business of rafting lumber and he asked tom to give him the particulars of the affair  we cant give you any particulars we were taken completely by surprise and it was too dark to see much said tom nevertheless he and sam told what they could to which the freight captain listened with close attention  ill keep my eye open for the raft said the latter and if i see anything of your brother ill certainly take him on board  where are you bound  i am going to stop at cleveland first then i go straight through to buffalo  a few words more passed and then the captain of the freight steamer gave the signal to go ahead  the stopping of her engines had caused the steamer to drift quite close to the swallow and as she swung around those on the yacht caught a good view of the freighters stern deck  there were a small number of passengers on board and as sam looked them over he gave a sudden start  my gracious can it be possible he gasped  can what be possible sam queried tom  look look  at what  at the passengers on the steamer am i dreaming or is thathe is gone and sams face fell  who are you talking about  arnold baxter he was on the steamer just as sure as i stand here and we both thought him dead     chapter iii  on a lumber raft   you think you saw arnold baxter demanded tom  yes i saw arnold baxter just as plain as day  sam you must be  no i am not dreaming it was arnold baxter true enough as soon as he saw i had spotted him he drew out of sight  but we thought he was deadburied under that landslide out in colorado  we didnt find his body and he isnt dead why i would never make a mistake in that rascals face never and sam shook his head to emphasize his words  was dan with him  i didnt see the son  if it was really arnold baxter we ought to let the authorities know at once so that they can arrest him for getting out of prison on that bogus pardon  yes and we ought to let father know too for you may be sure baxter will do all he can to get square with us for keeping the eclipse mining claim out of his grasp  he cant do anything about that claim now our claim is established by law and he is nothing but an escaped jailbird but i agree he may give us lots of trouble in other directions i presume he would like to see us all hung for the way we got ahead of him and his tools  if the steamer wasnt so far off we might hail her continued sam but this was now out of the question  both lads were very much disturbed and with good reason arnold baxter had been an enemy to mr rover for years and this meant a good deal when the desperate character of the man was taken into consideration he was a welleducated fellow but cruel and unprincipled to the last degree and one who would hesitate at nothing in order to accomplish his purpose  dats de wust yet was aleck pops comment i was finkin dat rascal was plumb dead suah and dan too suah yo didnt see dat goodfonuffin boy  no i didnt see dan  he must have been with his father when the landslide occurred went on tom and if one escaped more than likely the other did too my how i despise that chap and have ever since we had our first row with him at putnam hall  i wonder what brought arnold baxter back to this section of the country i shouldnt think he would dare to come back  he always was daring to the last degree in some matters just as he is cowardly in others i would give something to know if dan is with him  we might follow up the steamer if it wasnt for poor dick  the boys talked the matter over for some time and while doing this the sails of the swallow were again hoisted and they turned the yacht back to the vicinity where dick had gone overboard  and while tom and sam are looking for their elder brother let us turn back and learn what really did become of dick  he was waiting for tom to come on deck with the lanterns when of a sudden something black and threatening loomed up out of the darkness to the starboard of the swallow  the mass was the better half of a monstrous lumber raft which was rapidly going to pieces in the storm  the raft or rather what was left of it hit the swallow a glancing blow otherwise the sailing craft must have been stove in and sunk  the shock caught dick with one hand off the wheel and before he could catch hold again the youth found himself flung heels into the air and over the swallows stern  down and down he went into the lake waters until he thought he would never come up  the turn of affairs bewildered him and he did not come fully to his senses until his head struck one of the timbers of the raft  he clutched the timber as a drowning man clutches the proverbial straw and tried to draw himself to the surface of the lake only to discover to his horror that there were timbers to both sides of him cutting off his further progress upward  must i be drowned like a rat in a trap was the agonizing thought which rushed through his brain and then he pushed along from one timber to another until the last was reached and he came up almost overcome and panting heavily for breath  help help he cried feebly and presently heard his brothers answer him then the lifeline was thrown but it fell short and did him no good by the red fire and the rockets he saw the position of the swallow and saw his brothers but was too weak to even signal to sam and tom  it was with an effort that he at last drew himself to the top of some of the lumber this movement came none too soon for a moment later one of the outside chains of the raft broke and fully a third of what was left of the lumber was scattered in all directions  hullo bragin is that you  the cry came from out of the darkness and from the other end of the top lumber  are you calling to me replied dick in as loud a voice as he could muster  is that you bragin repeated the voice  i am not bragin answered dick where are you  here and the unknown repeated the cry until dick located and joined him he was a burly lumberman of forty with a heavy black beard and an equally heavy voice he gazed at the youth in astonishment  hullo where did you come from he demanded  from the yacht this lumber raft just struck  did the shock knock ye overboard  it did  humph i thought ye was bragin  i came pretty close to being drowned for i came up under the lumber  well we aint out o the woods yet young man didnt see nuthin o bragin did ye  ive seen nobody but you  then he must be down to the lake bottom by this time  he was on the raft with you  yes he and i left the tug to see to the chains when the storm came up  where is the tug  the raft broke away from her at the fust blow a fool of a greenhorn was amanagin of the thing an this is the result come hereits safer  dick was perfectly willing to crawl closer to the burly lumberman who was a good fellow as could be seen by a glance  well be all right if this section o the lumber keeps together went on the lumberman there are four chains here so it ought to hold  once safe for the time being dick began to wonder about the fate of the swallow  did the yacht go down he asked anxiously  i reckon not young man they burned red fire you know they wouldnt do that if there was much trouble aboard  that is true dick was silent for a moment i wish i could get back to her  be thankful that ye aint at the bottom o the lake if we kin outride this storm well be safe enough for the tug will be lookin for the raft when it gits light  slowly the hours wore away and in the meanwhile dick learned that the lumbermans name was luke peterson and that he was from the timberlands of michigan  i used to be in the united states service on the lakes hunting down smugglers between here and canada said peterson but that was years ago  do they do much smuggling asked dick  more than most folks think was the decided answer  the lumberman listened to dicks tale with interest of course the story had to be short and was frequently interrupted as high waves would come along and almost sweep them into the lake both lay flat clutching at the lumber and at the huge chains which held it and which had thus far refused to part although the strain upon them were tremendous  it was about two oclock in the morning when the storm according to dicks calculation reached its height the waves literally drove over the raft from end to end and it was all both he and luke peterson could do to keep on the timbers  hold on tight young man if ye value your life roared the lumberman an if the raft parts stick to the fust timber ye lay hands on  peterson had scarcely spoken when the raft went up to the top of a mighty wave and then came down with a dull boom in the hollow below the shock was terrific and it was followed by loud reports as the chains they had been depending upon snapped one after another immediately the lumber loosened up and began to drift apart  take care a yerself shouted the lumberman and hung fast to an extra long and heavy log dick heard him but could not answer for fear of getting his mouth full of water the youth turned over and over clutched at one log and missed it missed a second and a third and then touched a fourth and clung with a deathlike grip that nothing could loosen  it was a soultrying time and one which poor dick never forgot the storm roared all around him mingled with the thumping and bumping grinding and crashing of the sticks of timber once his left leg was caught between two sticks and for the instant he was afraid the limb would be crushed but then the pressure lessened and he drew the foot up in a hurry the water washed into his face and over him and he caught his breath with difficulty each instant looked as if it might be his last     chapter iv  in the hands of the enemy   daylight found poor dick all but exhausted he still held to the stick of lumber but his hands were numb and without feeling and his lower limbs were in the same condition  i cant stand this much longer was his dismal thought ive got to let go soon  he looked around him anxiously all that met his eyes was the broad expanse of water with here and there a solitary stick of lumber he gazed about for luke peterson but the lumberman was not in sight  he must have been drowned he thought heaven help me or ill go too  gradually the sky cleared of the clouds and the hot july sun began to pour down with a glare on the water that was wellnigh blinding as the waves went down he changed his position on the log and this gave him temporary relief soon the sun made his head ache and he began to see strange visions presently he put out his hand thinking that tom was before him and then went with a splash into the lake  almost unconscious of what he was doing he caught the log again but he was now too weak to pull himself up its the end he thought bitterly then a cry came to him a cry that seemed half real half imaginary  hullo rover is that you  it was peterson who was calling the lumberman had drifted up on another log and as the two sticks bumped together he caught hold of the youth and assisted him to his former resting place  ii cant hold on anyany longer gasped dick  try lad try some kind of a boat is bound to appear sooner or later  ii am nunumb all over  i suppose thats trueim numb myself but dont ye give up  encouraged somewhat by petersons words dick continued to hold on and a few minutes later the lumberman gave a cheering cry  a steamer saved at last  the lumberman was right the freighter tom and sam had hailed was approaching the castaways having been discovered by the aid of a marine glass  a man and a boy observed captain jasper to his mate  the boy looks pretty well done for returned the mate he must be the one that was thrown off the yacht  more than likely  as speedily as possible the freight steamer drew closer and a line was thrown to peterson  he turned to give one end to dick and then made the discovery that the latter had fainted from exhaustion  poor fellow he muttered and caught the youth just as he was sliding into the lake  it was no easy task to get dick on board of the freight steamer but it was accomplished at last and still unconscious he was carried to a stateroom and made as comfortable as possible  peterson was but little the worse for the adventure and his chief anxiety was for his friend bragin of whom so far nothing had been heard  the coming of dick on board of the captain rollow was viewed with much astonishment by two of the passengers on the freighter  these two persons were arnold baxter and his son dan  the two had quite recovered from the injuries received in the landslide in colorado and it may be as well to state right here that they were bound east in order to carry out a new plot which the elder baxter had hatched up against the rovers  what that plot was will be disclosed as our story proceeds  father it is dick rover cried dan baxter after having seen the unconscious one brought on board  hush dan i know it whispered arnold baxter  its a pity he wasnt drowned in the lake  i agree with you but he isnt dead and well have to keep out of sight for the rest of the trip  humph i am not afraid of him said the bully for as old readers know dan had never been anything else  that may be but if he sees us he mayahemmake much trouble for me  on account of our doings in colorado what can he prove nothing  perhaps he can besides dan you must remember that the officers of new york state are still after me  yes i havent forgotten that  i wish now that i had put on that false wig and beard before we left detroit went on arnold baxter but i hated to put them on before it was absolutely necessarythe weather is so warm  can you put them on now  hardly since all on board know my real looks i will have to keep out of rovers sight  i would like to know what he is doing out here  on a pleasure trip most likely  the talk went on for some time and then dan approached one of the mates of the freighter who had just come from the stateroom to which dick had been taken  how is that young fellow getting on he asked carelessly  hes in bad shape was the answer  do you think hell die  hardly but he is very weak and completely out of his mind the hot sun coming after the storm must have affected his brain  out of his mind doesnt he recognize anybody  no he talks nothing but lumber and cries out to be pulled from the water poor boy its too bad isnt it  it is too bad said dan baxter hypocritically do you know his name  no but hes a brother to those boys who hailed us from the yacht a couple of hours ago a lumber raft struck the yacht and the boy was knocked overboard and managed to cling to some timber  is the man who was saved his friend  no he was on the raft and the two are strangers and with this remark the mate of the freight steamer passed on  without delay dan told his father of what he had heard arnold baxter was much pleased  if he remains out of his mind well be safe enough he said i presume theyll put him off at cleveland and send him to the hospital  i wonder where that yacht is  oh we have left her miles behind  and how soon will we reach cleveland  inside of half an hour so i heard one of the deck hands say  no more was said for the time being but both father and son set to thinking deeply and their thoughts ran very much in the same channel  just as the freight steamer was about to make the landing at cleveland arnold baxter touched his son on the arm  if they take dick rover ashore let us go ashore too he whispered  i was thinking of that dad was dans answer was you thinking too of getting him in our power  yes  i dont see why we cant do itif he is still unconscious  it wont hurt to try but we will have to work quick for more than likely his brothers will follow us to this city went on arnold baxter  the steamer had but little freight for cleveland so the stop was only a short one  when poor dick was brought up on a cot still unconscious arnold baxter stepped forward  i have determined to stop off at cleveland he said to captain jasper if there is anything i can do for this poor fellow i will do it willingly  why i thought you were going through to buffalo returned the captain in surprise  i was going through but ive just remembered some business that must be attended to ill take the train for buffalo tomorrow if you want me to see to it that this poor fellow is placed in the hospital ill do it  the offer appeared a good one and relieved captain jaspers mind greatly  you are kind sir he said it isnt everyone who would put himself to so much trouble  i was wrecked myself once smiled arnold baxter and i know how miserable i felt when nobody gave me a hand  i suppose the authorities will take him until his brothers come in on that yacht  there is no need to send him to a public institution i will see to it that he gets to a firstclass hotel went on arnold baxter smoothly  there was a little more talk and then dick was carried ashore and a coach was called  by this time the freight steamer was ready to leave and a minute later she proceeded on her way  arnold baxter and dan looked around and saw only a few people at hand in the crowd was luke peterson who now came forward  want any help asked the lumberman respectfully  you might keep an eye open for that yacht replied arnold baxter  all right sir where are you going to take young rover  to the commercial hotel i am well known there and can easily get him a good room and the necessary medical attention  then if i see anything of the yacht ill send his brothers up to the hotel after him  thats it returned arnold baxter he turned to the driver of the coach to the commercial hotel he went on in a loud voice and drive as easy as you can  dan was already in the coach supporting poor dick in his arms arnold baxter leaped in and banged the door shut soon the coach was moving away from the water front and in the direction of the hotel which had been mentioned  of course you are not going to the commercial hotel observed dan as soon as he felt safe to speak  leave it all to me my son was arnold baxters reply we got him away nicely didnt we  yes but  never mind the future dan how is he  dead as a stone so far as knowing anything is concerned  i trust he remains so for a while at least  the coach rattled on and presently came to a halt in front of the hotel which had been mentioned  wait here until i get back said arnold baxter to his son and to the coach driver and then hurried inside of the building  instead of asking for a room he spent a few minutes in looking over a business directory  its too bad but they havent a single room vacant he said on coming back to the coach ive a good mind to take him to some private hospital after all do you know where dr karleys place is he went on turning to the coach driver  yes  then drive us to that place  again the coach went on dr karleys private sanitarium was on the outskirts of cleveland and it took half an hour to reach it it was an oldfashioned building surrounded by a high board fence entering the grounds arnold baxter ascended the piazza and rang the bell  a negro answered the summons and ushered him into a dingy parlor soon dr karley a driedup baldheaded old man appeared  and what can i do for you sir he asked in a squeaky voice  just the man i wanted to meet thought arnold baxter  he was a good reader of character and saw that dr karley would do almost anything for money  the doctors sanitarium was of a shady character among the inmates were two old men put there by their relatives merely to get them out of the way and an old lady who was said to be crazy by those who wished to get possession of her money  i have a peculiar case on hand doctor said arnold baxter after introducing himself as mr arnold a young friend of mine has been almost drowned in the lake i would like you to take charge of him for a day or two  well ier  i will pay you well for your services went on arnold baxter  you have him with you  yes in a coach outside he was found drifting on a log and almost out of his head on account of exposure to the water and the hot sun i think a few days of rest and medical attention will bring him around all right  the little old doctor bobbed his head i will go out and see him he said  quarter of an hour later found dick in an upper room of the sanitarium lying on a comfortable bed and with dr karley caring for him  in the meantime arnold baxter had gone out and paid the coach driver  do you generally stand down by the docks he asked  no sir my stand is uptown was the reply i had just brought down a passenger when you hailed me but i can go down for you if you wish  it will not be necessary the doctor has a carriage and i will hire that later on when i see how the patient is making out  all right sir then im off  as the coach passed out of sight arnold baxter chuckled to himself  i reckon that was well done he muttered i dont believe the rovers will find their brother very soon if they ever find him     chapter v  the sailing of the peacock   oh my what a bad dream i have had  such were the words which dick uttered to himself when he came once again to the full possession of his senses  he gazed around him curiously he was in a plainly furnished room lying on the top of a bed covered with a rubber blanket so that his wet clothing might not soil the linen beneath his coat and shoes had been removed likewise his collar and tie but that was all  the shades of the two windows of the apartment were tightly drawn and a lamp on the table lit up the room but dimly for it was now night no one was present but the sufferer  well one thing is certain i didnt drown after all he went on then he tried to sit up but fell back exhausted  he wondered where he was and if tom and sam were near and while he was wondering he fell into a light sleep which did a great deal toward restoring him to himself  when dick awoke he found dr karley at hand ready to give him some nourishing food the doctor had just come from a long talk with arnold baxter and it may as well be stated that the two men understood each other pretty thoroughly  where am i he asked in a fairly strong voice  safe said the old doctor soothingly here take this it will do you a whole lot of good  are my brothers around  well talk later after you are stronger  the old doctor would say no more dick took the medicine offered and did really feel stronger then a light breakfast was brought in of which he partook readily the food gone the doctor disappeared locking the door after him but so softly that dick was not aware of the fact until some time later  while dick was trying to get back his strength the baxters were not idle  arnold baxter had on his person all the money he possessed a little over three thousand dollars this had been saved from the wreck of his expedition to the west and he was now resolved to spend every dollar of it if necessary in bringing the rovers to terms as he put it  i was going to new york state to get the youngest rover boy in my power he said to dan but fate has thrown dick in our path and so we will take him instead once he is absolutely in our power i am sure i can bring anderson rover to terms and make him turn the entire right to that eclipse mine over to my representatives  its a ticklish job replied the son what of this doctor here wont he suspect anything  i reckon the doctor is no better than he ought to be dan i think i see my way clear to doing as i please with him a couple of hundred dollars will go a long way with fellows of his stripe  a conversation lasting half an hour followed and dan promised to keep close watch while his father went away to the docks  arnold baxter was absent the best part of the morning but came home with a face which showed he was well satisfied with what he had accomplished  i fell in luck he explained ran across a man i used to know years agogus langlessa sly old dog up for anything with money in it langless owns a small schooner the peacock and be says i can have her for a month with the services of himself and his crew for one thousand dollarsand nothing said about the job  did you accept dad  certainlyit was just what i wanted langless is all right and i told him i would double his money if he would stick by me to the finish and he swore that he would  and what is the next move  well take rover on board tonight and then set sail direct for detroit and lake huron langless knows an island in lake huron which will give us just the hiding place we want  and after that  ill send a letter to anderson rover which will sicken him to the heart and make him do just as i demand he thinks the world of his oldest son  good for you dad youve got a long head on your shoulders and when are you going to let dick rover know he is in our power  not until we have him on the peacock if i can prevent it if he knew here he might kick up a big row  pooh we could easily shut him up sniffed dan  now dick was in their custody he was impatient to browbeat the youth and taunt him with his helplessness but arnold baxter would not listen to it so the graceless son had to bide his time  the afternoon was an anxious one for both of the baxters who were afraid that the rovers would find their way to dr karleys place and thwart their carefully arranged plan but no one put in an appearance and by nightfall everything was in readiness for the departure the doctor had loaned his private turnout and for a consideration otherwise a bribe had dosed poor dick into semiunconsciousness and had promised to say to all comers that the young man had got well and gone off in the company of two of his friends a mr arnold and a mr daniels  when it came to transferring dick to the carriage arnold baxter put on the false wig and beard which he had been carrying in his valise thus transforming his appearance greatly dan kept out of sight on the seat of the carriage so that dick saw only his back in the gloom of the night the son drove while arnold baxter held dick  it was no easy matter to find the location of the peacock and equally difficult to get dick on board without observation but captain langless had wisely sent his men to a neighboring saloon so the coast was tolerably clear once dick was in the cabin arnold baxter left him in dans charge and hurried back to the sanitarium with the turnout in the meantime captain langless summoned his sailors and told them they would sail at early dawnhalfpast four  locking the door of the cabin and putting the key in his pocket dan baxter turned up the light and then looked at dick who lay half propped up in a chair  i guess ill wake him up he muttered and going over to the helpless youth he pulled his nose vigorously  oh groaned dick and opened his eyes dreamily then he caught sight of dan and stared as if he had seen a ghost  dan baxter he said slowly can it be possible  yes its me replied the bully with small regard for grammar do you know that you are in my power dick rover  iithought you were dead and dick closed his eyes again for it was next to impossible for him to arouse himself  im a long way from being dead laughed dan harshly i reckon youll die before i do  dick pulled himself together with a great effort  then the landslide didnt catch you he questioned  yes it did but it didnt kill me nor my father neither we are both here and you are absolutely in our power  is this the steamer that took me on board  no this is a boat that is under my fathers command  i dont understand it at all  reckon you will understand before we are done with you you thought you could crow over us but the crowing will be on the other side of the fence now  what are you going to do with me  youll find out soon enough  where are my brothers  i dont knowand i dont care  well i am glad they are not in your power returned dick with something of a sigh of relief  one of you is enough growled dan  and you wont tell me what boat this is  it is one under the command of my father  are we sailing  not yet but we will be in a few minutes  with an effort dick arose to his feet but he was dizzy from the effects of the dose administered by the doctor and immediately sank back again baxter gave a brutal laugh  now you see how it is he observed you are absolutely in our power how do you like the situation  how should i like it a lamb among wolves would be as safe to my way of thinking  i dont know but what you are right we intend to make a big thing out of you dick rover  how  i told you before youd find out soon enough  i presume youll try to make my father ransom me or something like that  well about make him give up that mining claim  you were going to make him give that up before  well we wont trip up this time our plans are carefully laid  you were always good at bragging dan baxter  dont insult me dick rover  i am telling the plain truth  with a sudden darkening of his face dan baxter strode forward  dick rover i hate you always have hated you and always will hate you take that for your impudence  he struck out and slapped the helpless boy heavily upon the cheek then as dick sank back in the chair he turned and left the cabin closing and locking the door after him  at halfpast four in the morning the peacock got under way and in less than an hour was far out upon the broad waters of lake erie     chapter vi  hunting for dick   dick must be drowned  it was tom who spoke addressing sam and aleck pop  for hours they had searched among the floating lumber for some sign of the missing one and the only thing that had been found was dicks cap caught in a crack of one of the timbers  its awful murmured sam his face was white and he was ready to cry for dick was very dear to him  perhaps dat steamboat dun pick him up suggested pop he wanted to say something comforting  i pray to heaven she did murmured tom i suppose the best thing we can do now is to steer for cleveland  yes thats the only hope left answered sam if he was floating around here we would surely have spotted him before this with the glass  the course was changed and toward nightfall they came in sight of cleveland and learned where they could tie up at a spot close to where the steamer had made her landing  their first inquiries were at this point and from a longshoreman they quickly learned that two persons had been picked up by the steamer a big man and a young fellow  it must be dick cried sam  where did they take the young fellow questioned tom  a man and a big boy came from the steamer and took charge of him answered the longshoreman  dont you know where they went  no most likely to the hospital the young fellow was in pretty bad shape they got in a coach  did the other man who was saved go along  no hes all right and is around here looking for you folksso he told me hehere he comes now  the longshoreman pointed to luke peterson who had just appeared at the upper end of the dock both sam and tom ran to meet him  so you are dick rovers brothers said peterson as he shook hands glad to know you yes your brother is all right although mighty tucked out by the exposure he fell in with a couple o friends on the steamer and they took him up to the commercial hotel  as peterson was curious to know how dick was faring he agreed to accompany sam and tom to the hotel and all three boarded a handy street car for that purpose  i wish to see my brother dick rover said tom to the clerk at the desk  not stopping here sir was the reply after the clerk had consulted the register  i mean the young man who was hauled out of the lake and was brought here feeling rather sick  the clerk shook his head no such person here  sam and tom stared in astonishment and then turned to the lumberman  the friends who were with him said they were going to bring him here said luke peterson and i promised to send you after em as soon as i spotted ye  i dont understand began tom and then turned swiftly to sam can this be some of arnold baxters work  it may be mr peterson how did the man who was with my brother look  as well as he could luke peterson described arnold baxter and also dan tom gave a low whistle  ill wager poor dick has fallen into the hands of the enemy he cried  what enemy questioned the lumberman  in as few words as possible tom and sam explained the situation concluding by saying they had discovered arnold baxter on the steamer the story made luke peterson look very grave  reckon we let your brother git into the wrong hands he observed  the question is where did they take dick  thats so where  evidently they didnt come here at all  perhaps if i could find that coach driver i might learn somethin  thats solet us find him by all means  but to find the driver was not easy and by midnight the search was abandoned much dejected sam and tom returned to the swallow and luke peterson accompanied them peterson was also downhearted having heard nothing of the tug which had been towing the lumber raft or of his friend bragin  ill notify the police in the morning said tom and did so he also sent a telegram to his father telling of what had happened the police took up the case readily but brought nothing new to light  im going to interview every cabby in town said tom and proceeded to do so accompanied by luke peterson and sam  at five oclock in the afternoon they found the coach driver who had taken dick from the dock  the man said they had no rooms vacant at the commercial hotel said the coach driver so he had me drive the party to dr karleys private sanitarium  where is that  on the outskirts about a mile and a half from here  can you take us there now  sorry but ive got a job in quarter of an hour  well pay you double fare put in sam get somebody else to take that other job  to this the coach driver readily agreed but to make the arrangement took time and it was six oclock before they were on the way to dr karleys place  when they reached the sanitarium they found the building dark with the shutters on the ground floor tightly closed dr karley answered toms summons in person  yes the parties were here he said smoothly but i could not accommodate them and so they went elsewhere  elsewhere echoed tom  exactly sir  but our coach driver says they got off here he was the one who brought them  at this announcement the face of the physician changed color for an instant but he quickly recovered himself  wellerthey did get off here as the sick young man wished to rest when i said i couldnt accommodate them the older man went off and got another coach and all three went off in that  to where  i do not know although i recommended the general hospital to them  they did not go to any of the city institutions  then perhaps they went to a hotel  we have inquired at every hotel in town  the little old doctor shrugged his bony shoulders i am sorry but i can give you no further information  how was the sick young man when he was here  he didnt appear to be very sick had he been bad i would have certainly done more for him  and you havent the least idea where they went to  i have not  its mighty strange was toms blunt comment do you know who the sick young man was  i havent the slightest idea i never ask questions unless they are necessary  he was my brother and those fellows who had him in charge are his enemies and up to no good  indeed and dr karley elevated his shaggy eyebrows in wellassumed surprise  i am bound to find my brother and if you know anything more you had better tell me went on tom bluntly  the random shaft struck home and the old doctor started back in dismay  whyersurely you do notersuspect me ofahemof anything wrong he stammered  i want to get at the truth which way did they go when they drove off  directly for town  and when was this  inside of half an hour after they got here  did they give any names  no it was not necessary since i could not take them in  your place doesnt seem to be very crowded  at this the physician glared angrily at tom  boy it seems to me that you are growing impudent he cried i am not accustomed to being addressed in this fashion i think i had better bid you goodnight  the two were standing in the hallway and now the doctor opened the door to signify that the interview was over  all right ill go muttered tom but i am going to get to the bottom of this affair dont you forget that and then he hurried out and rejoined sam and peterson at the coach  he may be telling the truth said the coach driver on hearing what tom had to say but all the same i was driving around these streets for a good hour after i left here and i saw no other rig with those men and your brother in it  i am inclined to think the doctor is humbugging us answered tom but the thing is to prove it  perhaps you had better watch the place for a while suggested the lumberman  do you know anything of this doctorwhat sort of a reputation he has asked sam of the driver  his reputation is none of the best was the answer he has been in court twice because of the people he treats  then he wouldnt be above helping arnold baxterif he was paid for it said tom  all entered the coach and drove off around the nearest corner  then tom and sam got out and walked away intending to come up at the rear of the sanitarium  presently a carriage appeared in view driven by a man who in the gloom appeared strangely familiar despite his false beard  arnold baxter cried sam hi there whoa  he ran toward the carriage and caught the horse by the bridle tom followed and the man who was just returning from taking dick to the peacock was brought to bay     chapter vii  the escape of arnold baxter   arnold baxter where is my brother dick demanded tom as he reached the carriage and caught the evildoer by the arm  to say that arnold baxter was astonished would be to put it altogether too mildly he was completely dumfounded  you he said slowly hardly knowing how to speak after he had caught his breath  yes you rascal where is dick  dick  yes dick  i know nothing of your brother this is aa complete surprise i didnt know you were in cleveland  perhaps not but let me tell you that we know your game and we are going to hand you over to the law  never arnold baxter fairly hissed out the words let go of that horsethe latter words to sam  dont you do it cried tom and then he caught arnold baxter by the leg come out of the carriage  a fierce struggle ensued and afraid that tom would get the worst of it sam set up a loud shout for help  you whelp ill fix you ejaculated arnold baxter and catching up the whip he struck at tom with the butt end he caught the youth directly over the head and tom went down as if shot  let tom alone screamed sam help help  who is it came from a distance and luke peterson hove into sight hullo the man we are after  he made a dive for arnold baxter but the latter was too quick for him and leaped from the opposite side of the carriage to the ground the horse now became frightened and set off on a run directly for a lane behind dr karleys institution  tom are you badly hurt questioned sam but even as he spoke tom tried to stagger to his feet seeing this sam began a chase after baxter with the lumberman beside him  arnold baxter was fleet of foot and realizing what capture meanta return to prison with his sentence to be served once more from the beginninghe ran as never before straight for the dock where the peacock lay  illustration the horse now became frightened and set off on a run  his first thought was to board the schooner and set sail out into the lake but a second thought convinced him that this would be unwise  they will follow me on a tug or steamer and the jig will be up in no time he said to himself i must find some hiding place  many of the docks were inclosed by high board fences and coming to one of these he leaped over and made his way to a huge pile of merchandise here he crouched down and kept as quiet as a mouse  sam and peterson followed by tom traced him to the fence but once on the opposite side lost all track of the rascal  hes gone said tom after running hither and thither on the dock he has given us the slip nicely  he cant be far off returned sam i believe he was bound for that doctors sanitarium when we spotted him  so do i and i wouldnt wonder if poor dick is at the place a prisoner  the matter was talked over for several minutes and the two brothers decided to return to dr karleys sanitarium the lumberman said he would remain around the docks on the lookout for arnold baxter  if you catch him ill give you fifty dollars said tom my father i know will pay the amount willingly  ill do my best answered peterson he was by no means rich and glad enough of a chance to make such a sum besides this the ways of the rover boys appeared to please him  when sam and tom returned to the doctors place they found the coach driver still at hand he having caught arnold baxters horse at the entrance to the lane  take him to the stable and ask the doctor if the rig is his said tom and the coach driver agreed he was gone the best part of quarter of an hour  the doctor says it is his horse and carriage but he also says he didnt know the turnout was out he announced with a grin hes an oily one he is  right you are but he cant stuff us with his fairy tales replied tom do you suppose there is a policeman handy  there is probably one somewhere around  i wish you would hunt him up and bring him here  what are you going to do  dare the lion in his den eh sam  right tom that doctor must know a good deal more than he is wiling to tell  the coach driver went off and walking around to the front of the sanitarium the boys rang the bell sharply  there was no answer to the summons and then tom gave the bell knob a jerk which nearly broke it off a secondstory window was thrown open with a bang  i want you boys to go away came in angry tones  and i want you to come down and let us in retorted tom  i wont let you in ive told you all i know and that is the end of it  its not the end of it dr karley we want to know how you came to let arnold baxter have your horse and carriage  i didnt know the horse and carriage were out of the stable the man must have taken them on the sly  its not likely open the door and let us init will be best for you  ha you threaten me  ive done more than thative sent for a policeman  at this announcement the old doctor grated his teeth savagely he was much disturbed and knew not how to proceed  i was a fool to go into this thing he muttered it may lead to all sorts of trouble i must get myself clear somehow  are you going to let us in went on tom  yes i will let you in but allow me to state that you are acting very foolishly answered the doctor and dropped the window a few minutes later he appeared at the door which he opened very gingerly  you can come into the parlor he said stiffly  well remain right here answered tom afraid of some sort of a trap  well what do you want  i want to know where that young man my brother is  the man who was with him said he was his nephew  it was a falsehood now where is my brother  honestly i have not the slightest idea  what was that man doing with your carriage  i repeat young man i did not know he had the carriage the old doctor drew a long breath wondering how soon an officer of the law would appear of course if anything is wrong i am perfectly willing to do all i can to set it right my institution is above reproach and i wish to keep it so  are you willing to let me look through your place  so you think your brother is here  i do  you are very forward still to convince you that you are mistaken you are at liberty to go through my place from top to bottom but you must not disturb any of the patients  all right let us go through sam you remain here on the watch for that policeman  with bad grace dr karley led the way and took tom through the sanitarium from top to bottom even allowing him to peep into the rooms occupied by the boarders as the medical man called them of course there was no trace of dick  now i trust you are satisfied said the doctor when they were again at the front door  i am not satisfied about that carriage affair returned tom as bluntly as ever  well i have told you the truth  at this moment the coach driver came in sight accompanied by a policeman  whats the trouble demanded the officer of the law  tom and sam told their tale and then the doctor had his say and the driver related what he knew  certainly a queer mixup remarked the policeman he turned to the rovers what do you want to do  i want to find my brother who has disappeared said tom  you say you have searched through here  i haveafter a fashion  you can go through if you wish said the doctor to the officer  i reckon my brother is gone went on tom but this doctor helped the rascals who spirited him away  i did absolutely nothing cried dr karley i am willing to aid you all i can but i am innocent i received no pay for giving the unfortunate young man some medicine to strengthen him and my horse and carriage were taken without my knowledge  a long and bitter war of words followed but in the end the doctor was left to himself  well make no charge against him yet said tom to the policeman but i wish you would keep an eye on the institutionin case that rascal puts in an appearance again  i will returned the officer  a little while later sam and tom set out to rejoin luke peterson when they gained the dock they saw nobody  he ought to be somewhere about said the younger rover  they tramped about from place to place for fully an hour  presently they came close to where the swallow lay had they but known it the peacock with poor dick on board lay but three blocks further away  my gracious cried sam suddenly  he had seen a form stretched motionless across some lumber lying near  the form was that of luke peterson and his cheek and temple were covered with blood     chapter viii  on the lake again   peterson cried tom in dismay  can he be dead came from sam then he bent over the lumberman no he still lives but he has been treated most shamefully  this must be some more of arnold baxters work  or else the work of some footpad  both boys knelt over the prostrate form of the lumberman and did what they could to restore him to his senses  in this they were partly successful  dont hit me again please dont hit me the man moaned over and over again  youre safe said tom but peterson paid no attention and only begged them not to hit him  let us carry him to the swallow suggested sam and between them they did so  wots dis asked aleck pop in astonishment  he is our friend and has been struck down answered tom get some water in a basin and a little liquor  when the colored man returned with the articles mentioned both boys washed the wounded mans head and bound it up with a towel then tom administered a few spoonfuls of liquor this seemed to give peterson some strength but he did not fully recover for some hours  follow the peacock were his first rational words follow the schooner peacock  the peacock repeated tom why should we follow her  your brother is on board and having spoken thus the lumberman sank again into semiunconsciousness  can he be telling the truth or is he out of his head questioned sam  im sure i dont know sam  perhaps we had better look around for the schooner he mentioned  all right ill do so you stay here with aleck  hadnt i better go with you  no ill keep my eyes open concluded tom and hurried away  it was now dawn and the early workers were just getting to their employment soon tom met a couple of watchmen and hailed them  i am looking for the schooner peacock said he do you know anything of the craft  sure an thats gus langless boat said one of the watchmen shes lying at the end of bassoons wharf over yonder  thank you and tom started away  the wharf mentioned was a long one and it took some time for the youth to reach the outer end as he ran he saw a boat in the distance moving away with all sails set of course he could not make out her name but he saw that she was schoonerrigged and felt certain she must be the craft for which he was searching  at the end of the pier he met a dock hand who had been resting in a nearby shed  is that boat the peacock he asked  yes sir  do you know anything of the people on board  i do not  has she a cargo  i believe not  you didnt see anybody going on her  hold up yes i did a young fellow and a man  was the young man in a feeble state  he seemed to be  thank you  tom turned away with something of a groan dick must be on board of that craft along with the baxters oh what luck we are having now what ought i to do next  his wisest move would have been to have informed the authorities but tom was too much upset mentally to think of that with all speed he returned to the swallow  the peacock has sailed he cried we must follow her  you are certain queried sam  yes i saw her in the distance come let us get after her before it is too late  as luke peterson was now doing fairly well all of the others ran on deck and soon the swallow was in pursuit of the schooner at first but little could be seen of the peacock but when the sun came up they saw her plainly heading toward the northwest  we must keep her in sight said tom  yes but supposing the baxters are on board how can we capture them came from sam we are but three or four at the most counting peterson while that craft must carry a crew of five or six  we can hail some other boat to help us the main thing is not to lose track of the rascals  the breeze was all that could be desired and once the shore was left behind they kept the peacock in sight with ease but try their best they gained but little on the larger boat  as there was now nothing to do but to let the yacht do her best tom left sam at the wheel and turned his attention to peterson the lumberman was now able to sit up although very weak  i discovered arnold baxter and tracked him to the schooners dock he said his son came to the dock and from what they said i am sure your brother is on the craft then they discovered me and the father struck me down with the butt of a pistol he carried after that all was a blank until i found myself here  you can be thankful you werent killed  i suppose so i shall not rest until that villain is brought to justice but what are ye up to now lad  we are in pursuit of the peacock  on the lake or up the river  on the lake  can you keep her in sight  so far we seem to be holding our own  good id go on deck and help ye but i feel kind o strangelike in the legs  better keep quiet for the present we may need you later on  got any firearms on board  yes a gun and two pistols  ye may want em afore ye git through with that crowd they are bad ones  we know them thoroughly mr peterson we have been acquainted with them for years and then tom told of how dan baxter had been the bully at putnam hall and how he had run away to join his rascally father and of how arnold baxter had been mr rovers enemy since the days of early mining in the west  o course they are carrying off your brother fer a purpose said the lumberman like as not theyll try to hit your father through him  i presume that is the game  the morning wore away slowly but as the sun mounted higher the breeze gradually died down  the peacock was the first to feel the going down of the wind and slowly but surely the swallow crept closer to the schooner  but at last both vessels came to a standstill about quarter of a mile apart  now whats to do questioned sam dismally  i reckon we can whistle for a breeze returned his brother  whistling wont do us any good ive been wondering if we could not do some rowing in the small boat  hurrah just the thing  there was a small rowboat stored away on board the swallow and this was now brought forth along with two pairs of oars  gwine ter row ober eh observed aleck pop racken you dun bettah been careful wot youse do  we shall go armed answered tom  the boys soon had the rowboat floating on the lake and they leaped in each with a pair of oars and with a pistol stowed away in his pocket  from the start those on board of the peacock had been afraid that the yacht was following them and now they were certain of it  two boys putting off in a rowboat announced captain langless  they are tom and sam rover answered arnold baxter after a brief survey through a marine glass  how did they get to know enough to follow this craft  im sure i dont know but those rover boys are slick and always were  what will you do when they come up  warn them off  ive got an idea dad came from dan  well  why not get out of sight and let captain langless invite them on board to look for dick then we can bag them and put them with dick  by jove that is a scheme exclaimed the rascally parent langless will you do it of course well have to get out of sight until the proper moment arrives  but if you bag em what of those left on the swallow questioned the captain  there is only one man a negro he doesnt amount to anything  there may be moreone or two officers of the law  arnold baxter used his glass again i see nobody but the darky if there were officers at hand i am sure they would have come along in that rowboat  i guess you are right about that  if we capture the boys the darky wont dare to follow us alone and it may be that we can capture him too went on arnold baxter  by this time the rowboat was drawing closer and arnold baxter and dan stepped out of sight behind the forecastle of the schooner  a few additional words passed between captain langless and the baxters and then the owner of the peacock awaited the coming of our friends who were now almost alongside never suspecting the trap which was set for them     chapter ix  caught in a trap   do you see anything of the baxters asked sam when the rowboat was within a hundred feet of the schooner  i thought i did before but i dont see them now answered tom  rowboat ahoy shouted captain langless what brings you  i reckon you know well enough tom shouted back we are after dick rover  dick rover who is he  your prisoner  our prisoner the owner of the peacock put on a look of surprise really you are talking in riddles  i dont think so where are arnold baxter and his son dan  dont know anybody by that name  they went on board of your boat put in sam  you must be mistaken captain langless turned to his mate find any stowaways on board  nary a one was the mates answer and just came up from the hold too  this talk perplexed tom and sam not a little  was it possible luke peterson had made some mistake  we have it on pretty good authority that the baxters are on board of your boat and that dick rover is aboard too said sam  its all a riddle to me answered captain langless we are not in the business of carrying prisoners we are bound for sandusky for a cargo of flour  this talk completely nonplused the boys and they held a whispered consultation  i dont believe him said sam  no more do i but what shall we do about it  im sure i dont know  you can come on board and look around if you wish called out the owner of the schooner i want you to satisfy yourself that you are mistaken  shall we go whispered tom it may be a trap  he seems honest enough  supposing i go and you stay in the rowboat then if anything happens you can call on aleck and peterson for help  so it was arranged and in a minute more tom was climbing up the ladder which had been thrown over the peacocks side  is the other young fellow coming asked the captain who did not fancy this move  no  the captain scowled but said no more  once on deck tom looked around him curiously and then moved toward the companion way leading to the cabin he felt instinctively that he was in a dangerous position as he crossed the deck several illappearing sailors gazed at him curiously but said nothingbeing under strict orders from the captain to remain silent in the presence of the stranger  the cabin of the peacock was a small affair considering the general size of the schooner and contained but little in the shape of furniture  dick had been removed long before so the apartment was empty of human occupants when tom entered  nobody here he murmured as he gazed around what foolishness to come anyway the baxters could easily hide on me if they wanted to  he was about to leave the cabin when a form darkened the companion way and arnold baxter appeared  silence commanded the man and pointed a pistol at toms head  the sight of the rascal startled the youth and the look on baxters face caused him to shiver  so you are here after all he managed to  say  silence repeated arnold baxter unless you want to be shot  where is my brother dick  before arnold baxter could reply dan put in an appearance carrying a pair of handcuffs  now well get square with you tom rover said the bully harshly  what do you intend to do  make you a prisoner hold out your hands  and if i refuse  you wont refuse put in arnold baxter and lowering his pistol he leaped behind tom and caught him by the arms at the same time dan attacked the lad in front and poor tom was soon handcuffed then he was led out of the cabin by a rear way a door was opened and he was thrust into the blackness of the hold but ere this was accomplished he let out one long loud cry for help which reached sams ears quite plainly  hi what are you doing to my brother ejaculated the younger rover he had brought the rowboat close up alongside the schooner  i dont know whats up answered the mate of the peacock better come aboard and see  he has fallen down the hatchway cried captain langless poor chap hes hurt himself quite badly and he disappeared as if going to toms assistance  if sam had been in a quandary before he was doubly so now had tom really fallen or had he been attacked  i cant leave him alone he thought and without further hesitation leaped up the side of the schooner with the agility of a cat  it was a fatal movement for scarcely had he reached the deck when he was pounced upon by captain langless and held fast until arnold baxter appeared  let me go cried sam but his protest proved of no avail a lively scuffle followed but the lad was no match for the men and in the end he found himself handcuffed and thrown into the hold beside tom  tie the rowboat fast to the stern ordered arnold baxter and this was done  the going down of the wind was only temporary and now a slight breeze sprang up  we are in luck said the captain of the schooner  we must keep away from the yacht returned arnold baxter  soon the schooners sails were filling and she continued on her course dragging the small boat behind her aleck pop saw the movement and grew much perplexed  dat dont look right to me nohow he muttered pears lak da was bein tuk along sumway  aleck was not much of a sailor but he had been out enough to know how to handle the yacht under ordinary circumstances and now he did his best to follow the peacock  with the glass he watched eagerly for the reappearance of sam and tom and his face became a study when fully half an hour passed and they failed to show themselves  da is in trouble suah he told himself now wots dis yeah niggah to do  he lashed the wheel fast and sought advice from luke peterson who was feeling stronger every minute the burly lumberman shook his head dubiously  in trouble for certain was his comment didnt hear any pistol shots did ye  didnt heah nuffin sah  they wouldnt remain on board of that craft of their own free will  dont specs da would sah de question is sah wots to do and aleck scratched his woolly head thoughtfully  i dont know excepting to keep the schooner in sight if possible and see if something doesnt turn up if you sight a steamer or a steam tug let me know and ill try to get help  so it was arranged and aleck returned to the wheel the swallow was going along smoothly and he did what he could to make the sails draw as much as possible peterson now discovered the medicine chest of the yacht and from this got another dose of liquor which afforded him the temporary strength of which he was in so much need  the coming of night found the two vessels far out upon the waters of lake erie and nearly half a mile apart peterson now came on deck to keep an eye on things while aleck prepared supper it promised to remain clear but as there would be no moon peterson was afraid that they would lose sight of the peacock in the gathering darkness  supper was soon served the lumberman eating first and then aleck cleared away the few dishes and tidied up generally the colored man was much downcast  fust it was dick an now it am de whole tree of em he remarked ise afraid dar is gwine ter be a bad endin to dis yeah trip  we will have to take what comes answered peterson but i have taken a fancy to those boys and ill stick by you to the end  slowly the darkness of night settled over the waters of the lake and with the going down of the sun the stars came forth one after another during the last few hours several sail had been seen at a distance but none had come close enough to be hailed  we are going to lose her in the darkness after all announced the lumberman at about eight oclock its hard for me to see her even now  half an hour later the peacock disappeared in the gloom and the chase for the time being came to an end     chapter x  the escape from the hold   sam is that you  yes  we are trapped  it looks like itor rather feels like it i cant see a thing  nor i did you find out anything about dick  no  a groan came from the opposite end of the hold  here i am how in the world did you get here  dick after all ejaculated tom and there was a slight trace of joy in his tone are you o k old man  hardly they dosed me with drugs until my mind is topsyturvy  im glad you are alive came from sam where are you  here lying on a couple of boxes look out how you move about or you may hurt yourselves  handcuffed as they were tom and sam felt their way along through the dark hold until they reached their elder brothers side they grasped his hands warmly  im glad we are together again even if we are prisoners remarked tom and this was his younger brothers sentiment too  how did you get here asked dick and each told his story from beginning to end and then the elder rover had to relate his own adventures  i knew that old doctor wasnt telling the truth burst out tom oh but wont we have an account to settle with all of those chaps if ever we get out of this scrape  dont let us hurrah until we are out of the woods added dick soberly we are in the hands of a desperate gang to my way of reasoning  the baxters are certainly bad enough  and any boat captain who would go into this game with them is probably just as bad whom did you leave on the yacht  aleck and the lumberman who was on the raft with you  i wonder if they will follow this schooner  no one could answer this question and for several minutes there was a silence during that time they heard heavy footsteps cross and recross the deck but that was all presently the schooner began to rock slightly  the wind is coming up said tom we are moving ahead again  thats bad for usif the schooner manages to run away from the yacht rejoined dick  soon the motion of the peacock showed that the schooner was bowling along rapidly they heard the creaking of tackle as additional sails were hoisted and felt certain that the craft was making the best run at her command  the hold had not been opened up for a long time consequently the air was foul as well as stifling from the heat  id give something for some fresh air said sam how is it with you dick  i want fresh air and a drink of water i am as dry as a bale of cotton  havent they given you anything since you came on board asked tom  not a thing  the inhuman wretches oh i wish i had dan baxter hereid punch his head good for him  ditto the head of his rascally father returned dick i would like to know just where they intend to take meor rather all of us now they certainly cant expect to keep us on board this craft  perhaps theyll ship us to canada  hardly since they couldnt land on the canadian shore without an inspection of the vessel  they have some plan up their sleeve thats certain  slowly the hours wore away until all sounds on deck ceased and they knew it must be well along in the night still the schooner kept on her course  all of the boys had been working at their bonds but without success they wished they had a light but neither sam nor tom had a match and dicks pockets were entirely bare tom and sam were likewise minus their pistols arnold baxter having taken the weapons away before placing them in the hold  the night proved to be a truly horrible one for the boys for the hold was overrun with rats who became altogether too familiar at first one of the pests ran over toms legs  a rat he cried hi scat and the frisky rodent scampered off but speedily returned followed by several others after that they had a lively time of it for half an hour when the rats left them as suddenly as they had appeared  the storm and their various adventures had tired the boys out and soon in spite of the surroundings one after another fell into a light doze the sleep did all of them good especially dick who declared on awakening that he felt almost as well as ever  only im as hungry as a bear he added  ditto myself came from tom i move we try to break out of this dingy hole  all right but where shall we break to put in sam i cant see much more than i could last night  the matter was talked over and presently they scattered to feel along the ribbed walls of the hold  for a long time nobody felt anything of importance but at last sam let out a soft cry  ive found something of a door  good for you answered tom can you open it  no there seems to be a bar or something on the other side  the others rejoined the youngest rover and made out the door quite plainly for there was a broad crack at the top and at the side opposite the hinges there was a bar true enough  if we had something that we could slip into that crack we might move the bar observed dick  i slipped on a sheet of tin a while ago said tom perhaps i can find that  his hunt was successful and soon they had the tin in the crack under the bar the latter gave way with ease and then they pulled the door open beyond was the passageway leading to the cabin  now whats the next movement whispered sam  let us try to arm ourselves first of all answered dick then if we are cornered again we may be able to make some kind of favorable terms  he tiptoed his way into the cabin and found it deserted on the table rested the remains of a breakfast served to several people and he picked up half a loaf of bread and put it in the pocket of his jacket several boiled eggs followed  on one of the walls of the cabin hung two oldfashioned swords and a brace of pistols without hesitation he took all of the weapons and returned with them to his brothers  here are pistols and swords and something to eat he said there seems to be nobody around so you can come into the cabin if you wish  all entered the compartment both water and a little coffee were handy and they made a hasty repast while eating tom hunted around the room and also looked into an adjoining stateroom in the latter place he found a bunch of keys on a nail  if only one of em fits these handcuffs he murmured and they tried the keys without delay one did fit and in a few seconds they were free of their fetters  now lay on macduff quoted tom as he swung aloft one of the swords well give them a warm reception eh  well do nothing of the kind replied dick hastily in this case silence is the better part of valor well lay low until the time comes to make a move  what do you mean to go back to the hold asked sam  we may as well for the present it is broad daylight now perhaps we can escape at night  do you suppose they took our rowboat along came from tom  i shouldnt wonder we can hist somebody is coming  dick was right captain langless was descending the companion way on tiptoes the three boys hurried to the door leading to the hold as they flung it back they found themselves confronted by arnold baxter and dan     chapter xi  gaining a point   the sudden turn of affairs chagrined the rover boys greatly and for the moment none of them knew what to say  arnold baxter and dan grinned at the trio sarcastically and the bully was the first to break the silence  didnt get away that time did you he sneered  ha so they are here came from captain langless who had just stepped into the cabin and without the handcuffs too  let us alone cried tom hotly if you touch me again ill shoot somebody and so speaking he raised one of the pistols taken from the cabin wall  his aim was at dan and the bully fell back with a cry of terror for as old readers know dan was a coward at heart  dontdont shoot he faltered dont  my pistols burst out the captain of the peacock in a rage hand those weapons over to me do you hear  he took several steps forward when dick brought him to a halt by raising one of the swords  it was a dramatic scene of intense interest to all concerned arnold baxter gazed at the armed youths in alarm and captain langless grated his teeth  this is foolishness said the owner of the schooner after a painful pause if you try to fight youll only get into worse trouble we are all told ten to three and the best thing you can do is to throw down those arms and submit  we wont submit came from sam with a boldness which was astonishing in one of his years his stirring adventures in africa and in the west accounted for much of this valor  we are not going to remain on this vessel said dick and if you try to detain us further somebody will get hurt  you scamp fumed arnold baxter and looked at the elder rover as if to annihilate him with a glance but dick remained undaunted and gradually arnold baxter fell back a few steps  it must be confessed that the rover boys felt far from comfortable here were two of the enemy on one side and one on the other cutting off their escape in both directions more than this captain langless now raised his voice and presently several roughlooking sailors came rushing into the cabin  leave the hold cried the owner of the schooner to the baxters i reckon i know how to manage em  arnold baxter understood and at once took his son by the arm the pair had come down into the hold by means of a ladder lowered through the forward hatchway now they ran for the ladder mounted and drew it up after them then the hatch was closed down as before  in the meantime captain langless whispered to one of his sailors and the tar ran to one of the staterooms and returned with an oldfashioned sevenshooter fully a foot and a half long  now get back there ordered the owner of the schooner i wont have any more fooling  if you shoot so will i said tom quickly  and so will i added sam  we had better have no bloodshed continued the captain trying to control himself behave yourselves and youll be treated all right kick up a muss and it will go hard with you  what do you intend to do with us questioned dick curiously  youll have to ask your friend arnold baxter about that  he is no friend of ours cried tom he is our worst enemyand you know it  if you behave yourself ill see to it that no harm befalls you continued captain langless im sorry i mixed up in this affair but now i am in it im going to see it through  you are carrying us off against our will  the owner of the peacock shrugged his shoulders  youll have to talk that over with baxter and his son  youve been starving us  we were just going to furnish you with breakfast and a small keg of water  we dont want to stay in that foulsmelling hold put in sam it is enough to make a fellow sick  if youll promise to behave yourselves we may let you on deck part of the time  youd better grumbled tom he hardly knew what to say and his brothers were in an equal quandary  come throw down your arms and well give you breakfast here in the cabin continued captain langless you wont find me such a bad chap to deal with when once you know me you look like decent sort of fellows and if you do the right thing ill promise to see to it that the baxters do the square thing too well be better off on a friendly footing than otherwise  the owner of the peacock spoke earnestly and it must be admitted that he meant a large part of what he said the manliness of the rover boys pleased him and he could not help but contrast it with the cowardice of the bully dan perhaps too behind it all he was a bit sick of the job he had undertaken he knew that he had virtually helped to kidnap the boys and if caught this would mean a long term of imprisonment  dick looked at his two brothers wondering what they would have to say he realized that after all they were in a hopeless minority and were bound to lose in a handtohand struggle  we may as well try them he whispered if we fight one of us may get killed  they talked among themselves for several minutes and then dick turned to the captain  well submit for the present he said but mind you we expect to be treated like gentlemen  and you will be treated as such answered captain langless glad that there would be no struggle come into the cabin and stack those weapons in the corner they were never meant for anything but wall decorations and he laughed somewhat nervously  the three lads entered the cabin and put down the weapons they kept their eyes on the captain and his men but there was no move to molest them  you can go said captain langless to the sailors and wilson send the cook here for orders  the sailors departed and with something of a grim smile on his furrowed face the owner of the peacock dropped into a seat near the companionway door he had just started to speak again when there was a noise outside and arnold baxter appeared  have you subdued the rascals he questioned hastily  reckon i have was the slow answer leaswise they have thrown down their weapons  then why dont you handcuff them again the rats  we are no rats and ill trouble you to be civil returned dick firmly  ha ill show you howled arnold baxter and would have rushed at dick had not the captain interposed  hold on sir were the words of the ships owner we have called a truce they have promised to behave themselves if we treat them squarely and so there are to be no more backbitings  buter arnold baxter was so astonished he could scarcely speak you are not going to put them in the hold  not for the present  they will run away  how can they when we are out of sight of land  they ought to be chained down  supposing you let me be the judge of that mr baxter i promised to do certain things for you if i do them youll have no cause to complain  have you decided to take these boys part ejaculated arnold baxter turning pale  i have made up my mind that treating them like beasts wont do any good  they dont deserve it  dont deserve what  to be well treated they areare  young gentlemen finished tom the captain knows gentlemen when he sees them even if you dont  dont talk to me tom rover  i will talk whenever i please i am not your slave  but you are in my power dont forget that  at this moment the cook of the schooner appeared  whats wanted he asked of the captain  bring some breakfast for these three young gentlemen said captain langless some fresh coffee and bread and some fried eggs and potatoes  at this order arnold baxter stood fairly aghast you are going to let them dine here he gasped  i am  butbut you must be crazy they willerthink they are running the ship  no they wont leave them to me and im sure we will get along all right come let us go on deck  what and leave them alone  i will send a man down to see that they dont get into mischief  but i dont like this turn of affairs stammered arnold baxter he was half afraid the captain was going back on him  its all right come answered the owner of the peacock and a moment later both men quitted the cabin     chapter xii  a dinner of importance   the captain isnt such a bad fellow after all observed sam when the three rovers were left to themselves  he certainly isnt a brute answered dick but about being bad thats another story  hes got an awfully shrewd face put in tom but im mighty glad he turned old baxter down that villain would ride over us roughshod  i think all told we have gained a point continued dick its something to be treated decently even if you are a prisoner the question is how long will we be caged up on board of the schooner  i would like to know if the swallow is in sight said tom wonder if i cant slip up the companion way and find out  he arose from the seat into which he had dropped but before he could gain the doorway a sailor appeared and waved him back then the sailor took the seat the captain had occupied by the door  are you sent to spy on us demanded tom  i was sent to see that you didnt cut up any tricks answered the tar he was terribly crosseyed but appeared to be rather goodnatured you mustnt go on deck without the captains permission  cant we have any fresh air  youll have to ask the captain about that he said i was to watch you while you had breakfast and keep you and those other folks from quarreling  what other folks the baxters  yes  no more was said and soon the cook appeared with a pot full of newly made coffee and a trayful of other things the hasty lunch had been a scanty one and it did not interfere with the boys appetites for what was now set before them  this is all right observed sam when he had almost finished eating we couldnt have a better meal on the swallow he turned to the sailor is the yacht still in sight  he spoke carelessly but the tar knew how much he was interested and smiled suggestively  no sail of any kind in sight  where are we bound  youll have to ask the captain about that  do you mean to say you dont know  the sailor nodded we follow orders we do and thats all he observed and then they could get nothing more out of him  the boys took their time yet the meal was finished inside of half an hour they were just getting up from the table when captain langless reappeared  well how did the breakfast suit he asked  firstrate returned dick now if you dont mind we would like to go on deck  you may do so under one condition  and that is  that you will go below again when ordered by me  at this both tom and sam cut wry faces  you are rather hard on us said dick slowly  on the contrary i think i am treating you generously the baxters wish to handcuff you and put you back into the hold  there was a pause and then the boys agreed if allowed to go on deck to go below again whenever the captain wished  but remember we are going to get away if we can added dick  all right get awayif you can rejoined captain langless if you go overboard youll be in for a long swim i can tell you that  it felt good to get into the bright sunshine once more and the boys tumbled up to the deck without ceremony as soon as they had quitted the cabin the captain put away the weapons at hand locking them in a closet  as the sailor had said no other craft was in sight and on every hand stretched the calm waters of lake erie as far as eye could reach the course was northwest and dick rightfully guessed that they were heading for the detroit river there was a stiff breeze blowing and with every sail set the peacock was making rapid headway  it was not long before dan baxter came up to them the bullys face was dark and threatening yet he did not dare say much for captain langless had given him warning that the prisoners must not be molested  i suppose you think it a fine thing to be up here he began  it will be if we dont get too much of you replied tom bluntly i suppose you would give a good deal to be on land  not particularly we enjoy sailing if not we wouldnt have been out in our yacht  where were you bound  that was our business baxter  oh if you dont want to tell me you neednt growled the bully and walked away  ill wager he and his father have had a row with captain langless observed dick otherwise he wouldnt be half so meek  i wish we could win captain langless over to our side put in sam suddenly struck by the idea do you suppose it could be done if we paid him well  id hate to buy him off said tom  but it might be best said dick slowly we dont know what the baxters may have in store for us  its pretty plain to me what they want to do they are going to hold us prisoners until father signs off his rights to that mining claim  and if father wont sign off  then theyll treat us pretty badly  perhaps theyll kill us  we can sound captain langlessit wont do any harm  but you mustnt let the baxters get an inkling of what is up  for the present the captain was not in sight having retired to the stern to consult arnold baxter upon several points they remained on deck until noon when the cook called them to dinner in the cabin they found they were to dine with captain langless  i asked the baxters to join us but they declined he observed as they sat down now i am not so hightoned  you mean you are not such a fool returned dick for myself i am glad they are staying away my meal would be spoiled if i had to eat with them  they are very bitter against you thats certain went on the owner of the schooner smoothly they want me to do all sorts of mean things but i have declined i am playing a game with them but i want to do it as be comes a man  dick looked around to see that no outsider was within earshot why do you play the game with them captain langless he whispered  the owner of the schooner frowned  well one must make a living if you want an answer he returned shortly  true but you might make a living more honestly  by helping us for instance added tom  by helping you  yes by helping us resumed dick  i must say lads i dont quite understand you the captain looked at them sharply as if anxious for either to proceed  let us review the situation continued the eldest of the rovers in the first place we take it that you have been hired by the baxters to do a certain thing  granted  the baxters have promised to pay you for your work and for the use of your vessel  granted again  you are running on dangerous ground and if you get tripped up it means a long term of imprisonment  you are a clever fellow rover and your school training does you credit however i dont know as any of us expect to get tripped up  no criminal does until he is caught  there may be something in that but i am willing to take my chances as the old saying goes nothing ventured nothing gained  but wouldnt you rather venture on the right side  you want me to come to terms is that it  we do we can make it worth your while if you will help us and help bring the baxters to justice do you know that arnold baxter is an escaped convict who got out of a new york prison on a forged pardon  no i know very little of the man  he is a bad one and his son is little better standing in with them is a serious business i dont know much about you but you dont look like a man who is bad by choice  at this the captain of the peacock let out a light laugh you talk as if you were a man of deep experience instead of a mere boy  i have had some experience especially with bad folksnot only in this country but in africa so that gives me an age not counted by years to my mind it seems that a man ought to be more willing to make money honestly than dishonestly  a long silence followed this speech  tell me what you have to offer said the captain and leaned back in his chair to listen     chapter xiii  prisoners three   it was easy to see that captain langless was feeling his way as the saying is and dick felt that he must go slow or he might spoil everything criminals are of all shades and degrees and look at affairs in a different light from honest men it is said that some would rather be dishonest than honest and dick did not yet know how the owner of the peacock stood on that point  perhaps you had better tell us first what arnold baxter has offered you said the elder rover as he looked the owner of the schooner squarely in the eyes  well he has offered considerable if his schemes go through  and if they fail you get nothing  i am a good loserso i shant complain  supposing i was to offer you several hundred dollars if you saw us safe on shore   how can you offer any money you havent got it with you have you  no but i could get the money and what i promised to pay i would pay  but several hundred dollars wouldnt be enough  if you helped to bring the baxters to justice we might make it a thousand dollars put in tom who was now as anxious as dick to bring the captain to terms  at the mention of a thousand dollars the eyes of captain langless glistened the sum was not large but it was sufficient to interest him he had already received three hundred dollars from arnold baxter as a guarantee of good faith so to speak but there was no telling how much more he could expect from that individual if he could obtain thirteen hundred dollars all told and get out of the affair on the safe side he might be doing well  how would you pay this thousand dollars he asked  our father would pay it he is a fairly rich man and anxious to see arnold baxter returned to prison  to get the man out of his path  partly that and partly to see justice done come what do you say  before the captain could answer there came a call down the companion way  two vessels in sighta schooner and a steam tug announced a sailor  coming this way asked the master of the schooner  aye sir  captain langless arose at once  i will have to ask you to step into the hold again he said politely but firmly i will talk over what you have offered later  he motioned to the passageway leading to the hold sam was on the point of objecting but dick silenced him with a look  all right well go grumbled tom but im going to take the dessert with me and he took up a bowl of rice pudding and a spoon dick followed with a pitcher of water and a glass at which the captain had to grin as soon as they were in the hold the owner of the schooner bolted the door and fixed it so that it might not again be opened from the inside  two ships in sight cried sam when they were alone we ought to have made a dash for liberty  it wouldnt have helped us answered his oldest brother those vessels must be some distance away and before they came up we would be down here handcuffed and in disgrace with the captain if we treat him right we may win him over and finish the baxters game  sitting in the darkness they took their time about eating the rice pudding and dick placed the water where it could be found when wanted then they listened for the approach of the two vessels which the lookout had sighted  yet hour after hour went by and nothing of importance reached their ears the vessels came up and passed them and then the peacock turned in for the mouth of the detroit river soon the boys knew by the steam whistles and other sounds that the schooner was approaching some sort of harbor  a dreary evening and night followed the peacock came to a standstill and they heard the sails come down and the anchors dropped but nobody came to them and they had to sink to rest supperless they remained awake until after midnight then dozed off one after another  when they awoke a surprise awaited them the hold was lit up by the rays of a bright lantern hung on a hook near the door leading to the cabin passageway below the lantern stood a tray filled with eatables and near at hand was a bucket of fresh water and half a dozen newspapers and magazines  by jinks this is not so bad observed tom we are to have breakfast thats certain  and reading to occupy our spare time added sam  dick however looked at the layout with a fallen face i dont like it he said this looks too much as if the captain and the others meant to keep us here for some time  i suppose thats so came from tom and then he too looked crestfallen  well let us make the best of it said sam and began to eat and the others did the same since time seemed no object they ate slowly in the meantime reviewing the situation from every possible standpoint but without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion  they had allowed their watches to run down so there was no telling what time it was but at last a faint streak of sunshine coming through a seam in the deck told that it must be near noon yet no one came near them and all was as silent close at hand as a tomb although in the distance they heard an occasional steam whistle or other sound common to a great city  there was nothing in the hold by which to reach the hatchway but growing weary of waiting tom dragged a box hither and asked dick and sam to stand upon it then he climbed on their shoulders to find his head directly against the beams of the deck he pushed with all of his strength on the hatch to find it battened down on the outside  stumped he cried laconically and leaped to the floor of the hold we are prisoners and no mistake  after this they went back to the door leading to the cabin but this likewise could not be moved and in the end they sat down a good deal discouraged  it was well toward night when they heard a noise at the door as they leaped up expecting to see the baxters or captain langless the barrier opened and the cook of the schooner appeared backed up by two of the sailors the cook had another trayful of food which he passed to dick in silence taking the other tray in exchange  where is captain langless asked tom  cant come now answered the cook  then send the baxters here  they cant come either  have they gone ashore questioned dick  i cant answer any questions and the cook started to back out  who is in charge we must see somebody  i am in charge said a rough voice and now the mate of the schooner thrust himself forward you had better be quiet until the capn gits back  then he has gone ashore  yes if you must know  and the baxters with him  yes but all hands will be back soon  are we in detroit harbor  yes  then im for escaping shouted tom and taking up the water pitcher he aimed it at the mates head the blow struck fairly and the sailor went down partly stunned seeing the success of his move tom leaped for the passageway and dick and sam followed their brother     chapter xiv  dick makes his escape   there are times when a movement made on the spur of the moment is more successful than one which is premeditated the enemy is taken completely off guard and does not realize what is happening until it is over  it was so in the present instance the mate of the peacock was a tough customer and a heavybuilt man and the men behind him were also large and none of the three had imagined that the boys would really undertake to combat them  as the mate went down tom leaped directly on top of him thus holding him to the floor for the moment and then struck out for the nearest man hitting him in the chin then dick came to his brothers aid with a blow that reached the sailors ear and he too fell back  but the third man had a second to think and he retaliated by a blow which nearly lifted poor tom off his feet but before he could strike out a second time sam with the nimbleness of a monkey darted in and caught him by one leg dick saw the movement gave the sailor a shove and the tar pitched headlong in the passageway  the opening was now tolerably clear and away went the three boys for the cabin gaining the compartment before any of the men could follow the door to the companion way was open and up the steps they flew with all the speed at their command they heard the sailors yell at them and use language unfit to print but paid no heed their one thought was to put distance between themselves and those who wished to keep them prisoners  stop stop roared the mate stop or it will be the worse for you  i guess we know what we are doing panted tom come on and he caught sam by the arm  the deck gained they gave a hasty look around the schooner was lying at anchor about a hundred yards from shore at a short distance above the busy portion of the city  there ought to be a small boat handy said dick leading the way to the stern  we cant wait for a boat answered sam let us swim for it perhaps somebody will come and pick us up and without further ado he leaped overboard seeing this his brothers did likewise and all three struck out boldly for the nearest dock  it was a risky thing to do with all their clothing on but each was a good swimmer and the weather had made the water very warm on they went keeping as closely together as possible  are you coming back furiously yelled the mate as he reached the rail and shook his fist at them  to this none of the boys made reply  if you dont come back ill shoot at you went on the man  do you think he will shoot asked sam in alarm  no answered dick we are too close to the city and there are too many people who would hear the shot  a boat is putting off from the shore said tom a second later it contains three persons  captain langless and the baxters burst out dick dive and swim as hard as you can down the stream  all promptly dove and the weight of their clothing kept them under as long as they pleased to remain when they came up they heard the mate yelling frantically to those in the boat who did not at once comprehend the turn affairs had taken  illustration captain langless caught him by the hair  but when they saw the boys they began to row toward them with all swiftness  we must recapture them cried arnold baxter if they get away our cake will be dough  then row as hard as you can replied captain langless he was at one pair of oars while arnold baxter was at another dan sat in the bow  slowly but surely the craft drew closer to the rover boys until it was less than a hundred feet off then it was seen that the lads had separated and were moving in three directions dick had ordered this  if we separate they wont catch all of us were his words and whoever escapes can inform the authorities  on pushed the boys striving as never before to gain the shore before the rowboat should come up to them  the small craft headed first for tom and presently it glided close to him he promptly dove but when he came up captain langless caught him by the hair  its no use lad said the captain firmly and despite his struggles hauled him on board  let me go roared tom and kicked out lively but the captain continued to hold him down while arnold baxter now headed the boat toward sam  sam was almost exhausted for the weight of his wet garments was beginning to tell upon him as the rowboat came closer he also thought to dive but the effort almost cost him his life he came up half unconscious and only realized in a dim uncertain way what was happening  but the capture of tom and his younger brother had taken time and now those in the rowboat saw that dick was almost to shore to take him therefore was out of the question  well have to let him go said captain langless the quicker the peacock gets out of this the better  yes but if he gets away hell make the ship no end of trouble returned arnold baxter ive half a mind to fire at him and he drew a pistol  no no i wont have it cried the captain sternly to the schooner and the quicker the better  holding tom he made the baxters turn the boat about and row to the peacock the mate was waiting for him and it did not take long to get on board the mate wished to explain matters but captain lawless would not listen  another time cadmus he said sharply into the hold with them and see they dont get away again we must up sail and anchor without the loss of a minute that boy who got away is going to make trouble for us  aye aye sir said cadmus and dragged the unfortunates away to the hatch he dropped both down without ceremony and then saw to it that hatch and door were tightly closed and made fast  in a few minutes the anchors were up and the sails hoisted and the peacock was steering straight up lake st clair toward the st clair river to reach lake huron the schooner would have to cover a distance of seventyfive to eighty miles and the captain wondered if this could be done ere the authorities got on their track  once on lake huron we will be safe enough he observed to arnold baxter i know the lake well and know of half a dozen islands near the canadian shore where we will be safe in hiding  but that boy may telegraph to st clair or port huron or some other point and have the peacock held up answered arnold baxter  weve got to run that risk was the grim reply if we get caught ill have an account to settle with cadmus  a while later the mate and the sailors who had been with him were called into the cabin so that captain langless might hear what they had to say the mate told a long story of how the boys had broken open the door leading to the cabin with a crowbar obtained from he knew not where and had fought them with the bar and with a club and a pistol there had been a fierce struggle but the lads had slipped away like eels the sailors corroborated the mates tale and added that the boys had fought like demons  ill fix them for that said arnold baxter when he heard the account theyll find out who is master before i get through with them  but this did not suit captain langless who had not forgotten his talk with the rovers at the dinner table if it looked as if he was going to be cornered he thought that a compromise with tom and sam would come in very handy  you mustnt mistreat the boys he said when cadmus and the other sailors were gone it wont help your plot any and it will only cause more trouble  you seem to be taking the affair out of my hands growled arnold baxter  i know i am running a larger risk than you answered the captain i own this craft and if she is confiscated ill be the loser  but see what i have offered you  yes if we win out as the saying goes but things wont be so nice if we lose will they  i dont intend to lose i have a scheme on hand for getting to lake huron before tomorrow morning  by what means  hire a large and swift tug to haul the peacock we can make splendid time considering that the schooner is without a cargo  who is going to pay the towing bill  how much will it be  the kind of tug you want will cost about fifty dollars  all right then ill pay the bill  the idea pleased the captain and the bargain was struck then and there  half an hour later a tug was sighted and hailed and the captain told a story of a rush job waiting for him at port huron a bargain was struck for the towing and soon a hawser was cast over to the schooner and the race for lake huron began     chapter xv  what the lame man knew   dick was not aware that his brothers had been captured until some hours after the sailing of the schooner he headed for a part of the river where several small craft were moving about and was just about to climb up the spiling of one of the docks when a lighter hit him and knocked him senseless  weve struck a boy shouted a man on the lighter and then rushed forward with a boathook as soon as he caught sight of dick he fished the youth from the water and hurried ashore with him  the shock had not been a heavy one but the lad was weak from swimming with his clothes on and he lay like a log on the flooring of the dock this alarmed the men from the lighter and they hastily carried him to a nearby drug store and summoned a doctor from the drug store he was removed to the hospital  when he was strong enough to go about his business he found it was night yet he lost no time in making his way to the docks on a search for his brothers  the search was of course useless and much depressed in spirits he found himself at sunrise on the waterfront seated on the stringpiece of one of the long piers  they must have either been captured or drowned he mused dismally and the peacock is gone too what shall i do next  it was far from an easy question to answer and he sat motionless for the best part of half an hour reviewing the situation then he leaped up  i must get the authorities to aid me he thought i should have done this before  he walked along the docks until he came to a street leading to the nearest police station he now realized that he was hungry but resolved to postpone eating until he had put the authorities on the track of the evildoers  as he was turning a corner he almost ran into a colored man going in the opposite direction the colored man stared at him then let out a wild cry of delight  massah dick or is i dreamin  aleck by all thats wonderful where did you come from  from de yacht ob course massah dick butbutdis knocks dis niggah suah i dun fink yo was on dat udder ship  i was on it but i escaped yesterday while the schooner lay in the river yonder  an where am tom and sam sah  that i dont know they left the vessel with me but we became separated in the water  perhaps da dun been cotched agin and pops face took on a sober look  that is what i am afraid of  didnt see nuffin ob em nowhere  no i was hit by a lighter and knocked senseless  whars dat dar peacock  gone too  wot you spects to do  i was going to inform the authorities we must find tom and sam  dats right sah  where is the swallow  tied up jest below heah sah dat dar luke peterson is asailin ob her wid me  good perhaps he can help us in the search he knows these waters well so he told me  together the pair made their way to the police station where they told their stories to the officer in charge  an alarm was at once sent out and the river police were set to work to learn what had become of the peacock and her crew  but all this took time and it was past noon when word came in that the schooner had been seen moving up lake st clair on the afternoon of the day before  then word was telegraphed to port huron to stop the craft and on his own responsibility dick offered a reward of one hundred dollars for the capture of ship and master  but all this came too late losing no time captain langless had had his craft towed to a point fifteen miles beyond port huron and had then let the tug go and steered a course known only to those on board  the tug did not return to port huron until the next day and its captain did not know how much the peacock was wanted until twentyfour hours later thus the schooner obtained a free and clear start of thirtysix hours over those who were in pursuit  we are stumped groaned dick when word came back from port huron that the peacock had passed that point long before that schooner now has the whole of lake huron before her and there is no telling where she will go perhaps the baxters will land in canada  i dont think so answered luke peterson american vessels coming inshore are closely watched you know on account of the smuggling that is carried on  then the smugglers between the united states and canada are still at work  indeed they are more so than the average american has any idea of i used to be in the customs service and i know  where do you suppose captain langless will go to  ah thats a question rover the lake is over two hundred miles long and ive heard tell that there are over twentyfive hundred islands large and small thats a pretty good place for a ship to hide in eh  and you reckon the peacock will go into hiding  more than likely while these baxters carry out their little game that is providing your brothers are on boardand i fancy they are i can tell ye i fancy they are a tough crowd all around  well one comfort the peacock wont get very far anywhere along shore without being spotted for the police have sent the news to all principal places  well thats a good plan now if we could only follow that schooner up  will you go with me in a hunt i will willingly pay you for your services  i will but we ought to have a steam tug instead of a yacht  i will charter one i have already telegraphed to my father for the necessary funds returned dick and he told the truth the long telegram had gone an hour before he had also sent word to larry colby telling of the turn of affairs  the telegram to mr rover brought a characteristic reply running as follows  i send you the money you want be careful and keep out of danger will come on by the first train  the message to larry colby brought that student up to detroit on the first train from sandusky  i know just the steam tug you want said larry when the situation was explained it is rum by old jack parsons who knows my father well i know he will do all he can for you if he is paid for his time  larry colby undertook to hunt up the tug which was named the rocket and found her tied up at one of the city docks he introduced dick and before the hour was out a bargain was struck with jack parsons which was satisfactory all around parsons knew luke peterson and said he would be glad to have the lumberman along on the hunt  he knows this lake as well as i do and between us we ought to find the peacock sooner or later said parsons he had heard about the raft disaster on lake erie and was pleased to be able to inform peterson that his friend bragin was safe the tug however which had been towing the raft was laid up in buffalo for repairs  at first dick thought to remain in detroit until his fathers arrival but then he realized that it would be best for one of them to remain on shore while the other went on the hunt on the lake  we will sail at once he said to his companions but this could not be since aleck had not yet provided all of the necessary provisions for the trip  while the colored man was completing his arrangements a newsboy came to dick with a note running as follows  if you want news of the peacock and will promise not to harm me come with the boy to the old grain elevator the boy knows the place  dick read the note with interest and then showed it to peterson  perhaps its a trap said the lumberman i wouldnt go alone if i were you  i will go answered dick but i wish you would follow me up on the quiet and so it was arranged  when dick reached the place mentioned he found it practically deserted  who gave you that note he asked of the newsboy  a man here he comes now  the newcomer proved to be a lame man who had in former years been a sailor he lived in a shanty behind the grain elevator and he came to dick with difficulty  come into my shanty and ill tell you what i know said the lame man ill not hurt you so dont be afraid and he hobbled off again  waving his hand to peterson who was in the distance dick followed the lame man and sat down on a bench in front of the shanty the odd individual seating himself on a stool opposite  want to find captain gus langless eh said the lame man closing one eye suggestively  yes  i read of the case in the papers hes a bad un eh  what do you know of the case demanded dick impatiently he realized that he had a decidedly queer individual with whom to deal  know everything yes sir everything jock pelly dont keep his ears open for nothing not me an i said to myself when i read the papers jock youve learned something of valueyou must sell the news says i to myself  but what do you know  gettin to that sir gettin there fast too did you offer a reward of a hundred dollars  yes  whos going to pay that amount its a pile of money a hundred dollars is  it will be paid you can be easy on that point  well supposin a man is lame and cant go after those rascals what does he git for puttin somebody on the track  if you put me on the right track ill give you fifty dollars  dead certain  yes now where has the peacock gone to  needle point island was the abrupt answer go there an youll find the peacock and her crew sure     chapter xvi  off for needle point island   needle point island repeated dick  exactly sirneedle point island most of the lake pilots know it  how far is it from here  about sixty miles  and how do you know the peacock has gone there  overheard captain langless talking about it yes siroverheard him talking to a man named baxter and a man named grimsbyhe as used to be a smuggler langless used to be in with grimsby although few know o that they talked a lot but that wouldnt interest you but the fact that they are goin to needle point island interests you eh  when did you hear this talk  the morning you escaped from the schooner accordin to the newspaper  where did you hear it  up on the other side of the elevator the men came out of one o the saloons to talk it over  a long conversation followed and dick became more than half convinced that what jock pelly had to relate was true  the man described the baxters clearly showing that he had really seen the pair and also described captain langless appearance on the morning in question  i will follow up this clew dick said when ready to depart  jock pelly caught the youth by the arm  hold on  what do you want now  my reward dont i get that fifty dollars  you do if i catch the captain and his schooner  that aint fairi ought to have the money now  i must prove what you have told me first you may be all wrong in your suppositions  jock pellys face fell  taint fairi ought to have the money now maybe you wont ever come back  dont alarm yourself my man if the information is of real value youll get paid for it here is something on account  dick slipped a fivedollar bill into the old mans hand at which jock pellys face relaxed a few minutes later the elder rover had joined luke peterson and was telling the lumberman what he had heard  needle point island exclaimed peterson yes i know the spot years ago it was a great hangingout place for smugglers but our government cleaned out the nest  then it is likely that this man told the truth  i dont know as captain langless could find a better hiding place the island is in the shape of a fiveleaf clover and the bays are all surrounded with tall trees and bushes so that a vessel could be hidden there without half trying besides that the island is a rough one full of caves and openings and that would just suit a crowd holding those boys prisoners  when the pair reached the rocket a consultation was held and it was decided to start for needle point island on the following morning jack parsons said it would take from five to six hours to reach the locality  now that dick had received what he thought was definite information he was anxious to go to the island that had been mentioned consequently the night proved a long and sleepless one to him he awaited further news from his father but none came  but information did come which disturbed him not a little he was speaking to larry before retiring and from one thing to another the conversation drifted around to mrs stanhope the widow who lived near putnam hall and her pretty daughter dora as old readers know dick was tremendously interested in pretty dora and had done much to keep her from harm  before i came on i heard that the stanhopes had started on a trip for the lakes said larry they left cedarville secretly and i got the news quite by accident from frank harrington who happened to see them off  i knew they were going sooner or later replied dick mrs stanhope was rather ill as you know and needed a change of some sort  i was wondering if she didnt want to get out of the way of josiah crabtree who is just out of prison continued larry oh but wasnt he a slick one for getting around the widowwhen he learned she was holding all that money in trust for dora  hes something of a hypnotist larrythat is why dora fears him she is afraid he will hypnotize her mother into doing something she will be sorry for afterward  do you really suppose he has so much influence as that  he has when mrs stanhope is not feeling well the stronger she is the less he seems to affect her by the way have you heard from old crabtree since he was let out of jail  yes some of us boys met him at ithaca one saturday we started to have a little fun with him asking him why he didnt come back to the hall and ask captain putnam for another position and how he liked live crabs in his bed but he flew in a rage and threatened to have us all arrested if we didnt clear out so we had to drop it but ill tell you one thing dick ill wager crabtrees up to no good  oh he might possibly turn over a new leaf  not he it isnt in him he was always a sneak like baxter only a bit more hightoned outwardly  i am anxious to know if he is aware where the stanhopes have gone to  i think he could find out if he tried hard they made a mistake that they didnt go traveling before he got out of jail  they couldnt go on account of mrs stanhopes health she had a relapse just about the time crabtrees term was up but he had better not bother them again or  or what dick will you get after him again  i will if i can and ill send him to jail for the rest of his life  the rocket was to sail at six in the morning and long before that time dick and larry with the others were on board jack parsons reached the tug at the last moment having had some private business which required his attention  the day was fair with a stiff breeze blowing which was good for the peacock as dick observed if she was still sailing the waters of the lake  jack parsons knew needle point island as well as did luke peterson and the former said he had stopped at the place only a few months before  i thought it was deserted he said the old cave the smugglers used to use was tumbled in and overgrown with brush  the run to port huron occurred without incident and a little while later the rocket was steaming merrily over the clear waters of lake huron  had it not been for his anxiety concerning his two brothers dick would have enjoyed the scene very much the rocket was a fine tug and cut the water like a thing of life she carried a crew of five all young and active fellows this made the party eight all told and as dick and his friends were armed and the tug boasted of several pistols a gun and a small cannon those on board felt themselves able to cope with the enemy no matter what occurred  we cant get there any too soon for me said dick to luke peterson there is no telling how cruelly sam and tom are being treated now that they made the attempt to run away  i hope your father doesnt give the rascals any money before we have a chance to catch them returned the lumberman  i think he will wait to hear from me after he reads the letter i left for him at detroit he is as down on the baxters as i am  when we come in sight of the island well have to move with caution went on the lumberman if we dont captain langless may lay low and give us the slip in the dark  are there any other islands close to needle point  a dozen of them and some with just as good hiding places too thats why the smugglers used to hang out in that locality they are ideal places for smugglers caves and the like i can tell ye that and luke peterson nodded his head sagaciously  at noon parsons announced that they were within three miles of needle point island dinner was ready but it must be confessed that dick was almost too excited to eat half a dozen vessels had thus far been sighted but not one which looked like the peacock  he was finishing up a hasty repast when a cry came from the deck  needle point island is in sight announced the lookout and a moment later he added a schooner bearing away to the bay on the east end  it must be the peacock ejaculated dick and rushed to the deck to learn the truth     chapter xvii  a cave and a snake   now we are in for it sam they wont give us a second chance to escape  a groan was the answer coming from out of the darkness of the hold of the peacock sam was too much stunned and bruised to reply to the words from his brother  the two boys had been hustled on board of the schooner with scant ceremony and now they found themselves bound and handcuffed so that it was next to impossible for either of them to move hour after hour had passed yet nobody had come near them  i reckon they are going to starve us to death for what we did went on tom after a long pause  if only i had a drink of water came at last from his younger brother my mouth is as dry as a chip and i seem to have a regular fever  make the best of it sam returned tom soothingly this state of things cant last forever if theyoh  the schooner had suddenly tacked in the strong wind and the bowling over of the empty craft had caused tom to take a long roll he struck up against his brother and the pair went sliding to the end of the hold to hit a jug of water which had been left there in the darkness  hurrah some water cried tom as some of the fluid splashed over his hand but alas how were they to get at what was left of the contents of the jug with their hands tied behind them  but time was no object and at last they solved the problem at first tom backed up to the jug and held it though clumsily for sam to drink and then the youngest rover did the same for his brother the water was warm and somewhat stale yet both could remember nothing which had ever tasted sweeter to them they drank about half of what the jug contained then set the rest carefully away for future use  the peacock was bowling along at a speed of seven or eight knots an hour and the creaking of the blocks attested the fact that captain langless was making every effort to reach his destination as soon as possible  once the boys heard somebody at the forward hatchway and presently the hatch was lifted for a few inches  hope you are enjoying yourselves down there came in the sarcastic tones of dan baxter to this they made no answer and the hatch was closed as quickly as it had been opened  the brute muttered tom id give a good deal to be able to punch his nose  he evidently thinks himself on top to stay came from sam who had propped himself up against an empty cask oh if only we knew what had become of dick he went on  dick must have escaped i dont see how it could be otherwise  but if he did why didnt he notify the authorities  the peacock must have given the river police the slip thats the only answer i can make sam  but they could have telegraphed to different points  well i cant make it out and well have to take what comes  where do you suppose we are bound  i havent the least idea  hour after hour went by and still nobody came to them it did indeed look as if they were to be starved to death but just as sam was almost fainting for the want of food the door to the cabin passageway was flung open and captain langless appeared with a lantern followed by arnold baxter who carried a tray containing a plate of bread and two bowls of beef stew  hungry ill wager said the captain laconically all the pleasantness he had previously exhibited had vanished  you ought to be ashamed of yourselves to let us starve so long replied tom who never hesitated to speak his mind  hi dont talk that way or you shall have nothing cried arnold baxter we are masters and you must understand it so  the captain set down the lantern and released the right hand of each of the prisoners then the tray was set upon an upturned box and they were told to eat what they wanted the captain and arnold baxter sitting down to watch them  there was no use to stand upon then dignity as tom afterward expressed it so they fell to without protest and it must be confessed that the stew was just what their stomachs in that weakened state needed it did not take long to get away with the larger portion of the bread and all of what the bowls contained  you can thank your stars that you got meal said arnold baxter you dont deserve it  according to you i suppose we dont deserve anything but abuse replied tom but never mind arnold baxter remember the old saying he laughs best who laughs last  im not here to listen to your back talk growled arnold baxter come captain let us be going and he arose  youve brought this treatment on yourselves said the captain with a shrewd look into the boys faces i was of a mind to treat you kindly before you know that  come insisted arnold baxter and caught the captain by the arm dont waste words on them there will be time enough to talk when we reach the island and then the two walked off closing and locking the passageway door after them  the island repeated sam then they intend to take us to some lonely island tom  i wouldnt be surprised ive noticed by the shafts of light coming through the cracks overhead that we are sailing northward we must be in lake huron by this time  one satisfaction they left our right hands free continued the youngest rover and i must say that stew just touched the spot  again the hours drifted slowly by the boys had really lost all track of time they dozed off and did not awaken until some time later whether they had slept through a night or not they did not know  presently they heard the sails being lowered and an anchor go overboard then a boat put off from the peacock and for a while all became silent  we must be close to some landing was toms comment perhaps its the island old baxter mentioned  another half hour slipped by then the door to the cabin was opened and both baxters captain langless and the mate of the schooner appeared  get up ordered the captain and when they arose he saw to it that their lower limbs were released but that their hands were bound more tightly behind them than ever  we are going ashore said arnold baxter remember we want no treachery nor any attempt to run away if you try either somebody will get shot  with this caution they were marched into the cabin and then on deck at first the strong light blinded them but soon they became accustomed to this and made out a small bay just ahead surrounded by cedar trees and various bushes back of the trees was a hill and off to the southward a rocky elevation ending in a needlelike point it was this elevation which gave to the island the name of needle point by the indians of days gone by the island was called arrow head  a rowboat was in waiting beside the peacock and into this the prisoners were placed the captain of the schooner and the baxters also went along and soon the rowboat had passed over the waters of the little bay and grounded on a bit of shelving beach  now well go ashore said captain langless and glad enough for the change tom and sam leaped upon the beach the others followed and tying up the boat the master of the peacock led the way through the trees and brush to the hill previously mentioned here there was a slight path winding in and out among a series of rocks  where are you going to take us said tom  youll find out soon enough returned arnold baxter march  supposing i refuse  well knock you down and drag you along put in dan baxter anxious to say something  you had better come along quietly said captain langless to kick will only make you worse off  the march was resumed and now they dove straight into the interior of the island which was about a mile and a half long and half as wide at some points the path was choked with weeds and trailing vines and they progressed with difficulty  it must be admitted that tom and sam were very uneasy they had felt that the authorities might follow the peacock but how would anybody ever discover them in such a lonely place as this but there was no help for it and on they went until captain langless called a sudden halt  they had gained a cliff running out from one end of the hill the rocks arose in a sheer wall thirty or more feet in height at the base were a spring and a small pool of water to the left of the spring was a cavelike opening partly choked with brushwood  here we are said the captain watch them  he moved toward the opening and soon had a portion of the brushwood torn aside then he lit a lantern he had brought along and disappeared into the opening  he had scarcely passed from view when he let out a yell of fright  a snake look out for him  the words just reached the ears of sam and tom when the reptile appeared he was all of five feet long and as thick as a mans wrist  a snake screamed dan baxter and took to his heels without waiting to see what the creature might do  arnold baxter was less frightened and snatching a pistol from his pocket he took hasty aim and fired but his aim was poor and the bullet flew wide of its mark  the snake was a dangerous one and very much shot and came straight for tom and sam an instant later the savage reptile was coiling itself around the youngest rovers left leg     chapter xviii  coffee for three   the situation was one which demanded instant action  the snake was a dangerous one and very much aroused and it might at any instant do sam great harm  the poor boy was speechless and motionless for the reptile had caught his eye and held him as by a spell  it was tom who acted heedless of the danger he leaped forward and aimed a kick at the snakes head  the reptile was caught fairly and squarely and the head went down with an angry hiss then tom stepped upon it but the snake squirmed loose and uttered another hiss louder than before  take him off take him off screamed sam now recovering his voice dont let him bite me  he would have caught the snake himself and so would tom but the hands of both were still tied behind them  by this time captain langless emerged from the cave pulling out a pistol as he did so  arnold baxter had not offered to fire a second shot now he was out of danger himself he did not seem to care what became of the rovers  crack crack it was the captains weapon which spoke up and the two shots fired in rapid succession did their work thoroughly the first took the snake in the neck and the second in the head and in a twinkle the long slippery body unwound itself from sams leg and began to turn and twist on the ground  good for you gasped sam when able to speak again ugh what an ugly thing and he retreated to the opposite side of the pool along with tom  he was a nasty one replied captain langless as he coolly proceeded to reload his pistol i might have killed him in the cave only the light was bad  is hehe dead came from behind some rocks and dan showed a white face and trembling form  yes hes dead answered arnold baxter i came pretty close to hitting him he went on bound to say something for himself  ii thought there was a whole nest of them continued dan if i had known there was only one i would have stood my ground  of courseyou always were brave answered tom sarcastically  see here tom rover i dont want any of your back talk howled the bully his face turning red  come dont quarrel now said captain langless so sternly that dan subsided on the instant the question is are there any more snakes in that cave  send dan in to investigate suggested sam with just the faintest touch of his oldtime lightheartedness  me ejaculated the individual mentioned not me i wouldnt go in there for a million dollars  perhaps we had better find some other cave said arnold baxter you said there were several around here  this is as good as any answered captain langless if you are afraid ill go in myself and turning he disappeared once more into the opening lantern in one hand and pistol in the other  he was gone the best part of quarter of an hour and came back covered with dust and dirt  the old spot is pretty well choked up with rubbish he said but there isnt a sign of another snake around nor of any wild beasts come and he motioned sam and tom to follow him  i dont think it fair that you should leave us helpless said tom at least untie our hands and let us each get a good stick  so you can fight us eh cried arnold baxter we are not such fools  you have your pistols put in sam and what could we do on a lonely island and without a boat  the lads are rightits not fair to leave them helpless when there may be other danger at hand interposed the captain if i unloosen you will you promise not to run away  the promise would not amount to anything sniffed dan  we wont run away for the present said tom honestly but you cant expect me to remain a prisoner herenot if i can help myself  the candor of the youth compelled captain langless to laugh and taking out a knife he cut the ropes which bound the lads hands  you wont need sticks i am sure of it he said come i will lead and younodding to the baxterscan bring up the rear  no more was said and in a minute more all were inside of the cave which proved to be fifteen feet wide about as high and at least two hundred feet long at the lower end were a turn and a narrow passageway leading to the darkness beyond the ceiling was rough and the lantern cast long dancing shadows over it as they advanced sam could not help but shiver and tom looked unusually sober  that the cave had once been used as a rendezvous of some sort was plainly evident at the back was a rude fireplace with a narrow slit in the rocks overhead through which the smoke might ascend here were several halfburned logs of wood and two tumbledown boxes which had evidently done duty as benches on a stick stuck in a crack of the wall hung an old overcoat now ready to fall apart from decay  rather unwholesome i admit said the captain with a glance at the others but a roaring fire in yonder chimneyplace will soon alter things and when ive had one of the men bring some blankets and stores from the peacock it will be fairly comfortable  do you mean to keep us here demanded tom  we do answered arnold baxter and you can thank your stars that you have not been taken to a worse place  its a jolly shame why dont you kill us off at once and be done with it  because you are worth more to us alive than dead  we wont live long if you keep us here put in sam its enough to give a fellow the ague  we will start a fire without delay said the captain and then turning to arnold baxter he continued can you find the way back to the ship  i think i can returned the other years ago i was used to tramping the gold regions of the west  then you had better go and tell the mate to bring along that stuff i mentioned before i left you can easily carry the stuff between you ill build the fire and with the aid of your son watch the two prisoners  so it was arranged although arnold baxter did not fancy the task of carrying stuff to be used for the rovers comfort he left his pistol with dan who kept it in his hand ready to shoot should sam or tom make the slightest movement toward getting away  as captain langless had said the fire made the cave far more comfortable taking away the feeling of dampness and lighting up all the nooks and corners from a distance the boys heard a faint falling of water and were told that it came from a spring hidden at the rear passageway  it was a good hour before arnold baxter returned lugging a fairsized bundle and followed by the mate of the peacock with an even greater load they had several blankets and a basket of provisions and likewise a few cooking utensils  evidently out for a stay muttered tom as he looked at the things  they are for your use was captain langless grim reply after this i reckon youll cook for yourselves  do you expect us to remain in this cave night and day  youll remain whenever things look suspicious outside  then youll let us go out otherwise  if you behave yourselves  it was not long before tom and sam were left in the cave alone the mate of the schooner was placed at the entrance on guard armed with the captains own pistol then captain langless and the baxters withdrew talking earnestly tom and sam could not catch the drift of the conversation although they heard the words by mail and we must get the cash used several times  they are bound to make money out of this affair if they can remarked tom when he and sam were alone once more  ive a good mind to knock that mate down and take the pistol from him said sam  and get shot for your pains besides if we took away the pistol and put him out of the fight what next we havent any boat to get away in  yes but i dont intend to remain here a prisoner forever  no more do i but we can do nothing just now let us see what kind of a meal we can make out of the provisions brought to us  the prospect of a meal brightened up both lads and they set to work with a will and soon had coffee made there were bread and butter and some canned beef and beans and they ate heartily  the mate sniffed the coffee and remarked that it seemed good  have a cup said tom cheerily  no funny work boy and cadmus looked at the boys suspiciously no break like that you tried on me before  no i wont run honor bright answered tom and then the mate took the coffee and drank it with much satisfaction  as he set down the cup he gazed fixedly at both tom and sam for several seconds then he drew himself up as if he had come to some mental decision  ive got a plan to propose he said slowly do you want to listen or not  what sort of a plan asked both  a plan to get you out of the clutches of captain langless and those baxters was the answer which filled tom and sam with deep and sudden interest     chapter xix  an astonishing discovery   are you willing to help us to get away cried sam  under certain circumstances i am replied the mate of the schooner captain langless didnt treat me square after you got away from me and andy cadmus aint the tar to forget such a thing in a hurry  what are your conditions asked tom  the conditions are two in number in the first place if i help you will you promise in case the plan falls through that you will not tell captain langless what i did but let him believe that you got away on your own hook  well promise that readily enough answered tom and sam nodded  in the second place if i get you away from them and see you to a place of safety will you promise to help clear me in case those others are brought to trial  we will came from both  is that all you want continued tom  almost but there is one other condition i forgot to mention  i know what that is said sam its money  correct lad its money im a poor man and what little i have is on board the peacock your father is rich if i help you it ought to be worth something to him  how much asked tom cautiously  well say a couple of hundred dollars i wont ask for too much  you shall have the money answered tom quickly on condition you will aid us in bringing the baxters to justice  then its a bargain and andy cadmus drew another long breath now for the details of our plan  the mate sat down on a stone at the mouth of the cave and filled a pipe with tobacco lit it and fell to smoking thoughtfully  the details ought to be simple enough said tom when you go back to the peacock you can take one of the small boats stock her with provisions and then go off in her then we can join you  it wont work unless you have a fight with whoever happens to be on guard hereand that may mean trouble for you i have a better scheme  whats that  tonight when im on watch ill stock one of the small boats and take her to shore and hide her in the bushes then when im on guard again here we can all cut sticks and take to the little boat  will you carry out the plan tonight asked sam  if i can  so it was arranged and then the three talked over the details cadmus said it was a good tern miles to the nearest point of the mainland but that he was certain he could steer almost a straight course thither  a couple of hours later one of the sailors from the peacock came up all out of breath and told the mate to return to the schooner with all speed  the capn wants ye he said but would not explain why  whats the trouble asked tom when the sailor was on guard but the newcomer refused to talk about the affair further than to say that he guessed cadmus would not be back to do additional sentinel duty  if thats the case our plan to escape is knocked in the head whispered sam as he and tom withdrew to the fire was ever there luck before  i move we try to escape without further delay returned tom he was in a reckless mood  shall we tackle the guard  let us try a bit of strategy and then the pair held a whispered consultation lasting several minutes  returning to the mouth of the cave tom took up his position at one side and sam on the other talking of things in general at first they gradually put the sailor in good humor and then turned on the subject of snakes  that was a bad snake we killed said tom i sincerely hope there are no more around the cave  snakes are ugly things said the sailor shaking his head vigorously  ever see a sea serpent questioned sam  no i reckon there aint none on the lakes like there are in the ocean ive got a cousin sails the pacific hes seen serpents lots o timeson the shores of them faroff islands  i dont believe a sea serpent is half as bad as a land snake continued sam why that snake was enough to give a fellow the jim jams he was so long and slimy and had such a bad look in his blazing eyes he wound right around my leg and was just going to strike when my gracious look at that snake behind you  worked up over what sam was relating and totally unconscious of the trick being played upon him the sailor leaped up and turned around as he did this tom came up behind him swiftly and pinioned his arms to his side then sam rushed in and caught hold of the gun  hi stop roared the sailor let go this aint fair nohow  keep still if you dont want to be shot answered tom and he continued to hold the fellow while sam gave the gun a dexterous twist and got it loose then the youngest rover aimed the weapon at the sailors head  up with your hands he said as coolly as he could although his heart was pumping like mad  tom released his hold and fearful of being shot the sailor raised his hands as commanded then tom picked up the ropes still lying near and proceeded to bind the sailors legs together  the fellow wished to yell for help but toms stern glance kept him silent  now what shall we do with him asked sam  carry him into the cave replied his brother somebody else from the schooner is bound to come sooner or later and release him  i dont want to go in with them snakes said the tar leave me out here  there are no more snakes in there said tom well place you close to the fire so youll be comfortable and in no danger of either snakes or wild beasts  with this the boys lugged the sailor into the cave they wasted no time for there was no telling when some others of their enemies might put in an appearance  now which way asked sam when the pair were again outside i wonder how big this island is  big enough for us to hide on i imagine sam let us go in the opposite direction to which we came  they skirted the cliff and then plunged into the woods beyond as they progressed tom cautioned his brother to keep to the rocks as much as possible in order that the trail might be hidden  it was still hot and before long the exertion of climbing the rocks and picking their way through the dense underbrush told upon them coming to the top of a small hill they halted  let us climb into yonder tree and rest said sam perhaps we can see the peacock from that point  this seemed a good idea and they moved to the very top of the tallest tree to be found  a grand view lay spread before their gaze close upon every side was the thickly wooded island sloping gradually down to the lake and beyond as far as eye could reach was the rolling water sparkling brightly in the sunlight to the northward tom discovered a bit of greenery which he rightly took for another island  but what interested them most was the appearance of a ship riding at anchor to the westward in one of the several bays previously mentioned it was a sailing vessel of fair size carrying a single mast  thats not the peacock ejaculated sam  youre right cried tom shes a stranger hurrah perhaps dick has followed us up after all  anyway we ought to find friends on that ship tom let us get to her as soon as possible  im willing but i must rest a bit im so dead tired  i wish we could get those on the strange ship to make the baxters and captain langless prisoners  perhaps we can but it will be a good deal to get out of the clutches of the enemy even if we cant do any more  feeling much elated over the discovery of the strange vessel the boys rested for quarter of an hour and then descending to the ground struck out rapidly once more through the woods and underbrush as they proceeded tom carried his pistol in his hand in case some wild animal might start up in their path but nothing of the sort came to view  as they came closer to the shore they found that the ground was wet and boggy and they had to pick their way with care once sam went into the soil up to his ankles and dragged himself out only with great difficulty then they made a detour coming out on the beach some distance below where the strange ship was anchored  halting behind a convenient bush they surveyed the ship with interest on the deck they discovered a man and a lady the lady was sitting in an easychair and the man stood by leaning on a railing both were talking earnestly  well i never came from tom sam do you recognize those two people  i do was the answer josiah crabtree and mrs stanhope how in the world did they get here  illustration halting behind a convenient bush they surveyed the ship with interest     chapter xx  josiah crabtrees game   for the moment the boys were practically dumfounded josiah crabtree and mrs stanhope in this outoftheway place what could it mean  they are arguing about something said tom after a long pause hear how earnestly old crabtree is talking to her  i wonder if dora is with them   i dont see anything of her  what shall we do  i dont knowexcepting to remain hidden until we learn how the land lays  the boys considered the situation for a while and then by turning back into the woods managed to come up at a point still closer to the ship which rested at anchor close to the trunk of a fallen tree  here they could hear the most of what was being said and could also obtain a fair look at the side of mrs stanhopes face josiah crabtrees back was turned to them they noticed that mrs stanhopes face wore a peculiar drawn expression like that of one who is walking in his sleep  ill wager hes been hypnotizing her again whispered tom oh what a rascal he is just as bad as the baxters every bit  i do not cannot understand it all the lady was saying i thought dora and i were to take this trip alone  it will all be clear to you in a few days pet returned the exschoolteacher soothingly he had lately gotten to calling the lady pet although that was not her real name  where is my child now i do not wish to remain on board without her  she will be back soon do not worry  i thought the trip would do me much good continued the lady with a deep sigh but i am more feeble than ever and i cannot think as clearly as i would wish  it may be that this lake air is too strong for you pet tomorrow we will take a run ashore the village of nestwood is close at hand and i dare say i can find very good accommodations for you there  will dora be with me  perhaps  i do not wish to go ashore without her she always said we would be safe on the boat  and you are safe  but she didnt want me tothat is she didnt expect you to be along  she has changed her mind about that pet i had a long talk with her and proved to her that she had been mistaken in me and that i was not as black as painted  but they put you in jail  all a mistake as i told you before it was the work of those rascally rover boys  i like that muttered tom isnt he a peach though for smoothing matters over  he has hypnotized her beyond a doubt returned sam she would never believe him otherwise  and what did dora say went on mrs stanhope after a pause during which josiah crabtree took a turn up and down the deck  she is perfectly willing that we should marry but under one condition  and what is that  i hardly dare to tell youit is so peculiar she doesnt wish to be present at the ceremony  not present  no she says it would not be right that she very foolishly made a vow never to be present should you marry again and that she must keep that vow she feels her position keenly but she wont break her vow  such a statement would have aroused any ordinary woman but mrs stanhope appeared to be completely in josiah crabtrees power and all she did now was to draw a long sigh and then wipe away a tear which stole down her pallid face  i do not think it right that i should marry without dora being present  pooh if the girl wishes to remain away let her do so she will soon come to her senses and be glad of the way matters have turned  you do not know dora she is veryvery headstrong at times  yes i do know her pet she is headstrong and greatly influenced by those rover boysespecially by dick rover who seems to beahem somewhat smitten with her  dick always impressed me as being a good youth  good he is anything but that why if it wasnt for the rovers i would now have the finest boarding school for boys on cayuga lake they spoiled all the plans i ever made but they shall do so no longer they cross my path again at their peril  the tragic old fraud whispered tom ive a good mind to face him just where he stands  go slow we dunt know who is on board of that ship  evidently friends to crabtree or they wouldnt let him hypnotize doras mother  where can dora be  that remains to be found out  i wonder where that ship hails from  one of the lake towns she is an old vessel there is the name wellington that sounds as if she might be a canadian  perhaps crabtree got both of them into canada and then cast dora adrift  there was now a stir on the ship and a fat old sailor came on deck  how long you say we stay in dees island hey he asked in a strong frenchcanadian accent  we will sail as soon as the sun goes down answered josiah crabtree  i no lak to stay here went on the sailor you no pay for to stay here  i will pay you for your full time answered the exschoolteacher smoothly do not worry on that account  you go on de land hey  i think not we shall set sail for nestwood as i told you before  is dora at nestwood questioned mrs stanhope  i expect to meet her there but she may not show up until after the wedding my dear  it is very very strange and mrs stanhope sighed again  the fat old sailor now went below again and after a few words more with mrs stanhope josiah crabtree followed  now is our chance whispered tom you stay here and ill try to have a talk with mrs stanhope in secret  so speaking tom crawled out upon the fallen tree trunk until he could reach a rope hanging over the wellingtons side then he drew himself up silently  oh cried mrs stanhope on catching sight of him is it really you tom rover  hush mrs stanhope not so loud he replied hastily i dont want to let josiah crabtree know i am here  but where did you come from  from the island its a long story i am here with sam  it is very strange but many things of late have been strange  may i ask how you happen to be here  that too is a long story i was to take a trip with dora for the benefit of my health but on the way to the lakes dora disappeared and mr crabtree turned up in her placeand he has been with me ever since  he wants to marry you doesnt he  yes he has always wished that as you know  i wouldnt do it he is after your money and that is all he is a fraud and everybody knows it  mrs stanhope passed her hand over her brow toms blunt words did much to counteract josiah crabtrees strange influence over her  your words impress me deeply she faltered dora talks that way too butbutmr crabtree when he is with me makes me think so differently she tried to get up then sank back in her seat and i am so weak physically  dont alarm yourself mrs stanhope if you need a friend ill stand by youand so will sam  where is dick you boys are always together  i dont know where he is at present we were carried off by the baxters who are not far off  the baxters oh i am afraid of those peoplemore afraid than i ever was of mr crabtree  they are certainly more daring but no worse morally than crabtree tom ran his hand through his curly hair in perplexity who is aboard of this boat  mr crabtree and myself two sailors and one of the sailors wives who has been waiting on me  not a very large crowd  mr crabtree said he did not wish too many along  how long have you been here on the lake  several days i did not wish to go but but  he has an influence over you  yes a strange influence i cannot understand oh i am so wretched and the lady suddenly burst into tears  dont please dont said tom all sympathy at once its crabtrees work and he shant harm you ill see you safe back to dora and home  will you she demanded eagerly i do not wish to marry unless dora is pleased she said  mrs stanhope got no further for at that instant josiah crabtree reappeared on deck his astonishment at seeing tom can better be imagined than described     chapter xxi  tom brings one enemy to terms   am i dreaming gasped the former schoolteacher when he could command his voice sufficiently to speak  you might better be dreaming josiah crabtree replied tom eying the man sharply this is a bad business you are engaged in  where did you come from  none of your business  dont be impertinent young man  then dont try to pry into my private affairs  have you been following this boat questioned crabtree nervously  never mind what ive been doing i have found you out and that appears to be a good job done  found me out what do you mean to insinuate by that  i mean that you are up to no good thats what i mean mr josiah crabtree a m  you are very very  dont try to abuse me it wont work i want to know what you propose to do with mrs stanhope  that is my affairor rather it is the affair of that lady and myselfand does not concern such a scamp as you  oh josiah i do not think tom is a scamp broke in mrs stanhope in a pleading voice  he is a scamp and worse pet allow me to deal with him alone  so you thought to elope with mrs stanhope went on tom sarcastically to elope without dora being the wiser  ha what do you know of dora ejaculated the man starting back in alarm  i know a good deal  has sheahem followed me  would that surprise you  it iservery extraordinary crabtree cleared his throat ithat iswhere is she now and he looked around  i told you i wasnt answering questions but you had better take my advice and go slow or youll soon find yourself in jail again  you must have followed us in a boat where is your craft  another question which i am not answering do you surrender  surrender  that is what i said  ierdont understand  the case is very simple you ran off with mrs stanhope influencing her against her will to accompany you your game is to marry her so that you can get hold of the money she is holding in trust for dora   it is false  it is the plain truth josiah crabtree you are a trickster of the first water but if i can prevent your trickery i am going to do it tom turned to mrs stanhope who was now crying violently wont you go below and let me have it out with this man  oh i trust there will be no violence she sobbed  i shall teach this young upstart a lesson fumed josiah crabtree he saw that toms coming had greatly lessened his influence over the lady  please go below mrs stanhope and dont worry about me said tom  yes it will be best added crabtree and then the lady disappeared down the companion way walking slowly for she felt weaker than ever because of the excitement  now sir we will come to an understanding said the former teacher of putnam hall as he faced tom with a show of severe dignity  very well we will come to an understanding  you have followed me to here  granted  you came in another boat with dora  what if i did do you suppose i would come with her alone went on tom struck with a sudden idea  do you mean to say you haveerbrought along any of theahem authorities and josiah crabtree glanced around nervously  i am not alonenor is dora where you can do her any harm  josiah crabtrees face became a trifle pale  boy what do you wish to doruin me  mr crabtree you are ruining yourself  you were the means of putting me in jail beforeyou and your brothers  you deserved it didnt you  no  i think you did but that has nothing to do with the present situation i want to know if you are willing to come to terms or not  whaterterms do you want me to make  are you in control of this boat  i am  then in the first place you must turn the control of the boat over to me  and after that  you can remain on board if you behave yourself until we reach the mainland  and what then  after that you can make your own terms with mrs stanhope and dora  but the authorities  mr crabtree for the sake of the stanhopes we wish to avoid all publicity replied tom playing his game as skillfully as possible i dont think they will want to bring you and themselves into court if you will promise to leave them alone in the future  who is with you here and crabtree looked ashore anxiously  sam is close at hand  and the others  never mind about the others i hold a winning hand but what that is ill let time show now for the last time are you willing to let me take charge or not  it is a very unusual proceeding  say yes or no  what shall i say i do not wish any trouble  then i am going to take charge call up the two sailors who have been running this boat for you  with a dark look on his face josiah crabtree did as requested at the same time tom beckoned to sam to come on the deck  the sailors were much astonished to see the two strangers only the fat tar could speak english and he translated what was said into french for his companions benefit  it was with very bad grace that josiah crabtree told the sailor who commanded the wellington that tom would now direct the movements of the vessel  we haveerdecided to change our plans said the former school teacher  what you lak to do den hey demanded the fat sailor  what is the nearest american town to here asked tom  ze nearest place  yes  buryport  and how far is that from here  ten or eleven miles  then we will sail for that place and at once  at this crabtree looked surprised  you are going to buryport at once what about the others you said were with you  i will answer no questions tom turned around and winked at sam who had heard the previous conversation i guess theyll follow right enough eh  sure answered sam dick knows what hes doing and so does that detective  a detective groaned josiah crabtree has it come to this and he wrung his hands nervously  mr crabtree i must ask you to step forward went on tom i do not wish you to go below  why  i do not wish you to worry mrs stanhope answered the youth but what he was afraid of was that crabtree might take it into his head to arm himself and bring on further trouble  as you please answered the former teacher with a shrug of his shoulders you seem to have matters well in hand and he strode forward biting his lip in vexation he would have tried to escape to the island only he was afraid no one would ever come to rescue him  while speaking tom had taken the pains to display the pistol taken from the sailor at the cave sam now took up a short iron bar lying near and both boys showed that they meant to remain masters of the situation the canadians noted this but said nothing for they felt something was wrong and they wished to get into no trouble a few minutes later the anchor was brought up the sails hoisted and the wellington stood away from needle point island     chapter xxii  the secret of the island cave   it is now time that we go back to the rocket and see how dick and those with him were faring  at the announcement that a schooner looking like the peacock was in sight he ran on deck with all speed and caught up a glass belonging to the owner of the steam tug  its the peacock sure he cried  see anything o that captain langless or them baxters asked luke peterson  i see somebody but we are too far off to make out their faces  the order was passed to the engineer of the tug and the speed of the craft was materially increased  but before they could come up to the schooner she disappeared around a headland of the island  we must run out a bit said captain parsons there is a nasty reef here and if we aint careful well get aground  where do you suppose the peacock has gone asked dick  into one of the bays most likely  can we follow her  of coarse the tug doesnt draw any more water than the schooner if as much  perhaps we had better see how the land lays before we approach too close suggested peterson they may be prepared to fight us off  that is true said dick perhaps we can slip into another bay close by  so it was arranged and they sped on their way passing the bay in which the peacock lay  near the island was a quantity of driftwood and they had just gotten out of sight of the bay when there was a sudden grinding and crashing sound on board of the tug and the engineer shut off the steam power  a breakdown exclaimed the captain and so it proved the screw had become entangled in the limb of a tree and sufficient damage had been done to render the screw useless  this was indeed an unlookedfor accident and dick wondered what they had best do  we cant use the screw at all he asked of the engineer after an examination  not until i have had a chance to repair it  and how long will the repairs take  cant tell till i get at work maybe an hour or two maybe half a day  this was dismaying information and dick held a consultation with larry colby and luke  i know what id do said larry id have the captain of the tug land me at some point above here and then id watch the peacock from behind some bushes on shore  this was considered good advice and dick agreed to act upon it he spoke to parsons and a small boat was put out and dick larry and peterson were rowed to land  now what will you do with the tug asked the eldest rover  well haul her in to a safe spot answered parsons i dont believe those repairs will take over a couple of hours then well be at your service again  once on land dick led the way into the woods moving in the direction of the bay where he had last seen the peacock  he was armed and so were his companions but they wished if possible to avoid all trouble  they had landed at a spot where the rocks were numerous and the ground uncertain and they had not proceeded far when luke peterson called a halt  we want to be careful here he said this island is full of caves and pitfalls and before you know it youll break a leg  it is certainly an ideal hiding place returned larry hi dick whats that  whats what  i thought i saw somebody in the brush yonder  dick shook his head  i saw nothing  neither did i put in the lumberman who did it look like  perhaps i was mistaken and it was a bird flitting through the brush come on  larry plunged ahead and dick followed  both had hardly taken a dozen steps when each gave a yell  whats up now cried peterson and came after them at a bound  then all tried to scramble back  it was too late they had struck a tiny watercourse between the rocks and now the very bottom of it seemed to drop out and they sank down and down into almost utter darkness  we are lost spluttered dick but it is doubtful if either of his companions heard him  for the minute after dick was so dazed and bewildered that he said nothing more he clutched at rocks dirt and tree roots but all gave way at his touch  at last he found himself flat on his back on a heap of dead leaves and moss partly across him lay larry while peterson was several feet away around the three lay dirt and bushes and several goodsized stones it was lucky the stones had not come down on top of them otherwise one or another might have been killed  gosh what a tumble ejaculated peterson when he could speak i told ye to be careful this island is like a reglar honeycomb fer holes  oh my foot gasped larry as he tried to get up  that was a tumble and no mistake said dick whats the matter with your foot larry  i dont know excepting i must have sprained my ankle was the answer oh and larry gave a loud groan  forgetful of their situation dick and the lumberman bent over larry and helped him to get off his shoe and sock his ankle was beginning to swell and turn red and he had sprained it beyond a doubt  the water was coming into the opening from the little stream overhead and dick readily procured a hatful of the fluid and the ankle was bathed with this after this it was bound up and larry said it felt somewhat better  but i cant walk very far on it he continued and then added with a sorry smile i am laid up just as the rocket is  the question is now we are down at the bottom of this hole how are we going to get out said dick to peterson  well have to get out some way was the unsatisfactory response see the water is coming in faster than ever  the lumberman was right the water had been running in a tiny stream not larger than a childs wrist now it was pouring in steadily like a cataract soon the bottom of the hole had formed a pool several inches deep  wait till it fills up and then swim out suggested larry  no thanks returned dick we might be drowned by that operation  the hole was irregular in shape about ten feet in diameter and fully twenty feet deep what had caused the sudden sinking was a mystery until it was solved by the water in the pool suddenly dropping away into another hole still deeper then of a sudden the trio went down again this time at an angle to find themselves in a goodsized cave where all was dark and uncertain  the tumble had wrenched larrys ankle still more and the youth could not suppress his groans of pain  as soon as he was able peterson leaped up struck a match and lit some brushwood which happened to be near and which the water had not yet touched  by this light larrys ankle was again attended to and bound up in a couple of handkerchiefs  if we keep on well get to the center of the earth remarked dick as he gazed around curiously where do you suppose we are now  in one of the island caves answered peterson i told you the place was full of them thats the reason the smugglers used to hold out here  perhaps well come across some of their treasures  at this peterson shook his head not likely when the last of the smugglers was arrested the government detectives searched the island thoroughly and gathered in all to be found  i see well how are we to get out now we are down here  we might climb back rover the way we came but that is dangerous on account of the water i rather think well do better to look for the regular opening to the cave if there is any  the matter was talked over for several minutes and it was decided that dick and peterson should investigate while larry remained by the fire keeping it as bright as possible and resting his sore ankle  at a short distance ahead the cave branched into two parts and coming to the forks dick took the right while peterson moved to the left dick carried a torch which he held overhead and likewise a pistol in case any snake or wild animal should attack him  the youth had not proceeded far before he came upon signs which showed that the cave at one time had been inhabited by human beings first he espied a part of an old bag then a weatherbeaten sailors cap and soon after a rusty pistol falling apart for the want of care  this must have been a smugglers retreat sure he murmured to himself my if i should stumble across a box of gold  he hurried forward and presently reached a spot where the cave broadened out into a round chamber here there were a rude table and several benches all ready to fall apart from decay  with quick steps he approached the table for he had seen something lying upon itsomething which made him start and give a cry of wonder  in the center of the table was a heap of silver dollars and beside this was a land map drawn by hand on the map lay a rusty dagger and a human skull     chapter xxiii  the baxters are followed   well i never  dick gazed at the silver the map the daggers and the skull with mingled surprise and horror  how had those things come there and what was the mystery concerning them  coming closer he picked up several of the dollars and examined them all were dated thirty to forty years back  then he picked up the dagger a beautiful affair of polished steel with a curiously wrought handle of buckhorn  the skull he left untouched  the map was covered with dust some of which he endeavored to blow away beneath he saw that there were odd tracings of many kinds and letterings in a language which was strange to him then his light began to go out and he shouted for peterson to join him  the sound echoed and reechoed throughout the cavern showing that the place was even more roomy than he had anticipated he waited several minutes then saw petersons light  whats up demanded the lumberman as he approached find anything important  i should say so answered dick look there  peterson did so then gave a cry of astonishment  silver lad silver and a skull  there is some story hidden in this affair said dick soberly can you explain it  i cannot peterson picked up the dagger thats a french weapon  but the dollars are u s money  right it is a mystery and no error how much money is there here  the two counted the pile and found it footed up to two hundred and forty dollars  not a fortune but still a tidy sum said peterson to a man in his standing two hundred and forty dollars was quite an amount  a fair share of it is yours said dick let us investigate some more  the lumberman was willing and lighting a fresh torch they moved around the circular chamber at one point they saw an opening leading into a second chamber here were a number of boxes and casks all covered with dust and dirt the accumulation of years prying open one of the boxes which was handy they discovered that it contained canned vegetables a second box contained dress goods and a third some candles a cask close at hand was marked cognac  this was a regular smugglers hangout said peterson those boxes must contain stuff of some value rover we have made a haul by coming here  yes but i am forgetting all about my brothers added dick hastily let us leave this alone for the present i guess it is safe enough  no doubt since it has rested undisturbed so many years  they left the storeroom as it may properly be termed and returned to the circular chamber  at first they could find no further opening but then dick saw a thin shaft of light coming from a corner here there was a flat rock which was easily pulled aside a broad opening led upward to the outer world  safe so far as getting out is concerned remarked peterson all told i reckon we had quite a lucky tumble after all  if larrys ankle isnt too bad  they hurried back to where larry had been left and found him still nursing his ankle which had swollen to the size of his knee he tried to stand upon it but the pain was so great he was glad enough to sit down again  he listened in openmouthed wonder to what dick had to tell a treasure cave he cried who would have dreamed of such a thing on lake huron  now that larry could not move the others were in a quandary as to what to do dick was impatient to be after the peacock  the folks on the schooner may take it into their heads to sail away if they caught sight of the steam tug he said and if they give us the slip i wont know where to look for them  i guess ill be safe if left alone said larry i have water and the fire and my pistol you go ahead and come back for me when it is convenient only dont leave the island without me  leave without you not much answered dick  you forget the treasure put in peterson with a laugh we are not going to let that slip  thats so said larry all right ill remain as the guardian of the treasure and so it was arranged  it was no easy matter to gain the outer air once more for the passageway was choked with dirt and brushwood which the wind had blown in when they came into the open they found themselves close to the lake shore at a spot surrounded thickly with trees  a fine cove for a smuggler to hide in observed peterson no wonder they made this cave their rendezvous  where is the bay in which the peacock disappeared  to the westward rover come ill show the way  be careful that we dont get into another trap  ive got my eyes open responded the lumberman  on they went once more over the rocks and through a tangle of brushwood it was now almost dark and dick was beginning to think they would lose their way when peterson called a sudden halt  here we are he whispered and pointed ahead there through the trees could be seen the waters of the tiny bay and there lay the peacock at anchor  only one man was on deck a sailor dick had seen several times otherwise the craft appeared deserted  do you suppose the baxters and the others have gone ashore asked dick  no telling yet lad let us watch out for a while  they sat down and watched until the darkness of night began to hide the peacock from view  at last they saw arnold baxter come on deck followed by dan  the two entered a rowboat and a sailor took them ashore they had scarcely landed when captain langless appeared coming along a pathway but a few yards from where dick and the lumberman were in hiding  at once a wordy war ensued between the baxters and the owner of the schooner what it was about dick and peterson could not make out although they realized that it concerned tom and sam  your men are a set of doughheads cried arnold baxter they are to be trusted with nothing  never mind well come out ahead anyway retorted captain langless i reckon youve been tripped up yourself before this  i warned you to be careful  it wasnt my fault  whats to do now put in dan baxter shall we stay on the island dad  certainly grumbled arnold baxter but i dont know exactly what to do and the man scratched his head in perplexity  let us go up to the cave  that wont do you any good growled captain langless i know what i am going to do  what  im going to sail around the island and find out if any other boat is near i dont want those boys to signal another boat  a good idea said arnold baxter but dan and i can remain on shore anyway  just as you please and captain langless shrugged his shoulders  the rowboat was still at the shore and the captain returned to the peacock with the member of his crew leaving the baxters to themselves  dick nudged peterson in the side  can it be possible that tom and sam have escaped he whispered  it looks that way answered the lumberman anyway something is very much wrong or these rascals wouldnt fall out with each other  hadnt we better watch the baxters  i think so the peacock will not go far im pretty sure of that  the baxters now passed along the footpath leading to the cave in which tom and sam had been placed  noiselessly dick and peterson followed as dick advanced he drew his pistol  quarter of a mile was covered and they were close to the cave when arnold baxter suddenly halted  dan supposing captain langless doesnt come back he exclaimed loud enough for dick and his companion to hear  doesnt come back ejaculated the bully why hes got to come back  no he hasnt  but i dont understand  you know well enough that the rovers tried to bribe the captain  yes but they ran away  perhaps its only a bluff dan the boys may have been taken to another part of the island from which langless can transfer them to the schooner later  what and desert us groaned the bully  yes and desert us i think we were foolish to leave the peacock without taking the captain or cadmus along i wont trust any of them any longer  well what shall we do dad go back  its too late now the peacock has gotten under way long ago  well let us try to get on the track of the two boys perhaps we can follow them up from the cave if all of the footsteps point this way well know the captain has been deceiving us  again the baxters moved on and so did dick and peterson the way was rough and made dan grumble a good deal  we ought to have kept this game all in our own hands from the start said the former bully of putnam hall we made a rank mistake to take captain langless into our confidence  i wont care if only we make anderson rover pony up that money answered the father im afraid the mine scheme will have to fall through  what did you strike him for in cash  ten thousand dollars  you ought to have made it fifty  i wanted to get ten first and double that afterward if i struck him too high first i was afraid he wouldnt try to meet me but put the detectives on the track without delay     chapter xxiv  an encounter in the dark   a little while later the baxters reached the cave where tom and sam had been held prisoners  the sailor who had been left bound had long since been released so the place was deserted  look out for snakes said dan we had better light torches  this was done for it was now dark under the trees  hiding in a thicket dick and peterson saw the baxters enter the cave the pair remained inside for fully quarter of an hour and came out looking much disappointed  with torches close to the ground they searched for sam and toms trail  here are footprints exclaimed arnold baxter at last they are not made by men either  they must be the boys answered dan come on let us follow  it is very dark dan im afraid well have to wait until morning  nevertheless the pair passed on and again dick and peterson came behind  hardly three rods had been passed when dan baxter let out a cry as some small wild animal dashed across the trail the bully turned to run and discovered dick ere the latter could hide  dick rover he gasped  rover cried arnold baxter what are you talking about dan  here is dick rover and that lumber fellow is with him  impossible why rover where did you come from and arnold baxter came up hardly believing his eyes  we were following you arnold baxter answered dick quietly  for what  to see what you were going to do next  have you found sam and tom questioned dan quickly  dan be still thundered his father you are always putting your foot into it  i reckon you chaps are fairly caught put in luke peterson  caught came from both in a breath  yes caught said dick we did not follow you for nothing  perhaps you are the ones who are caught said arnold baxter with a sickly smile  hardly and dick showed his pistol we are well armed arnold baxter and will stand no fooling  we are armed too began dan but his parent stopped him  of course you came to this island on a boat of some sort went on the elder baxter  how else could we come the mainland is miles away  where is your boat  not far off and well manned too added dick we came not alone to capture you but also the peacock and all on board  at this announcement the faces of the baxters fell and dan actually trembled  where is your boat repeated arnold baxter  as i just told you not far off the question is will you submit quietly or must i summon help  submit to what  submit to being taken to our boat  you have no right to make me go to your boat  ill be hanged if ill go growled dan  and you may be shot if you dont go answered dick significantly i know you well and i shall take no further chances with you now will you go or not  i suppose if we dont go youll bring some officers here to compel us to do as you wish  exactly  you may as well give in said peterson this island is not large and even if you try to run away youll be found sooner or later the peacock is probably already captured and those on our boat will see that no other boat comes near here until we have you safe on board the jig is up  i wont give in cried arnold baxter come dan he caught his son by the arm and both turned and sped into the nearest brush  it was dark the torches having died low and before dick could shoot even if he wished to do so the pair of rascals were out of sight  stop said dick to peterson who was for following them up we can do nothing in the darkness let them go tomorrow is another day let us return to the rocket and take steps to capture the peacock  yes and we must get back to larry said the lumberman  it was no easy matter to find their way back to the treasure cave and they missed the direction half a dozen times when they did get back it was so gloomy in the bushes that they had to call out to larry in order to locate him  gracious i was afraid you would never come back said the youth  weve had quite an adventure replied dick and related the particulars  larrys ankle was somewhat better and by leaning on both dick and peterson he managed to hobble along to where the rockets small boat had landed them  the steam tug was close at hand and they were soon on board  is the screw repaired was dicks first question  not quite but it will be inside of half an hour answered jack parsons  have you seen anything of the peacock she is sailing around the island  no havent seen any sail since you left we  a cry from the lookout interrupted the captain  here comes the peacock  the report was true and all crowded forward to catch sight of the schooner in the darkness  the stars made it fairly light on the water and as the schooner came up close to the steam tug dick made out several figures on board  ahoy what tug is that came from the schooner  the rocket answered parsons what schooner is that  to this there was no answer  what are you doing here asked captain langless instead  we are in trouble returned parsons after whispering with dick  whats up  weve had a breakdown  seen anybody from the island  why we thought this island was deserted  so it is  come up closer and give us a lift  cant we are behind time now  then without warning a bengal light was lit on board of the schooner a large reflector was placed behind the light which was thus cast on the deck of the rocket at once dick peterson and the others were exposed to the gaze of captain langless  ha i suspected as much roared the master of the schooner sheer off wimble or the game is up  the helm of the peacock was at once thrown over and she began to move off a stiff breeze caused her to make rapid progress  stop cried dick stop or we will fire on you  he had scarcely spoken when the report of a pistol rang out and a bullet cut through the air over his head  let that be a warning to you to leave us alone cried captain langless  then the schooner increased her speed the flare from the bengal light died out and soon the peacock was lost to view in the darkness     chapter xxv  beaching the wellington   how is this for a turn of fortune remarked tom as he and sam stood on the deck of the wellington and watched the shore of needle point island fading from view in the distance  its all right if only we can make those canadians obey us replied the youngest of the rovers they dont seem to like matters much they look dark and distrustful  i dont think theyll make trouble sam  josiah crabtree seems thoroughly cowed  dont trust him he is worse than a snake in the grass and he hates us worse than poison  the two paced the deck thoughtfully mrs stanhope was still in the cabin in the company of one of the sailors wives while the former teacher of putnam hall also kept out of sight  this seems an old tub of a boat went on tom a few minutes later i wonder that crabtree didnt hire something better she just crawls along and no more  probably he got the boat cheap he always was the one to go in for cheap things and in his surmise the lad was correct  it was not long before one of the canadians took hold of a handpump near the bow of the boat and began to pump the water out of the hold  hullo your old tub leaks eh said tom  yees heem leak some answered the fat canadian heem want some whatyoucallheem tar hey and he smiled broadly  any danger of sinking  at this the canadian shook his head then he went to pumping at a faster rate than ever  i believe he is afraid said tom to sam she must leak fearfully or he wouldnt pump up so much water  well the journey to the mainland wont last foreverthats one satisfaction tom i reckon the tub is good for that much of a run i dont care what becomes of her after we are ashore  nor i she can sink if she wishes with crabtree on board too  sink cried a voice behind them is there danger of the ship going down i noticed that she was leaking yesterday  it was josiah crabtree who spoke he had just come up and he was very pale  i guess shell keep up a few minutes longer said tom soberly  a few minutes oh dear if we did sink what would become of us  why if we did sink wed sink thats all  i mean if the ship sunk what would we do  you might wade ashore if your legs are long enough  but this is no joking matter thomas the lake is very deep out here  then you had better find a lifepreserver  josiah crabtree gave something of a groan and moved away he did not know whether tom was poking fun at him or not yet he did search for a preserverand in doing that he was wiser than the boys had anticipated  presently the wind veered around and the yards came over with a bang the wellington gave a lurch and there was a strange creaking and cracking far below the deck the canadian pumped more madly than ever and shouted to his companion in french  is she leaking worse asked tom  the canadian nodded then the wellington gave another lurch and tom noticed that her bow gave an odd little dip  filling with water ill be bound he muttered and running to the hatch he sounded the well hole there were sixteen inches of water below soon it measured seventeen inches  weve sprung a bad leak he announced to sam it looks as if we might go to the bottom  oh tom you dont mean it  yes i do  cant we turn back the island isnt more than two miles off it may be safer to go back than to keep on  exactly my idea sam ill speak to the canadian about it  the fat sailor was still pumping but his face was full of despair  de ship he go down he gasped we drown in ze lake  better turn back to the island returned tom and lose no time about it  yees yees zat ees best we turn heem back  the canadian shouted to his companion who was at the wheel and then left the pump to attend to the sails at once tom took his place at the pump at the same time calling to sam to go down for mrs stanhope  tell her to come on deck he said and find some lifepreservers if you can  what of the rowboat  its as rotten as the ship sam well have to swim for it if this tub sinks  sam disappeared into the cabin and tom turned to the pumping never had he worked so hard and the perspiration poured down his face soon mrs stanhope appeared her face full of fear  oh pray heaven we do not go down she murmured how far are we from land  we have turned back for the island answered tom hardly able to speak because of his exertions we are not much more than a mile away  a mile and how long will it take us to reach the island  about ten minutes if the wind holds out  the wellington was now groaning and creaking in every timber as if she was aware that her last hour on the surface of the lake had come she was as tom had said an old tub and should have been condemned years before but the canadians were used to her and handled the craft as skillfully as possible they too provided themselves with lifepreservers and when sam relieved his brother at the pump tom did likewise  as she filled with water the ship moved more slowly until despite the breeze she seemed to merely crawl along it was now growing dark and the island was not yet in sight  sounded again the well hole showed twenty inches of water at this the fat canadian gave a long sigh and disappeared into the forecastle to obtain a trunk and some of his other belongings sam had already brought on deck the things belonging to mrs stanhope  at last the fat sailor uttered a welcome cry the island the island  where questioned the others  the sailor pointed with his hand he was right land was just visible and no more then of a sudden came a crash and a shock which threw all of those on board headlong  we have struck a rock yelled josiah crabtree we are going down and in his terror he leaped overboard and struck out wildly for the distant shore  sam was also ready in a moment to spring into the water but tom held him back the wellington settled and swung around and then sheered off the rock and went on her way but it was plainly to be seen that she could float but a few minutes more at the most  there is a sandy shore cried tom to the canadians better drive her straight in and beach her  good said the fat sailor and spoke to his companion in french then as well as they were able they brought the waterlogged craft around to the wind slowly she drifted in her deck sinking with every forward move then came a strong pull of wind which caught the sails squarely and drove them ahead a grating and a slishing followed and they ran up the muddy shore and came to a standstill in about three feet of water  hurrah saved shouted sam my but that was a narrow escape  where is mr crabtree asked mrs stanhope anxiously oh do not let him drown  they looked around and saw him in the water not a hundred feet away puffing and blowing like a porpoise  save me he screamed as soon as he saw their safety dont let me drown  youre all right returned tom its shallow here see if you cant walk ashore  josiah crabtree continued his paddling and presently put down his feet very gingerly he could just touch the bottom soon he was in a position to walk and lost no time in getting out of the lake and coming up to the bow of the wellington  oh dear this is dreadful he groaned with a shiver throw out a plank that i may come onboard  thought you were tired of the old tub said tom dryly  i thought she was surely going down thomas please throw out a plank thats a good boy  the canadian got the longest plank at hand and resting one end at the bow allowed the other to fall ashore in a few inches of mud and water then josiah crabtree came up the plank on hands and knees looking for all the world like a halfdrowned rat     chapter xxvi  crabtree joins the baxters   well we are no better off than we were before remarked sam after josiah crabtree had disappeared in the direction of the cabin and the two boys had walked forward by themselves  no we are no better off but we have succeeded in rescuing mrs stanhope from old crabtrees clutches and that is something  true but supposing we fall in the hands of the baxters and captain langless again  cant we hold them at bay if they try to come on board this tub  perhaps but we cant remain on board the wellington forever  now that the danger was over the lads found that they were hungry and called upon the sailors to bring out what food the craft afforded they made a hearty meal in which mrs stanhope joined josiah crabtree was not invited and had to eat later on with the sailors and the one sailors wife  this wreck may throw us together for some time crabtree said tom later on when he and the former schoolteacher were alone i want to warn you to behave yourself during that time  i know my own business was the stiff reply  well you keep your distance or there will be trouble  can i not speak to mrs stanhope  when she speaks to you yes but you must not bother her with your attentions and if you try your hypnotic nonsense well pitch you overboard and so speaking tom walked off again josiah crabtree looked very black nevertheless he took the youths words to heart and only spoke to mrs stanhope when it was necessary  by the time supper was over it was night and time to think of getting some rest the boys took possession of one of the staterooms on board and arranged that each should sleep five hours tom taking the first watch mrs stanhope soon retired and so did josiah crabtree and one of the canadians  tom found the fat canadian the man to remain on deck quite a sociable fellow and asked him much about himself and how he had come to hire out with crabtree he soon discovered that the canadians were honest to the last degree and had gone in for the trip thinking all was above board  i soon see ze man haf von bad eye said the canadian i tell menot i no like heem now he has brought ruin on our ship  the canadian imagined that crabtree had hypnotized the sailing qualities of the wellington as well as cast a spell over mrs stanhope and tom saw no reason just then for saying anything to the contrary  you must watch crabtree he said dont let him get you in his power stick by me and my brother and you will be all right and the canadian promised  but who vill pay for ze ship he questioned dolefully tis all menot and myself haf in ze worl and he shook his head in sorrow  we will pay you well for whatever you do for us the balance you must get out of crabtree then tom gave the fat sailor a fivedollar bill and from that moment the pair were warm friends  feeling that crabtree would not dare to do much as matters stood tom did not take the trouble to arouse sam when he turned in and the brothers slept soundly until some time after sunrise  say why didnt you wake me up asked sam in astonishment you didnt stay up all night did you  not much answered tom and spoke of the canadian whose name was peglace  well whats to do  i must confess i dont know i suppose the baxters and captain langless are on the search for us  more than likely  then we had better lay low until some vessel comes to rescue us  i dont think very many ships come this way  neither do i but we wont despair come im hungry again and they stirred around to get breakfast  an examination showed that the wellington was hard and fast in the mud and likely to remain exactly as she stood for an indefinite time wading around in the water below the canadians reported several planks broken and wrenched loose and that immediate repairs seemed out of the question  ze ship ees gone said peglace sadly we air like zat man whatyou callheem crusoe robinson hey and he shook his head  well i hope we dont have to stay as long on this island as robinson crusoe remained on that other remarked sam tom im going for a walk on shore  can i go with you put in josiah crabtree humbly i am tired of this ships deck  all right come on  i will remain with mrs stanhope said tom dont go too far sam  sam and the former teacher of putnam hall were soon over the side the boy came down the plank easily enough but crabtree slipped and went into the water and mud up to his knees  ugh i am always unfortunate he spluttered however since the weather is warm i dont think ill suffer much  at a short distance up the beach there was a headland covered with tall trees sam decided to make his way to this  im going to climb the tallest of the trees and look around he said you can go along if you wish  i will go but i cannot climb the tree answered crabtree  to get to the headland they had to make a detour around a marshy spot and then climb over a number of rough rocks the exertion exhausted josiah crabtree and he soon fell behind  reaching the headland sam gazed around anxiously he could see a long distance to the north and the west but not a sail was in sight  the peacock ought to be somewhere around here he told himself and then coming to a tall tree with low drooping branches he began to climb to the top  it was a difficult task for the tree was a thickly wooded one and a veritable monarch of the forest but he persevered and at last gained the topmost branch  here the view of the island and its vicinity was much extended and he could see not only the bay where the peacock had been at anchor but also several other harbors  the peacock is gone such were the first words which escaped him she must have left the island altogether  with anxious eye he turned his gaze to the other harbors and suddenly gave a start  a steam tug how lucky he had discovered the rocket which was just getting up steam in order to follow the peacock the screw being now repaired and ready for use  as fast as he could he descended to the ground his one thought being to tell tom of his discovery and to either get to the steam tug or to signal those on board so that the tug might not leave the island without them he had noticed the black smoke curling up from the stack and knew that this betokened that steam was getting up  sam rover  the voice came from behind the rocks like a bolt out of the clear sky then dan baxter rushed forward followed by his father  sam was taken off his guard and before he could do anything the baxters had him by both arms and were holding him a prisoner  let me go  not much came from arnold baxter where are your brothersi mean he added in some confusion where is tom  find out for yourself arnold baxter let me go i say and sam began to struggle  daniel baxter is it possible came in josiah crabtrees voice and he emerged from the brushwood what an extraordinary meeting  i should say it was responded the bully where did you spring from  perhaps daniel i can ask the same question  is tom rover with you  no he is on a ship which is beached a short distance from here  alone  no with some canadians andermrs stanhope  oh i see the same old game growled the bully anybody else on the boat  no  if thats the case we are in luck came from arnold baxter he gazed at crabtree sharply do you know where this lad came from  what do you mean  he and his brother tom escaped from us we brought them here  what i thought they had followed me and  mrs stanhope  hardly arnold baxter proceeded to bind sams arms behind him dan take him to yonder tree and tie him fast then he walked away to talk to josiah crabtree  the conversation which followed lasted for quarter of an hour what was said sam could not make out the boy wanted to get away but was helpless and now dan baxter took away the pistol with which he had provided himself a little later the baxters and crabtree moved toward the wreck leaving him bound to the tree alone     chapter xxvii  how tom was captured   tom was pacing the deck of the wreck in thoughtful mood when on looking up he saw josiah crabtree coming back alone  where is sam he called out  samuel wishes you to join him at the headland replied crabtree he thinks a boat is coming around the other side of the island  did you see it  no my eyesight is failing me and i had no spectacles along  well you can go back with me said tom to make sure that the former teacher should not bother mrs stanhope during his absence from the wellington  i calculated to go back responded crabtree  telling mrs stanhope that he would soon return tom left the wreck and followed josiah crabtree around the marsh land and over the cocks  so long as crabtree was in front poor tom did not anticipate any treachery consequently he was taken completely by surprise when the baxters fell upon him from behind and bore him to the ground  dont he cried and tried to rise but dan baxter struck him a heavy blow with a club and then pointed the pistol at his head and he had to submit  when he was a prisoner josiah crabtree came back his face beaming sarcastically the tables are turned once more thomas he said we are masters of the situation how do you like the prospect  what have you done with sam  we have taken care of him answered arnold baxter and well take good care of you after this too  tom said no more but his heart sank like a lump of lead in his breast the talk of a ship being in sight must be a hoax unless crabtree referred to the peacock  the baxters had a small bit of rope remaining and with this they tied toms hands behind him then he was made to march to where sam was a prisoner  what tom you too cried the youngest rover and then he felt worse than ever for he had hoped that his brother might come to his rescue  both boys were tied to the trees but at some distance apart then without delay the baxters and josiah crabtree hurried off toward the wellington the baxters had heard that the boat was not much damaged and thought that it might be possible to patch her up sufficiently to reach the mainland and to do this ere dick rover and his party discovered them for the peacock and langless arnold baxter now cared but little  she has left the bay he said to dan and more than likely has abandoned us  the canadians were surprised to see josiah crabtree returning with two strangers and mrs stanhope uttered a shriek when confronted by the baxters  i must be dreaming she murmured when she had recovered sufficiently to speak how came you here  we are not answering questions just now madam said arnold baxter we wish to patch up this boat if we can and at once and he called the canadians to him  as can be imagined the sailors were dumfounded especially when told that the rover boys would not be back at least for the present they shook their heads  ze ship cannot be patched up said peglace ze whole bottom ees ready to fall out  arnold baxter would not believe him and armed with lanterns he and dan went below to make an examination  what does this mean demanded mrs stanhope of crabtree when they were left alone what have you done with the rover boys  do not worry about them my dear said the former teacher soothingly all will come right in the end  then he began to look at her steadily in an endeavor to bring her once more under his hypnotic influence but without waiting she ran off and refused to confront him again  follow me and i will leap into the lake she cried and fearful she would commit suicide he let her alone  the examination below decks lasted nearly an hour and was far from satisfactory to arnold baxter he felt that the wellington might be patched up but the work would take at least several days and there was no telling what would happen in the meantime  dick rover and his party are sure to find us before that time said dan  i am afraid so dan but i know of nothing better to do than to remain here  we might find the peacock and make a new deal with captain langless  langless is a weakhearted fool and ill never trust him again we would have done much better had we hired a small boat which we could ran alone  but what shall we do dad  i think we had best go into hiding in the interior of the island we can take a store of provisions along from this boat  shall we take the rovers with us  we may as well we cant let them starve and by holding them prisoners we may be able to make terms with dick rover and his friends  thats an idea i reckon dick will do a lot rather than see tom and sam suffer  to be sure  where do you suppose dick rover and his friends are now  somewhere around the island although i have seen nothing of their boat  by noon the baxters had completed their plans and left the boat carrying with them a load of provisions wrapped up in a sheet of canvas they invited josiah crabtree to go with them but that individual declined  i cannot take mrs stanhope along he said and i will not desert the lady  as you please replied arnold baxter  what are you going to do with tom and sam rover  take them with us if you see anything of dick rover dont say anything about us  i dont wish to see dick rover answered josiah crabtree nervously  if the dick rover party leaves the island well come back put in dan in the meantime if i was you id lay low  soon the baxters were out of sight and then josiah crabtree turned to have another talk with mrs stanhope in the meantime setting the canadians on guard to watch for and hail any passing sail which might appear  in his wandering on the island arnold baxter had stumbled across a convenient cave near the headland where he had encountered sam rover and thither father and son now made their way  the cave gained they put down their bundles which included a quantity of rope and then started for the headland to bring in tom and sam  the headland gained a surprise awaited than both boys had disappeared     chapter xxviii  the baxters talk it over   tom we are in a fix  so it would seem sam who ever dreamed of running across the baxters in this fashion  we are in the hands of a trio of rascals now for crabtree is as bad as the others  perhaps but he hasnt the nerve that arnold baxter has what shall we do  try to get free  i cant budge an inch dan baxter took especial delight in tying me up  i can move one hand and ifit is free hurrah  can you get the other hand free  i can try the ropethats free too now for my legs  sam rover worked rapidly and was soon as free as ever then he ran over to where tom was tied up and liberated his brother  now what shall we do  i move we go after the people on that steam tug and get them to help us rescue mrs stanhope  thats a good idea and the quicker we go the better  sam remembered very well in what direction he had seen the tug and now set a straight course across the island to the cove  but the trail led over a hill and through a dense thicket and long before the journey was half finished both lads were wellnigh exhausted  we ought to have followed the shore aroundwe would have got there quicker panted tom as he fairly cut his way through the dense brush wood  i hope there are no wild animals here  i doubt if there is anything very large on the island if so we would have seen it before this  so speaking they pushed on once more the woods passed they came to a swamp filled with long grass they hurried around this and then into the forest skirting the lake shore  at last the cove came into sight alas the steam tug was nowhere to be seen  she has gone groaned sam oh what luck  i cant see a sign of her anywhere returned tom she must have steamed away right after you came down the tree  more than likely  much disappointed and utterly worn out they cast themselves down in the shade to rest as they rested they listened intently but only the breeze through the trees and the soft laplap of the waves striking the rocks reached their ears  i never thought a spot on our lakes could be so lonely said sam at length why its as if we were in the middle of the pacific  i trust no harm befalls mrs stanhope sam perhaps it is our duty to go back to her in spite of the danger  i was thinking of that too but we are only two boys against two men and a boy and they are armed  i think the canadians will prove our friends in a mixup they hate crabtree for they half fancy he bewitched their boat  we might go back on the sly and do some spying  that is what i mean  but they were too tired to go back at once and spent a good hour near the beach close at hand was a tiny spring and here they procured a drink of water and took a washup after which they felt somewhat better  they were about to start on the return when tom suddenly plucked his brother by the sleeve  somebody is coming he whispered let us hide  they had scarcely time to get behind some brushwood when the baxters came into view moving very slowly and gazing sharply around them  i dont see a thing dad came from dan baxter in disgusted tones i dont believe they came this way  they certainly didnt go back to that old boat replied arnold baxter let us take a walk along the beach  i am tired to death let us rest first  so speaking dan baxter threw himself on a grassy bank overlooking the lake and arnold baxter followed  both were out of sorts and did a large amount of grumbling the father lit a short briarroot pipe while the son puffed away at a cigarette  id give a hundred dollars if a boat would come along and take us to the mainland observed the father i am sick and tired of this game all through  so am i sick of it dad we made a mistake by ever coming east it seems to me  if i could get to the mainland i might make money out of it even so dan anderson rover may have sent that ten thousand dollars to bay city after all he thinks an awful lot of his sons and wont want a hair of their head harmed  so the money was to go to bay city you didnt tell me that before  i wanted to keep the matter secret  who will receive it there  a man i can trust  oh pshaw you neednt be so closemouthed about it growled the son lighting a fresh cigarette  well the mans name is cowdrickhiram cowdrick he comes from colorado and used to know the roebuck crowd  i suppose old rover was to send the money in secret  certainly i wrote him a long letter telling him that if there was the least effort made to follow up the money on his part the lives of his sons should pay the forfeit  thats the way to put it dad i shouldnt wonder if old rover sent the money on  id soon find out if i could get to shore if i had the money the boys could rot here for all i care  thank you for nothing muttered tom under his breath just you wait till i have a chance to square accounts thats all  hush whispered sam they must not discover us and then tom became silent again  josiah crabtree is in a fix too went on dan with something of a laugh he dont seem to know what to do  where is mrs stanhopes daughter  i dont know if crabtree marries mrs stanhope it will break dora all up  well that isnt our affair but it is queer we should run together on this island we canwhat is that a sail  arnold baxter leaped to his feet and so did dan tom and sam also looked in the direction pointed out  there was a sail true enough far out on the lake all watched it with interest and saw it gradually grow larger evidently the craft was heading directly for the island  she is coming this way dad almost shouted dan  it looks so to me replied arnold baxter with increasing interest and she isnt the peacock either  no shes a strange shipa sloop by her rig  the baxters watched the coming sail eagerly and it must be confessed that the rover boys were equally interested  if the folks on that boat are honest they will surely help us against the baxters murmured sam  just what i was thinking replied his brother  at last the vessel was near enough to be signaled and running to a high rock overlooking the water dan swung his hat and a handkerchief in the air  at first the signals were not seen but at last came a voice through a speaking trumpet  ahoy there  ahoy shouted dan come here come here  whats the trouble  we are wrecked we want you to take us off  wrecked  yes will you take us off  certainly  slowly but surely the sloop drew nearer she was a fairsized craft and carried a crew of three the men seemed to be nice fellows and not at all of the captain langless class soon the sloop dropped anchor close in shore and the mainsail came down at the same time     chapter xxix  dora stanhope appears   so you have been shipwrecked said the master of the sloop a young man of apparently twentyfive whose name was fairwell  yes answered baxter senior  your own boat or some large vessel  our own boat we were out on a little cruise when we struck something in the dark and our craft went down almost immediately fortunately we were not far from this shore or we would have been drowned where are you bound  nowhere in particular how long have you been on the island  since night before last  all alone  yes  had anything to eat  wellernot much stammered arnold baxter we found some wreckage with some bread and a few cans of sardines but that is all  then i reckon you wont go back on a square meal laughed fairwell  indeed i wont put in dan bound to say something  we would like to get back to the mainland as soon as possible went on arnold baxter i am from chicago and must attend to some banking matters my name is larsonhenry larson of state street  well mr larson well get you to the main shore as soon as we can that is providing the lady who has hired this sloop is willing to go on without stopping here i reckon this young man is your friend  he is my son and you are  randy fairwell at your service sir its too bad you were wrecked but you can be thankful your life was spared seen anybody around here since youve been ashore  not a soul  nor any sail  nothing it has been very very lonesome and arnold baxter shook his head hypocritically  tom and sam listened to this talk with keen interest tom now nudged his brother  this has gone far enough he whispered those men seem all right and im sure will prove our friends im going to show myself  wait till the baxters go on board replied sam otherwise they may take it into their heads to run away again  a few words more followed between those on the sloop and the baxters and then the latter ran on the deck of the sloop by means of a plank thrown out for that purpose  then tom came forward stick in hand and sam followed  hold those men he cried dont let them get away from you  of course the men on the sloop were much astonished both by the boys sudden appearance and by the words which were spoken  whats that called out randy fairwell  those rover boys ejaculated arnold baxter and his face turned white  i said hold those men repeated tom dont let them get away from you  what for who are you  those fellows are rascals and the father is an escaped prisonbird put in sam hold them or they will run sure  its false burst out dan baxter that fellow is crazy i never saw him before  i guess they are both crazy put in arnold baxter taking the cue from his son certainly i never set eyes on them before  do not believe one word of what he says said tom his name is not what he said but arnold baxter and he is the man who got out of a new york prison by means of a forged pardon you must have read of that case in the newspapers last summer  i did read of it answered randy fairwell butbut he was too bewildered to go on where did you young men come from  we were carried off in a schooner hired by these rascals and put in a cave on this island we escaped only after a hard fight  but why were you carried off asked one of the other men on board of the sloop  these baxters wanted to get our father to pay them money for our safe return  a kidnapping eh  its aa fairy story and these fellows must be stark mad cried arnold baxter i give you my word gentlemen i never set eyes on the chaps before either they are escaped lunatics or else their lonely life here has turned their brains  for a moment there was a pause sam and tom standing at the end of the plank clubs in hand and the baxters on the deck of the sloop surrounded by the three men who had been sailing the craft those of the sloop looked from one party to the other in bewilderment  well i must say i dont know whom to believe said randy fairwell slowly he turned to the boys who are you  tom rover and this is my brother sam answered the elder of the pair  i never heard the name before said arnold baxter loftily  they dont appear to be very crazy put in one of the men whose name was ruff  thats true but they must be crazy or they wouldnt address my father and me in this fashion said dan baxter  they can talk all they please retorted sam but if you let them escape you will make a great mistake  here is a fair suggestion said tom take us all to the mainland and to the nearest police station the authorities will soon straighten out this tangle  that certainly seems fair muttered randy fairwell  i say these boys must be crazy blustered arnold baxter if you take them on board the chances are theyll try to murder us  i dont want to sail with a couple of crazy fellows put in dan scowling darkly at the rovers  we might keep a close watch on them suggested ruff  and keep a close watch on the baxters added tom  at this moment the door of the tiny cabin of the sloop opened and a girl came out rubbing her eyes as if she had been taking a nap which was a fact  she stared at the baxters like one in a dream and then gave a sudden cry of alarm  is it you  dora stanhope ejaculated tom and sam in a breath  then the girl started and turned her eyes ashore tom rover and sam where in the wide world did you come from  the baxters fell back almost overcome and the father clutched the arm of his son savagely  weve put our foot into it here he muttered  who would have supposed that she was on this boat came from the son  do you know these folks miss stanhope questioned randy fairwell  yes i know all of them answered the girl when she had somewhat recovered from her surprise  of course she knows us put in tom and she knows those rascals too dont you dora  yes tom but how did you come here  its a long tale dora but just now i want you to help me bring the baxters to justice they are trying to make out that they are all right and that we are crazy  crazy the idea indeed mr fairwell these boys are not crazy they are my best friends they are tom and sam rover and they are brothers to the dick rover i told you about  and what of these fellows questioned the master of the sloop  this man is an escaped prisoner and this is his son who is also wanted by the authorities i believe  trash and nonsense stormed arnold baxter hardly knowing what to say this is simply a plot against us he caught his son by the arm come we had better be going since we are not wanted here  he leaped upon the plank and dan came after him  get back there roared tom standing at the outer end of the plank another step and ill crack your head open arnold baxter  and he swung his club in the air defiantly  out of my way or i will fire on you answered arnold baxter and started to draw his pistol  oh dont screamed dora and covered her face with her hands  we want no shooting here began randy fairwell and then stopped short in wonder  for reaching down tom had suddenly given the end of the plank a wobble before they could save themselves the baxters father and son pitched with a loud splash into the lake  good for you cried sam if only they dont try to shoot when they come up  there was a commotion in the water and mud lining the shore and slowly the baxters appeared to view covered with slime and weeds and both emptyhanded for dan had not had time to draw his weapon and that of the father lay somewhere on the bottom  now do you surrender or shall i do a little shooting said tom sternly although he had no weapon  dont shoot me please dont howled dan his last bit of courage deserting him  the father said nothing but looked as if he would like to annihilate both of the rovers  randy fairwell turned quickly to dora stanhope  you are certain these people are bad he said  yes yes very bad answered dora and continued you can believe all the rovers tell you concerning them  one end of the plank still rested on the sloop and fairwell quickly placed the board in position again  by this time the baxters were crawling out of the lake sam caught hold of dan while tom tackled the father  with a heavy boathook in his hand randy fairwell now ran ashore followed by ruff  you had better give up the fight said fairwell to arnold baxter if you are in the right you shall have justice done to you  i will never give in growled arnold baxter savagely and did his best to get away seeing this sam let dan go and started in to help tom the struggle lasted several minutes but fairwell put an end to it by catching arnold baxter from behind and holding him in a grasp of iron and then the rascal was made a close prisoner by being bound with a rope  now for dan cried tom and turned around to find that dan baxter had taken time by the forelock and disappeared it was destined to be many a day before any of the rovers set eyes on him again     chapter xxx  home againconclusion   dan is gone  which way did he go  i dont know  he ran up the shore in that direction called out dora pointing with her hand  leaving arnold baxter in the grasp of fairwell and ruff tom and sam hurried off  but dan baxter had disappeared in a perfect wilderness of rocks and bushes and could not be located  never mind said tom let him go if he wants to remain on this lonely spot  all were soon on board the sloop and tom and sam told their tale to which dora as well as the others listened with close attention  then my mother is safe burst out the girl thank heaven for that  she was safe when last we saw her said tom i guess the best thing we can do will be to get back to the wreck of the wellington without delay  yes yes take me to my mother at once i have been hunting for her ever since she disappeared  but how did you happen to come here  i found out that josiah crabtree had hired the wellington and day before yesterday we ran across a steamboat which had sighted the schooner headed in this direction  how did he get her away in the first place  we were stopping at a hotel in canada and i went out to do some necessary shopping when i got back my mother was gone she had received a bogus note written i presume by crabtree asking her to come to me at once as i had been taken sick in one of the stores i immediately hired a detective mr ruff here and we tracked mr crabtree to the lake  good for you doraa man couldnt have done better cried sam so enthusiastically that dora had to blush  but now i want to get to mother without further delay  let us set sail at once then said tom the distance to the wreck is not over two miles  without delay the anchor was hoisted the mainsail set and the sloop left the shore she was a trimbuilt craft and under a good breeze her bow cut the shining waters of the lake like a knife  the only one on the boat who was not in good humor was arnold baxter when he got the chance he called tom rover to him  rover what do you intend to do with me he asked  we intend to hand you over to the authorities  you are making a great mistake  ill risk that  if youll let me go ill promise to turn over a new leaf and more than that ill help your father to make a pile of money out of that mine in colorado  your promises are not worth the breath they are uttered in arnold baxter you belong in prison and that is where you are going  at this baxter began to rave and utter words unfit to print but tom soon stopped this  keep a civil tongue in your head or well gag you he said and then baxter relapsed into sullen silence  the breeze was favorable and it was not long before the sloop rounded a point of the island and came in sight of the wellington  let us surprise old crabtree suggested sam we can keep out of his sight until the last moment  tom was willing yet dora demurred wishing to get to her mother as soon as possible yet as they drew closer the girl stepped behind the cabin for a minute  a ship cried peglace who was on watch on deck a ship at last and coming to shore  he uttered the words in french and they speedily brought to the deck his companion and his companions fat wife  a ship sure enough said the other canadian while his wife shed tears of joy  josiah crabtree had just been interviewing mrs stanhope in the cabin he was trying again to hypnotize her and she was trying to keep from under the spell  a boat must be coming by the cries said the former teacher i will go to the deck and investigate  he ran up the companion way and mrs stanhope followed the lady felt weak and utterly discouraged  if i only had dora with me she murmured to herself  did you speak asked crabtree looking over his shoulder  not to you she answered coldly  soon crabtree was at the stern the sloop came closer and a rope was thrown to the wellington and made fast by the canadians the smaller craft drew so little water that she did not ground even when lying at the larger ships stern  hullo began josiah crabtree addressing randy fairwell this is most fortunate  i see you are wrecked returned fairwell calmly  exactly sira very unfortunate affair truly will you rescue us  anybody else on board  yes a lady to whom i am engaged to be married and crabtree smiled blandly will you come on board  i guess i will answered fairwell eh mr ruff  yes answered the detective and leaped on the deck of the wreck  by this time mrs stanhope was on deck also gazing curiously at those on the sloop  i believe this is mr josiah crabtree went on ruff coldly  eh whyeryou have the advantage of me stammered the former teacher of putnam hall falling back in dismay  are you josiah crabtree or not  i am but  then consider yourself my prisoner mr crabtree  your prisoner  that is what i said  but why do you say i am arrested who are you  you are arrested for plotting against the welfare of mrs stanhope there and dora stanhope her daughter also for forging dora stanhopes name to a letter sent to the girls mother  it is false iioh  josiah crabtree staggered back for dora had run forward in a second more mother and daughter were in each others arms an affecting scene followed josiah crabtree turned a sickly green and his knees smote together  ierthat is wethe lady and myselfthere is some mistake he tried to go on but failed utterly  you fraud you cried tom and came forward followed by sam now josiah crabtree we are on top and we mean to stay there mr ruff you had better handcuff him  i will returned the detective and brought forth a pair of steel nippers  handcuff me groaned crabtree oh the disgrace no no  you ought to have thought of the disgrace before was ruffs comment and the next minute the handcuffs were fast on the prisoner  a shout was now heard from one of the canadian sailors he was pointing to the north of the island where a steam tug had just hove into sight  the tug was coming on rapidly and as she drew closer tom and sam made out a youth standing on the cabin top eagerly waving his hand to them  dick cried both of the rovers dick by all that is wonderful  it was indeed dick and the rocket and soon the steam tug came up to the stern of the sloop and made fast  tom and sam and safe burst out dick and then his eyes fell upon the stanhopes dora he shook hands and blushed deeply and so did the girl why i never expected this  none of us did answered dora with a warm smile  and your mother too  its like a fairy tale put in tom and i guess its going to end just as happily as fairy tales usually do  it took some time for each to tell his story when it came to dicks turn he said the steam tug had done her best to follow up captain langless and his schooner but had failed because of the darkness  shes now out of sight he concluded and there is no telling where she is  well let him go said tom we have arnold baxter and he is the chief villain i dont believe captain langless will ever bother us again  after a long conversation it was decided that all of the party should return to the mainland in the steam tug and the sloop the latter to be towed by the former dick remained on the sloop with the stanhopes while josiah crabtree was placed in the company of his fellowcriminal arnold baxter with the party went the canadian who was married and his wife leaving the other canadian to look after the wreck until his partner should return with material with which the boat could be patched up  the run to the mainland was a pleasing one to the rovers and also to larry and faithful aleck pop the negro was on a broad grin over the safety of the brothers  dem boys beat de nation he said nebber gits into trouble so deep but wot da paddles out agin in short ordah yes sah  during the trip it was decided by the stanhopes on dicks advice to prosecute josiah crabtree to the full extent of the law mrs stanhope demurred somewhat to this but dora was firm and when the case was brought to trial crabtree was sent to prison for two years  the first thing the rover boys did when on shore was to telegraph to their father telling him of their safety this telegram caught mr rover just as he was about to arrange for sending the ten thousand dollars to arnold baxter he was overjoyed at the glad tidings and came on as far as detroit to meet the whole party  my boys how you must have suffered he said as he shook one after another by the hand in the future you must be more careful  arnold baxter wished to see anderson rover hoping thereby to influence the latter in his behalf but mr rover refused to grant the interview and on the day following arnold baxter was sent back to the prison in new york state there to begin his long term of imprisonment all over again  there was much speculation concerning dan baxter and when the rovers went back to the island on the steam tugto obtain what had been discovered in the cavethey asked the canadian on the wreck if he had seen the youth  yes i see him was the answer but he is gone now he went off in a small boat that torched here yesterday  its just as well said tom we didnt want to see the fellow starve here  but at the cave which dick and the others had discovered he changed his tune for there were many signs that dan baxter had visited the locality the money which had been lying on the dustcovered table was gone likewise the map and the dagger  we are out that much said dick to larry and peterson  the boxes and casks are not disturbed replied the old lumberman  he couldnt carry those said larry perhaps he thinks to come back for these later  then well fool him replied dick  all of the goods were transferred to the steam tug and taken to detroit where after remaining unclaimed for some time they were sold the sale netting the rovers and their friends several thousand dollars  one oddshaped box dick kept as a souvenir it had been a money casket and was lined with brass little did the youth dream of all the strange adventures into which that casket was to lead him and his brothers what those adventures were will be told in another volume of this series to be entitled the rover boys in the mountains or a hunt for fun and fortune  the homecoming of the three boys was celebrated in grand style not alone by the covers but by many of their friends who flocked in from far and near to see them captain putnam was there along with many of their old schoolfellows  its good to be home once more said sam  especially with so many friends around you added tom  and after escaping from so many perils came from dick  and here let us leave them wishing them well both for the present and the future  the end
