rudyard kipling have excited has naturally led to curiosity concerning their author and to a desire to know the conditions of his life much has been written about him which has had little or no foundation in truth it seems then worth while in order to prevent false or mistaken reports from being accepted as trustworthy and in order to provide for the public such information concerning mr kipling as it has a right to possess that a correct and authoritative statement of the chief events in his life should be given to it this is the object of the following brief narrative                                       rudyard kipling was born at bombay on the 30th of december 1865 his mother alice daughter of the rev g b macdonald a wesleyan preacher eminent in that denomination and his father john lockwood kipling the son also of a wesleyan preacher were both of yorkshire birth they had been married in london early in the year and they named their firstborn child after the pretty lake in staffordshire on the borders of which their acquaintance had begun mr lockwood kipling after leaving school had served his apprenticeship in one of the famous staffordshire potteries at burslem had afterward worked in the studio of the sculptor mr birnie philip and from 1861 to 1865 had been engaged on the decorations of the south kensington museum during our american war and in the years immediately following the trade of bombay was exceedingly flourishing the city was immensely prosperous a spirit of inflation possessed the government and the people alike there were great designs for the improvement and rebuilding of large portions of the town and a need was felt for artistic oversight and direction of the works in hand and contemplated the distinction which mr lockwood kipling had already won by his native ability and thorough training led to his being appointed in 1865 to go to bombay as the professor of architectural sculpture in the british school of art which had been established there  it was thus that rudyard kipling came to be born in the most cosmopolitan city of the eastern world and it was there and in its neighbourhood that the first three years of the boys life were spent years in which every child receives ineffaceable impressions shaping his conceptions of the world and in which a child of peculiarly sensitive nature and active disposition such as this boy possessed lies open to myriad influences that quicken and give colour to the imagination  in the spring of 1868 he was taken by his mother for a visit to england and there in the same year his sister was born in the next year his mother returned to india with both her children and the boys next two years were spent at and near bombay  he was a friendly and receptive child eager interested in all the various entertaining aspects of life in a city which gleaning all races from all lands presents more diversified and picturesque varieties of human condition than any other east or west a little incident which his mother remembers is not without a pretty allegoric significance it was at nasik on the dekhan plain not far from bombay the little fellow trudging over the ploughed field with his hand in that of the native husbandman called back to her in the hindustani which was as familiar to him as english goodbye this is my brother  in 1871 mr and mrs kipling went with their children to england and being compelled to return to india the next year they took up the sorrow common to angloindian lives in leaving their children at home in charge of friends at southsea near portsmouth it was a hard and sad experience for the boy the originality of his nature and the independence of his spirit had already become clearly manifest and were likely to render him unintelligible and perplexing to whosoever might have charge of him unless they were gifted with unusual perceptions and quick sympathies happily his mothers sister mrs now lady burnejones was near at hand in case of need to care for him  in the spring of 1877 mrs kipling came to england to see her children and was followed the next year by her husband the children were removed from southsea and rudyard grown into a companionable activeminded interesting boy now in his thirteenth year had the delight of spending some weeks in paris with his father attracted thither by the exhibition of that year his eyesight had been for some time a source of trouble to him and the relief was great from glasses which were specially fitted to his eyes and with which he has never since been able to dispense  on the return of his parents to india early in 1878 rudyard was placed at the school of westward ho at bideford in devon this school was one chiefly intended for the sons of members of the indian services most of whom were looking forward to following their fathers careers as servants of the crown it was in charge of an admirable headmaster mr cormell price whose character was such that he won the affection of his boys no less than their respect the young kipling was not an easy boy to manage he chose his own way his talents were such that he might have held a place near the highest in his studies but he was content to let others surpass him in lessons while he yielded to his genius in devoting himself to original composition and to much reading in books of his own choice he became the editor of the school paper he contributed to the columns of the local bideford journal he wrote a quantity of verse and was venturesome enough to send a copy of verses to a london journal which to his infinite satisfaction was accepted and published some of his verses were afterward collected in a little volume privately printed by his parents at lahore with the title schoolboy lyrics all through his time at school his letters to his parents in india were such as to make it clear to them that his future lay in the field of literature  his literary gifts came to him by inheritance from both the father and mother and they were nurtured and cultivated in the circle of relatives and family friends with whom his holidays were spent a submaster at westward ho though little satisfied with the boys progress in the studies of the school gave to him the liberty of his own excellent library the holidays were spent at the grange in south kensington the home of his aunt and uncle mr and mrs burnejones and here he came under the happiest possible domestic influences and was brought into contact with men of highest quality whose lives were given to letters and the arts especially with william morris the closest intimate of the household of the grange other homes were open to him where the pervading influence was that of intellectual pursuits and where he had access to libraries through which he was allowed to wander and to browse at his will the good which came to him directly and indirectly from these opportunities can hardly be overstated to know to love and to be loved by such a man as burnejones was a supreme blessing in his life  in the autumn of 1882 having finished his course at school a position was secured for him on the civil and military gazette lahore and he returned to his parents in india who had meanwhile removed from bombay to lahore where his father was at the head of the most important school of the arts in india the civil and military gazette is the chief journal of northwestern india owned and conducted by the managers and owners of the allahabad pioneer the ablest and most influential of all indian newspapers published in the interior of the country  for five years he worked hard and steadily on the gazette much of the work was simple drudgery he shirked nothing the editorinchief was a somewhat grim man who believed in snubbing his subordinates and who though he recognized the talents of the clever pup as he called him and allowed him a pretty free hand in his contributions to the paper yet was inclined to exact from him the full tale of the heavy routine work of a newspaper office  but these were happy years for the youth was feeling the spring of his own powers was full of interest in life was laying up stores of observation and experience and found in his own home not only domestic happiness but a sympathy in taste and a variety of talent and accomplishment which acted as a continual stimulus to his own genius father mother sister and brother all played and worked together with rare combination of sympathetic gifts in 1885 some of the verses with the writing of which he and his sister had amused themselves were published at lahore in a little volume entitled echoes because most of them were lively parodies on some of the poems of the popular poets of the day the little book had its moment of narrowly limited success and opened the way for the wider notoriety and success of a volume into which were gathered the departmental ditties that had appeared from time to time in the gazette many of the stories also which were afterward collected under the now familiar title of plain tales from the hills made their first appearance in the gazette and attracted wide attention in the angloindian community  kiplings work for five years at lahore had indeed been of such quality that it was not surprising that he was called down to allahabad in 1887 to take a place upon the editorial staff of the pioneer the training of an angloindian journalist is peculiar he has to master knowledge of many kinds to become thoroughly acquainted with the affairs of the english administration and the conditions of angloindian life and at the same time with the interests the modes of life and thought of the vast underlying native population the higher positions in indian journalism are places of genuine importance and of large emolument worthy objects of ambition for a young man conscious of literary faculty and inspired with zeal for public ends  the pioneer issued a weekly as well as a daily edition and in addition to his regular work upon the daily paper kipling continued to write for the weekly issue stories similar to those which had already won him reputation and they now attracted wider attention than ever his home at allahabad was with professor hill a man of science attached to the allahabad college but the continuity of his life was broken by various journeys undertaken in the interest of the paperone through rajputana from which he wrote a series of descriptive letters called letters of marque another to calcutta and through bengal which resulted in the city of dreadful night and other letters describing the littleknown conditions of the vast presidency and finally in 1889 he was sent off by the pioneer on a tour round the world on which he was accompanied by his friends professor and mrs hill going first to japan he thence came to america writing on the way and in america the letters which appeared in the pioneer under the title of from sea to sea and in september 1889 he arrived in london  his indian repute had not preceded him to such degree as to make the way easy for him through the london crowd but after a somewhat dreary winter during which he had been making acquaintances and had found irregular employment upon newspapers and magazines arrangements were made with messrs macmillan  co for the publication of an edition of plain tales from the hills the book appeared in june its success was immediate it was republished at once in america and was welcomed as warmly on this side of the atlantic as on the other the reprint of kiplings other indian stories and of his departmental ditties speedily followed together with the new tales and poems which showed the wide range of his creative genius each volume was a fresh success each extended the circle of mr kiplings readers till now he is the most widely known of english authors  in 1891 mr kipling left england for a long voyage to south africa australia new zealand and ceylon and thence to visit his parents at lahore on his return to england he was married in london to miss balestier daughter of the late mr wolcott balestier of new york shortly after their marriage mr and mrs kipling visited japan and in august they came to america they established their home at brattleboro vermont where mrs kiplings family had a large estate and here in a pleasant and beautifully situated house which they had built for themselves their two eldest children were born and here they continued to live till september 1896  during these four years mr kipling made three brief visits to england to see his parents who had left india and were now settled in the old country  the winter of 189798 was spent by mr kipling and his family accompanied by his father in south africa he was everywhere received with the utmost cordiality and friendliness  returning to england in the spring of 1898 he took a house at rottingdean near brighton with intention to make it his permanent home  of the later incidents of his life there is no need to speak     iv  baa baa black sheep       at the school council baa baa black sheep was elected to a      very high position among the kipling stories because it      shows how mean they were to a boy and he did nt need it      baa baa black sheep     have you any wool     yes sir yes sir three bags full     one for the master one for the dame     none for the little boy that cries down the lane                                           nursery rhyme   the first bag       when i was in my fathers house i was in a better place   they were putting punch to bedthe ayah and the hamal and meeta the big surti boy with the red and gold turban judy already tucked inside her mosquitocurtains was nearly asleep punch had been allowed to stay up for dinner many privileges had been accorded to punch within the last ten days and a greater kindness from the people of his world had encompassed his ways and works which were mostly obstreperous he sat on the edge of his bed and swung his bare legs defiantly  punchbaba going to byelo said the ayah suggestively  no said punch punchbaba wants the story about the ranee that was turned into a tiger meeta must tell it and the hamal shall hide behind the door and make tigernoises at the proper time  but judybaba will wake up said the ayah  judybaba is waking piped a small voice from the mosquitocurtains there was a ranee that lived at delhi go on meeta and she fell asleep again while meeta began the story  never had punch secured the telling of that tale with so little opposition he reflected for a long time the hamal made the tigernoises in twenty different keys  top said punch authoritatively why does nt papa come in and say he is going to give me putput  punchbaba is going away said the ayah in another week there will be no punchbaba to pull my hair any more she sighed softly for the boy of the household was very dear to her heart  up the ghauts in a train said punch standing on his bed all the way to nassick where the raneetiger lives  not to nassick this year little sahib said meeta lifting him on his shoulder down to the sea where the cocoanuts are thrown and across the sea in a big ship will you take meeta with you to belait  you shall all come said punch from the height of meetas strong arms meeta and the ayah and the hamal and bhiniinthegarden and the salaamcaptainsahibsnakeman  there was no mockery in meetas voice when he repliedgreat is the sahibs favour and laid the little man down in the bed while the ayah sitting in the moonlight at the doorway lulled him to sleep with an interminable canticle such as they sing in the roman catholic church at parel punch curled himself into a ball and slept  next morning judy shouted that there was a rat in the nursery and thus he forgot to tell her the wonderful news it did not much matter for judy was only three and she would not have understood but punch was five and he knew that going to england would be much nicer than a trip to nassick                                       and papa and mamma sold the brougham and the piano and stripped the house and curtailed the allowance of crockery for the daily meals and took long council together over a bundle of letters bearing the rocklington postmark  the worst of it is that one cant be certain of anything said papa pulling his moustache the letters in themselves are excellent and the terms are moderate enough  the worst of it is that the children will grow up away from me thought mamma but she did not say it aloud  we are only one case among hundreds said papa bitterly you shall go home again in five years dear  punch will be ten thenand judy eight oh how long and long and long the time will be and we have to leave them among strangers  punch is a cheery little chap hes sure to make friends wherever he goes  and who could help loving my ju  they were standing over the cots in the nursery late at night and i think that mamma was crying softly after papa had gone away she knelt down by the side of judys cot the ayah saw her and put up a prayer that the memsahib might never find the love of her children taken away from her and given to a stranger  mammas own prayer was a slightly illogical one summarized it ran let strangers love my children and be as good to them as i should be but let me preserve their love and their confidence for ever and ever amen punch scratched himself in his sleep and judy moaned a little that seems to be the only answer to the prayer and next day they all went down to the sea and there was a scene at the apollo bunder when punch discovered that meeta could not come too and judy learned that the ayah must be left behind but punch found a thousand fascinating things in the rope block and steampipe line on the big p and o steamer long before meeta and the ayah had dried their tears  come back punchbaba said the ayah  come back said meeta and be a burra sahib  yes said punch lifted up in his fathers arms to wave goodbye yes i will come back and i will be a burra sahib bahadur  at the end of the first day punch demanded to be set down in england which he was certain must be close at hand next day there was a merry breeze and punch was very sick when i come back to bombay said punch on his recovery i will come by the roadin a broomgharri this is a very naughty ship  the swedish boatswain consoled him and he modified his opinions as the voyage went on there was so much to see and to handle and ask questions about that punch nearly forgot the ayah and meeta and the hamal and with difficulty remembered a few words of the hindustani once his secondspeech  but judy was much worse the day before the steamer reached southampton mamma asked her if she would not like to see the ayah again judys blue eyes turned to the stretch of sea that had swallowed all her tiny past and she said ayah what ayah  mamma cried over her and punch marveled it was then that he heard for the first time mammas passionate appeal to him never to let judy forget mamma seeing that judy was young ridiculously young and that mamma every evening for four weeks past had come into the cabin to sing her and punch to sleep with a mysterious tune that he called sonny my soul punch could not understand what mamma meant but he strove to do his duty for the moment mamma left the cabin he said to judy ju you bemember mamma  torse i do said judy  then always bemember mamma r else i wont give you the paper ducks that the redhaired captain sahib cut out for me  so judy promised always to bemember mamma  many and many a time was mammas command laid upon punch and papa would say the same thing with an insistence that awed the child  you must make haste and learn to write punch said papa and then youll be able to write letters to us in bombay  ill come into your room said punch and papa choked  papa and mamma were always choking in those days if punch took judy to task for not bemembering they choked if punch sprawled on the sofa in the southampton lodginghouse and sketched his future in purple and gold they choked and so they did if judy put up her mouth for a kiss  through many days all four were vagabonds on the face of the earth punch with no one to give orders to judy too young for anything and papa and mamma grave distracted and choking  where demanded punch wearied of a loathsome contrivance on four wheels with a mound of luggage atopwhere is our broomgharri this thing talks so much that i cant talk where is our own broomgharri when i was at bandstand before we comed away i asked inverarity sahib why he was sitting in it and he said it was his own and i said i will give it youi like inverarity sahiband i said can you put your legs through the pullywag loops by the windows and inverarity sahib said no and laughed i can put my legs through the pullywag loops i can put my legs through these pullywag loops look oh mammas crying again i did nt know i was nt not to do so  punch drew his legs out of the loops of the fourwheeler the door opened and he slid to the earth in a cascade of parcels at the door of an austere little villa whose gates bore the legend downe lodge punch gathered himself together and eyed the house with disfavour it stood on a sandy road and a cold wind tickled his knickerbockered legs  let us go away said punch this is not a pretty place  but mamma and papa and judy had quitted the cab and all the luggage was being taken into the house at the doorstep stood a woman in black and she smiled largely with dry chapped lips behind her was a man big bony gray and lame as to one legbehind him a boy of twelve blackhaired and oily in appearance punch surveyed the trio and advanced without fear as he had been accustomed to do in bombay when callers came and he happened to be playing in the veranda  how do you do said he i am punch but they were all looking at the luggageall except the gray man who shook hands with punch and said he was a smart little fellow there was much running about and banging of boxes and punch curled himself up on the sofa in the diningroom and considered things  i dont like these people said punch but never mind well go away soon we have always went away soon from everywhere i wish we was gone back to bombay soon  the wish bore no fruit for six days mamma wept at intervals and showed the woman in black all punchs clothesa liberty which punch resented but praps shes a new white ayah he thought im to call her antirosa but she does nt call me sahib she says just punch he confided to judy what is antirosa  judy did nt know neither she nor punch had heard anything of an animal called an aunt their world had been papa and mamma who knew everything permitted everything and loved everybodyeven punch when he used to go into the garden at bombay and fill his nails with mold after the weekly nailcutting because as he explained between two strokes of the slipper to his sorely tried father his fingers felt so new at the ends  in an undefined way punch judged it advisable to keep both parents between himself and the woman in black and the boy in black hair he did not approve of them he liked the gray man who had expressed a wish to be called uncleharri they nodded at each other when they met and the gray man showed him a little ship with rigging that took up and down  she is a model of the briskthe little brisk that was sore exposed that day at navarino the gray man hummed the last words and fell into a reverie ill tell you about navarino punch when we go for walks together and you must nt touch the ship because shes the brisk  long before that walk the first of many was taken they roused punch and judy in the chill dawn of a february morning to say goodbye and of all people in the wide earth to papa and mammaboth crying this time punch was very sleepy and judy was cross  dont forget us pleaded mamma oh my little son dont forget us and see that judy remembers too  ive told judy to bemember said punch wiggling for his fathers beard tickled his neck ive told judytenfortyleven thousand times but ju s so youngquite a babyis nt she  yes said papa quite a baby and you must be good to judy and make haste to learn to write andandand  punch was back in his bed again judy was fast asleep and there was the rattle of a cab below papa and mamma had gone away not to nassick that was across the sea to some place much nearer of course and equally of course they would return they came back after dinnerparties and papa had come back after he had been to a place called the snows and mamma with him to punch and judy at mrs inveraritys house in marine lines assuredly they would come back again so punch fell asleep till the true morning when the blackhaired boy met him with the information that papa and mamma had gone to bombay and that he and judy were to stay at downe lodge forever antirosa tearfully appealed to for a contradiction said that harry had spoken the truth and that it behooved punch to fold up his clothes neatly on going to bed punch went out and wept bitterly with judy into whose fair head he had driven some ideas of the meaning of separation  when a matured man discovers that he has been deserted by providence deprived of his god and cast without help comfort or sympathy upon a world which is new and strange to him his despair which may find expression in evilliving the writing of his experiences or the more satisfactory diversion of suicide is generally supposed to be impressive a child under exactly similar circumstances as far as its knowledge goes cannot very well curse god and die it howls till its nose is red its eyes are sore and its head aches punch and judy through no fault of their own had lost all their world they sat in the hall and cried the blackhaired boy looking on from afar  the model of the ship availed nothing though the gray man assured punch that he might pull the rigging up and down as much as he pleased and judy was promised free entry into the kitchen they wanted papa and mamma gone to bombay beyond the seas and their grief while it lasted was without remedy  when the tears ceased the house was very still antirosa had decided it was better to let the children have their cry out and the boy had gone to school punch raised his head from the floor and sniffed mournfully judy was nearly asleep three short years had not taught her how to bear sorrow with full knowledge there was a distant dull boom in the aira repeated heavy thud punch knew that sound in bombay in the monsoon it was the seathe sea that must be traversed before anyone could get to bombay  quick ju he cried were close to the sea i can hear it listen thats where theyve went praps we can catch them if we was in time they did nt mean to go without us theyve only forgot  iss said judy theyve only forgotted less go to the sea  the halldoor was open and so was the gardengate  its very very big this place he said looking cautiously down the road and we will get lost but i will find a man and order him to take me back to my houselike i did in bombay  he took judy by the hand and the two fled hatless in the direction of the sound of the sea downe villa was almost the last of a range of newly built houses running out through a chaos of brickmounds to a heath where gypsies occasionally camped and where the garrison artillery of rocklington practised there were few people to be seen and the children might have been taken for those of the soldiery who ranged far half an hour the wearied little legs tramped across heath potatofield and sanddune  ise so tired said judy and mamma will be angry  mammas never angry i suppose she is waiting at the sea now while papa gets tickets well find them and go along with them ju you must nt sit down only a little more and well come to the sea ju if you sit down ill thmack you said punch  they climbed another dune and came upon the great gray sea at low tide hundreds of crabs were scuttling about the beach but there was no trace of papa and mamma not even of a ship upon the watersnothing but sand and mud for miles and miles  and uncleharri found them by chancevery muddy and very forlornpunch dissolved in tears but trying to divert judy with an ickle trab and judy wailing to the pitiless horizon for mamma mammaand again mamma   the second bag      ah welladay for we are souls bereaved     of all the creatures under heavens wide scope     we are most hopeless who had once most hope     and most beliefless who had most believed                            the city of dreadful night   all this time not a word about black sheep he came later and harry the blackhaired boy was mainly responsible for his coming judywho could help loving little judypassed by special permit into the kitchen and thence straight to aunty rosas heart harry was aunty rosas one child and punch was the extra boy about the house there was no special place for him or his little affairs and he was forbidden to sprawl on sofas and explain his ideas about the manufacture of this world and his hopes for his future sprawling was lazy and wore out sofas and little boys were not expected to talk they were talked to and the talking to was intended for the benefit of their morals as the unquestioned despot of the house at bombay punch could not quite understand how he came to be of no account in this new life  harry might reach across the table and take what he wanted judy might point and get what she wanted punch was forbidden to do either the gray man was his great hope and standby for many months after mamma and papa left and he had forgotten to tell judy to bemember mamma  this lapse was excusable because in the interval he had been introduced by aunty rosa to two very impressive thingsan abstraction called god the intimate friend and ally of aunty rosa generally believed to live behind the kitchenrange because it was hot thereand a dirty brown book filled with unintelligible dots and marks punch was always anxious to oblige everybody he therefore welded the story of the creation on to what he could recollect of his indian fairy tales and scandalized aunty rosa by repeating the result to judy it was a sin a grievous sin and punch was talked to for a quarter of an hour he could not understand where the iniquity came in but was careful not to repeat the offence because aunty rosa told him that god had heard every word he had said and was very angry if this were true why did nt god come and say so thought punch and dismissed the matter from his mind afterward he learned to know the lord as the only thing in the world more awful than aunty rosaas a creature that stood in the background and counted the strokes of the cane  but the reading was just then a much more serious matter than any creed aunty rosa sat him upon a table and told him that a b meant ab  why said punch a is a and b is bee why does a b mean ab  because i tell you it does said aunty rosa and youve got to say it  punch said it accordingly and for a month hugely against his will stumbled through the brown book not in the least comprehending what it meant but uncle harry who walked much and generally alone was wont to come into the nursery and suggest to aunty rosa that punch should walk with him he seldom spoke but he showed punch all rocklington from the mudbanks and the sand of the backbay to the great harbours where ships lay at anchor and the dockyards where the hammers were never still and the marinestore shops and the shiny brass counters in the offices where uncle harry went once every three months with a slip of blue paper and received sovereigns in exchange for he held a woundpension punch heard too from his lips the story of the battle of navarino where the sailors of the fleet for three days afterward were deaf as posts and could only sign to each other that was because of the noise of the guns said uncle harry and i have got the wadding of a bullet somewhere inside me now  punch regarded him with curiosity he had not the least idea what wadding was and his notion of a bullet was a dockyard cannonball bigger than his own head how could uncle harry keep a cannonball inside him he was ashamed to ask for fear uncle harry might be angry  punch had never known what angerreal angermeant until one terrible day when harry had taken his paintbox to paint a boat with and punch had protested with a loud and lamentable voice then uncle harry had appeared on the scene and muttering something about strangers children had with a stick smitten the blackhaired boy across the shoulders till he wept and yelled and aunty rosa came in and abused uncle harry for cruelty to his own flesh and blood and punch shuddered to the tips of his shoes it was nt my fault he explained to the boy but both harry and aunty rosa said that it was and that punch had told tales and for a week there were no more walks with uncle harry  but that week brought a great joy to punch  he had repeated till he was thrice weary the statement that the cat lay on the mat and the rat came in  now i can truly read said punch and now i will never read anything in the world  he put the brown book in the cupboard where his schoolbooks lived and accidentally tumbled out a venerable volume without covers labelled sharpes magazine there was the most portentous picture of a griffin on the first page with verses below the griffin carried off one sheep a day from a german village till a man came with a falchion and split the griffin open goodness only knew what a falchion was but there was the griffin and his history was an improvement upon the eternal cat  this said punch means things and now i will know all about everything in all the world he read till the light failed not understanding a tithe of the meaning but tantalized by glimpses of new worlds hereafter to be revealed  what is a falchion what is a ewee lamb what is a base ussurper what is a verdant mead he demanded with flushed cheeks at bedtime of the astonished aunt rosa  say your prayers and go to sleep she replied and that was all the help punch then or afterward found at her hands in the new and delightful exercise of reading  aunt rosa only knows about god and things like that argued punch uncle harry will tell me  the next walk proved that uncle harry could not help either but he allowed punch to talk and even sat down on a bench to hear about the griffin other walks brought other stories as punch ranged farther afield for the house held large store of old books that no one ever openedfrom frank fairlegh in serial numbers and the earlier poems of tennyson contributed anonymously to sharpes magazine to 62 exhibition catalogues gay with colours and delightfully incomprehensible and odd leaves of gullivers travels  as soon as punch could string a few pothooks together he wrote to bombay demanding by return of post all the books in all the world papa could not comply with this modest indent but sent grimms fairy tales and a hans andersen that was enough if he were only left alone punch could pass at any hour he chose into a land of his own beyond reach of aunty rosa and her god harry and his teasements and judys claims to be played with  dont disturb me im reading go and play in the kitchen grunted punch aunty rosa lets you go there judy was cutting her second teeth and was fretful she appealed to aunty rosa who descended on punch  i was reading he explained reading a book i want to read  youre only doing that to show off said aunty rosa but well see play with judy now and dont open a book for a week  judy did not pass a very enjoyable playtime with punch who was consumed with indignation there was a pettiness at the bottom of the prohibition which puzzled him  its what i like to do he said and shes found out that and stopped me dont cry juit was nt your faultplease dont cry or shell say i made you  ju loyally mopped up her tears and the two played in their nursery a room in the basement and half underground to which they were regularly sent after the midday dinner while aunty rosa slept she drank winethat is to say something from a bottle in the cellaretfor her stomachs sake but if she did not fall asleep she would sometimes come into the nursery to see that the children were really playing now bricks wooden hoops ninepins and chinaware cannot amuse forever especially when all fairyland is to be won by the mere opening of a book and as often as not punch would be discovered reading to judy or tell her interminable tales that was an offence in the eyes of the law and judy would be whisked off by aunty rosa while punch was left to play alone and be sure that i hear you doing it  it was not a cheering employ for he had to make a playful noise at last with infinite craft he devised an arrangement whereby the table could be supported as to three legs on toy bricks leaving the fourth clear to bring down on the floor he could work the table with one hand and hold a book with the other this he did till an evil day when aunty rosa pounced upon him unawares and told him that he was acting a lie  if youre old enough to do that she saidher temper was always worst after dinneryoure old enough to be beaten  butimim not a animal said punch aghast he remembered uncle harry and the stick and turned white aunty rosa had hidden a light cane behind her and punch was beaten then and there over the shoulders it was a revelation to him the room door was shut and he was left to weep himself into repentance and work out his own gospel of life  aunty rosa he argued had the power to beat him with many stripes it was unjust and cruel and mamma and papa would never have allowed it unless perhaps as aunty rosa seemed to imply they had sent secret orders in which case he was abandoned indeed it would be discreet in the future to propitiate aunty rosa but then again even in matters in which he was innocent he had been accused of wishing to show off he had shown off before visitors when he had attacked a strange gentlemanharrys uncle not his ownwith requests for information about the griffin and the falchion and the precise nature of the tilbury in which frank fairlegh rodeall points of paramount interest which he was bursting to understand clearly it would not do to pretend to care for aunty rosa  at this point harry entered and stood afar off eying punch a disheveled heap in the corner of the room with disgust  youre a liara young liar said harry with great unction and youre to have tea down here because youre not fit to speak to us and youre not to speak to judy again till mother gives you leave youll corrupt her youre only fit to associate with the servant mother says so  having reduced punch to a second agony of tears harry departed upstairs with the news that punch was still rebellious  uncle harry sat uneasily in the diningroom d it all rosa said he at last cant you leave the child alone hes a good enough little chap when i meet him  he puts on his best manners with you henry said aunty rosa but im afraid im very much afraid that he is the black sheep of the family  harry heard and stored up the name for future use judy cried till she was bidden to stop her brother not being worth tears and the evening concluded with the return of punch to the upper regions and a private sitting at which all the blinding horrors of hell were revealed to punch with such store of imagery as aunty rosas narrow mind possessed  most grievous of all was judys roundeyed reproach and punch went to bed in the depths of the valley of humiliation he shared his room with harry and knew the torture in store for an hour and a half he had to answer that young gentlemans question as to his motives for telling a lie and a grievous lie the precise quantity of punishment inflicted by aunty rosa and had also to profess his deep gratitude for such religious instruction as harry thought fit to impart  from that day began the downfall of punch now black sheep  untrustworthy in one thing untrustworthy in all said aunty rosa and harry felt that black sheep was delivered into his hands he would wake him up in the night to ask him why he was such a liar  i dont know punch would reply  then dont you think you ought to get up and pray to god for a new heart  yyess  get out and pray then and punch would get out of bed with raging hate in his heart against all the world seen and unseen he was always tumbling into trouble harry had a knack of crossexamining him as to his days doings which seldom failed to lead him sleepy and savage into half a dozen contradictionsall duly reported to aunty rosa next morning  but it was nt a lie punch would begin charging into a laboured explanation that landed him more hopelessly in the mire i said that i did nt say my prayers twice over in the day and that was on tuesday once i did i know i did but harry said i did nt and so forth till the tension brought tears and he was dismissed from the table in disgrace  you use nt to be as bad as this said judy awestricken at the catalogue of black sheeps crimes why are you so bad now  i dont know black sheep would reply im not if i only was nt bothered upside down i knew what i did and i want to say so but harry always makes it out different somehow and aunty rosa does nt believe a word i say oh ju dont you say im bad too  aunty rosa says you are said judy she told the vicar so when he came yesterday  why does she tell all the people outside the house about me it is nt fair said black sheep when i was in bombay and was baddoing bad not madeup bad like thismamma told papa and papa told me he knew and that was all outside people did nt know tooeven meeta did nt know  i dont remember said judy wistfully i was all little then mamma was just as fond of you as she was of me was nt she  course she was so was papa so was everybody  aunty rosa likes me more than she does you she says that you are a trial and a black sheep and im not to speak to you more than i can help  always not outside of the times when you must nt speak to me at all  judy nodded her head mournfully black sheep turned away in despair but judys arms were round his neck  never mind punch she whispered i will speak to you just the same as ever and ever youre my own own brother though you arethough aunty rosa says youre bad and harry says youre a little coward he says that if i pulled your hair hard youd cry  pull then said punch  judy pulled gingerly  pull harderas hard as you can there i dont mind how much you pull it now if youll speak to me same as ever ill let you pull it as much as you likepull it out if you like but i know if harry came and stood by and made you do it id cry  so the two children sealed the compact with a kiss and black sheeps heart was cheered within him and by extreme caution and careful avoidance of harry he acquired virtue and was allowed to read undisturbed for a week uncle harry took him for walks and consoled him with rough tenderness never calling him black sheep its good for you i suppose punch he used to say let us sit down im getting tired his steps led him now not to the beach but to the cemetery of rocklington amid the potatofields for hours the gray man would sit on a tombstone while black sheep read epitaphs and then with a sigh would stump home again  i shall lie there soon said he to black sheep one winter evening when his face showed white as a worn silver coin under the lights of the chapellodge you need nt tell aunty rosa  a month later he turned sharp round ere half a morning walk was completed and stumped back to the house put me to bed rosa he muttered ive walked my last the wadding has found me out  they put him to bed and for a fortnight the shadow of his sickness lay upon the house and black sheep went to and fro unobserved papa had sent him some new books and he was told to keep quiet he retired into his own world and was perfectly happy even at night his felicity was unbroken he could lie in bed and string himself tales of travel and adventure while harry was downstairs  uncle harrys going to die said judy who now lived almost entirely with aunty rosa  im very sorry said black sheep soberly he told me that a long time ago  aunty rosa heard the conversation will nothing check your wicked tongue she said angrily there were blue circles round her eyes  black sheep retreated to the nursery and read cometh up as a flower with deep and uncomprehending interest he had been forbidden to read it on account of its sinfulness but the bonds of the universe were crumbling and aunty rosa was in great grief  im glad said black sheep she s unhappy now it was nt a lie though i knew he told me not to tell  that night black sheep woke with a start harry was not in the room and there was a sound of sobbing on the next floor then the voice of uncle harry singing the song of the battle of navarino cut through the darkness      our vanship was the asia     the albion and genoa  he s getting well thought black sheep who knew the song through all its seventeen verses but the blood froze at his little heart as he thought the voice leapt an octave and rang shrill as a boatswains pipe      and next came on the lovely rose     the philomel her fireship closed     and the little brisk was sore exposed     that day at navarino  that day at navarino uncle harry shouted black sheep half wild with excitement and fear of he knew not what  a door opened and aunty rosa screamed up the staircase hush for gods sake hush you little devil uncle harry is dead   the third bag      journeys end in lovers meeting     every wise mans son doth know   i wonder what will happen to me now thought black sheep when the semipagan rites peculiar to the burial of the dead in middleclass houses had been accomplished and aunty rosa awful in black crape had returned to this life i dont think ive done anything bad that she knows of i suppose i will soon she will be very cross after uncle harrys dying and harry will be cross too i ll keep in the nursery  unfortunately for punchs plans it was decided that he should be sent to a dayschool which harry attended this meant a morning walk with harry and perhaps an evening one but the prospect of freedom in the interval was refreshing harry ll tell everything i do but i wont do anything said black sheep fortified with this virtuous resolution he went to school only to find that harrys version of his character had preceded him and that life was a burden in consequence he took stock of his associates some of them were unclean some of them talked in dialect many dropped their hs and there were two jews and a negro or someone quite as dark in the assembly thats a hubshi said black sheep to himself even meeta used to laugh at a hubshi i dont think this is a proper place he was indignant for at least an hour till he reflected that any expostulation on his part would be by aunty rosa construed into showing off and that harry would tell the boys  how do you like school said aunty rosa at the end of the day  i think it is a very nice place said punch quietly  i suppose you warned the boys of black sheeps character said aunty rosa to harry  oh yes said the censor of black sheeps morals they know all about him  if i was with my father said black sheep stung to the quick i should nt speak to those boys he would nt let me they live in shops i saw them go into shopswhere their fathers live and sell things  youre too good for that school are you said aunty rosa with a bitter smile you ought to be grateful black sheep that those boys speak to you at all it is nt every school that takes little liars  harry did not fail to make much capital out of black sheeps illconsidered remark with the result that several boys including the hubshi demonstrated to black sheep the eternal equality of the human race by smacking his head and his consolation from aunty rosa was that it served him right for being vain he learned however to keep his opinions to himself and by propitiating harry in carrying books and the like to secure a little peace his existence was not too joyful from nine till twelve he was at school and from two to four except on saturdays in the evenings he was sent down into the nursery to prepare his lessons for the next day and every night came the dreaded crossquestionings at harrys hand of judy he saw but little she was deeply religiousat six years of age religion is easy to come byand sorely divided between her natural love for black sheep and her love for aunty rosa who could do no wrong  the lean woman returned that love with interest and judy when she dared took advantage of this for the remission of black sheeps penalties failures in lessons at school were furnished at home by a week without reading other than schoolbooks and harry brought the news of such a failure with glee further black sheep was then bound to repeat his lessons at bedtime to harry who generally succeeded in making him break down and consoled him by gloomiest forebodings for the morrow harry was at once spy practical joker inquisitor and aunty rosas deputy executioner he filled his many posts to admiration from his actions now that uncle harry was dead there was no appeal black sheep had not been permitted to keep any selfrespect at school at home he was of course utterly discredited and grateful for any pity that the servantgirlsthey changed frequently at downe lodge because they too were liarsmight show you re just fit to row in the same boat with black sheep was a sentiment that each new jane or eliza might expect to hear before a month was over from aunty rosas lips and black sheep was used to ask new girls whether they had yet been compared to him harry was master harry in their mouths judy was officially miss judy but black sheep was never anything more than black sheep tout court  as time went on and the memory of papa and mamma became wholly overlaid by the unpleasant task of writing them letters under aunty rosas eye each sunday black sheep forgot what manner of life he had led in the beginning of things even judys appeals to try and remember about bombay failed to quicken him  i cant remember he said i know i used to give orders and mamma kissed me  aunty rosa will kiss you if you are good pleaded judy  ugh i dont want to be kissed by aunty rosa shed say i was doing it to get something more to eat  the weeks lengthened into months and the holidays came but just before the holidays black sheep fell into deadly sin  among the many boys whom harry had incited to punch black sheeps head because he dare nt hit back was one more aggravating than the rest who in an unlucky moment fell upon black sheep when harry was not near the blows stung and black sheep struck back at random with all the power at his command the boy dropped and whimpered black sheep was astounded at his own act but feeling the unresisting body under him shook it with both his hands in blind fury and then began to throttle his enemy meaning honestly to slay him there was a scuffle and black sheep was torn off the body by harry and some colleagues and cuffed home tingling but exultant aunty rosa was out pending her arrival harry set himself to lecture black sheep on the sin of murderwhich he described as the offence of cain  why did nt you fight him fair what did you hit him when he was down for you little cur  black sheep looked up at harrys throat and then at a knife on the dinnertable  i dont understand he said wearily you always set him on me and told me i was a coward when i blubbed will you leave me alone until aunty rosa comes in shell beat me if you tell her i ought to be beaten so its all right  its all wrong said harry magisterially you nearly killed him and i should nt wonder if he dies  will he die said black sheep  i daresay said harry and then youll be hanged  all right said black sheep possessing himself of the tableknife then ill kill you now you say things and do things andand i dont know how things happen and you never leave me aloneand i dont care what happens  he ran at the boy with the knife and harry fled upstairs to his room promising black sheep the finest thrashing in the world when aunty rosa returned black sheep sat at the bottom of the stairs the tableknife in his hand and wept for that he had not killed harry the servantgirl came up from the kitchen took the knife away and consoled him but black sheep was beyond consolation he would be badly beaten by aunty rosa then there would be another beating at harrys hands then judy would not be allowed to speak to him then the tale would be told at school and then  there was no one to help and no one to care and the best way out of the business was by death a knife would hurt but aunty rosa had told him a year ago that if he sucked paint he would die he went into the nursery unearthed the nowdisused noahs ark and sucked the paint off as many animals as remained it tasted abominable but he had licked noahs dove clean by the time aunty rosa and judy returned he went upstairs and greeted them with please aunty rosa i believe ive nearly killed a boy at school and ive tried to kill harry and when youve done all about god and hell will you beat me and get it over  the tale of the assault as told by harry could only be explained on the ground of possession by the devil wherefore black sheep was not only most excellently beaten once by aunty rosa and once when thoroughly cowed down by harry but he was further prayed for at family prayers together with jane who had stolen a cold rissole from the pantry and snuffled audibly as her enormity was brought before the throne of grace black sheep was sore and stiff but triumphant he would die that very night and be rid of them all no he would ask for no forgiveness from harry and at bedtime would stand no questioning at harrys hands even though addressed as young cain  ive been beaten said he and ive done other things i dont care what i do if you speak to me tonight harry ill get out and try to kill you now you can kill me if you like  harry took his bed into the spareroom and black sheep lay down to die  it may be that the makers of noahs arks know that their animals are likely to find their way into young mouths and paint them accordingly certain it is that the common weary next morning broke through the windows and found black sheep quite well and a good deal ashamed of himself but richer by the knowledge that he could in extremity secure himself against harry for the future  when he descended to breakfast on the first day of the holidays he was greeted with the news that harry aunty rosa and judy were going away to brighton while black sheep was to stay in the house with the servant his latest outbreak suited aunty rosas plans admirably it gave her good excuse for leaving the extra boy behind papa in bombay who really seemed to know a young sinners wants to the hour sent that week a package of new books and with these and the society of jane on boardwages black sheep was left alone for a month  the books lasted for ten days they were eaten too quickly in long gulps of fourandtwenty hours at a time then came days of doing absolutely nothing of dreaming dreams and marching imaginary armies up and down stairs of counting the number of banisters and of measuring the length and breadth of every room in handspansfifty down the side thirty across and fifty back again jane made many friends and after receiving black sheeps assurance that he would not tell of her absences went out daily for long hours black sheep would follow the rays of the sinking sun from the kitchen to the diningroom and thence upward to his own bedroom until all was gray dark and he ran down to the kitchen fire and read by its light he was happy in that he was left alone and could read as much as he pleased but later he grew afraid of the shadows of windowcurtains and the flapping of doors and the creaking of shutters he went out into the garden and the rustling of the laurelbushes frightened him  he was glad when they all returnedaunty rosa harry and judyfull of news and judy laden with gifts who could help loving loyal little judy in return for all her merry babblement black sheep confided to her that the distance from the halldoor to the top of the first landing was exactly one hundred and eightyfour handspans he had found it out himself  then the old life recommenced but with a difference and a new sin to his other iniquities black sheep had now added a phenomenal clumsinesswas as unfit to trust in action as he was in word he himself could not account for spilling everything he touched upsetting glasses as he put his hand out and bumping his head against doors that were manifestly shut there was a gray haze upon all his world and it narrowed month by month until at last it left black sheep almost alone with the flapping curtains that were so like ghosts and the nameless terrors of broad daylight that were only coats on pegs after all  holidays came and holidays went and black sheep was taken to see many people whose faces were all exactly alike was beaten when occasion demanded and tortured by harry on all possible occasions but defended by judy through good and evil report though she hereby drew upon herself the wrath of aunty rosa  the weeks were interminable and papa and mamma were clean forgotten harry had left school and was a clerk in a bankingoffice freed from his presence black sheep resolved that he should no longer be deprived of his allowance of pleasurereading consequently when he failed at school he reported that all was well and conceived a large contempt for aunty rosa as he saw how easy it was to deceive her she says im a little liar when i dont tell lies and now i do she does nt know thought black sheep aunty rosa had credited him in the past with petty cunning and stratagem that had never entered into his head by the light of the sordid knowledge that she had revealed to him he paid her back full tale in a household where the most innocent of his motives his natural yearning for a little affection had been interpreted into a desire for more bread and jam or to ingratiate himself with strangers and so put harry into the background his work was easy aunty rosa could penetrate certain kinds of hypocrisy but not all he set his childs wits against hers and was no more beaten it grew monthly more and more of a trouble to read the schoolbooks and even the pages of the openprint storybooks danced and were dim so black sheep brooded in the shadows that fell about him and cut him off from the world inventing horrible punishments for dear harry or plotting another line of the tangled web of deception that he wrapped round aunty rosa  then the crash came and the cobwebs were broken it was impossible to foresee everything aunty rosa made personal inquiries as to black sheeps progress and received information that startled her step by step with a delight as keen as when she convicted an underfed housemaid of the theft of cold meats she followed the trail of black sheeps delinquencies for weeks and weeks in order to escape banishment from the bookshelves he had made a fool of aunty rosa of harry of god of all the world horrible most horrible and evidence of an utterly depraved mind  black sheep counted the cost it will only be one big beating and then shell put a card with liar on my back same as she did before harry will whack me and pray for me and she will pray for me at prayers and tell me im a child of the devil and give me hymns to learn but ive done all my reading and she never knew shell say she knew all along shes an old liar too said he  for three days black sheep was shut in his own bedroomto prepare his heart that means two beatings one at school and one here that one will hurt most and it fell even as he thought he was thrashed at school before the jews and the hubshi for the heinous crime of bringing home false reports of progress he was thrashed at home by aunty rosa on the same count and then the placard was produced aunty rosa stitched it between his shoulders and bade him go for a walk with it upon him  if you make me do that said black sheep very quietly i shall burn this house down and perhaps ill kill you i dont know whether i can kill youyou re so bonybut ill try  no punishment followed this blasphemy though black sheep held himself ready to work his way to aunty rosas withered throat and grip there till he was beaten off perhaps aunty rosa was afraid for black sheep having reached the nadir of sin bore himself with a new recklessness  in the midst of all the trouble there came a visitor from over the seas to downe lodge who knew papa and mamma and was commissioned to see punch and judy black sheep was sent to the drawingroom and charged into a solid teatable laden with china  gently gently little man said the visitor turning black sheeps face to the light slowly whats that big bird on the palings  what bird asked black sheep  the visitor looked deep down into black sheeps eyes for a half a minute and then said suddenly good god the little chaps nearly blind  it was a most businesslike visitor he gave orders on his own responsibility that black sheep was not to go to school or open a book until mamma came home shell be here in three weeks as you know of course said he and im inverarity sahib i ushered you into this wicked world young man and a nice use you seem to have made of your time you must do nothing whatever can you do that  yes said punch in a dazed way he had known that mamma was coming there was a chance then of another beating thank heaven papa was nt coming too aunty rosa had said of late that he ought to be beaten by a man  for the next three weeks black sheep was strictly allowed to do nothing he spent his time in the old nursery looking at the broken toys for all of which account must be rendered to mamma aunty rosa hit him over the hands if even a wooden boat were broken but that sin was of small importance compared to the other revelations so darkly hinted at by aunty rosa when your mother comes and hears what i have to tell her she may appreciate you properly she said grimly and mounted guard over judy lest that small maiden should attempt to comfort her brother to the peril of her own soul  and mamma camein a fourwheeler and a flutter of tender excitement such a mamma she was young frivolously young and beautiful with delicately flushed cheeks eyes that shone like stars and a voice that needed no additional appeal of outstretched arms to draw little ones to her heart judy ran straight to her but black sheep hesitated could this wonder be showing off she would not put out her arms when she knew of his crimes meantime was it possible that by fondling she wanted to get anything out of black sheep only all his love and all his confidence but that black sheep did not know aunty rosa withdrew and left mamma kneeling between her children half laughing half crying in the very hall where punch and judy had wept five years before  well chicks do you remember me  no said judy frankly but i said god bless papa and mamma evvy night  a little said black sheep remember i wrote to you every week anyhow that is nt to show off but cause of what comes afterward  what comes after what should come after my darling boy and she drew him to her again he came awkwardly with many angles not used to petting said the quick mothersoul the girl is  shes too little to hurt anyone thought black sheep and if i said id kill her shed be afraid i wonder what aunty rosa will tell  there was a constrained late dinner at the end of which mamma picked up judy and put her to bed with endearments manifold faithless little judy had shown her defection from aunty rosa already and that lady resented it bitterly black sheep rose to leave the room  come and say good night said aunty rosa offering a withered cheek  huh said black sheep i never kiss you and im not going to show off tell that woman what ive done and see what she says  black sheep climbed into bed feeling that he had lost heaven after a glimpse through the gates in half an hour that woman was bending over him black sheep flung up his right arm it was nt fair to come and hit him in the dark even aunty rosa never tried that but no blow followed  are you showing off i wont tell you anything more than aunty rosa has and she does nt know everything said black sheep as clearly as he could for the

all the love in the world will not wholly take away that knowledge though it may turn darkened eyes for a while to the light and teach faith where no faith was     v  wee willie winkie  an officer and a gentleman   his full name was percival william williams but he picked up the other name in a nurserybook and that was the end of the christened titles his mothers ayah called him williebaba but as he never paid the faintest attention to anything that the ayah said her wisdom did not help matters  his father was the colonel of the 195th and as soon as wee willie winkie was old enough to understand what military discipline meant colonel williams put him under it there was no other way of managing the child when he was good for a week he drew goodconduct pay and when he was bad he was deprived of his goodconductstripe generally he was bad for india offers so many chances to little sixyearolds of going wrong  children resent familiarity from strangers and wee willie winkie was a very particular child once he accepted an acquaintance he was graciously pleased to thaw he accepted brandis a subaltern of the 195th on sight brandis was having tea at the colonels and wee willie winkie entered strong in the possession of a goodconduct badge won for not chasing the hens round the compound he regarded brandis with gravity for at least ten minutes and then delivered himself of his opinion  i like you said he slowly getting off his chair and coming over to brandis i like you i shall call you coppy because of your hair do you mind being called coppy it is because of ve hair you know  here was one of the most embarrassing of wee willie winkies peculiarities he would look at a stranger for some time and then without warning or explanation would give him a name and the name stuck no regimental penalties could break wee willie winkie of this habit he lost his goodconduct badge for christening the commissioners wife pobs but nothing that the colonel could do made the station forego the nickname and mrs collen remained mrs pobs till the end of her stay so brandis was christened coppy and rose therefore in the estimation of the regiment  if wee willie winkie took an interest in anyone the fortunate man was envied alike by the mess and the rank and file and in their envy lay no suspicion of selfinterest the colonels son was idolized on his own merits entirely yet wee willie winkie was not lovely his face was permanently freckled as his legs were permanently scratched and in spite of his mothers almost tearful remonstrances he had insisted upon having his long yellow locks cut short in the military fashion i want my hair like sergeant tummils said wee willie winkie and his father abetting the sacrifice was accomplished  three weeks after the bestowal of his youthful affections on lieutenant brandishenceforward to be called coppy for the sake of brevitywee willie winkie was destined to behold strange things and far beyond his comprehension  coppy returned his liking with interest coppy had let him wear for five rapturous minutes his own big swordjust as tall as wee willie winkie coppy had promised him a terrier puppy and coppy had permitted him to witness the miraculous operation of shaving nay morecoppy had said that even he wee willie winkie would rise in time to the ownership of a box of shiny knives a silver soapbox and a silverhandled sputterbrush as wee willie winkie called it decidedly there was no one except his father who could give or take away goodconduct badges at pleasure half so wise strong and valiant as coppy with the afghan and egyptian medals on his breast why then should coppy be guilty of the unmanly weakness of kissingvehemently kissinga big girl miss allardyce to wit in the course of a morning ride wee willie winkie had seen coppy so doing and like the gentleman he was had promptly wheeled round and cantered back to his groom lest the groom should also see  under ordinary circumstances he would have spoken to his father but he felt instinctively that this was a matter on which coppy ought first to be consulted  coppy shouted wee willie winkie reining up outside that subalterns bungalow early one morningi want to see you coppy  come in young un returned coppy who was at early breakfast in the midst of his dogs what mischief have you been getting into now  wee willie winkie had done nothing notoriously bad for three days and so stood on a pinnacle of virtue  ive been doing nothing bad said he curling himself into a long chair with a studious affectation of the colonels langour after a hot parade he buried his freckled nose in a teacup and with eyes staring roundly over the rim asked i say coppy is it pwoper to kiss big girls  by jove youre beginning early who do you want to kiss  no one my muvvers always kissing me if i dont stop her if it is nt pwoper how was you kissing major allardyces big girl last morning by ve canal  coppys brow wrinkled he and miss allardyce had with great craft managed to keep their engagement secret for a fortnight there were urgent and imperative reasons why major allardyce should not know how matters stood for at least another month and this small marplot had discovered a great deal too much  i saw you said wee willie winkle calmly but ve groom did nt see i said hut jao  oh you had that much sense you young rip groaned poor coppy half amused and half angry and how many people may you have told about it  only me myself you did nt tell when i twied to wide ve buffalo ven my pony was lame and i fought you would nt like  winkie said coppy enthusiastically shaking the small hand youre the best of good fellows look here you cant understand all these things one of these dayshang it how can i make you see itim going to marry miss allardyce and then shell be mrs coppy as you say if your young mind is so scandalized at the idea of kissing big girls go and tell your father  what will happen said wee willie winkie who firmly believed that his father was omnipotent  i shall get into trouble said coppy playing his trump card with an appealing look at the holder of the ace  ven i wont said wee willie winkie briefly but my faver says its unmanly to be always kissing and i did nt fink youd do vat coppy  im not always kissing old chap its only now and then and when youre bigger youll do it too your father meant its not good for little boys  ah said wee willie winkle now fully enlightened its like ve sputterbrush  exactly said coppy gravely  but i dont fink ill ever want to kiss big girls nor no one cept my muvver and i must vat you know  there was a long pause broken by wee willie winkie  are you fond of vis big girl coppy  awfully said coppy  fonder van you are of bell or ve butchaor me  its in a different way said coppy you see one of these days miss allardyce will belong to me but youll grow up and command the regiment andall sorts of things its quite different you see  very well said wee willie winkie rising if youre fond of ve big girl i wont tell anyone i must go now  coppy rose and escorted his small guest to the door adding youre the best of little fellows winkie i tell you what in thirty days from now you can tell if you liketell anyone you like  thus the secret of the brandisallardyce engagement was dependent on a little childs word coppy who knew wee willie winkies idea of truth was at ease for he felt that he would not break promises wee willie winkie betrayed a special and unusual interest in miss allardyce and slowly revolving round that embarrassed young lady was used to regard her gravely with unwinking eye he was trying to discover why coppy should have kissed her she was not half so nice as his own mother on the other hand she was coppys property and would in time belong to him therefore it behooved him to treat her with as much respect as coppys big sword or shiny pistol  the idea that he shared a great secret in common with coppy kept wee willie winkie unusually virtuous for three weeks then the old adam broke out and he made what he called a campfire at the bottom of the garden how could he have foreseen that the flying sparks would have lighted the colonels little hayrick and consumed a weeks store for the horses sudden and swift was the punishmentdeprivation of the goodconduct badge and most sorrowful of all two days confinement to barracksthe house and verandacoupled with the withdrawal of the light of his fathers countenance  he took the sentence like the man he strove to be drew himself up with a quivering underlip saluted and once clear of the room ran to weep bitterly in his nurserycalled by him my quarters coppy came in the afternoon and attempted to console the culprit  im under awwest said wee willie winkie mournfully and i did nt ought to speak to you  very early the next morning he climbed on to the roof of the housethat was not forbiddenand beheld miss allardyce going for a ride  where are you going cried wee willie winkie  across the river she answered and trotted forward  now the cantonment in which the 195th lay was bounded on the north by a riverdry in the winter from his earliest years wee willie winkie had been forbidden to go across the river and had noted that even coppythe almost almighty coppyhad never set foot beyond it wee willie winkie had once been read to out of a big blue book the history of the princess and the goblinsa most wonderful tale of a land where the goblins were always warring with the children of men until they were defeated by one curdie ever since that date it seemed to him that the bare black and purple hills across the river were inhabited by goblins and in truth everyone had said that there lived the bad men even in his own house the lower halves of the windows were covered with green paper on account of the bad men who might if allowed clear view fire into peaceful drawingrooms and comfortable bedrooms certainly beyond the river which was the end of all the earth lived the bad men and here was major allardyces big girl coppys property preparing to venture into their borders what would coppy say if anything happened to her if the goblins ran off with her as they did with curdies princess she must at all hazards be turned back  the house was still wee willie winkie reflected for a moment on the very terrible wrath of his father and thenbroke his arrest it was a crime unspeakable the low sun threw his shadow very large and very black on the trim gardenpaths as he went down to the stables and ordered his pony it seemed to him in the hush of the dawn that all the big world had been bidden to stand still and look at wee willie winkie guilty of mutiny the drowsy groom handed him his mount and since the one great sin made all others insignificant wee willie winkie said that he was going to ride over to coppy sahib and went out at a footpace stepping on the soft mould of the flowerborders  the devastating track of the ponys feet was the last misdeed that cut him off from all sympathy of humanity he turned into the road leaned forward and rode as fast as the pony could put foot to the ground in the direction of the river  but the liveliest of twelvetwo ponies can do little against the long canter of a waler miss allardyce was far ahead had passed through the crops beyond the policepost when all the guards were asleep and her mount was scattering the pebbles of the river bed as wee willie winkie left the cantonment and british india behind him bowed forward and still flogging wee willie winkie shot into afghan territory and could just see miss allardyce a black speck flickering across the stony plain the reason of her wandering was simple enough coppy in a tone of toohastilyassumed authority had told her over night that she must not ride out by the river and she had gone to prove her own spirit and teach coppy a lesson  almost at the foot of the inhospitable hills wee willie winkie saw the waler blunder and come down heavily miss allardyce struggled clear but her ankle had been severely twisted and she could not stand having thus demonstrated her spirit she wept copiously and was surprised by the apparition of a white wideeyed child in khaki on a nearly spent pony  are you badly badly hurted shouted wee willie winkie as soon as he was within range you did nt ought to be here  i dont know said miss allardyce ruefully ignoring the reproof good gracious child what are you doing here  you said you was going acwoss ve wiver panted wee willie winkie throwing himself off his pony and nobodynot even coppymust go acwoss ve wiver and i came after you ever so hard but you would nt stop and now you ve hurted yourself and coppy will be angry wiv me andive bwoken my awwest ive bwoken my awwest  the future colonel of the 195th sat down and sobbed in spite of the pain in her ankle the girl was moved  have you ridden all the way from cantonments little man what for  you belonged to coppy coppy told me so wailed wee willie winkie disconsolately i saw him kissing you and he said he was fonder of you van bell or ve butcha or me and so i came you must get up and come back you did nt ought to be here vis is a bad place and i ve bwoken my awwest  i cant move winkie said miss allardyce with a groan ive hurt my foot what shall i do  she showed a readiness to weep afresh which steadied wee willie winkie who had been brought up to believe that tears were the depth of unmanliness still when one is as great a sinner as wee willie winkie even a man may be permitted to break down  winkie said miss allardyce when youve rested a little ride back and tell them to send out something to carry me back in it hurts fearfully  the child sat still for a little time and miss allardyce closed her eyes the pain was nearly making her faint she was roused by wee willie winkie tying up the reins on his ponys neck and setting it free with a vicious cut of his whip that made it whicker the little animal headed toward the cantonments  oh winkie what are you doing  hush said wee willie winkie veres a man comingone of ve bad men i must stay wiv you my faver says a man must always look after a girl jack will go home and ven vey ll come and look for us vat s why i let him go  not one man but two or three had appeared from behind the rocks of the hills and the heart of wee willie winkie sank within him for just in this manner were the goblins wont to steal out and vex curdies soul thus had they played in curdies garden he had seen the picture and thus had they frightened the princesss nurse he heard them talking to each other and recognized with joy the bastard pushto that he had picked up from one of his fathers grooms lately dismissed people who spoke that tongue could not be the bad men they were only natives after all  they came up to the boulders on which miss allardyces horse had blundered  then rose from the rock wee willie winkie child of the dominant race aged six and threequarters and said briefly and emphatically jao the pony had crossed the riverbed  the men laughed and laughter from natives was the one thing wee willie winkie could not tolerate he asked them what they wanted and why they did not depart other men with most evil faces and crookedstocked guns crept out of the shadows of the hills till soon wee willie winkie was face to face with an audience some twenty strong miss allardyce screamed  who are you said one of the men  i am the colonel sahibs son and my order is that you go at once you black men are frightening the miss sahib one of you must run into cantonments and take the news that the miss sahib has hurt herself and that the colonels son is here with her  put our feet into the trap was the laughing reply hear this boys speech  say that i sent youi the colonels son they will give you money  what is the use of this talk take up the child and the girl and we can at least ask for the ransom ours are the villages on the heights said a voice in the background  these were the bad menworse than goblinsand it needed all wee willie winkies training to prevent him from bursting into tears but he felt that to cry before a native excepting only his mothers ayah would be an infamy greater than any mutiny moreover he as future colonel of the 195th had that grim regiment at his back  are you going to carry us away said wee willie winkie very blanched and uncomfortable  yes my little sahib bahadur said the tallest of the men and eat you afterward  that is childs talk said wee willie winkie men do not eat men  a yell of laughter interrupted him but he went on firmlyand if you do carry us away i tell you that all my regiment will come up in a day and kill you all without leaving one who will take my message to the colonel sahib  speech in any vernacularand wee willie winkie had a colloquial acquaintance with threewas easy to the boy who could not yet manage his rs and ths aright  another man joined the conference crying oh foolish men what this babe says is true he is the hearts heart of those white troops for the sake of peace let them go both for if he be taken the regiment will break loose and gut the valley our villages are in the valley and we shall not escape that regiment are devils they broke khoda yars breastbone with kicks when he tried to take the rifles and if we touch this child they will fire and rape and plunder for a month till nothing remains better to send a man back to take the message and get a reward i say that this child is their god and that they will spare none of us nor our women if we harm him  it was din mahommed the dismissed groom of the colonel who made the diversion and an angry and heated discussion followed wee willie winkie standing over miss allardyce waited the upshot surely his wegiment his own wegiment would not desert him if they knew of his extremity                                       the riderless pony brought the news to the 195th though there had been consternation in the colonels household for an hour before the little beast came in through the paradeground in front of the main barracks where the men were settling down to play spoilfive till the afternoon devlin the colour sergeant of e company glanced at the empty saddle and tumbled through the barrackrooms kicking up each room corporal as he passed up ye beggars theres something happened to the colonels son he shouted  he could nt fall off selp me e could nt fall off blubbered a drummerboy go an hunt acrost the river hes over there if hes anywhere an maybe those pathans have got im for the love o gawd dont look for im in the nullahs lets go over the river  theres sense in mott yet said devlin e company double out to the riversharp  so e company in its shirtsleeves mainly doubled for the dear life and in the rear toiled the perspiring sergeant adjuring it to double yet faster the cantonment was alive with the men of the 195th hunting for wee willie winkie and the colonel finally overtook e company far too exhausted to swear struggling in the pebbles of the riverbed  up the hill under which wee willie winkies bad men were discussing the wisdom of carrying off the child and the girl a lookout fired two shots  what have i said shouted din mahommed there is the warning the pulton are out already and are coming across the plain get away let us not be seen with the boy  the men waited for an instant and then as another shot was fired withdrew into the hills silently as they had appeared  the wegiment is coming said wee willie winkie confidently to miss allardyce and its all wight dont cwy  he needed the advice himself for ten minutes later when his father came up he was weeping bitterly with his head in miss allardyces lap  and the men of the 195th carried him home with shouts and rejoicings and coppy who had ridden a horse into a lather met him and to his intense disgust kissed him openly in the presence of the men  but there was balm for his dignity his father assured him that not only would the breaking of arrest be condoned but that the goodconduct badge would be restored as soon as his mother could sew it on his blousesleeve miss allardyce had told the colonel a story that made him proud of his son  she belonged to you coppy said wee willie winkie indicating miss allardyce with a grimy forefinger i knew she did nt ought to go acwoss ve wiver and i knew ve wegiment would come to me if i sent jack home  youre a hero winkie said coppya pukka hero  i dont know what vat means said wee willie winkie but you

steeringwheel     to her figurehead of silver and her beak of hammered steel     the legbar chafed the ankle and we gasped for cooler air     but no galley on the water with our galley could compare      our bulkheads bulged with cotton and our masts were stepped in gold     we ran a mighty merchandise of negroes in the hold     the white foam spun behind us and the black shark swam below     as we gripped the kicking sweephead and we made that galley go      it was merry in the galley for we revelled now and then     if they wore us down like cattle faith we fought and loved like men     as we snatched her through the water so we snatched a minutes bliss     and the mutter of the dying never spoiled the lovers kiss      our women and our children toiled beside us in the dark     they died we filed their fetters and we heaved them to the shark     we heaved them to the fishes but so fast the galley sped     we had only time to envy for we could not mourn our dead      bear witness once my comrades what a hardbit gang were we     the servants of the sweephead but the masters of the sea     by the hands that drove her forward as she plunged and yawed and         sheered     woman man or god or devil was there anything we feared      was it storm our fathers faced it and a wilder never blew     earth that waited for the wreckage watched the galley struggle through     burning noon or choking midnight sickness sorrow parting death     nay our very babes would mock you had they time for idle breath      but today i leave the galley and another takes my place     theres my name

take awhile his oar     but today i leave the galley shall i curse her service then     god be thankedwhateer comes after i have lived and toiled with men     vii  the ship that found herself   it was her first voyage and though she was but a cargosteamer of twentyfive hundred tons she was the very best of her kind the outcome of forty years of experiments and improvements in framework and machinery and her designers and owner thought as much of her as though she had been the lucania anyone can make a floating hotel that will pay expenses if he puts enough money into the saloon and charges for private baths suites of rooms and such like but in these days of competition and low freights every square inch of a cargoboat must be built for cheapness great holdcapacity and a certain steady speed this boat was perhaps two hundred and forty feet long and thirtytwo feet wide with arrangements that enabled her to carry cattle on her main and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted to but her great glory was the amount of cargo that she could store away in her holds her ownersthey were a very wellknown scotch firmcame round with her from the north where she had been launched and christened and fitted to liverpool where she was to take cargo for new york and the owners daughter miss frazier went to and fro on the clean decks admiring the new paint and the brass work and the patent winches and particularly the strong straight bow over which she had cracked a bottle of champagne when she named the steamer the dimbula it was a beautiful september afternoon and the boat in all her newnessshe was painted leadcolour with a red funnellooked very fine indeed her houseflag was flying and her whistle from time to time acknowledged the salutes of friendly boats who saw that she was new to the high and narrow seas and wished to make her welcome  and now said miss frazier delightedly to the captain shes a real ship is nt she it seems only the other day father gave the order for her and nowand nowis nt she a beauty the girl was proud of the firm and talked as though she were the controlling partner  oh shes no so bad the skipper replied cautiously but im sayin that it takes more than christenin to mak a ship in the nature o things miss frazier if ye follow me shes just irons and rivets and plates put into the form of a ship she has to find herself yet  i thought father said she was exceptionally well found  so she is said the skipper with a laugh but its this way wi ships miss frazier shes all here but the parrts of her have not learned to work together yet theyve had no chance  the engines are working beautifully i can hear them  yes indeed but theres more than engines to a ship every inch of her yell understand has to be livened up and made to work wi its neighboursweetenin her we call it technically  and how will you do it the girl asked  we can no more than drive and steer her and so forth but if we have rough weather this tripits likelyshell learn the rest by heart for a ship yell obsairve miss frazier is in no sense a reegid body closed at both ends shes a highly complex structure o various an conflictin strains wi tissues that must give an tak accordin to her personal modulus of elasteecity mr buchanan the chief engineer was coming toward them im sayin to miss frazier here that our little dimbula has to be sweetened yet and nothin but a gale will do it hows all wi your engines buck  well enoughtrue by plumb an rule o course but theres no spontaneeity yet he turned to the girl take my word miss frazier and maybe yell comprehend later even after a pretty girls christened a ship it does not follow that theres such a thing as a ship under the men that work her  i was sayin the very same mr buchanan the skipper interrupted  thats more metaphysical than i can follow said miss frazier laughing  why so yere good scotch ani knew your mothers father he was fra dumfriesyeve a vested right in metapheesics miss frazier just as ye have in the dimbula the engineer said  eh well we must go down to the deep watters an earn miss frazier her deevidends will you not come to my cabin for tea said the skipper well be in dock the night and when youre goin back to glasgie ye can think of us loadin her down an drivin her forthall for your sake  in the next few days they stowed some four thousand tons dead weight into the dimbula and took her out from liverpool as soon as she met the lift of the open water she naturally began to talk if you lay your ear to the side of the cabin next time you are in a steamer you will hear hundreds of little voices in every direction thrilling and buzzing and whispering and popping and gurgling and sobbing and squeaking exactly like a telephone in a thunderstorm wooden ships shriek and growl and grunt but iron vessels throb and quiver through all their hundreds of ribs and thousands of rivets the dimbula was very strongly built and every piece of her had a letter or number or both to describe it and every piece had been hammered or forged or rolled or punched by man and had lived in the roar and rattle of the shipyard for months therefore every piece had its own separate voice in exact proportion to the amount of trouble spent upon it castiron as a rule says very little but mild steel plates and wroughtiron and ribs and beams that have been much bent and welded and riveted talk continuously their conversation of course is not half as wise as our human talk because they are all though they do not know it bound down one to the other in a black darkness where they cannot tell what is happening near them nor what will overtake them next  as soon as she had cleared the irish coast a sullen grayheaded old wave of the atlantic climbed leisurely over her straight bows and sat down on her steamcapstan used for hauling up the anchor now the capstan and the engine that drove it had been newly painted red and green besides which nobody likes being ducked  dont you do that again the capstan sputtered through the teeth of his cogs hi wheres the fellow gone  the wave had slouched overside with a plop and a chuckle but plenty more where he came from said a brotherwave and went through and over the capstan who was bolted firmly to an iron plate on the iron deckbeams below  cant you keep still up there said the deckbeams whats the matter with you one minute you weigh twice as much as you ought to and the next you dont  it is nt my fault said the capstan theres a green brute outside that comes and hits me on the head  tell that to the shipwrights youve been in position for months and youve never wriggled like this before if you are nt careful youll strain us  talking of strain said a low rasping unpleasant voice are any of you fellowsyou deckbeams we meanaware that those exceedingly ugly knees of yours happen to be riveted into our structureours  who might you be the deckbeams inquired  oh nobody in particular was the answer were only the port and starboard upperdeck stringers and if you persist in heaving and hiking like this we shall be reluctantly compelled to take steps  now the stringers of the ship are long iron girders so to speak that run lengthways from stern to bow they keep the iron frames what are called ribs in a wooden ship in place and also help to hold the ends of the deckbeams which go from side to side of the ship stringers always consider themselves most important because they are so long  you will take stepswill you this was a long echoing rumble it came from the framesscores and scores of them each one about eighteen inches distant from the next and each riveted to the stringers in four places we think you will have a certain amount of trouble in that and thousands and thousands of the little rivets that held everything together whispered you will you will stop quivering and be quiet hold on brethren hold on hot punches whats that  rivets have no teeth so they cannot chatter with fright but they did their best as a fluttering jar swept along the ship from stern to bow and she shook like a rat in a terriers mouth  an unusually severe pitch for the sea was rising had lifted the big throbbing screw nearly to the surface and it was spinning round in a kind of sodawaterhalf sea and half airgoing much faster than was proper because there was no deep water for it to work in as it sank again the enginesand they were triple expansion three cylinders in a rowsnorted through all their three pistons was that a joke you fellow outside its an uncommonly poor one how are we to do our work if you fly off the handle that way  i did nt fly off the handle said the screw twirling huskily at the end of the screwshaft if i had youd have been scrapiron by this time the sea dropped away from under me and i had nothing to catch on to thats all  thats all dyou call it said the thrustblock whose business it is to take the push of the screw for if a screw had nothing to hold it back it would crawl right into the engineroom it is the holding back of the screwing action that gives the drive to a ship i know i do my work deep down and out of sight but i warn you i expect justice all i ask for is bare justice why cant you push steadily and evenly instead of whizzing like a whirligig and making me hot under all my collars the thrustblock had six collars each faced with brass and he did not wish to get them heated  all the bearings that supported the fifty feet of screwshaft as it ran to the stern whispered justicegive us justice  i can only give you what i can get the screw answered look out its coming again  he rose with a roar as the dimbula plunged and whackflackwhackwhack went the engines furiously for they had little to check them  im the noblest outcome of human ingenuitymr buchanan says so squealed the highpressure cylinder this is simply ridiculous the piston went up savagely and choked for half the steam behind it was mixed with dirty water help oiler fitter stoker help im choking it gasped never in the history of maritime invention has such a calamity overtaken one so young and strong and if i go whos to drive the ship  hush oh hush whispered the steam who of course had been to sea many times before he used to spend his leisure ashore in a cloud or a gutter or a flowerpot or a thunderstorm or anywhere else where water was needed thats only a little priming a little carryingover as they call it itll happen all night on and off i dont say its nice but its the best we can do under the circumstances  what difference can circumstances make im here to do my workon clean dry steam blow circumstances the cylinder roared  the circumstances will attend to the blowing ive worked on the north atlantic run a good many timesits going to be rough before morning  it is nt distressingly calm now said the extrastrong framesthey were called webframesin the engineroom theres an upward thrust that we dont understand and theres a twist that is very bad for our brackets and diamondplates and theres a sort of westnorthwesterly pull that follows the twist which seriously annoys us we mention this because we happened to cost a good deal of money and we feel sure that the owner would not approve of our being treated in this frivolous way  im afraid the matter is out of owners hand for the present said the steam slipping into the condenser youre left to your own devices till the weather betters  i would nt mind the weather said a flat bass voice below its this confounded cargo thats breaking my heart im the garboardstrake and im twice as thick as most of the others and i ought to know something  the garboardstrake is the lowest plate in the bottom of a ship and the dimbulas garboardstrake was nearly threequarters of an inch mild steel  the sea pushes me up in a way i should never have expected the strake grunted and the cargo pushes me down and between the two i dont know what im supposed to do  when in doubt hold on rumbled the steam making head in the boilers  yes but theres only dark and cold and hurry down here and how do i know whether the other plates are doing their duty those bulwarkplates up above ive heard aint more than fivesixteenths of an inch thickscandalous i call it  i agree with you said a huge webframe by the main cargohatch he was deeper and thicker than all the others and curved halfway across the ship in the shape of half an arch to support the deck where deck beams would have been in the way of cargo coming up and down i work entirely unsupported and i observe that i am the sole strength of this vessel so far as my vision extends the responsibility i assure you is enormous i believe the moneyvalue of the cargo is over one hundred and fifty thousand pounds think of that  and every pound of it is dependent on my personal exertions here spoke a seavalve that communicated directly with the water outside and was seated not very far from the garboardstrake i rejoice to think that i am a princehyde valve with best para rubber facings five patents cover mei mention this without pridefive separate and several patents each one finer than the other at present i am screwed fast should i open you would immediately be swamped this is incontrovertible  patent things always use the longest words they can it is a trick that they pick up from their inventors  thats news said a big centrifugal bilgepump i had an idea that you were employed to clean decks and things with at least ive used you for that more than once i forget the precise number in thousands of gallons which i am guaranteed to throw per hour but i assure you my complaining friends that there is not the least danger i alone am capable of clearing any water that may find its way here by my biggest deliveries we pitched then  the sea was getting up in workmanlike style it was a dead westerly gale blown from under a ragged opening of green sky narrowed on all sides by fat gray clouds and the wind bit like pincers as it fretted the spray into lacework on the flanks of the waves  i tell you what it is the foremast telephoned down its wirestays im up here and i can take a dispassionate view of things theres an organized conspiracy against us im sure of it because every single one of these waves is heading directly for our bows the whole sea is concerned in itand sos the wind its awful  whats awful said a wave drowning the capstan for the hundredth time  this organized conspiracy on your part the capstan gurgled taking his cue from the mast  organized bubbles and spindrift there has been a depression in the gulf of mexico excuse me he leaped overside but his friends took up the tale one after another  which has advanced that wave hove green water over the funnel  as far as cape hatteras he drenched the bridge  and is now going out to seato seato sea the third went free in three surges making a clean sweep of a boat which turned bottom up and sank in the darkening troughs alongside while the broken falls whipped the davits  thats all there is to it seethed the white water roaring through the scuppers theres no animus in our proceedings were only meteorological corollaries  is it going to get any worse said the bowanchor chained down to the deck where he could only breathe once in five minutes  not knowing cant say wind may blow a bit by midnight thanks awfully goodbye  the wave that spoke so politely had travelled some distance aft and found itself all mixed up on the deck amidships which was a welldeck sunk between high bulwarks one of the bulwark plates which was hung on hinges to open outward had swung out and passed the bulk of the water back to the sea again with a clean smack  evidently thats what im made for said the plate closing again with a sputter of pride oh no you dont my friend  the top of a wave was trying to get in from the outside but as the plate did not open in that direction the defeated water spurted back  not bad for fivesixteenths of an inch said the bulwarkplate my work i see is laid down for the night and it began opening and shutting as it was designed to do with the motion of the ship  we are not what you might call idle groaned all the frames together as the dimbula climbed a big wave lay on her side at the top and shot into the next hollow twisting in the descent a huge swell pushed up exactly under her middle and her bow and stern hung free with nothing to support them then one joking wave caught her up at the bow and another at the stern while the rest of the water slunk away from under her just to see how she would like it so she was held up at her two ends only and the weight of the cargo and the machinery fell on the groaning iron keels and bilgestringers  ease off ease off there roared the garboardstrake i want oneeighth of an inch fair play d you hear me you rivets  ease off ease off cried the bilgestringers dont hold us so tight to the frames  ease off grunted the deckbeams as the dimbula rolled fearfully youve cramped our knees into the stringers and we cant move ease off you flatheaded little nuisances  then two converging seas hit the bows one on each side and fell away in torrents of streaming thunder  ease off shouted the forward collisionbulkhead i want to crumple up but im stiffened in every direction ease off you dirty little forgefilings let me breathe  all the hundreds of plates that are riveted to the frames and make the outside skin of every steamer echoed the call for each plate wanted to shift and creep a little and each plate according to its position complained against the rivets  we cant help it we cant help it they murmured in reply were put here to hold you and were going to do it you never pull us twice in the same direction if youd say what you were going to do next wed try to meet your views  as far as i could feel said the upperdeck planking and that was four inches thick every single iron near me was pushing or pulling in opposite directions now whats the sense of that my friends let us all pull together  pull any way you please roared the funnel so long as you dont try your experiments on me i need fourteen wire ropes all pulling in different directions to hold me steady is nt that so  we believe you my boy whistled the funnelstays through their clinched teeth as they twanged in the wind from the top of the funnel to the deck  nonsense we must all pull together the decks repeated pull lengthways  very good said the stringers then stop pushing sideways when you get wet be content to run gracefully fore and aft and curve in at the ends as we do  nono curves at the end a very slight workmanlike curve from side to side with a good grip at each knee and little pieces welded on said the deckbeams  fiddle cried the iron pillars of the deep dark hold who ever heard of curves stand up straight be a perfectly round column and carry tons of good solid weightlike that there a big sea smashed on the deck above and the pillars stiffened themselves to the load  straight up and down is not bad said the frames who ran that way in the sides of the ship but you must also expand yourselves sideways expansion is the law of life children open out open out  come back said the deckbeams savagely as the upward heave of the sea made the frames try to open come back to your bearings you slackjawed irons  rigidity rigidity rigidity thumped the engines absolute unvarying rigidityrigidity  you see whined the rivets in chorus no two of you will ever pull alike andand you blame it all on us we only know how to go through a plate and bite down on both sides so that it cant and must nt and shant move  ive got onefraction of an inch play at any rate said the garboardstrake triumphantly so he had and all the bottom of the ship felt the easier for it  then were no good sobbed the bottom rivets we were orderedwe were orderednever to give and weve given and the sea will come in and well all go to the bottom together first were blamed for everything unpleasant and now we have nt the consolation of having done our work  dont say i told you whispered the steam consolingly but between you and me and the last cloud i came from it was bound to happen sooner or later you had to give a fraction and youve given without knowing it now hold on as before  whats the use a few hundred rivets chattered weve givenweve given and the sooner we confess that we cant keep the ship together and go off our little heads the easier it will be no rivet forged can stand this strain  no one rivet was ever meant to share it among you the steam answered  the others can have my share im going to pull out said a rivet in one of the forward plates  if you go others will follow hissed the steam theres nothing so contagious in a boat as rivets going why i knew a little chap like youhe was an eighth of an inch fatter thoughon a steamerto be sure she was only twelve hundred tons now i come to think of itin exactly the same place as you are he pulled out in a bit of a bobble of a sea not half as bad as this and he started all his friends on the same buttstrap and the plates opened like a furnace door and i had to climb into the nearest fogbank while the boat went down  now thats peculiarly disgraceful said the rivet fatter than me was he and in a steamer not half our tonnage reedy little peg i blush for the family sir he settled himself more firmly than ever in his place and the steam chuckled  you see he went on quite gravely a rivet and especially a rivet in your position is really the one indispensable part of the ship  the steam did not say that he had whispered the very same thing to every single piece of iron aboard there is no sense in telling too much truth  and all that while the little dimbula pitched and chopped and swung and slewed and lay down as though she were going to die and got up as though she had been stung and threw her nose round and round in circles half a dozen times as she dipped for the gale was at its worst it was inky black in spite of the tearing white froth on the waves and to top everything the rain began to fall in sheets so that you could not see your hand before your face this did not make much difference to the ironwork below but it troubled the foremast a good deal  now its all finished he said dismally the conspiracy is too strong for us there is nothing left but to  hurraar brrrraaah brrrrrrp roared the steam through the foghorn till the decks quivered dont be frightened below its only me just throwing out a few words in case any one happens to be rolling round tonight  you dont mean to say theres any one except us on the sea in such weather said the funnel in a husky snuffle  scores of em said the steam clearing its throat rrrrrraaa brraaaaa prrrrp its a trifle windy up here and great boilers how it rains  were drowning said the scuppers they had been doing nothing else all night but this steady thrash of rain above them seemed to be the end of the world  thats all right well be easier in an hour or two first the wind and then the rain soon you may make sail again grrraaaaaah drrrraaaa drrrp i have a notion that the sea is going down already if it does youll learn something about rolling weve only pitched till now by the way are nt you chaps in the hold a little easier than you were  there was just as much groaning and straining as ever but it was not so loud or squeaky in tone and when the ship quivered she did not jar stiffly like a poker hit on the floor but gave with a supple little waggle like a perfectly balanced golfclub  we have made a most amazing discovery said the stringers one after another a discovery that entirely changes the situation we have found for the first time in the history of shipbuilding that the inward pull of the deckbeams and the outward thrust of the frames locks us as it were more closely in our places and enables us to endure a strain which is entirely without parallel in the records of marine architecture  the steam turned a laugh quickly into a roar up the foghorn what massive intellects you great stringers have he said softly when he had finished  we also began the deckbeams are discoverers and geniuses we are of opinion that the support of the holdpillars materially helps us we find that we lock up on them when we are subjected to a heavy and singular weight of sea above  here the dimbula shot down a hollow lying almost on her siderighting at the bottom with a wrench and a spasm  in these casesare you aware of this steamthe plating at the bows and particularly at the sternwe would also mention the floors beneath ushelp us to resist any tendency to spring the frames spoke in the solemn awed voice which people use when they have just come across something entirely new for the very first time  im only a poor puffy little flutterer said the steam but i have to stand a good deal of pressure in my business its all tremendously interesting tell us some more you fellows are so strong  watch us and youll see said the bowplates proudly ready behind there heres the father and mother of waves coming sit tight rivets all a great sluicing comber thundered by but through the scuffle and confusion the steam could hear the low quick cries of the ironwork as the various strains took themcries like these easy noweasy now push for all your strength hold out give a fraction holdup pull in shove crossways mind the strain at the ends grip now bite tight let the water get away from underand there she goes  the wave raced off into the darkness shouting not bad that if its your first run and the drenched and ducked ship throbbed to the beat of the engines inside her all three cylinders were white with the salt spray that had come down through the engineroom hatch there was white fur on the canvasbound steampipes and even the brightwork deep below was speckled and soiled but the cylinders had learned to make the most of steam that was half water and were pounding along cheerfully  hows the noblest outcome of human ingenuity hitting it said the steam as he whirled through the engineroom  nothing for nothing in this world of woe the cylinders answered as though they had been working for centuries and precious little for seventyfive pounds head weve made two knots this last hour and a quarter rather humiliating for eight hundred horsepower is nt it  well its better than drifting astern at any rate you seem rather lesshow shall i put itstiff in the back than you were  if youd been hammered as weve been this night you would nt be stiffiffiff either theoretirettirettically of course rigidity is the thing purrrpurrpractically there has to be a little give and take we found that out by working on our sides for five minutes at a stretchchchchh hows the weather  seas going down fast said the steam  good business said the highpressure cylinder whack her up boys theyve given us five pounds more steam and he began humming the first bars of said the young obadiah to the old obadiah which as you may have noticed is a pet tune among engines not built for high speed racingliners with twinscrews sing the turkish patrol and the overture to the bronze horse and madame angot till something goes wrong and then they render gounods funeral march of a marionette with variations  youll learn a song of your own some fine day said the steam as he flew up the foghorn for one last bellow  next day the sky cleared and the sea dropped a little and the dimbula began to roll from side to side till every inch of iron in her was sick and giddy but luckily they did not all feel ill at the same time otherwise she would have opened out like a wet paper box  the steam whistled warnings as he went about his business it is in this short quick roll and tumble that follows a heavy sea that most of the accidents happen for then everything thinks that the worst is over and goes off guard so he orated and chattered till the beams and frames and floors and stringers and things had learned how to lock down and lock up on one another and endure this new kind of strain  they found ample time to practise for they were sixteen days at sea and it was foul weather till within a hundred miles of new york the dimbula picked up her pilot and came in covered with salt and red rust her funnel was dirty gray from top to bottom two boats had been carried away three copper ventilators looked like hats after a fight with the police the bridge had a dimple in the middle of it the house that covered the steam steeringgear was split as with hatchets there was a bill for small repairs in the engineroom almost as long as the screwshaft the forward cargohatch fell into bucketstaves when they raised the iron crossbars and the steamcapstan had been badly wrenched on its bed altogether as the skipper said it was a pretty general average  but shes soupled he said to mr buchanan for all her dead weight she rode like a yacht ye mind that last blow off the banks i am proud of her buck  its vera good said the chief engineer looking along the dishevelled decks now a man judgin superfeecially would say we were a wreck but we know otherwiseby experience  naturally everything in the dimbula fairly stiffened with pride and the foremast and the forward collisionbulkhead who are pushing creatures begged the steam to warn the port of new york of their arrival tell those big boats all about us they said they seem to take us quite as a matter of course  it was a glorious clear dead calm morning and in single file with less than half a mile between each their bands playing and their tugboats shouting and waving handkerchiefs were the majestic the paris the touraine the servia the kaiser wilhelm ii and the werkendam all statelily going out to sea as the dimbula shifted her helm to give the great boats clear way the steam who knows far too much to mind making an exhibition of himself now and then shouted  oyez oyez oyez princes dukes and barons of the high seas know ye by these presents we are the dimbula fifteen days nine hours from liverpool having crossed the atlantic with four thousand ton of cargo for the first time in our career we have not foundered we are here eer eer we are not disabled but we have had a time wholly unparalleled in the annals of shipbuilding our decks were swept we pitched we rolled we thought we were going to die hi hi but we did nt we wish to give notice that we have come to new york all the way across the atlantic through the worst weather in the world and we are the dimbula we arearrhahaharrr  the beautiful line of boats swept by as steadily as the procession of the seasons the dimbula heard the majestic say hmph and the paris grunted how and the touraine said oui with a little coquettish flicker of steam and the servia said haw and the kaiser and the werkendam said hoch dutch fashionand that was absolutely all  i did my best said the steam gravely but i dont think they were much impressed with us somehow do you  its simply disgusting said the bowplates they might have seen what weve been through there is nt a ship on the sea that has suffered as we haveis there now  well i would nt go so far as that said the steam because ive worked on some of those boats and sent them through weather quite as bad as the fortnight that weve had in six days and some of them are a little over ten thousand tons i believe now ive seen the majestic for instance ducked from her bows to her funnel and ive helped the arizona i think she was to back off an iceberg she met with one dark night and i had to run out of the pariss engineroom one day because there was thirty foot of water in it of course i dont deny the steam shut off suddenly as a tugboat loaded with a political club and a brass band that had been to see a new york senator off to europe crossed their bows going to hoboken there was a long silence that reached without a break from the cutwater to the propellerblades of the dimbula  then a new big voice said slowly and thickly as though the owner had just waked up its my conviction that i have made a fool of myself  the steam knew what had happened at once for when a ship finds herself all the talking of the separate pieces ceases and melts into one voice which is the soul of the ship  who are you he said with a laugh  i am the dimbula of course ive never been anything else except thatand a fool  the tugboat which was doing its very best to be run down got away just in time its band playing clashily and brassily a popular but impolite air      in the days of old ramesesare you on     in the days of old ramesesare you on     in the days of old rameses     that story had paresis     are you onare you onare you on  well im glad youve found yourself said the steam to tell the truth i was a little tired of talking to all those ribs and stringers heres quarantine after that well go to our wharf and clean up a little andnext month well do it all over again     i  a trip across a continent1       harvey n cheyne a spoiled darling perhaps fifteen years      old an americanfirst last and all the time had      staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail after      trying to smoke a wheeling stogie he was fainting from      seasickness and a roll of the ship tilted him over the      rail where a gray motherwave tucked him under one arm      he was picked up by the fishing schooner were here and      after many marvellous experiences among the sailors arrived      in port a happier and wiser fellow his telegram to his      father brings the following result   cheyne was flying to meet the only son so miraculously restored to him the bear was seeking his cub not the bulls hard men who had their knives drawn to fight for their financial lives put away the weapons and wished him godspeed while half a dozen panicsmitten tinpot roads perked up their heads and spoke of the wonderful things they would have done had not cheyne buried the hatchet  footnote 1 a selection from captains courageous copyrighted by the century company  it was a busy weekend among the wires for now that their anxiety was removed men and cities hastened to accommodate los angeles called to san diego and barstow that the southern california engineers might know and be ready in their lonely roundhouses barstow passed the word to the atlantic

changing engines three for watering and two for coaling warn the men and arrange tanks and chutes accordingly for harvey cheyne is in a hurry a hurryhurry sang the wires forty miles an hour will be expected and division superintendents will accompany this special over their respective divisions from san diego to sixteenth street chicago let the magic carpet be laid down hurry oh hurry  it will be hot said cheyne as they rolled out of san diego in the dawn of sunday were going to hurry mamma just as fast as ever we can but i really dont think theres any good of your putting on your bonnet and gloves yet youd much better lie down and take your medicine id play you a game o dominoes but its sunday  ill be good oh i will be good onlytaking off my bonnet makes me feel as if wed never get there  try to sleep a little mamma and well be in chicago before you know  but its boston father tell them to hurry  the sixfoot drivers were hammering their way to san bernardino and the mohave wastes but this was no grade for speed that would come later the heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned east to the needles and the colorado river the car cracked in the utter drought and glare and they put crushed ice to mrs cheynes neck and toiled up the long long grades past ash fork toward flagstaff where the forests and quarries are under the dry remote skies the needle of the speedindicator flicked and wagged to and fro the cinders rattled on the roof and a whirl of dust sucked after the whirling wheels the crew of the combination sat on their bunks panting in their shirtsleeves and cheyne found himself among them shouting old old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows above the roar of the car he told them about his son and how the sea had given up its dead and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him asked after her back there and whether she could stand it if the engineer let her out a piece and cheyne thought she could accordingly the great firehorse was let out from flagstaff to winslow till a division superintendent protested  but mrs cheyne in the boudoir stateroom where the french maid sallowwhite with fear clung to the silver doorhandle only moaned a little and begged her husband to bid them hurry and so they dropped the dry sands and moonstruck rocks of arizona behind them and grilled on till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze of the brakehose told them they were at coolidge by the continental divide  three bold and experienced mencool confident and dry when they began white quivering and wet when they finished their trick at those terrible wheelsswung her over the great lift from albuquerque to glorietta and beyond springer up and up to the raton tunnel on the state line whence they dropped rocking into la junta had sight of the arkansaw and tore down the long slope to dodge city where cheyne took comfort once again from setting his watch an hour ahead  there was very little talk in the car the secretary and typewriter sat together on the stamped spanishleather cushions by the plateglass observationwindow at the rear end watching the surge and ripple of the ties crowded back behind them and it is believed making notes of the scenery cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant gorgeousness and the naked necessity of the combination an unlit cigar in his teeth till the pitying crews forgot that he was their tribal enemy and did their best to entertain him  at night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all the luxuries and they fared sumptuously swinging on through the emptiness of abject desolation now they heard the swish of a watertank and the guttural voice of a chinaman the clinkclink of hammers that tested the krupp steel wheels and the oath of a tramp chased off the rearplatform now the solid crash of coal shot into the tender and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a waiting train now they looked out into great abysses a trestle purring beneath their tread or up to rocks that barred out half the stars now scaur and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged mountains on the horizons edge and now broke into hills lower and lower till at last came the true plains  at dodge city an unknown hand threw in a copy of a kansas paper containing some sort of an interview with harvey who had evidently fallen in with an enterprising reporter telegraphed on from boston the joyful journalese revealed that it was beyond question their boy and it soothed mrs cheyne for a while her one word hurry was conveyed by the crews to the engineers at nickerson topeka and marceline where the grades are easy and they brushed the continent behind them towns and villages were close together now and a man could feel here that he moved among people  i cant see the dial and my eyes ache so what are we doing  the very best we can mamma theres no sense in getting in before the limited wed only have to wait  i dont care i want to feel were moving sit down and tell me the miles  cheyne sat down and read the dial for her there were some miles which stand for records to this day but the seventyfoot car never changed its long steamerlike roll moving through the heat with the hum of a giant bee yet the speed was not enough for mrs cheyne and the heat the remorseless august heat was making her giddy the clockhands would not move and when oh when would they be in chicago  it is not true that as they changed engines at fort madison cheyne passed over to the amalgamated brotherhood of locomotive engineers an endowment sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on equal terms for evermore he paid his obligations to engineers and firemen as he believed they deserved and only his bank knows what he gave the crews who had sympathized with him it is on record that the last crew took entire charge of switching operations at sixteenth street because she was in a doze at last and heaven was to help any one who bumped her  now the highly paid specialist who conveys the lake shore and michigan southern limited from chicago to elkhart is something of an autocrat and he does not approve of being told how to back up to a car none the less he handled the constance as if she might have been a load of dynamite and when the crew rebuked him they did it in whispers and dumb show  pshaw said the atchison topeka and santa fÃ© men discussing life later we were nt runnin for a record harvey cheynes wife she was sick back an we did nt want to jounce her come to think of it our runnin time from san diego to chicago was 5754 you can tell that to them eastern waytrains when were tryin for a record we ll let you know  to the western man though this would not please either city chicago and boston are cheek by jowl and some railroads encourage the delusion the limited whirled the constance into buffalo and the arms of the new york central and hudson river illustrious magnates with white whiskers and gold charms on their watchchains boarded her here to talk a little business to cheyne who slid her gracefully into albany where the boston and albany completed the run from tidewater to tidewatertotal time eightyseven hours and thirtyfive minutes or three days fifteen hours and one half harvey was waiting for them     ii  the children of the zodiac2       its too hard said the big boy i dont know what      zodiac means i will hunt up the words for you in the      dictionary said the little girl and when they came to the      next story the boy took pleasure in doing his own hunting in      the dictionary       though thou love her as thyself     as a self of purer clay     though her parting dim the day     stealing grace from all alive         heartily know         when half gods go     the gods arriveemerson  thousands of years ago when men were greater than they are today the children of the zodiac lived in the world there were six children of the zodiacthe ram the bull the lion the twins and the girl and they were afraid of the six houses which belonged to the scorpion the balance the crab the fishes the goat and the waterman even when they first stepped down upon the earth and knew that they were immortal gods they carried this fear with them and the fear grew as they became better acquainted with mankind and heard stories of the six houses men treated the children as gods and came to them with prayers and long stories of wrong while the children of the zodiac listened and could not understand  footnote 2 copyrighted 1891 by harper  brothers  a mother would fling herself before the feet of the twins or the bull crying my husband was at work in the fields and the archer shot him and he died and my son will also be killed by the archer help me the bull would lower his huge head and answer what is that to me or the twins would smile and continue their play for they could not understand why the water ran out of peoples eyes at other times a man and a woman would come to leo or the girl crying we two are newly married and we are very happy take these flowers as they threw the flowers they would make mysterious sounds to show that they were happy and leo and the girl wondered even more than the twins why people shouted ha ha ha for no cause  this continued for thousands of years by human reckoning till on a day leo met the girl walking across the hills and saw that she had changed entirely since he had last seen her the girl looking at leo saw that he too had changed altogether then they decided that it would be well never to separate again in case even more startling changes should occur when the one was not at hand to help the other leo kissed the girl and all earth felt that kiss and the girl sat down on a hill and the water ran out of her eyes and this had never happened before in the memory of the children of the zodiac  as they sat together a man and a woman came by and the man said to the woman  what is the use of wasting flowers on those dull gods they will never understand darling  the girl jumped up and put her arms around the woman crying i understand give me the flowers and i will give you a kiss  leo said beneath his breath to the man what was the new name that i heard you give to your woman just now  the man answered darling of course  why of course said leo and if of course what does it mean  it means very dear and you have only to look at your wife to see why  i see said leo you are quite right and when the man and the woman had gone on he called the girl darling wife and the girl wept again from sheer happiness  i think she said at last wiping her eyes i think that we two have neglected men and women too much what did you do with the sacrifices they made to you leo  i let them burn said leo i could not eat them what did you do with the flowers  i let them wither i could not wear them i had so many of my own said the girl and now i am sorry  there is nothing to grieve for said leo we belong to each other  as they were talking the years of mens life slipped by unnoticed and presently the man and the woman came back both whiteheaded the man carrying the woman  we have come to the end of things said the man quietly this that was my wife  as i am leos wife said the girl quickly her eyes staring   was my wife has been killed by one of your houses the man set down his burden and laughed  which house said leo angrily for he hated all the houses equally  you are gods you should know said the man we have lived together and loved one another and i have left a good farm for my son what have i to complain of except that i still live  as he was bending over his wifes body there came a whistling through the air and he started and tried to run away crying it is the arrow of the archer let me live a little longeronly a little longer the arrow struck him and he died leo looked at the girl and she looked at him and both were puzzled  he wished to die said leo he said that he wished to die and when death came he tried to run away he is a coward  no he is not said the girl i think i feel what he felt leo we must learn more about this for their sakes  for their sakes said leo very loudly  because we are never going to die said the girl and leo together still more loudly  now sit you still here darling wife said leo while i go to the houses whom we hate and learn how to make these men and women live as we do  and love as we do said the girl  i do not think they need to be taught that said leo and he strode away very angry with his lionskin swinging from his shoulder till he came to the house where the scorpion lives in the darkness brandishing his tail over his back  why do you trouble the children of men said leo with his heart between his teeth  are you so sure that i trouble the children of men alone said the scorpion speak to your brother the bull and see what he says  i come on behalf of the children of men said leo i have learned to love as they do and i wish them to live as ias wedo  your wish was granted long ago speak to the bull he is under my special care said the scorpion  leo dropped back to the earth again and saw the great star aldebaran that is set in the forehead of the bull blazing very near to the earth when he came up to it he saw that his brother the bull yoked to a countrymans plough was toiling through a wet ricefield with his head bent down and the sweat streaming from his flanks the countryman was urging him forward with a goad  gore that insolent to death cried leo and for the sake of our family honour come out of the mire  i cannot said the bull the scorpion has told me that some day of which i cannot be sure he will sting me where my neck is set on my shoulders and that i shall die bellowing  what has that to do with this disgraceful exhibition said leo standing on the dyke that bounded the wet field  everything this man could not plough without my help he thinks that i am a stray bullock  but he is a mudcrusted cottar with matted hair insisted leo we are not meant for his use  you may not be i am i cannot tell when the scorpion may choose to sting me to deathperhaps before i have turned this furrow the bull flung his bulk into the yoke and the plough tore through the wet ground behind him and the countryman goaded him till his flanks were red  do you like this leo called down the dripping furrows  no said the bull over his shoulder as he lifted his hind legs from the clinging mud and cleared his nostrils  leo left him scornfully and passed to another country where he found his brother the ram in the centre of a crowd of country people who were hanging wreaths round his neck and feeding him on freshly plucked green corn  this is terrible said leo break up that crowd and come away my brother their hands are spoiling your fleece  i cannot said the ram the archer told me that on some day of which i had no knowledge he would send a dart through me and that i should die in very great pain  what has that to do with this said leo but he did not speak as confidently as before  everything in the world said the ram these people never saw a perfect sheep before they think that i am a stray and they will carry me from place to place as a model to all their flocks  but they are greasy shepherds we are not intended to amuse them said leo  you may not be i am said the ram i cannot tell when the archer may choose to send his arrow at meperhaps before the people a mile down the road have seen me the ram lowered his head that a yokel newly arrived might throw a wreath of wild garlicleaves over it and waited patiently while the farmers tugged his fleece  do you like this cried leo over the shoulders of the crowd  no said the ram as the dust of the trampling feet made him sneeze and he snuffed at the fodder piled before him  leo turned back intending to retrace his steps to the houses but as he was passing down a street he saw two small children very dusty rolling outside a cottage door and playing with a cat they were the twins  what are you doing here said leo indignant  playing said the twins calmly  cannot you play on the banks of the milky way said leo  we did said they till the fishes swam down and told us that some day they would come for us and not hurt us at all and carry us away so now we are playing at being babies down here the people like it  do you like it said leo  no said the twins but there are no cats in the milky way and they pulled the cats tail thoughtfully a woman came out of the doorway and stood behind them and leo saw in her face a look that he had sometimes seen in the girls  she thinks that we are foundlings said the twins and they trotted indoors to the evening meal  then leo hurried as swiftly as possible to all the houses one after another for he could not understand the new trouble that had come to his brethren he spoke to the archer and the archer assured him that so far as that house was concerned leo had nothing to fear the waterman the fishes and the goat gave the same answer they knew nothing of leo and cared less they were the houses and they were busied in killing men  at last he came to that very dark house where cancer the crab lies so still that you might think he was asleep if you did not see the ceaseless play and winnowing motion of the feathery branches round his mouth that movement never ceases it is like the eating of a smothered fire into rotten timber in that it is noiseless and without haste  leo stood in front of the crab and the half darkness allowed him a glimpse of that vast blueblack back and the motionless eyes now and again he thought that he heard some one sobbing but the noise was very faint  why do you trouble the children of men said leo there was no answer and against his will leo cried why do you trouble us what have we done that you should trouble us  this time cancer replied what do i know or care you were born into my house and at the appointed time i shall come for you  when is the appointed time said leo stepping back from the restless movement of the mouth  when the full moon fails to call the full tide said the crab i shall come for the one when the other has taken the earth by the shoulders i shall take that other by the throat  leo lifted his hand to the apple of his throat moistened his lips and recovering himself said  must i be afraid for two then  for two said the crab and as many more as may come after  my brother the bull had a better fate said leo sullenly he is alone  a hand covered his mouth before he could finish the sentence and he found the girl in his arms womanlike she had not stayed where leo had left her but had hastened off at once to know the worst and passing all the other houses had come straight to cancer  that is foolish said the girl whispering i have been waiting in the dark for long and long before you came then i was afraid but now she put her head down on his shoulder and sighed a sigh of contentment  i am afraid now said leo  that is on my account said the girl i know it is because i am afraid for your sake let us go husband  they went out of the darkness together and came back to the earth leo very silent and the girl striving to cheer him my brothers fate is the better one leo would repeat from time to time and at last he said let us each go our own way and live alone till we die we were born into the house of cancer and he will come for us  i know i know but where shall i go and where will you sleep in the evening but let us try i will stay here do you go on  leo took six steps forward very slowly and three long steps backward very quickly and the third step set him again at the girls side this time it was she who was begging him to go away and leave her and he was forced to comfort her all through the night that night decided them both never to leave each other for an instant and when they had come to this decision they looked back at the darkness of the house of cancer high above their heads and with their arms round each others necks laughed ha ha ha exactly as the children of men laughed and that was the first time in their lives that they had ever laughed  next morning they returned to their proper home and saw the flowers and the sacrifices that had been laid before their doors by the villagers of the hills leo stamped down the fire with his heel and the girl flung the flowerwreaths out of sight shuddering as she did so when the villagers rereturned as of custom to see what had become of their offerings they found neither roses nor burned flesh on the altars but only a man and a woman with frightened white faces sitting hand in hand on the altarsteps  are you not virgo said a woman to the girl i sent you flowers yesterday  little sister said the girl flushing to her forehead do not send any more flowers for i am only a woman like yourself the man and the woman went away doubtfully  now what shall we do said leo  we must try to be cheerful i think said the girl we know the very worst that can happen to us but we do not know the best that love can bring us we have a great deal to be glad of  the certainty of death said leo  all the children of men have that certainty also yet they laughed long before we ever knew how to laugh we must learn to laugh leo we have laughed once already  people who consider themselves gods as the children of the zodiac did find it hard to laugh because the immortals know nothing worth laughter or tears leo rose up with a very heavy heart and he and the girl together went to and fro among men their new fear of death behind them first they laughed at a naked baby attempting to thrust its fat toes into its foolish pink mouth next they laughed at a kitten chasing her own tail and then they laughed at a boy trying to steal a kiss from a girl and getting his ears boxed lastly they laughed because the wind blew in their faces as they ran down a hillside together and broke panting and breathless into a knot of villagers at the bottom the villagers laughed too at their flying clothes and windreddened faces and in the evening gave them food and invited them to a dance on the grass where everybody laughed through the mere joy of being able to dance  that night leo jumped up from the girls side crying every one of those people we met just now will die  so shall we said the girl sleepily lie down again dear leo could not see that her face was wet with tears  but leo was up and far across the fields driven forward by the fear of death for himself and for the girl who was dearer to him than himself presently he came across the bull drowsing in the moonlight after a hard days work and looking through halfshut eyes at the beautiful straight furrows that he had made  ho said the bull so you have been told these things too which of the houses holds your death  leo pointed upward to the dark house of the crab and groaned and he will come for the girl too he said  well said the bull what will you do  leo sat down on the dike and said that he did not know  you cannot pull a plough said the bull with a little touch of contempt i can and that prevents me from thinking of the scorpion  leo was angry and said nothing till the dawn broke and the cultivator came to yoke the bull to his work  sing said the bull as the stiff muddy oxbow creaked and strained my shoulder is galled sing one of the songs that we sang when we thought we were all gods together  leo stepped back into the canebrake and lifted up his voice in a song of the children of the zodiacthe warwhoop of the young gods who are afraid of nothing at first he dragged the song along unwillingly and then the song dragged him and his voice rolled across the fields and the bull stepped to the tune and the cultivator banged his flanks out of sheer lightheartedness and the furrows rolled away behind the plough more and more swiftly then the girl came across the fields looking for leo and found him singing in the cane she joined her voice to his and the cultivators wife brought her spinning into the open and listened with all her children round her when it was time for the nooning leo and the girl had sung themselves both thirsty and hungry but the cultivator and his wife gave them rye bread and milk and many thanks and the bull found occasion to say  you have helped me to do a full half field more than i should have done but the hardest part of the day is to come brother  leo wished to lie down and brood over the words of the crab the girl went away to talk to the cultivators wife and baby and the afternoon ploughing began  help us now said the bull the tides of the day are running down my legs are very stiff sing if you never sang before  to a mudspattered villager said leo  he is under the same doom as ourselves are you a coward said the bull  leo flushed and began again with a sore throat and a bad temper little by little he dropped away from the songs of the children and made up a song as he went along and this was a thing he could never have done had he not met the crab face to face he remembered facts concerning cultivators and bullocks and ricefields that he had not particularly noticed before the interview and he strung them all together growing more interested as he sang and he told the cultivator much more about himself and his work than the cultivator knew the bull grunted approval as he toiled down the furrows for the last time that day and the song ended leaving the cultivator with a very good opinion of himself in his aching bones the girl came out of the hut where she had been keeping the children quiet and talking womantalk to the wife and they all ate the evening meal together  now yours must be a very pleasant life said the cultivator sitting as you do on a dyke all day and singing just what comes into your head have you been at it long you twogipsies  ah lowed the bull from his byre thats all the thanks you will ever get from men brother  no we have only just begun it said the girl but we are going to keep to it as long as we live are we not leo  yes said he and they went away hand in hand  you can sing beautifully leo said she as a wife will to her husband  what were you doing said he  i was talking to the mother and the babies she said you would not understand the little things that make us women laugh  andand i am to go on with thisthis gipsy work said leo  yes dear and i will help you  there is no written record of the life of leo and of the girl so we cannot tell how leo took to his new employment which he detested we are only sure that the girl loved him when and wherever he sang even when after the song was done she went round with the equivalent of a tambourine and collected the pence for the daily bread there were times too when it was leos very hard task to console the girl for the indignity of horrible praise that people gave him and herfor the silly wagging peacock feathers that they stuck in his cap and the buttons and pieces of cloth that they sewed on his coat womanlike she could advise and help to the end but the meanness of the means revolted  what does it matter leo would say so long as the songs make them a little happier and they would go down the road and begin again on the old old refrainthat whatever came or did not come the children of men must not be afraid it was heavy teaching at first but in process of years leo discovered that he could make men laugh and hold them listening to him even when the rain fell yet there were people who would sit down and cry softly though the crowd was yelling with delight and there were people who maintained that leo made them do this and the girl would talk to them in the pauses of the performance and do her best to comfort them people would die too while leo was talking and singing and laughing for the archer and the scorpion and the crab and the other houses were as busy as ever sometimes the crowd broke and were frightened and leo strove to keep them steady by telling them that this was cowardly and sometimes they mocked at the houses that were killing them and leo explained that this was even more cowardly than running away  in their wanderings they came across the bull or the ram or the twins but all were too busy to do more than nod to each other across the crowd and go on with their work as the years rolled on even that recognition ceased for the children of the zodiac had forgotten that they had ever been gods working for the sake of men the star aldebaran was crusted with caked dirt on the bulls forehead the rams fleece was dusty and torn and the twins were only babies fighting over the cat on the doorstep it was then that leo said let us stop singing and making jokes and it was then that the girl said no but she did not know why she said no so energetically leo maintained that it was perversity till she herself at the end of a dusty day made the same suggestion to him and he said most certainly not and they quarrelled miserably between the hedgerows forgetting the meaning of the stars above them other singers and other talkers sprang up in the course of the years and leo forgetting that there could never be too many of these hated them for dividing the applause of the children of men which he thought should be all his own the girl would grow angry too and then the songs would be broken and the jests fall flat for weeks to come and the children of men would shout go home you two gipsies go home and learn something worth singing  after one of these sorrowful shameful days the girl walking by leos side through the fields saw the full moon coming up over the trees and she clutched leos arm crying the time has come now oh leo forgive me  what is it said leo he was thinking of the other singers  my husband she answered and she laid his hand upon her breast and the breast that he knew so well was hard as stone leo groaned remembering what the crab had said  surely we were gods once he cried  surely we are gods still said the girl do you not remember when you and i went to the house of the crab andwere not very much afraid and since then  we have forgotten what we were singing forwe sang for the pence and oh we fought for themwe who are the children of the zodiac  it was my fault said leo  how can there be any fault of yours that is not mine too said the girl my time has come but you will live longer and the look in her eyes said all she could not say  yes i will remember that we are gods said leo  it is very hard even for a child of the zodiac who has forgotten his godhead to see his wife dying slowly and to know that he cannot help her the girl told leo in those last months of all that she had said and done among the wives and the babies at the back of the roadside performances and leo was astonished that he knew so little of her who had been so much to him when she was dying she told him never to fight for pence or quarrel with the other singers and above all to go on with his singing immediately after she was dead  then she died and after he had buried her he went down the road to a village that he knew and the people hoped that he would begin quarrelling with a new singer that had sprung up while he had been away but leo called him my brother the new singer was newly marriedand leo knew itand when he had finished singing leo straightened himself and sang the song of the girl which he had made coming down the road every man who was married or hoped to be married whatever his rank or colour understood that songeven the bride leaning on the new husbands arm understood it tooand presently when the song ended and leos heart was bursting in him the men sobbed that was a sad tale they said at last now make us laugh because leo had known all the sorrow that a man could know including the full knowledge of his own fall who had once been a godhe changing his song quickly made the people laugh till they could laugh no more they went away feeling ready for any trouble in reason and they gave leo more peacock feathers and pence than he could count knowing that pence led to quarrels and that peacock feathers were hateful to the girl he put them aside and went away to look for his brothers to remind them that they too were gods  he found the bull goring the undergrowth in a ditch for the scorpion had stung him and he was dying not slowly as the girl had died but quickly  i know all the bull groaned as leo came up i had forgotten too but i remember now go and look at the fields i ploughed the furrows are straight i forgot that i was a god but i drew the plough perfectly straight for all that and you brother  i am not at the end of the ploughing said leo does death hurt  no but dying does said the bull and he died the cultivator who then owned him was much annoyed for there was a field still unploughed  it was after this that leo made the song of the bull who had been a god and forgotten the fact and he sang it in such a manner that half the young men in the world conceived that they too might be gods without knowing it a half of that half grew impossibly conceited and died early a half of the remainder strove to be gods and failed but the other half accomplished four times more work than they would have done under any other delusion  later years later always wandering up and down and making the children of men laugh he found the twins sitting on the bank of a stream waiting for the fishes to come and carry them away they were not in the least afraid and they told leo that the woman of the house had a real baby of her own and that when that baby grew old enough to be mischievous he would find a welleducated cat waiting to have its tail pulled then the fishes came for them but all that the people saw was two children drowning in a brook and though their fostermother was very sorry she hugged her own real baby to her breast and was grateful that it was only the foundlings  then leo made the song of the twins who had forgotten that they were gods and had played in the dust to amuse a fostermother that song was sung far and wide among the women it caused them to laugh and cry and hug their babies closer to their hearts all in one breath and some of the women who remembered the girl said surely that is the voice of virgo only she could know so much about ourselves  after those three songs were made leo sang them over and over again till he was in danger of looking upon them as so many mere words and the people who listened grew tired and there came back to leo the old temptation to stop singing once and for all but he remembered the girls dying words and went on  one of his listeners interrupted him as he was singing leo said he i have heard you telling us not to be afraid for the past forty years can you not sing something new now  no said leo it is the only song that i am allowed to sing you must not be afraid of the houses even when they kill you  the man turned to go wearily but there came a whistling through the air and the arrow of the archer was seen skimming low above the earth pointing to the mans heart he drew himself up and stood still waiting till the arrow struck home  i die he said quietly it is well for me leo that you sang for forty years  are you afraid said leo bending over him  i am a man not a god said the man i should have run away but for your songs my work is done and i die without making a show of my fear  i am very well paid said leo to himself now that i see what my songs are doing i will sing better ones  he went down the road collected his little knot of listeners and began the song of the girl in the middle of his singing he felt the cold touch of the crabs claw on the apple of his throat he lifted his hand choked and stopped for an instant  sing on leo said the crowd the old song runs as well as ever it did  leo went on steadily till the end with the cold fear at his heart when his song was ended he felt the grip on his throat tighten he was old he had lost the girl he knew that he was losing more than half his power to sing he could scarcely walk to the diminishing crowds that waited for him and could not see their faces when they stood about him none the less he cried angrily to the crab  why have you come for me now  you were born under my care how can i help coming for you said the crab wearily every human being whom the crab killed had asked that same question  but i was just beginning to know what my songs were doing said leo  perhaps that is why said the crab and the grip tightened  you said you would not come till i had taken the world by the shoulders gasped leo falling back  i always keep my word you have done that three times with three songs what more do you desire  let me live to see the world know it pleaded leo let me be sure that my songs  make men brave said the crab even then there would be one man who was afraid the girl was braver than you are come  leo was standing close to the restless insatiable mouth i forgot said he simply the girl was braver but i am a god too and i am not afraid  what is that to me said the crab  then leos speech was taken from him and he lay still and dumb watching death till he died  leo was the last of the children of the zodiac after his death there sprang up a breed of little mean men whimpering and flinching and howling because the houses killed them and theirs who wished to live forever without any pain they did not increase their lives but they increased their own torments miserably and there were no children of the zodiac to guide them and the greater part of leos songs were lost  only he had carved on the girls tombstone the last verse of the song of the girl which stands at the head of this story  one of the children of men coming thousands of years later rubbed away the lichen read the lines and applied them to a trouble other than the one leo meant being a man men believed that he had made the verses himself but they belong to leo the child of the zodiac and teach as he taught that what comes or does not come we must not be afraid     iii  the bridge builders   the least that findlayson of the public works department expected was a cie he dreamed of a csi indeed his friends told him that he deserved more for three years he had endured heat and cold disappointment discomfort danger and disease with responsibility almost too heavy for one pair of shoulders and day by day through that time the great kashi bridge over the ganges had grown under his charge now in less than three months if all went well his excellency the viceroy would open the bridge in state an archbishop would bless it the first trainload of soldiers would come over it and there would be speeches  findlayson c e sat in his trolley on a constructionline that ran along one of the main revetmentsthe huge stonefaced banks that flared away north and south for three miles on either side of the riverand permitted himself to think of the end with its approaches his work was one mile and threequarters in length a latticegirder bridge trussed with the findlayson truss standing on sevenandtwenty brick piers each one of those piers was twentyfour feet in diameter capped with red agra stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the ganges bed above them ran the railwayline fifteen feet broad above that again a cartroad of eighteen feet flanked with footpaths at either end rose towers of red brick loopholed for musketry and pierced for big guns and the ramp of the road was being pushed forward to their haunches the raw earthends were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny asses climbing out of the yawning borrowpit below with sackfuls of stuff and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of hooves the rattle of the drivers sticks and the swish and rolldown of the dirt the river was very low and on the dazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat cribs of railwaysleepers filled within and daubed without with mud to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up in the little deep water left by the drought an overheadcrane travelled to and fro along its spilepier jerking sections of iron into place snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant grunts in the timberyard riveters by the hundred swarmed about the lattice sidework and the iron roof of the railwayline hung from invisible staging under the bellies of the girders clustered round the throats of the piers and rode on the overhang of the footpathstanchions their firepots and the spurts of flame that answered each hammerstroke showing no more than pale yellow in the suns glare east and west and north and south the constructiontrains rattled and shrieked up and down the embankments the piled trucks of brown and white stone banging behind them till the sideboards were unpinned and with a roar and a grumble a few thousand tons more material were thrown out to hold the river in place  findlayson c e turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the country that he had changed for seven miles around looked back on the humming village of five thousand workmen up stream and down along the vista of spurs and sand across the river to the far piers lessening in the haze overhead to the guardtowersand only he knew how strong those wereand with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was good there stood his bridge before him in the sunlight lacking only a few weeks work on the girders of the three middle piershis bridge raw and ugly as original sin but pukkapermanentto endure when all memory of the builder yea even of the splendid findlayson truss had perished practically the thing was done  hitchcock his assistant cantered along the line on a little switchtailed kabuli pony who through long practice could have trotted securely over a trestle and nodded to his chief  all but said he with a smile  ive been thinking about it the senior answered not half a bad job for two men is it oneand a half gad what a coopers hill cub i was when i came on the works hitchcock felt very old in the crowded experiences of the past three years that had taught him power and responsibility  you were rather a colt said findlayson i wonder how youll like going back to office work when this jobs over  i shall hate it said the young man and as he went on his eye followed findlaysons and he muttered is nt it good  i think well go up the service together findlayson said to himself youre too good a youngster to waste on another man cub thou wast assistant thou art personal assistant and at simla thou shalt be if any credit comes to me out of the business  indeed the burden of the work had fallen altogether on findlayson and his assistant the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to break to his own needs there were labourcontractors by the halfhundredfitters and riveters european borrowed from the railway workshops with perhaps twenty white and halfcaste subordinates to direct under direction the bevies of workmenbut none knew better than these two who trusted each other how the underlings were not to be trusted they had been tried many times in sudden crisesby slipping of booms by breaking of tackle failure of cranes and the wrath of the riverbut no stress had brought to light any man among them whom findlayson and hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked themselves findlayson thought it over from the beginning the months of office work destroyed at a blow when the government of india at the last moment added two feet to the width of the bridge under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper and so brought to ruin at least half an acre of calculationsand hitchcock new to disappointment buried his head in his arms and wept the heartbreaking delays over the filling of the contracts in england the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commission if one only one rather doubtful consignment were passed the war that followed the refusal the careful polite obstruction at the other end that followed the war till young hitchcock putting one months leave to another month and borrowing ten days from findlayson spent his poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to london and there as his own tongue asserted and the later consignments proved put the fear of god into a man so great that he feared only parliament and said so till hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinnertable andhe feared the kashi bridge and all who spoke in its name then there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by the bridgeworks and after the cholera smote the smallpox the fever they had always with them hitchcock had been appointed a magistrate of the third class with whipping powers for the better government of the community and findlayson watched him wield his powers temperately learning what to overlook and what to look after it was a long long reverie and it covered storm sudden freshets death in every manner and shape violent and awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things drought sanitation finance birth wedding burial and riot in the village of twenty warring castes argument expostulation persuasion and the blank despair that a man goes to bed upon thankful that his rifle is all in pieces in the guncase behind everything rose the black frame of the kashi bridgeplate by plate girder by girder span by spanand each pier of it recalled hitchcock the allround man who had stood by his chief without failing from the very first to this last so the bridge was two mens workunless one counted peroo as peroo certainly counted himself he was a lascar a kharva from bulsar familiar with every port between rockhampton and london who had risen to the rank of serang on the british india boats but wearying of routine musters and clean clothes had thrown up the service and gone inland where men of his calibre were sure of employment for his knowledge of tackle and the handling of heavy weights peroo was worth almost any price he might have chosen to put upon his services but custom decreed the wage of the overheadmen and peroo was not within many silver pieces of his proper value neither running water nor extreme heights made him afraid and as an exserang he knew how to hold authority no piece of iron was so big or so badly placed that peroo could not devise a tackle to lift ita looseended sagging arrangement rigged with a scandalous amount of talking but perfectly equal to the work in hand it was peroo who had saved the girder of number seven pier from destruction when the new wire rope jammed in the eye of the crane and the huge plate tilted in its slings threatening to slide out sideways then the native workmen lost their heads with great shoutings and hitchcocks right arm was broken by a falling tplate and he buttoned it up in his coat and swooned and came to and directed for four hours till peroo from the top of the crane reported alls well and the plate swung home there was no one like peroo serang to lash and guy and hold to control the donkeyengines to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out of the borrowpit into which it had tumbled to strip and dive if need be to see how the concrete blocks round the piers stood the scouring of mother gunga or to adventure upstream on a monsoon night and report on the state of the embankmentfacings he would interrupt the fieldcouncils of findlayson and hitchcock without fear till his wonderful english or his still more wonderful linguafranca half portuguese and half malay ran out and he was forced to take string and show the knots that he would recommend he controlled his own gang of tacklemenmysterious relatives from kutch mandvi gathered month by month and tried to the uttermost no consideration of family or kin allowed peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy head on the payroll my honour is the honour of this bridge he would say to the abouttobe dismissed what do i care for your honour go and work on a steamer that is all you are fit for  the little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred round the tattered dwelling of a seapriestone who had never set foot on black water but had been chosen as ghostly counsellor by two generations of searovers all unaffected by port missions or those creeds which are thrust upon sailors by agencies along thames bank the priest of the lascars had nothing to do with their caste or indeed with anything at all he ate the offerings of his church and slept and smoked and slept again for said peroo who had haled him a thousand miles inland he is a very holy man he never cares what you eat so long as you do not eat beef and that is good because on land we worship shiva we kharvas but at sea on the kumpanis boats we attend strictly to the orders of the burra malum the first mate and on this bridge we observe what finlinson sahib says  findlayson sahib had that day given orders to clear the scaffolding from the guardtower on the right bank and peroo with his mates was casting loose and lowering down the bamboo poles and planks as swiftly as ever they had whipped the cargo out of a coaster  from his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serangs silver pipe and the creak and clatter of the pulleys peroo was standing on the topmost coping of the tower clad in the blue dungaree of his abandoned service and as findlayson motioned to him to be careful for his was no life to throw away he gripped the last pole and shading his eyes shipfashion answered with the longdrawn wail of the focsle lookout ham dekhta hai i am looking out findlayson laughed and then sighed it was years since he had seen a steamer and he was sick for home as his trolley passed under the tower peroo descended by a rope apefashion and cried it looks well now sahib our bridge is all but done what think you mother gunga will say when the rail runs over  she has said little so far it was never mother gunga that delayed us  there is always time for her and none the less there has been delay has the sahib forgotten last autumns flood when the stoneboats were sunk without warningor only a halfdays warning  yes but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now the spurs are holding well on the west bank  mother gunga eats great allowances there is always room for more stone on the revetments i tell this to the chota sahibhe meant hitchcockand he laughs  no matter peroo another year thou wilt be able to build a bridge in thine own fashion  the lascar grinned then it will not be in this waywith stonework sunk under water as the quetta was sunk i like sussuspensheen bridges that fly from bank to bank with one big step like a gangplank then no water can hurt when does the lord sahib come to open the bridge  in three months when the weather is cooler  ho ho he is like the burra malum he sleeps below while the work is being done then he comes upon the quarterdeck and touches with his finger and says this is not clean jiboonwallah  but the lord sahib does not call me a jiboonwallah peroo  no sahib but he does not come on deck till the work is all finished even the burra malum of the nerbudda said once at tuticorin  bah go i am busy  i also said peroo with an unshaken countenance may i take the light dinghy now and row along the spurs  to hold them with thy hands they are i think sufficiently heavy  nay sahib it is thus at sea on the black water we have room to be blown up and down without care here we have no room at all look you we have put the river into a dock and run her between stone sills  findlayson smiled at the we  we have bitted and bridled her she is not like the sea that can beat against a soft beach she is mother gungain irons his voice fell a little  peroo thou hast been up and down the world more even than i speak true talk now how much dost thou in thy heart believe of mother gunga  all that our priest says london is london sahib sydney is sydney and port darwin is port darwin also mother gunga is mother gunga and when i come back to her banks i know this and worship in london i did poojah to the big temple by the river for the sake of the god within yes i will not take the cushions in the dinghy  findlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a bungalow that he shared with his assistant the place had become home to him in the last three years he had grilled in the heat sweated in the rains and shivered with fever under the rude thatch roof the limewash beside the door was covered with rough drawings and formulÃ¦ and the sentrypath trodden in the matting of the veranda showed where he had walked alone there is no eighthour limit to an engineers work and the evening meal with hitchcock was eaten booted and spurred over their cigars they listened to the hum of the village as the gangs came up from the riverbed and the lights began to twinkle  peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy hes taken a couple of nephews with him and hes lolling in the stern like a commodore said hitchcock  thats all right hes got something on his mind you d think that ten years in the british india boats would have knocked most of his religion out of him  so it has said hitchcock chuckling i overheard him the other day in the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat old guru of theirs peroo denied the efficacy of prayer and wanted the guru to go to sea and watch a gale out with him and see if he could stop a monsoon  all the same if you carried off his guru hed leave us like a shot he was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of st pauls when he was in london  he told me that the first time he went into the engineroom of a steamer when he was a boy he prayed to the lowpressure cylinder  not half bad a thing to pray to either hes propitiating his own gods now and he wants to know what mother gunga will think of a bridge being run across her whos there a shadow darkened the doorway and a telegram was put into hitchcocks hand  she ought to be pretty well used to it by this time only a tar it ought to be rallis answer about the new rivets great heavens hitchcock jumped to his feet  what is it said the senior and took the form thats what mother gunga thinks is it he said reading keep cool young un weve got all our work cut out for us lets see muir wires half an hour ago floods on the ramgunga look out well that gives usone twonine and a half for the flood to reach melipur ghaut and sevens sixteen and a half to latodisay fifteen hours before it comes down to us  curse that hillfed sewer of a ramgunga findlayson this is two months before anything could have been expected and the left bank is littered up with stuff still two full months before the time  thats why it happens ive only known indian rivers for five and twenty years and i dont pretend to understand here comes another tar findlayson opened the telegram cockran this time from the ganges canal heavy rains here bad he might have saved the last word well we dont want to know any more weve got to work the gangs all night and clean up the riverbed youll take the east bank and work out to meet me in the middle get everything that floats below the bridge we shall have quite enough rivercraft coming down adrift anyhow without letting the stoneboats ram the piers what have you got on the east bank that needs looking after  pontoon one big pontoon with the overhead crane on it tother overhead crane on the mended pontoon with the cartroad rivets from twenty to twentythree pierstwo construction lines and a turningspur the pilework must take its chance said hitchcock  all right roll up everything you can lay hands on well give the gang fifteen minutes more to eat their grub  close to the veranda stood a big nightgong never used except for flood or fire in the village hitchcock had called for a fresh horse and was off to his side of the bridge when findlayson took the clothbound stick and smote with the rubbing stroke that brings out the full thunder of the metal  long before the last rumble ceased every nightgong in the village had taken up the warning to these were added the hoarse screaming of conches in the little temples the throbbing of drums and tomtoms and from the european quarters where the riveters lived mccartneys bugle a weapon of offence on sundays and festivals brayed desperately calling to stables engine after engine toiling home along the spurs after her days work whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the far bank then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it was flood and not fire conch drum and whistle echoed the call and the village quivered to the sound of bare feet running upon soft earth the order in all cases was to stand by the days work and wait instructions the gangs poured by in the dusk men stopping to knot a loincloth or fasten a sandal gangforemen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused by the toolissue sheds for bars and mattocks locomotives creeping down their tracks wheeldeep in the crowd till the brown torrent disappeared into the dusk of the riverbed raced over the pilework swarmed along the lattices clustered by the cranes and stood still each man in his place  then the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take up everything and bear it beyond highwater mark and the flarelamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters began a nights work racing against the flood that was to come the girders of the three centre piersthose that stood on the cribswere all but in position they needed just as many rivets as could be driven into them for the flood would assuredly wash out the supports and the ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone if they were not blocked at the ends a hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the temporary line that fed the unfinished piers it was heaved up in lengths loaded into trucks and backed up the bank beyond floodlevel by the groaning locomotives the toolsheds on the sands melted away before the attack of shouting armies and with them went the stacked ranks of government stores ironbound boxes of rivets pliers cutters duplicate parts of the rivetmachines spare pumps and chains the big crane would be the last to be shifted for she was hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the main structure of the bridge the concrete blocks on the fleet of stoneboats were dropped overside where there was any depth of water to guard the piers and the empty boats themselves were poled under the bridge downstream it was here that peroos pipe shrilled loudest for the first stroke of the big gong had brought aback the dinghy at racing speed and peroo and his people were stripped to the waist working for the honour and credit which are better than life  i knew she would speak he cried i knew but the telegraph gave us good warning o sons of unthinkable begettingchildren of unspeakable shameare we here for the look of the thing it was two feet of wire rope frayed at the ends and it did wonders as peroo leaped from gunnel to gunnel shouting the language of the sea  findlayson was more troubled for the stoneboats than anything else mccartney with his gangs was blocking up the ends of the three doubtful spans but boats adrift if the flood chanced to be a high one might endanger the girders and there was a very fleet in the shrunken channels  get them behind the swell of the guardtower he shouted down to peroo it will be deadwater there get them below the bridge  accha very good i know we are mooring them with wire rope was the answer hah listen to the chota sahib he is working hard  from across the river came an almost continuous whistling of locomotives backed by the rumble of stone hitchcock at the last minute was spending a few hundred more trucks of tarakee stone in reinforcing his spurs and embankments  the bridge challenges mother gunga said peroo with a laugh but when she talks i know whose voice will be the loudest  for hours the naked men worked screaming and shouting under the lights it was a hot moonless night the end of it was darkened by clouds and a sudden squall that made findlayson very grave  she moves said peroo just before the dawn mother gunga is awake hear he dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the current mumbled on it a little wave hit the side of a pier with a crisp slap  six hours before her time said findlayson mopping his forehead savagely now we cant depend on anything wed better clear all hands out of the riverbed  again the big gong beat and a second time there was the rushing of naked feet on earth and ringing iron the clatter of tools ceased in the silence men heard the dry yawn of water crawling over thirsty sand  foreman after foreman shouted to findlayson who had posted himself by the guardtower that his section of the riverbed had been cleaned out and when the last voice dropped findlayson hurried over the bridge till the iron plating of the permanent way gave place to the temporary plankwalk over the three centre piers and there he met hitchcock  all clear your side said findlayson the whisper rang in the box of latticework  yes and the east channels filling now were utterly out of our reckoning when is this thing down on us  theres no saying shes filling as fast as she can look findlayson pointed to the planks below his feet where the sand burned and defiled by months of work was beginning to whisper and fizz  what orders said hitchcock  call the rollcount storessit on your bunkersand pray for the bridge thats all i can think of good night dont risk your life trying to fish out anything that may go downstream  oh ill be as prudent as you are night heavens how shes filling heres the rain in earnest findlayson picked his way back to his bank sweeping the last of mccartneys riveters before him the gangs had spread themselves along the embankments regardless of the cold rain of the dawn and there they waited for the flood only peroo kept his men together behind the swell of the guardtower where the stoneboats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers wireropes and chains  a shrill wail ran along the line growing to a yell half fear and half wonder the face of the river whitened from bank to bank between the stone facings and the faraway spurs went out in spouts of foam mother gunga had come bankhigh in haste and a wall of chocolatecoloured water was her messenger there was a shriek above the roar of the water the complaint of the spans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were whirled out from under their bellies the stoneboats groaned and ground each other in the eddy that swung round the abutment and their clumsy masts rose higher and higher against the dim skyline  before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would do now she is thus cramped god only knows what she will do said peroo watching the furious turmoil round the guardtower ohÃ© fight then fight hard for it is thus that a woman wears herself out  but mother gunga would not fight as peroo desired after the first downstream plunge there came no more walls of water but the river lifted herself bodily as a snake when she drinks in midsummer plucking and fingering along the revetments and banking up behind the piers till even findlayson began to recalculate the strength of his work  when day came the village gasped only last night men said turning to each other it was as a town in the riverbed look now  and they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water the racing water that licked the throat of the piers the farther bank was veiled by rain into which the bridge ran out and vanished the spurs upstream were marked by no more than eddies and spoutings and downstream the pent river once freed of her guidelines had spread like a sea to the horizon then hurried by rolling in the water dead men and oxen together with here and there a patch of thatched roof that melted when it touched a pier  big flood said peroo and findlayson nodded it was as big a flood as he had any wish to watch his bridge would stand what was upon her now but not very much more and if by any of a thousand chances there happened to be a weakness in the embankments mother gunga would carry his honour to the sea with the other raffle worst of all there was nothing to do except to sit still and findlayson sat still under his macintosh till his helmet became pulp on his head and his boots were over ankle in mire he took no count of time for the river was marking the hours inch by inch and foot by foot along the embankment and he listened numb and hungry to the straining of the stoneboats the hollow thunder under the piers and the hundred noises that make the full note of a flood once a dripping servant brought him food but he could not eat and once he thought that he heard a faint toot from a locomotive across the river and then he smiled the bridges failure would hurt his assistant not a little but hitchcock was a young man with his big work yet to do for himself the crash meant everythingeverything that made a hard life worth the living they would say the men of his own professionhe remembered the halfpitying things that he himself had said when lockharts big waterworks burst and broke down in brick heaps and sludge and lockharts spirit broke in him and he died he remembered what he himself had said when the sumao bridge went out in the big cyclone by the sea and most he remembered poor hartopps face three weeks later when the shame had marked it his bridge was twice the size of hartopps and it carried the findlayson truss as well as the new piershoethe findlayson bolted shoe there were no excuses in his service government might listen perhaps but his own kind would judge him by his bridge as that stood or fell he went over it in his head plate by plate span by span brick by brick pier by pier remembering comparing estimating and recalculating lest there should be any mistake and through the long hours and through the nights of formulÃ¦ that danced and wheeled before him a cold fear would come to pinch his heart his side of the sum was beyond question but what man knew mother gungas arithmetic even as he was making all sure by the multiplicationtable the river might be scooping potholes to the very bottom of any one of those eightyfoot piers that carried his reputation again a servant came to him with food but his mouth was dry and he could only drink and return to the decimals in his brain and the river was still rising peroo in a mat sheltercoat crouched at his feet watching now his face and now the face of the river but saying nothing  at last the lascar rose and floundered through the mud toward the village but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the boats  presently he returned most irreverently driving before him the priest of his creeda fat old man with a gray beard that whipped the wind with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder never was seen so lamentable a guru  what good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry grain shouted peroo if squatting in the mud is all that thou canst do thou hast dealt long with the gods when they were contented and wellwishing now they are angry speak to them  what is a man against the wrath of gods whined the priest cowering as the wind took him let me go to the temple and i will pray there  son of a pig pray here is there no return for salt fish and curry powder and dried onions call aloud tell mother gunga we have had enough bid her be still for the night i cannot pray but i have served in the kumpanis boats and when men did not obey my orders i a flourish of the wirerope colt rounded the sentence and the priest breaking from his disciple fled to the village  fat pig said peroo after all that we have done for him when the flood is down i will see to it that we get a new guru finlinson sahib it darkens for night now and since yesterday nothing has been eaten be wise sahib no man can endure watching and great thinking on an empty belly lie down sahib the river will do what the river will do  the bridge is mine i cannot leave it  wilt thou hold it up with thy hands then said peroo laughing i was troubled for my boats and sheers before the flood came now we are in the hands of the gods the sahib will not eat and lie down take these then they are meat and good toddy together and they kill all weariness besides the fever that follows the rain i have eaten nothing else today at all  he took a small tin tobaccobox from his sodden waistbelt and thrust it into findlaysons hand saying nay do not be afraid it is no more than opiumclean malwa opium  findlayson shook two or three of the darkbrown pellets into his hand and hardly knowing what he did swallowed them the stuff was at least a good guard against feverthe fever that was creeping upon him out of the wet mudand he had seen what peroo could do in the stewing mists of autumn on the strength of a dose from the tin box  peroo nodded with bright eyes in a littlein a little the sahib will find that he thinks well again i too will he dived into his treasurebox resettled the raincoat over his head and squatted down to watch the boats it was too dark now to see beyond the first pier and the night seemed to have given the river new strength findlayson stood with his chin on his chest thinking there was one point about one of the piersthe sevenththat that he had not fully settled in his mind the figures would not shape themselves to the eye except one by one and at enormous intervals of time there was a sound rich and mellow in his ears like the deepest note of a doublebassan entrancing sound upon which he pondered for several hours as it seemed then peroo was at his elbow shouting that a wire hawser had snapped and the stoneboats were loose findlayson saw the fleet open and swing out fanwise to a longdrawn shriek of wire straining across gunnels  a tree hit them they will all go cried peroo the main hawser has parted what does the sahib do  an immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into findlaysons mind he saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angleseach rope a line of white fire but there was one rope which was the masterrope he could see that rope if he could pull it once it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guardtower but why he wondered was peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank it was necessary to put the lascar aside gently and slowly because it was necessary to save the boats and further to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so difficult and thenbut it was of no conceivable importancea wire rope raced through his hand burning it the high bank disappeared and with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem he was sitting in the rainy darknesssitting in a boat that spun like a top and peroo was standing over him  i had forgotten said the lascar slowly that to those fasting and unused the opium is worse than any wine those who die in gunga go to the gods still i have no desire to present myself before such great ones can the sahib swim  what need he can flyfly as swiftly as the wind was the thick answer  he is mad muttered peroo under his breath and he threw me aside like a bundle of dungcakes well he will not know his death the boat cannot live an hour here even if she strike nothing it is not good to look at death with a clear eye  he refreshed himself again from the tin box squatted down in the bows of the reeling pegged and stitched craft staring through the mist at the nothing that was there a warm drowsiness crept over findlayson the chief engineer whose duty was with his bridge the heavy raindrops struck him with a thousand tingling little thrills and the weight of all time since time was made hung heavy on his eyelids he thought and perceived that he was perfectly secure for the water was so solid that a man could surely step out upon it and standing still with his legs apart to keep his balancethis was the most important pointwould be borne with great and easy speed to the shore but yet a better plan came to him it needed only an exertion of will for the soul to hurl the body ashore as wind drives paper to waft it kitefashion to the bank thereafterthe boat spun dizzilysuppose the high wind got under the freed body would it tower up like a kite and pitch headlong on the faraway sands or would it duck about beyond control through all eternity findlayson gripped the gunnel to anchor himself for it seemed that he was on the edge of taking the flight before he had settled all his plans opium has more effect on the white man than the black peroo was only comfortably indifferent to accidents she cannot live he grunted her seams open already if she were even a dinghy with oars we could have ridden it out but a box with holes is no good finlinson sahib she fills  accha i am going away come thou also  in his mind findlayson had already escaped from the boat and was circling high in air to find a rest for the sole of his foot his bodyhe was really sorry for its gross helplessnesslay in the stern the water rushing about its knees  how very ridiculous he said to himself from his eyrie thatis findlaysonchief of the kashi bridge the poor beast is going to be drowned too drowned when its close to shore imim on shore already why does nt it come along  to his intense disgust he found his soul back in his body again and that body spluttering and choking in deep water the pain of the reunion was atrocious but it was necessary also to fight for the body he was conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand and striding prodigiously as one strides in a dream to keep foothold in the swirling water till at last he hauled himself clear of the hold of the river and dropped panting on wet earth  not this night said peroo in his ear the gods have protected us the lascar moved his feet cautiously and they rustled among dried stumps this is some island of last years indigo crop he went on we shall find no men here but have great care sahib all the snakes of a hundred miles have been flooded out here comes the lightning on the heels of the wind now we shall be able to look but walk carefully  findlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes or indeed any merely human emotion he saw after he had rubbed the water from his eyes with an immense clearness and trod so it seemed to himself with worldencompassing strides somewhere in the night of time he had built a bridgea bridge that spanned illimitable levels of shining seas but the deluge had swept it away leaving this one island under heaven for findlayson and his companion sole survivors of the breed of man  an incessant lightning forked and blue showed all that there was to be seen on the little patch in the flooda clump of thorn a clump of swaying creaking bamboos and a gray gnarled peepul overshadowing a hindoo shrine from whose dome floated a tattered red flag the holy man whose summer restingplace it was had long since abandoned it and the weather had broken the reddaubed image of his god the two men stumbled heavylimbed and heavyeyed over the ashes of a brickset cookingplace and dropped down under the shelter of the branches while the rain and river roared together  the stumps of the indigo crackled and there was a smell of cattle as a huge and dripping brahminee bull shouldered his way under the tree the flashes revealed the trident mark of shiva on his flank the insolence of head and hump the luminous staglike eyes the brow crowned with a wreath of sodden marigold blooms and the silky dewlap that night swept the ground there was a noise behind him of other beasts coming up from the floodline through the thicket a sound of heavy feet and deep breathing  here be more beside ourselves said findlayson his head against the treepole looking through halfshut eyes wholly at ease  truly said peroo thickly and no small ones  what are they then i do not see clearly  the gods who else look  ah true the gods surelythe gods findlayson smiled as his head fell forward on his chest peroo was eminently right after the flood who should be alive in the land except the gods that made itthe gods to whom his village prayed nightlythe gods who were in all mens mouths and about all mens ways he could not raise his head or stir a finger for the trance that held him and peroo was smiling vacantly at the lightning  the bull paused by the shrine his head lowered to the damp earth a green parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and screamed against the thunder as the circle under the tree filled with the shifting shadows of beasts there was a blackbuck at the bulls heelssuch a buck as findlayson in his faraway life upon earth might have seen in dreamsa buck with a royal head ebon back silver belly and gleaming straight horns beside him her head bowed to the ground the green eyes burning under the heavy brows with restless tail switching the dead grass paced a tigress fullbellied and deepjowled  the bull crouched beside the shrine and there leaped from the darkness a monstrous gray ape who seated himself manwise in the place of the fallen image and the rain spilled like jewels from the hair of his neck and shoulders  other shadows came and went behind the circle among them a drunken man flourishing staff and drinkingbottle then a hoarse bellow broke out from near the ground the flood lessens even now it cried hour by hour the water falls and their bridge still stands  my bridge said findlayson to himself that must be very old work now what have the gods to do with my bridge  his eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar a crocodilethe bluntnosed fordhaunting mugger of the gangesdraggled herself before the beasts lashing furiously to right and left with her tail  they have made it too strong for me in all this night i have only torn away a handful of planks the walls stand the towers stand they have chained my flood and my river is not free any more heavenly ones take this yoke away give me clear water between bank and bank it is i mother gunga that speak the justice of the gods deal me the justice of the gods  what said i whispered peroo this is in truth a punchayet of the gods now we know that all the world is dead save you and i sahib  the parrot screamed and fluttered again and the tigress her ears flat to her head snarled wickedly  somewhere in the shadow a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed to and fro and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on the snarl  we be here said a deep voice the great ones one only and very many shiv my father is here with indra kali has spoken already hanuman listens also  kashi is without her kotwal tonight shouted the man with the drinkingbottle flinging his staff to the ground while the island rang to the baying of hounds give her the justice of the gods  ye were still when they polluted my waters the great crocodile bellowed ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the walls i had no help save my own strength and that failedthe strength of mother gunga failedbefore their guardtowers what could i do i have done everything finish now heavenly ones  i brought the death i rode the spotted sickness from hut to hut of their workmen and yet they would not cease a noseslitten hideworn ass lame scissorlegged and galled limped forward i cast the death at them out of my nostrils but they would not cease  peroo would have moved but the opium lay heavy upon him  bah he said spitting here is sitala herself matathe smallpox has the sahib a handkerchief to put over his face  small help they fed me the corpses for a month and i flung them out on my sandbars but their work went forward demons they are and so sons of demons and ye left mother gunga alone for their firecarriage to make a mock of the justice of the gods on the bridgebuilders  the bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly if the justice of the gods caught all who made a mock of holy things there would be many dark altars in the land mother  but this goes beyond a mock said the tigress darting forward a griping paw thou knowest shiv and ye too heavenly ones ye know that they have defiled gunga surely they must come to the destroyer let indra judge  the buck made no movement as he answered how long has this evil been  three years as men count years said the mugger close pressed to the earth  does mother gunga die then in a year that she is so anxious to see vengeance now the deep sea was where she runs but yesterday and tomorrow the sea shall cover her again as the gods count that which men call time can any say that this their bridge endures till tomorrow said the buck  there was a long hush and in the clearing of the storm the full moon stood up above the dripping trees  judge ye then said the river sullenly i have spoken my shame the flood falls still i can do no more  for my own partit was the voice of the great ape seated within the shrineit pleases me well to watch these men remembering that i also builded no small bridge in the worlds youth  they say too snarled the tiger that these men came of the wreck of thy armies hanuman and therefore thou hast aided  they toil as my armies toiled in lanka and they believe that their toil endures indra is too high but shiv thou knowest how the land is threaded with their firecarriages  yea i know said the bull their gods instructed them in the matter  a laugh ran round the circle  their gods what should their gods know they were born yesterday and those that made them are scarcely yet cold said the mugger tomorrow their gods will die  ho said peroo mother gunga talks good talk i told that to the padresahib who preached on the mombassa and he asked the burra malum to put me in irons for a great rudeness  surely they make these things to please their gods said the bull again  not altogether the elephant rolled forth it is for the profit of my mahajunsmy fat moneylenders that worship me at each new year when they draw my image at the head of the accountbooks i looking over their shoulders by lamplight see that the names in the books are those of men in far placesfor all the towns are drawn together by the firecarriage and the money comes and goes swiftly and the accountbooks grow as fat asmyself and i who am ganesh of good luck i bless my peoples  they have changed the face of the landwhich is my land they have killed and made new towns on my banks said the mugger  it is but the shifting of a little dirt let the dirt dig in the dirt if it pleases the dirt answered the elephant  but afterward said the tiger afterward they will see that mother gunga can avenge no insult and they fall away from her first and later from us all one by one in the end ganesh we are left with naked altars  the drunken man staggered to his feet and hiccupped vehemently in the face of the assembled gods  kali lies my sister lies also this my stick is the kotwal of kashi and he keeps tally of my pilgrims when the time comes to worship bhaironand it is always timethe firecarriages move one by one and each bears a thousand pilgrims they do not come afoot any more but rolling upon wheels and my honour is increased  gunna i have seen thy bed at pryag black with the pilgrims said the ape leaning forward and but for the firecarriage they would have come slowly and in fewer numbers remember  they come to me always bhairon went on thickly by day and night they pray to me all the common people in the fields and the roads who is like bhairon today what talk is this of changing faiths is my staff kotwal of kashi for nothing he keeps the tally and he says that never were so many altars as today and the firecarriage serves them well bhairon am ibhairon of the common people and the chiefest of the heavenly ones today also my staff says  peace thou lowed the bull the worship of the schools is mine and they talk very wisely asking whether i be one or many as is the delight of my people and ye know what i am kali my wife thou knowest also  yea i know said the tigress with lowered head  greater am i than gunga also for ye know who moved the minds of men that they should count gunga holy among the rivers who die in that waterye know how men saycome to us without punishment and gunga knows that the firecarriage has borne to her scores upon scores of such anxious ones and kali knows that she has held her chiefest festivals among the pilgrimages that are fed by the firecarriage who smote at pooree under the image there her thousands in a day and a night and bound the sickness to the wheels of the firecarriages so that it ran from one end of the land to the other who but kali before the firecarriage came it was a heavy toil the firecarriages have served thee well mother of death but i speak for mine own altars who am not bhairon of the common folk but shiv men go to and fro making words and telling talk of strange gods and i listen faith follows faith among my people in the schools and i have no anger for when the words are said and the new talk is ended to shiv men return at the last  true it is true murmured hanuman to shiv and to the others mother they return i creep from temple to temple in the north where they worship one god and his prophet and presently my image is alone within their shrines  small thanks said the buck turning his head slowly i am that one and his prophet also  even so father said hanuman and to the south i go who am the oldest of the gods as men know the gods and presently i touch the shrines of the new faith and the woman whom we know is hewn twelvearmed and still they call her mary  small thanks brother said the tigress i am that woman  even so sister and i go west among the firecarriages and stand before the bridgebuilder in many shapes and because of me they change their faiths and are very wise ho ho i am the builder of bridges indeedbridges between this and that and each bridge leads surely to us in the end be content gunga neither these men nor those that follow them mock thee at all  am i alone then heavenly ones shall i smooth out my flood lest unhappily i bear away their walls will indra dry my springs in the hills and make me crawl humbly between their wharfs shall i bury me in the sand ere i offend  and all for the sake of a little iron bar with the firecarriage atop truly mother gunga is always young said ganesh the elephant a child had not spoken more foolishly let the dirt dig in the dirt ere it return to the dirt i know only that my people grow rich and praise me shiv has said that the men of the schools do not forget bhairon is content for his crowd of the common people and hanuman laughs  surely i laugh said the ape my altars are few beside those of ganesh or bhairon but the firecarriages bring me new worshippers from beyond the black waterthe men who believe that their god is toil i run before them beckoning and they follow hanuman  give them the toil that they desire then said the river make a bar across my flood and throw the water back upon the bridge once thou wast strong in lanka hanuman stoop and lift my bed  who gives life can take life the ape scratched in the mud with a long forefinger and yet who would profit by the killing very many would die  there came up from the water a snatch of a lovesong such as the boys sing when they watch their cattle in the noon heats of late spring the parrot screamed joyously sidling along his branch with lowered head as the song grew louder and in a patch of clear moonlight stood revealed the young herd the darling of the gopis the idol of dreaming maids and of mothers ere their children are bornkrishna the wellbeloved he stooped to knot up his long wet hair and the parrot fluttered to his shoulder  fleeting and singing and singing and fleeting hiccupped bhairon those make thee late for the council brother  and then said krishna with a laugh throwing back his head ye can do little without me or karma here he fondled the parrots plumage and laughed again what is this sitting and talking together i heard mother gunga roaring in the dark and so came quickly from a hut where i lay warm and what have ye done to karma that he is so wet and silent and what does mother gunga here are the heavens full that ye must come paddling in the mud beastwise karma what do they do  gunga has prayed for a vengeance on the bridgebuilders and kali is with her now she bids hanuman whelm the bridge that her honour may be made great cried the parrot i waited here knowing that thou wouldst come o my master  and the heavenly ones said nothing did gunga and the mother of sorrows outtalk them did none speak for my people  nay said ganesh moving uneasily from foot to foot i said it was but dirt at play and why should we stamp it flat  i was content to let them toilwell content said hanuman  what had i to do with gungas anger said the bull  i am bhairon of the common folk and this my staff is kotwal of all kashi i spoke for the common people  thou the young gods eyes sparkled  am i not the first of the gods in their mouths today returned bhairon unabashed for the sake of the common people i saidvery many wise things which i have now forgottenbut this my staff  krishna turned impatiently saw the mugger at his feet and kneeling slipped an arm round the cold neck mother he said gently get thee to thy flood again the matter is not for thee what harm shall thy honour take of this live dirt thou hast given them their fields new year after year and by thy flood they are made strong they come all to thee at the last what need to slay them now have pity mother for a littleand it is only for a little  if it be only for a little the slow beast began  are they gods then krishna returned with a laugh his eyes looking into the dull eyes of the river be certain that it is only for a little the heavenly ones have heard thee and presently justice will be done go now mother to the flood again men and cattle are thick on the watersthe banks fallthe villages melt because of thee  but the bridgethe bridge stands the mugger turned grunting into the undergrowth as krishna rose  it is ended said the tigress viciously there is no more justice from the heavenly ones ye have made shame and sport of gunga who asked no more than a few score lives  of my peoplewho lie under the leafroofs of the village yonderof the young girls and the young men who sing to them said krishna and when all is done what profit tomorrow sees them at work ay if ye swept the bridge out from end to end they would begin anew hear me bhairon is drunk always hanuman mocks his people with new riddles  nay but they are very old ones the ape said laughing  shiv hears the talk of the schools and the dreams of the holy men ganesh thinks only of his fat traders but ii live with these my people asking for no gifts and so receiving them hourly  and very tender art thou of thy people said the tigress  they are my own the old women dream of me turning in their sleep the maids look and listen for me when they go to fill their lotahs by the river i walk by the young men waiting without the gates at dusk and i call over my shoulder to the whitebeards ye know heavenly ones that i alone of us all walk upon the earth continually and have no pleasure in our heavens so long as a green blade springs here or there are two voices at twilight in the standing crops wise are ye but ye live far off forgetting whence ye came so do i not forget and the firecarriage feeds your shrines ye say and the firecarriages bring a thousand pilgrimages where but ten came in the old years true that is true today  but tomorrow they are dead brother said ganesh  peace said the bull as hanuman leaned forward again and tomorrow belovedwhat of tomorrow  this only a new word creeping from mouth to mouth among the common folka word that neither man nor god can lay hold ofan evil worda little lazy word among the common folk saying and none know who set that word afoot that they weary of ye heavenly ones  the gods laughed together softly and then beloved they said  and to cover that weariness they my people will bring to thee shiv and to thee ganesh at first greater offerings and a louder noise of worship but the word has gone abroad and after they will pay fewer dues to your fat brahmins next they will forget your altars but so slowly that no man can say how his forgetfulness began  i knewi knew i spoke this also but they would not hear said the tigress we should have slainwe should have slain  it is too late now ye should have slain at the beginning when the men from across the water had taught our folk nothing now my people see their work and go away thinking they do not think of the heavenly ones altogether they think of the firecarriage and the other things that the bridgebuilders have done and when your priests thrust forward hands asking alms they give unwillingly a little that is the beginning among one or two or five or tenfor i moving among my people know what is in their hearts  and the end jester of the gods what shall the end be said ganesh  the end shall be as it was in the beginning o slothful son of shiv the flame shall die upon the altars and the prayer upon the tongue till ye become little gods againgods of the junglenames that the hunters of rats and noosers of dogs whisper in the thicket and among the cavesraggods pot godlings of the tree and the villagemark as ye were at the beginning that is the end ganesh for thee and for bhaironbhairon of the common people  it is very far away grunted bhairon also it is a lie  many women have kissed krishna they told him this to cheer their own hearts when the gray hairs came and he has told us the tale said the bull below his breath  their gods came and we changed them i took the woman and made her twelvearmed so shall we twist all their gods said hanuman  their gods this is no question of their godsone or threeman or woman the matter is with the people they move and not the gods of the bridgebuilders said krishna  so be it i have made a man worship the firecarriage as it stood still breathing smoke and he knew not that he worshipped me said hanuman the ape they will only change a little the names of their gods i shall lead the builders of the bridges as of old shiv shall be worshipped in the schools by such as doubt and despise their fellows ganesh shall have his mahajuns and bhairon the donkeydrivers the pilgrims and the sellers of toys beloved they will do no more than change the names and that we have seen a thousand times  surely they will do no more than change the names echoed ganesh but there was an uneasy movement among the gods  they will change more than the names me alone they cannot kill so long as maiden and man meet together or the spring follows the winter rains heavenly ones not for nothing have i walked upon the earth my people know not now what they know but i who live with them i read their hearts great kings the beginning of the end is born already the firecarriages shout the names of new gods that are not the old under new names drink now and eat greatly bathe your faces in the smoke of the altars before they grow cold take dues and listen to the cymbals and the drums heavenly ones while yet there are flowers and songs as men count time the end is far off but as we who know reckon it is today i have spoken  the young god ceased and his brethren looked at each other long in silence  this i have not heard before peroo whispered in his companions ear and yet sometimes when i oiled the brasses in the engineroom of the goorkha i have wondered if our priests were so wiseso wise the day is coming sahib they will be gone by the morning  a yellow light broadened in the sky and the tone of the river changed as the darkness withdrew  suddenly the elephant trumpeted aloud as though men had goaded him  let indra judge father of all speak thou what of the things we have heard has krishna lied indeed or  ye know said the buck rising to his feet ye know the riddle of the gods when brahm ceases to dream the heavens and the hells and earth disappear be content brahm dreams still the dreams come and go and the nature of the dreams changes but still brahm dreams krishna has walked too long upon earth and yet i love him the more for the tale he has told the gods change belovedall save one  ay all save one that makes love in the hearts of men said krishna knotting his girdle it is but a little time to wait and ye shall know if i lie  truly it is but a little time as thou sayest and we shall know get thee to thy huts again beloved and make sport for the young things for still brahm dreams go my children brahm dreamsand till he wakes the gods die not                                       whither went they said the lascar awestruck shivering a little with the cold  god knows said findlayson the river and the island lay in full daylight now and there was never mark of hoof or pug on the wet earth under the peepul only a parrot screamed in the branches bringing down showers of waterdrops as he fluttered his wings  up we are cramped with cold has the opium died out canst thou move sahib  findlayson staggered to his feet and shook himself his head swam and ached but the work of the opium was over and as he sluiced his forehead in a pool the chief engineer of the kashi bridge was wondering how he had managed to fall upon the island what chances the day offered of return and above all how his work stood  peroo i have forgotten much i was under the guardtower watching the river and thendid the flood sweep us away  no the boats broke loose sahib and if the sahib had forgotten about the opium decidedly peroo would not remind him in striving to retie them so it seemed to mebut it was darka rope caught the sahib and threw him upon a boat considering that we two with hitchcock sahib built as it were that bridge i came also upon the boat which came riding on horseback as it were on the nose of this island and so splitting cast us ashore i made a great cry when the boat left the wharf and without doubt hitchcock sahib will come for us as for the bridge so many have died in the building that it cannot fall  a fierce sun that drew out all the smell of the sodden land had followed the storm and in that clear light there was no room for a man to think of dreams of the dark findlayson stared upstream across the blaze of moving water till his eyes ached there was no sign of any bank to the ganges much less of a bridgeline  we came down far he said it was wonderful that we were not drowned a hundred times  that was the least of the wonder for no man dies before his time i have seen sydney i have seen london and twenty great ports butperoo looked at the damp discoloured shrine under the peepulnever man has seen that we saw here  what  has the sahib forgotten or do we black men only see the gods  there was a fever upon me findlayson was still looking uneasily across the water it seemed that the island was full of beasts and men talking but i do not remember a boat could live in this water now i think  oho then it is true when brahm ceases to dream the gods die now i know indeed what he meant once too the guru said as much to me but then i did not understand now i am wise  what said findlayson over his shoulder  peroo went on as if he were talking to himself sixseventen monsoons since i was watch on the focsle of the rewahthe kumpanis big boatand there was a big tufan green and black water beating and i held fast to the lifelines choking under the waters then i thought of the godsof those whom we saw tonighthe stared curiously at findlaysons back but the white man was looking across the flood yes i say of those whom we saw this night past and i called upon them to protect me and while i prayed still keeping my lookout a big wave came and threw me forward upon the ring of the great black bowanchor and the rewah rose high and high leaning toward the lefthand side and the water drew away from beneath her nose and i lay upon my belly holding the ring and looking down into those great deeps then i thought even in the face of death if i lose hold i die and for me neither the rewah nor my place by the galley where the rice is cooked nor bombay nor calcutta nor even london will be any more for me how shall i be sure i said that the gods to whom i pray will abide at all this i thought and the rewah dropped her nose as a hammer falls and all the sea came in and slid me backward along the focsle and over the break of the focsle and i very badly bruised my shin against the donkeyengine but i did not die and i have seen the gods they are good for live men but for the deadthey have spoken themselves therefore when i come to the village i will beat the guru for talking riddles which are no riddles when brahm ceases to dream the gods go  look upstream the light blinds is there smoke yonder  peroo shaded his eyes with his hands he is a wise man and quick hitchcock sahib would not trust a rowboat he has borrowed the rao sahibs steamlaunch and comes to look for us i have always said that there should have been a steamlaunch on the bridgeworks for us  the territory of the rao of baraon lay within ten miles of the bridge and findlayson and hitchcock had spent a fair portion of their scanty leisure in playing billiards and shooting blackbuck with the young man he had been bearled by an english tutor of sporting tastes for some five or six years and was now royally wasting the revenues accumulated during his minority by the indian government his steamlaunch with its silverplated rails striped silk awning and mahogany decks was a new toy which findlayson had found horribly in the way when the rao came to look at the bridgeworks  its great luck murmured findlayson but he was none the less afraid wondering what news might be of the bridge  the gaudy blue and white funnel came downstream swiftly they could see hitchcock in the bows with a pair of operaglasses and his face was unusually white then peroo hailed and the launch made for the tail of the island the rao sahib in tweed shootingsuit and a sevenhued turban waved his royal hand and hitchcock shouted but he need have asked no questions for findlaysons first demand was for his bridge  all serene gad i never expected to see you again findlayson youre seven koss downstream yes theres not a stone shifted anywhere but how are you i borrowed the rao sahibs launch and he was good enough to come along jump in  ah finlinson you are very well eh that was most unprecedented calamity last night eh my royal palace too it leaks like the devil and the crops will also be short all about my country now you shall back her out hitchcock ii do not understand steamengines you are wet you are cold finlinson i have some things to eat here and you will take a good drink  im immensely grateful rao sahib i believe youve saved my life how did hitchcock  oho his hair was upon end he rode to me in the middle of the night and woke me up in the arms of morphus i was most truly concerned finlinson so i came too my headpriest he is very angry just now we will go quick mister hitchcock i am due to attend at twelvefortyfive in the state temple where we sanctify some new idol if not so i would have asked you to spend the day with me they are dambore these religious ceremonies finlinson eh  peroo well known to the crew had possessed himself of the wheel and was taking the launch craftily upstream but while he steered he was in his mind handling two feet of partially untwisted wirerope and the back upon which he beat was the back of his guru     iv  the miracles       i sent a message to my dear       a thousand leagues and more to her     the dumb sealevels thrilled to hear       and lost atlantis bore to her      behind my message hard i came       and nigh had found a grave for me     but that i launched of steel and flame       did war against the wave for me      uprose the deep by gale on gale       to bid me change my mind again     he broke his teeth along my rail       and roaring swung behind again      i stayed the sun at noon to tell       my way across the waste of it     i read the storm before it fell       and made the better haste of it      afar i hailed the land at night       the towers i built had heard of me     and ere my rocket reached its height       had flashed my love the word of me      earth gave her chosen men of strength       they lived and strove and died for me     to drive my road a nations length       and toss the miles aside for me      i snatched their toil to serve my needs       too slow their fleetest flew for me     i tired twenty smoking steeds       and bade them bait a new for me      i sent the lightnings forth to see       where hour by hour she waited me     among ten million one was she       and surely all men hated me      dawn ran to meet us at my goal       ah day no tongue
