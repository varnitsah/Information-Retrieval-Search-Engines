25790145	touch and go  a play in three acts   by d h lawrence     preface   a nice phrase a peoples theatre but what about it theres no such thing in existence as a peoples theatre or even on the way to existence as far as we can tell the name is chosen the baby isnt even begotten nay the wouldbe parents arent married nor yet courting  a peoples theatre note the indefinite article it isnt the peoples theatre but a peoples theatre not the theatre of plebs the proletariat but the theatre of a people what people quel peuple donca peoples theatre translate it into french for yourself  a peoples theatre since we cant produce it let us deduce it major premise the seats are cheap minor premiss the plays are good conclusion a peoples theatre how much will you give me for my syllogism not a slap in the eye i hope  we stick to our guns the seats are cheap that has a nasty proletarian look about it but appearances are deceptive the proletariat isnt poor everybody is poor except capital and labour between these upper and nether millstones great numbers of decent people are squeezed  the seats are cheap in decencys name nobody wants to swank to sit in the front of a box like a geranium on a windowsillthe cynosure of many eyes nobody wants to profiteer we all feel that it is as humiliating to pay high prices as to charge them no man consents in his heart to pay high prices unless he feels that what he pays with his right hand he will get back with his left either out of the pocket of a man who isnt looking or out of the envy of the poor neighbour who is looking but cant afford the figure the seats are cheap why should a people fabulous and lofty giraffe want to charge or pay high prices if it were the people nowbut it isnt it isnt plebs the proletariat the seats are cheap  the plays are good pahthis has a canting smell any play is good to the man who likes to look at it and at that rate chu chin chow is extrasupergood what about your good plays whose good pfui to your goodness  that minor premiss is a bad egg it will hatch no bird good plays you might as well say mimsy bomtittle plays youd be saying as much the plays aredont say good or youll be beaten the playsthe plays of a peoples theatre areoh heaven what are theynot popular nor populous nor plebian nor proletarian nor folk nor parish plays none of that adjectival spawn  the only clueword is peoples for all that a peopleschaste word it will bring forth no adjective the plays of a peoples theatre are peoples plays the plays of a peoples theatre are plays about people  it doesnt look much at first sight after allpeople yes people not the people ie plebs nor yet the upper ten people neither piccoli nor grandi in our republic people  people ah god not mannequins not lords nor proletariats nor bishops nor husbands nor corespondents nor virgins nor adultresses nor uncles nor noses not even white rabbits nor presidents people  men who are somebody not men who are something men who happen to be bishops or corespondents women who happen to be chaste just as they happen to freckle because its one of their innumerable odd qualities even men who happen by the way to have long noses but not noses on two legs not burly pairs of gaiters stuffed and voluble not white meringues of chastity not incarnations of corespondence not proletariats petitioners presidents noses bits of fluff heavens what an assortment of bits and arent we sick of them  people i say and after all its saying something its harder to be a human being than to be a president or a bit of fluff you can be a president or a bit of fluff or even a nose by clockwork given a role a part you can play it by clockwork but you cant have a clockwork human being  were dead sick of parts its no use your protesting that there is a man behind the nose we cant see him and he cant see himself nothing but nose neither can you make us believe there is a man inside the gaiters hes never showed his head yet  it may be in real life the gaiters wear the man as the nose wears cyrano it may be sir auckland geddes and mr j h thomas are only clippings from the illustrated press it may be that a miner is a complicated machine for cutting coal and voting on a ballotpaper it may be that coalowners are like the petit bleu arrangement a system of vacuum tubes for whooshing bradburys about from one to the other  it may be that everybody delights in bits in parts that the public insists on noses gaiters white rabbits bits of fluff automata and gewgaws if they do then let em chu chin chow for ever  in spite of them all a peoples theatre a peoples theatre shows men and not parts not bits nor bundles of bits a whole bunch of roles tied into one wont make an individual though gaiters perish we will have men  although most miners may be pickcumshovelcumballot implements and no more still among miners there must be two or three living individuals the same among the masters the majority are suctiontubes for bradburys but is this sodom of industrialism there are surely ten men all told my poor little withered grain of mustard seed i am half afraid to take you across to the seedtesting department  and if there are men there is a peoples theatre  how many tragic situations did goethe say were possible something like thirtytwo which seems a lot anyhow granted that men are men still that not all of them are bits parts machinesections then we have added another tragic possibility to the list the strike situation as yet no one tackles this situation it is a sort of medusa head which turnsno not to stone but to sloppy treacle mr galsworthy had a peep and sank down towards bathos  granted that men are still men labour v capitalism is a tragic struggle if men are no more than implements it is nontragic and merely disastrous in tragedy the man is more than his part hamlet is more than prince of denmark macbeth is more than murderer of duncan the man is caught in the wheels of his part his fate he may be torn asunder he may be killed but the resistant integral soul in him is not destroyed he comes through though he dies he goes through with his fate though death swallows him and it is in this facing of fate this going right through with it that tragedy lies tragedy is not disaster it is a disaster when a cartwheel goes over a frog but it is not a tragedy not the hugest not the death of ten million men it is only a cartwheel going over a frog there must be a supreme struggle  in shakespeares time it was the people versus king storm that was brewing majesty was about to have its head off come what might hamlet and macbeth and goneril and regan had to see the business through  now a new wind is getting up we call it labour versus capitalism we say it is a mere material struggle a moneygrabbing affair but this is only one aspect of it in so far as men are merely mechanical the struggle is one which though it may bring disaster and death to millions is no more than accident an accidental collision of forces but in so far as men are men the situation is tragic it is not really the bone we are fighting for we are fighting to have somebodys head off the conflict is in pure passional antagonism turning upon the poles of belief majesty was only hors doevres to this tragic repast  so the strike situation has this dual aspect first it is a mechanicomaterial struggle two mechanical forces pulling asunder from the central object the bone all it can result in is the pulling asunder of the fabric of civilisation and even of life without any creative issue it is no more than a frog under a cartwheel the mechanical forces rolling on roll over the body of life and squash it  the second is the tragic aspect according to this view we see more than two dogs fighting for a bone and life hopping under the juggernaut wheel the two dogs are making the bone a pretext for a fight with each other that old bulldog the british capitalist has got the bone in his teeth that unsatisfied mongrel plebs the proletariat shivers with rage not so much at the sight of the bone as at sight of the great wrinkled jowl that holds it there is the old dog with his knowing look and his massive grip on the bone and there is the insatiable mongrel with his great splay paws the one is all head and arrogance the other all paws and grudge the bone is only the pretext a first condition of the being of bully is that he shall hate the prowling great paws of the plebs whilst plebs by inherent nature goes mad at the sight of bullys jowl drop it cries plebs hands off growls bully it is hands against head the shambling servile body in a rage of insurrection at last against the wrinkled heavy head  labour not only wants his debt he wants his pound of flesh it is a quandary in our heart of hearts we must admit the debt we must admit that it is long overdue but this last condition in vain we study our anatomy to see which part we can best spare  where is our portia to save us with a timely quibble weve plenty of portias theyve recited their heads offthe quality of mercy is not strained but the old shylock of the proletariat persists he pops up again and says all right i cant have my pound of flesh with the blood but then you cant keep my pound of flesh with your bloodyou owe it to me it is your business to deliver the goods deliver it thenwith or without blooddeliver it the portia scratches her head and thinks again  whats the solution there is no solution but still there is a choice theres a choice between a mess and a tragedy if plebs and bully hang on one to each end of the bone and pull for grim life they will at last tear the bone to atoms in short destroy the whole material substance of life and so perish by accident no better than a frog under the wheel of destiny that may be a disaster but it is only a mess for all that  on the other hand if they have a fight to fight they might really drop the bone instead of wrangling the bone to bits they might really go straight for one another they are like hostile parties on board a ship who both proceed to scuttle the ship so as to sink the other party down goes the ship with all the bally lot on board a few survivors swim and squeal among the bubblesand then silence  it is too much to suppose that the combatants will ever drop the obvious old bone but it is not too much to imagine that some men might acknowledge the bone to be merely a pretext and hollow casus belli if we really could know what we were fighting for if we if we could deeply believe in what we were fighting for then the struggle might have dignity beauty satisfaction for us if it were a profound struggle for something that was coming to life in us a struggle that we were convinced would bring us to a new freedom a new life then it would be a creative activity a creative activity in which death is a climax in the progression towards new being and this is tragedy  therefore if we could but comprehend or feel the tragedy in the great labour struggle the intrinsic tragedy of having to pass through death to birth our souls would still know some happiness the very happiness of creative suffering instead of which we pile accident on accident we tear the fabric of our existence fibre by fibre we confidently look forward to the time when the whole great structure will come down on our heads yet after all that when we are squirming under the debris we shall have no more faith or hope or satisfaction than we have now we shall crawl from under one cartwheel straight under another  the essence of tragedy which is creative crisis is that a man should go through with his fate and not dodge it and go bumping into an accident and the whole business of life at the great critical periods of mankind is that men should accept and be one with their tragedy therefore we should open our hearts for one thing we should have a peoples theatre perhaps it would help us in this hour of confusion better than anything

man addressing a small gang of colliers from the   foot of a stumpy memorial obelisk  church bells heard   churchgoers passing along the outer pavements   willie houghton whats the matter with you folks as ive told you before and as i shall keep on telling you every now and again though it doesnt make a bit of difference is that youve got no idea of freedom whatsoever ive lived in this blessed place for fifty years and ive never seen the spark of an idea nor of any response to an idea come out of a single one of you all the time i dont know what it is with collierswhether its spending so much time in the bowels of the earthbut they never seem to be able to get their thoughts above their bellies if youve got plenty to eat and drink and a bit over to keep the missis quiet youre satisfied i never saw such a satisfied bloomin lot in my life as you barlow  wasalls men are really of course you can growse as well as anybody and you do growse but you dont do anything else youre stuck in a sort of mud of contentment and you feel yourselves sinking but you make no efforts to get out you bleat a bit like sheep in a bogbut you like it you know you like sinking inyou dont have to stand on your own feet then  ill tell you whatll happen to you chaps ill give you a little picture of what youll be like in the future barlow  walsalls ll make a number of compounds such as they keep niggers in in south africa and there youll be kept and every one of youll have a little brass collar round his neck with a number on it you wont have names any more and youll go from the compound to the pit and from the pit back again to the compound you wont be allowed to go outside the gates except at weekends theyll let you go home to your wives on saturday nights to stop over sunday but youll have to be in again by halfpast nine on sunday night and if youre late youll have your next weekend knocked off and there youll beand youll be quite happy theyll give you plenty to eat and a can of beer a day and a bit of baccaand theyll provide dominoes and skittles for you to play with and youll be the most contented set of men alivebut you wont be men you wont even be animals youll go from number one to number three thousand a lot of numbered slavesa new sort of slaves  voice an wheer shall thee be willie  willie oh i shall be outside the palings laughing at you i shall have to laugh because itll be your own faults youll have nobody but yourself to thank for it you dont want to be men youd rather not be freemuch rather youre like those people spoken of in shakespeare oh how eager these men are to be slaves i believe its shakespeareor the bibleone or the otherit mostly is  anabel wrath she was passing to church it was tiberius  willie eh  anabel tiberius said it  willie tiberiusoh did he laughs thanks well if tiberius said it there must be something in it and he only just missed being in the bible anyway he was a day late or theyd have had him in oh how eager these men are to be slavesits evident the romans deserved all they got from tiberiusand youll deserve all you get every bit of it but dont you bother youll get it you wont be at the mercy of tiberius youll be at the mercy of something a jolly sight worse tiberius took the skin off a few romans apparently but youll have the soul taken out of youevery one of you and id rather lose my skin than my soul any day but perhaps you wouldnt  voice what art makin for willie tha seems to say a lot but tha goes round it thart like a donkey on a gin tha gets ravelled  willie yes thats just it i am precisely like a donkey on a gina donkey thats trying to wind a lot of colliers up to the surface theres many a donkey thats brought more colliers than you up to see daylight by trotting roundbut do you want to know what im making for i can soon tell you that you barlow  wasalls men you havent a soul to call your own barlow  wasalls have only to say to one of you come and he cometh go and he goeth lie voice ayan what about it thas got a behind o thy own hasnt yer  willie do you stand there and ask me what about it and havent the sense to alter it couldnt you set up a proper government tomorrow if you liked couldnt you contrive that the pits belonged to you instead of you belonging to the pits like so many old pitponies that stop down till they are blind and take to eating coalslack for meadowgrass not knowing the difference if only youd learn to think id respect you as you are i cant not if i try my hardest all you can think of is to ask for another shilling a day thats as far as your imagination carries you and perhaps you get sevenpence hapenny but pay for it with halfacrowns worth of sweat the masters arent foolsas you are theyll give you twothirds of what you ask for but theyll get fivethirds of it back againand theyll get it out of your flesh and blood too in jolly hard work shylock wasnt in it with them he only wanted a pound of flesh but you cheerfully give up a pound a week each one of you and keep on giving it upbut you dont seem to see these things you cant think beyond your dinners and your lowance you think if you can get another shilling a day youre set up you make me tired i tell you  job arthur freer we think of others besides ourselves  willie hello job arthurare you there i didnt recognise you without your frockcoat and silk haton the sabbathwhat was that you said you think of something else besides yourselvesoh ayim glad to hear it did you mean your own importance       a motor car gerald barlow driving oliver turton with him has      pulled up   job arthur glancing at the car no i didnt  willie didnt you thoughcome speak up let us have it the more the merrier you were going to say something  job arthur nay you were doing the talking  willie yes so i was till you interrupted with a great idea on the tip of your tongue come spit it out no matter if mr barlow hears you you know how sorry for you we feel that youve always got to make your speeches twiceonce to those above and once to us here below i didnt meant the angels and the devils but never mind speak up job arthur  job arthur its not everybody as has as much to say as you mr houghton  willie no not in the openthats a fact some folks says a great deal more in semiprivate you were just going to explain to me on behalf of the men whom you so ably represent and so wisely lead job arthurwe wont say by the noseyou were just going to tell meon behalf of the men of course not of the mastersthat you think of others besides yourself do you mind explaining what others  job arthur everybodys used to your talk mr houghton and for that reason it doesnt make much impression what i meant to say in plain words was that we have to think of whats best for everybody not only of ourselves  willie oh i see whats best for everybody i see well for myself im much obligedtheres nothing for us to do gentlemen but for all of us to bow acknowledgments to mr job arthur freer who so kindly has all our interests at heart  job arthur i dont profess to be a redrag socialist i dont pretend to think that if the government had the pits it would be any better for us no what i mean is that the pits are there and every man on this place depends on them one way or another theyre the cow that gives the milk and what i mean is how every man shall have a proper share of the milk which is food and living its like killing the goose that laid the golden egg i want to keep the cow healthy and strong and the cow is the pits and were the men that depend on the pits  willie whos the cat thats going to lick the cream  job arthur my position is thisand i state it before masters and menthat its our business to strike such a balance between the interests of the men and the interests of the masters that the pits remain healthy and everybody profits  willie youre out for the millennium i can seewith mr job arthur freer striking the balance we all see you job arthur one foot on either side of the fence balancing the seesaw with masters at one end and men at the other youll have to give one side a lot of puddingbut go back a bit to where we were before the motor car took your breath away when you said job arthur that you think of others besides yourself didnt you mean as a matter of fact the office men didnt you mean that the colliers ledwe wont mention nosesby you were going to come out in sympathy with the office clerks supposing they didnt get the rise in wages which theyve asked forthe office clerks wasnt that it  job arthur theres been some talk among the men of standing by the office i dont know what theyll do but theyll do it of their own decision whatever it is  willie theres not a shadow of doubt about it job arthur but its a funny thing the decisions all have the same foxy smell about them job arthur  oliver turton calling from the car what was the speech about in the first place  willie i beg pardon  oliver what was the address about to begin with  willie oh the same old hatfreedom but partly its given to annoy the unco guid as they pass to their sabbath banquet of selfcomplacency  oliver what about freedom  willie very much as usual i believe but you

all but it was terrible it was terrible oliver you dont realise you dont realise how awful passion can be when it never resolves when it never becomes anything else it is hate really  oliver what did you want the passion to resolve into  anabel i was blindedmaddened gerald stung me and stung me till i was mad i left him for reasons sake for sanitys sake we should have killed one another  oliver you stung him too you knowand pretty badly at the last you dehumanised him  anabel when when i left him you mean  oliver yes when you went away with that norwegianplaying your game a little too far  anabel yes i knew youd blame me i knew youd be against me but dont you see oliver you helped to make it impossible for us  oliver did i i didnt intend to  anabel ha ha oliver your good intentions they are too good to bear investigation my friend ah but for your good and friendly intentions  oliver you mean my friendship with gerald went against you  anabel yes and your friendship with me went against gerald  oliver so i am the devil in the piece  anabel you see oliver gerald loved you far too well ever to love me altogether he loved us both but the gerald that loved you so dearly old old friends as you were and trusted you he turned a terrible face of contempt on me you dont know oliver the cold edge of geralds contempt for mebecause he was so secure and strong in his old friendship with you you dont know his sneering attitude to me in the deepest things with you he had a passion for me but he loved you  oliver well he doesnt any more we went apart after you had gone the

you wont go against the clerks in such a small matter always avoid trouble over small matters dont make bad feelingdont make bad blood  mrs barlow the blood is already rotten in the neighbourhood what it needs is letting out we need a few veins opening or we shall have mortification setting in the blood is black  mr barlow we wont accept your figure of speech literally dear no gerald dont go to war over trifles  gerald its just over trifles that one must make war father one can yield gracefully over big matters but to be bullied over trifles is a sign of criminal weakness  mr barlow ah not so not so my boy when you are as old as i am you will know the comparative insignificance of these trifles  gerald the older i get father the more such trifles stick in my throat  mr barlow ah it is an increasingly irritable disposition in you my child nothing costs so bitterly in the end as a stubborn pride  mrs barlow except a stubborn humilityand that will cost you more avoid humility beware of stubborn humility it degrades hark geraldfight when the occasion comes fight if its one against five thousand fight dont give them your heart on a dish never if they want to eat your heart out make them fight for it and then give it them poisoned at last poisoned with your own bloodwhat do you say young woman  anabel is it for me to speak mrs barlow  mrs barlow werent you asked  anabel certainly i would never give the world my heart on a dish but cant there ever be peacereal peace  mrs barlow nonot while there is devilish enmity  mr barlow you are wrong dear you are wrong the peace can come the peace that passeth all understanding  mrs barlow that there is already between me and almighty god i am at peace with the god that made me and made me proud with men who humiliate me i am at war between me and the shameful humble there is war to the end though they are millions and i am one i hate the people between my race and them and my childrenfor ever war for ever and ever  mr barlow ah

woman i am glad when you blame me but dont blame me when i tell you to fight dont do that or you will regret it when you must die ah your father was stiff and proud enough before men of better rank than himself he was overbearing enough with his equals and his betters but he humbled himself before the poor he made me ashamed he must hear ithe must hear it better he should hear it than die coddling himself with peace his humility and my pride they have made a nice ruin of each other yet he is the man i wanted to marryhe is the man i would marry again but never never again would i give way before his goodness gerald if you must be true to your father be true to me as well dont set me down at nothing because i havent a humble case  gerald no motherno dear mother you see dear mother i

music sir  gerald no dont stay eva we mustnt tire father exit eva  mr barlow i am afraid anabel you will have a great deal to excuse in us in the way of manners we have never been a formal household but you have lived in the world of artists you will understand i hope  anabel oh surely  mr barlow yes i know we have been a turbulent family and we have had our share of sorrow even more perhaps than of joys and sorrow makes one indifferent to the conventionalities of life  gerald excuse me father do you mind if i go and write a letter i have on my conscience  mr barlow no my boy exit gerald we have had our share of sorrow and of conflict miss wrath as you may have gathered  anabel yesa little  mr barlow the mines were opened when my father was a boythe firstand i was born late when he was nearly fifty so that all my life has been involved with coal and colliers as a young man i was gay and thoughtless but i married young and we lost our first child through a terrible accident two children we have lost through sudden and violent death winifred goes out unnoticed it made me reflect and when i came to reflect anabel i could not justify my position in life if i believed in the teachings of the new testamentwhich i did and dohow could i keep two or three thousand men employed and underground in the mines at a wage let us say of two pounds a week whilst i lived in this comfortable house and took something like two thousand pounds a yearlet us name any figure  anabel yes of course but is it money that really matters mr barlow  mr barlow my dear if you are a working man it matters when i went into the homes of my poor fellows when they were ill or had had accidentsthen i knew it mattered i knew that the great disparity was wrongeven as we are taught that it is wrong  anabel yes i believe that the great disparity is a mistake but take their lives mr barlow do you thing they would live more if they had more money do you think the poor live less than the richis their life emptier  mr barlow surely their lives would be better anabel  oliver all our lives would be better if we hadnt to hang on in the perpetual tugofwar like two donkeys pulling at one carrot the ghastly tension of possessions and struggling for possession spoils life for everybody  mr barlow yes i know now as i knew then that it was wrong but how to avoid the wrong if i gave away the whole of my income it would merely be an arbitrary dispensation of charity the money would still be mine to give and those that received it would probably only be weakened instead of strengthened and then my wife was accustomed to a certain way of living a certain establishment had i any right to sacrifice her without her consent  anabel why no  mr barlow again if i withdrew from the company if i retired on a small income i knew that another man would automatically take my place and make it probably harder for the men  anabel of coursewhile the system stands if one makes selfsacrifice one only panders to the system makes it fatter  mr barlow one panders to the systemone panders to the system and so you see the problem is too much one man cannot alter or affect the system he can only sacrifice himself to it which is the worst thing probably that he can do  oliver quite but why feel guilty for the systemeverybody supports it the poor as much as the rich if every rich man withdrew from the system the working class and socialists would keep it going every man in the hope of getting rich himself at last its the people that are wrong they want the system much more than the rich dobecause they are much more anxious to be richnever having been rich poor devils  mr barlow just the system so i decided at last that the best way was to give every private help that lay in my power i would help my men individually and personally wherever i could not one of them came to me and went away unheard and there was no distress which could be alleviated that i did not try to alleviate yet i am afraid that the greatest distress i never heard of the most distressed never came to me they hid their trouble  anabel yes the decent ones  mr barlow but i wished to helpit was my duty still i think that on the whole we were a comfortable and happy community barlow  walsalls men were not unhappy in those days i believe we were liberal the men lived  oliver yes that is true even twenty years ago the place was still jolly  mr barlow and then when gerald was a lad of thirteen came the great lockout we belonged to the masters federationi was but one man on the board we had to abide by the decision the mines were closed till the men would accept the reductionwell that cut my life across we were shutting the men out from work starving their families in order to force them to accept a reduction it may be the condition of trade made it imperative but for myself i would rather have lost everythingof course we did what we could food was very cheappractically given away we had open kitchen here and it was mercifully warm summertime nevertheless there was privation and suffering and trouble and bitterness we had the redcoats downeven to guard this house and from this window i saw whatmore headstocks ablaze and before i could get to the spot the soldiers had shot two poor fellows they were not killed thank god  oliver ah but they enjoyed itthey enjoyed it immensely i remember what grand old sporting weeks they were it was like a foxhunt so lively and gaybands and teaparties and excitement everywhere pitponies loose men all over the countryside  mr barlow there was a great deal of suffering which you were too young to appreciate however since that year i have had to acknowledge a new situationa radical if unspoken opposition between masters and men since that year we have been split into opposite camps whatever i might privately feel i was one of the owners one of the masters and therefore in the opposite camp to my men i was an oppressor a representative of injustice and greed privately i like to think that even to this day they bear me no malice that they have some lingering regard for me but the master stands before the human being and the condition of war overrides individualsthey hate the master even whilst as a human being he would be their friend i recognise the inevitable justice it is the price one has to pay  anabel yes it is difficultvery  mr barlow perhaps i weary you  anabel oh nono  mr barlow wellthen the mines began to pay badly the seams ran thin and unprofitable work was short either we must close down or introduce a new system american methods which i dislike so extremely now it really became a case of men working against machines flesh and blood working against iron for a livelihood still it had to be donethe whole system revolutionised gerald took it in handand now i hardly know my own pits with the great electric plants and strange machinery and the new coalcuttersiron men as the colliers call themeverything running at top speed utterly dehumanised inhuman well it had to be done it was the only alternative to closing down and throwing three thousand men out of work and gerald has done it but i cant bear to see it the men of this generation are not like my men they are worn and gloomy they have a hollow look that i cant bear to see they are a great grief to me i remember men even twenty years agoa noisy lively careless set who kept the place ringing i feel it is unnatural i feel afraid of it and i cannot help feeling guilty  anabel yesi understand it terrifies me  mr barlow does itdoes ityesand as my wife says i leave it all to geraldthis terrible situation but i appeal to god if anything in my power could have averted it i would have averted it i would have made any sacrifice for it is a great and bitter trouble to me  anabel ah well in death there is no industrial situation something must be different there  mr barlow yesyes  oliver and you see sacrifice isnt the slightest use if only people would be sane and decent  mr barlow yes indeedwould you be so good as to ring oliver i think i must go to bed  anabel ah you have overtired yourself  mr barlow no my dearnot overtired excuse me if i have burdened you with all this i relieves me to speak of it  anabel i realise how terrible it is mr barlowand how helpless one is  mr barlow thank you my dear for your sympathy  oliver if the people for one minute pulled themselves up and conquered their mania for money and machine excitement the whole thing would be solvedwould you like me to find winnie and tell her to say good night to you  mr barlow if you would be so kind exit oliver cant you find a sweet that you would like my dear wont you take a little cherry brandy   enter butler   anabel thank you  william you will go up sir  mr barlow yes william  william you are tired tonight sir  mr barlow it has come over me just now  william i wish you went up before you became so overtired sir would you like nurse  mr barlow no ill go with you william good night my dear  anabel good night mr barlow i am so sorry if you are overtired       exit butler and mr barlow  anabel takes a drink and goes to      the fire   enter gerald   gerald father gone up  anabel yes  gerald i thought i heard him has he been talking too muchpoor father he will take things to heart  anabel tragic really  gerald yes i suppose it is but one can get beyond tragedybeyond the state of feeling tragical i mean father himself is tragical one feels he is mistakenand yet he wouldnt be any different and be himself i suppose hes sort of crucified on an idea of the working people its rather horrible when hes ones fatherhowever apart from tragedy how do you like being here in this house  anabel i like the house its rather too comfortable  gerald yes but how do you like being here  anabel how do you like my being in your home  gerald oh i think youre very decorative  anabel more decorative than comfortable  gerald perhaps but perhaps you give the necessary finish to the establishment  anabel like the correct windowcurtains  gerald yes something like that i say why did you come anabel why did you come slapbang into the middle of usits not expostulationi want to know  anabel you mean you want to be told  gerald yes i want to be told  anabel thats rather mean of you you should savvy and let it go without saying  gerald yes but i dont savvy  anabel then wait till you do  gerald no i want to be told theres a difference in you anabel that puts me out rather youre sort of softer and sweeterim not sure whether it isnt a touch of father in you theres a little sanctified smudge on your face are you really a bit sanctified  anabel no not sanctified its true i feel different i feel i want a new way of lifesomething more dignified more religious if you likeanyhow something positive  gerald is it the change of heart anabel  anabel perhaps it is gerald  gerald im not sure that i like it isnt it like a berry that decides to get very sweet and goes soft  anabel i dont think so  gerald slightly sanctimonious i think i liked you better before i dont think i like you with this touch of aureole people seem to me so horribly selfsatisfied when they get a change of heartthey take such a fearful lot of credit to themselves on the strength of it  anabel i dont think i dodo you feel no different gerald  gerald radically i cant say i do i feel very much more indifferent  anabel what to  gerald everything  anabel youre still angrythats what it is  gerald oh yes im angry but that is part of my normal state  anabel why are you angry  gerald is there any reason why i shouldnt be angry im angry because you treated mewell so impudently reallyclearing out and leaving one to whistle to the empty walls  anabel dont you think it was time i cleared out when you became so violent and really dangerous really like a madman  gerald time or not time you wentyou disappeared and left us high and dryand i am still angrybut im not only angry about that im angry with the colliers with labour for its lowdown impudenceand im angry with father for being so illand im angry with mother for looking such a hopeless thingand im angry with oliver because he thinks so much  anabel and what are you angry with yourself for  gerald im angry with myself for being myselfi always was that i was always a curse to myself  anabel and thats why you curse others so much  gerald you talk as if butter wouldnt melt in your mouth  anabel you see gerald there has to be a change youll have to change  gerald change of heartwell it wont be to get softer anabel  anabel you neednt be softer but you can be quieter more sane even there ought to be some part of you that can be quiet and apart from the world some part that can be happy and gentle  gerald well there isnt i dont pretend to be able to extricate a soft sort of john halifax gentleman out of the machine im mixed up in and keep him to gladden the connubial hearth im angry and im angry right through and im not going to play bopeep with myself pretending not to be  anabel nobody asks you to but is there no part of you that can be a bit gentle and peaceful and happy with a woman  gerald no there isntim not going to smug with youno not i youre smug in your coming back you feel virtuous and expect me to rise to it i wont  anabel then id better have stayed away  gerald if you want me to virtuise and smug with you you had  anabel what do you want then  gerald i dont know i know i dont want that  anabel oh very well goes to the piano begins to play   enter mrs barlow

gerald what have you heard mother  mrs barlow i heard oliver and this young woman talking  gerald oh did you when what did they say  mrs barlow something about married in the sight of heaven but couldnt keep it up on earth  gerald i dont understand  mrs barlow that you and this young woman were married in the sight of heaven or through eternity or something similar but that you couldnt make up your minds to it on earth  gerald really thats very curious mother  mrs barlow very common occurrence i believe  gerald yes so it is but i dont think you heard quite right dear there seems to be some lingering uneasiness in heaven as a matter of fact wed quite made up our minds to live apart on earth but where did you hear this mother  mrs barlow i heard it outside the studio door this morning  gerald you mean you happened to be on one side of the door while oliver and anabel were talking on the other  mrs barlow youd make a detective geraldyoure so good at putting two and two

as she pretends to be  anabel i dont think shes mad at all i think she has most desperate courage  gerald courage is good thats a new term for it  anabel yes courage when a man says courage he means the courage to die a woman means the courage to live thats what women hate men most for that they havent the courage to live  gerald mother takes her courage in both hands rather late  anabel were a little late ourselves  gerald we are rather by the way you seem to have had plenty of the courage of deathyouve played a pretty deathly game it seems to meboth when i knew you and afterwards youve had your finger pretty deep in the deathpie  anabel thats why i want a change ofof  gerald of heartbetter take mothers tip and try the poker  anabel i will  gerald hacorraggio  anabel yescorraggio  gerald

sounds like a sneezing game doesnt it  gerald it is do you know the famous rhyme             speak roughly to your little boy           and beat him when he sneezes   job arthur no i cant say i do  gerald my mother does will you have anything to drink will you help yourself  job arthur wellnoi dont think ill have anything thanks  gerald a cherry brandyyesanabel whats yours  anabel did i see kummel  gerald you did they all take drinks whats the latest mr freer  job arthur the latest well i dont know im sure  gerald oh yes trot it out were quite private  job arthur welli dont know theres several things  gerald the more the merrier  job arthur im not so sure the men are in a very funny temper mr barlowvery funny  gerald coincidenceso am i not surprising is it  job arthur the men perhaps not  gerald what else job arthur  job arthur you know the men have decided to stand by the office men  gerald yes  job arthur theyve agreed to come out next monday  gerald have they  job arthur yes there was no stopping them they decided for it like one man  gerald how was that  job arthur thats what surprises me theyre a jolly sight more certain over this than theyve ever been over their own interests  gerald all their love for the office clerks coming out in a rush  job arthur well i dont know about love but thats how it is  gerald what is it if it isnt love  job arthur i cant say theyre in a funny temper its hard to make out  gerald a funny temper are they then i suppose we ought to laugh  job arthur no i dont think its a laughing matter theyre coming out on monday for certain  gerald yesso are the daffodils  job arthur beg pardon  gerald daffodils  job arthur no i dont follow what you mean  gerald dont you but i thought alfred breffitt and william straw were not very popular  job arthur no they arentnot in themselves but its the principle of the thingso it seems  gerald what principle  job arthur why all sticking together for one thingall barlow  walsalls men holding by one another  gerald united we stand  job arthur thats it and then its the strong defending the weak as well theres three thousand colliers standing up for thirtyodd office men i must say i think its sporting myself  gerald you do do you united we stand divided we fall what do they stand for really what is it  job arthur wellfor their right to a living wage thats how i see it  gerald for their right to a living wage just that  job arthur yes sirthats how i see it  gerald well that doesnt seem so preposterously difficult does it  job arthur why thats what i think myself mr gerald its such a little thing  gerald quite i suppose the men themselves are to judge what is a living wage  job arthur oh i think theyre quite reasonable you know  gerald oh yes eminently reasonable reasons their strong pointand if they get their increase theyll be quite contented  job arthur yes as far as i know they will  gerald as far as you know why is there something you dont knowsomething youre not sure about  job arthur noi dont think so i think theyll be quite satisfied this time  gerald why this time is there going to be a next timeeverydayhasitstomorrow kind of thing  job arthur i dont know about that its a funny world mr barlow  gerald yes i quite believe it how do you see it so funny  job arthur oh i dont know everythings in a funny state  gerald what do you mean by everything  job arthur welli mean things in generallabour for example  gerald you think labours in a funny state do you what do you think it wants what do you think personally  job arthur well in my own mind i think it wants a bit of its own back  gerald and how does it mean to get it  job arthur ha thats not so easy to say but it means to have it in the long run  gerald you mean by increasing demands for higher wages  job arthur yes perhaps thats one road  gerald do you see any other  job arthur not just for the present  gerald but later on  job arthur i cant say about that the men will be quiet enough for a bit if its all right about the office men you know  gerald probably but have barlow  walsalls men any special grievance apart from the rest of the miners  job arthur i dont know theyve no liking for you you know sir  gerald why  job arthur they think youve got a down on them  gerald why should they  job arthur i dont know sir but they do  gerald so they have a personal feeling against me you dont think all the colliers are the same all over the country  job arthur i think theres a good deal of feeling  gerald of wanting their own back  job arthur thats it  gerald but what can they do i dont see what they can do they can go out on strikebut theyve done that before and the owners at a pinch can stand it better than they can as for the ruin of the industry if they do ruin it it falls heaviest on them in fact it leaves them destitute theres nothing they can do you know that doesnt hit them worse than it hits us  job arthur i know theres something in that but if they had a strong man to lead them you see  gerald yes ive heard a lot about that strong manbut ive never come across any signs of him you know i dont believe in one strong man appearing out of so many little men all men are pretty big in an age or in a movement which produces a really big man and labour is a great swarm of hopelessly little men thats how i see it  job arthur im not so sure about that  gerald i am labour is a thing that cant have a head its a sort of unwieldy monster thats bound to run its skull against the wall sooner or later and knock out what bit of brain its got you see you need wit and courage and real understanding if youre going to do anything positive and labour has none of these thingscertainly it shows no signs of them  job arthur yes when it has a chance i think youll see plenty of courage and plenty of understanding  gerald it always had a chance and where one sees a bit of courage theres no understanding and where theres some understanding theres absolutely no courage its hopeless you knowit would be far best if theyd all give it up and try a new line  job arthur i dont think they will  gerald no i dont either theyll make a mess and when theyve made it theyll never get out of it they canttheyre too stupid  job arthur theyve never had a try yet  gerald theyre trying every day they just simply couldnt control modern industrythey havent the intelligence theyve no life intelligence the owners may have little enough but labour has none theyre just mechanical little things that can make one or two motions and theyre done theyve no more idea of life than a lawnmower has  job arthur it remains to be seen  gerald no it doesnt its perfectly obvioustheres nothing remains to be seen all that labour is capable of is smashing things up and even for that i dont believe it has either the energy or the courage or the bit of necessary passion or slapdashcall it whatever you will however well see  job arthur yes sir perhaps you see now why youre not so very popular mr gerald  gerald we cant all be popular job arthur youre very high up in popularity i believe  job arthur not so very they listen to me a bit but you never know when theyll let you down i know theyll let me down one dayso it wont be a surprise  gerald i should think not  job arthur but about the office men mr gerald you think itll be all right  gerald oh yes thatll be all right  job arthur easiest for this time anyhow sir we dont want bloodshed do we  gerald i shouldnt mind at all it might clear the way to something but i have absolutely no belief in the power of labour even to bring about anything so positive as bloodshed  job arthur i dont know about thati dont know well  gerald have another drink before you goyes do help yourself  job arthur wellif youre so pressing helps himself heres luck all  all thanks  gerald take a cigartheres the box go ontake a handfulfill your case  job arthur theyre a great luxury nowadays arent they almost beyond a man like me  gerald yes thats the worst of not being a bloated capitalist never mind youll be a cabinet minister some dayoh all rightill open the door for you  job arthur oh dont trouble good nightgood night exeunt  oliver oh god what a world to live in  anabel i rather liked him what is he  oliver checkweighmanlocal secretary for the miners federationplays the violin well although he was a collier and it spoilt his hands theyre a musical family  anabel but isnt he rather nice  oliver i dont like him but i confess hes a study hes the modern judas  anabel dont you think he likes gerald  oliver im sure he does the way he suns himself herelike a cat purring in his luxuriation  anabel yesi dont mind it it shows a certain sensitiveness and a certain taste  oliver yes he has bothtouch of the artist as mrs barlow says he loves refinement culture breeding all those thingsloves themand a presence a fine free manner  anabel but that is nice in him  oliver quite but what he loves and what he admires and what he aspires to he must betray its his fatality he lives for the moment when he can kiss gerald in the garden of olives or wherever it was  anabel but gerald shouldnt be kissed  oliver thats what i say  anabel and thats what his mother means as well i suppose   enter gerald   gerald wellyouve heard the voice of the people  anabel he isnt the people  gerald i think he is myselfthe epitome  oliver no hes a special type  gerald ineffectual dont you think  anabel how pleased you are gerald how pleased you are with yourself you love the turn with him  gerald its rather stimulating you know  anabel it oughtnt to be then  oliver hes you judas and you love him  gerald nothing so deep hes just a sort of aeolian harp that sings to the temper of the wind i find him amusing  anabel i think its boring  oliver and i think its nasty  gerald i believe youre both jealous of him what do you think of the working man oliver  oliver it seems to me hes in nearly as bad a way as the british employer hes nearly as much beside the point  gerald what point  oliver oh just life  gerald thats too vague my boy do you think theyll ever make a bustup  oliver i cant tell i dont see any good in it if they do  gerald it might clear the wayand it might block the way for ever depends what comes through but sincerely i dont think theyve got it in them  anabel they may have something better  gerald that suggestion doesnt interest me anabel ah well we shall see what we shall see have a whisky and soda with me oliver and let the troubled course of this evening run to a smooth close its quite like old times arent you smoking anabel  anabel no thanks  gerald i believe youre a reformed character so it wont be like old times after all  anabel i dont want old times i want new ones  gerald wait till job arthur has risen like antichrist and proclaimed the resurrection of the godsdo you see job arthur proclaiming dionysos and aphrodite  anabel it bores me i dont like your mood good night  gerald oh dont go  anabel yes good night exit  oliver shes not reformed gerald shes the same old moral charactermoral to the last bit of her reallyas she always was  gerald is that what it isbut one must be moral  oliver oh yes oliver cromwell wasnt as moral as anabel isnor such an iconoclast  gerald poor old anabel  oliver how she hates the dark gods  gerald and yet they cast a spell over her poor old anabel well oliver is bacchus the father of whisky  oliver i dont knowi dont like you either you seem to smile all over yourself its objectionable good night  gerald oh look here this is censorious  oliver you smile to yourself exit   curtain     act iii   scene i    an old park  early evening  in the background a low georgian   hall which has been turned into offices for the company shows   windows already lighted  gerald and anabel walk along the path   anabel how beautiful this old park is  gerald yes it is beautifulseems so far away from everywhere if one doesnt remember that the hall is turned into officesno one has lived here since i was a little boy i remember going to a christmas party at the walsalls  anabel has it been shut up so long  gerald the walsalls didnt like ittoo near the ugliness they were county you knowwe never were father never gave mother a chance there and besides the place is damp cellars full of water  anabel even now  gerald no not nowtheyve been drained but the place would be too damp for a dwellinghouse its all right as offices they burn enormous fires the rooms are quite charming this is what happens to the stately homes of englandthey buzz with inky clerks or their equivalent stateliness is on its last legs  anabel yes it grieves methough i should be bored if i had to be stately i thinkisnt it beautiful in this light like an eighteenthcentury aquatint im sure no age was as ugly as this since the world began  gerald for pure ugliness certainly not and i believe none has been so filthy to live inlet us sit down a minute shall we and watch the rooks fly home it always stirs sad sentimental feelings in me  anabel so it does in melisten one can hear the coalcarts on the roadand the brookand the dull noise of the townand the beating of new london pitand voicesand the rooksand yet it is so still we seem so still here dont we  gerald yes  anabel dont you think weve been wrong  gerald how  anabel in the way weve livedand the way weve loved  gerald it hasnt been heaven has it yet i dont know that weve been wrong anabel we had it to go through  anabel perhapsand yes weve been wrong too  gerald probably only i dont feel it like that  anabel then i think you ought you ought to feel youve been wrong  gerald yes probably only i dont i cant help it i think weve gone the way we had to go following our own natures  anabel and where has it landed us  gerald here  anabel and where is that  gerald just on this bench in the park looking at the evening  anabel but what next  gerald god knows why trouble  anabel one must trouble i want to feel sure  gerald what of  anabel of youand of myself  gerald then be sure  anabel but i cant think of the pastwhat its been  gerald this isnt the past  anabel but what is it is there anything sure in it is there any real happiness  gerald why not  anabel but how can you ask think of what our life has been  gerald i dont want to  anabel no you dont but what do you want  gerald im all right you know sitting here like this  anabel but one cant sit here forever can one  gerald i dont want to  anabel and what will you do when we leave here  gerald god knows dont worry me be still a bit  anabel but im worried you dont love me  gerald i wont argue it  anabel and im not happy  gerald why not anabel  anabel because you dont love meand i cant forget  gerald i do love youand tonight ive forgotten  anabel then make me forget too make me happy  gerald i cant make youand you know it  anabel yes you can its your business to make me happy ive made you happy  gerald you want to make me unhappy  anabel i do think youre the last word in selfishness if i say i cant forget you merely say ive forgotten and if i say im unhappy all you can answer is that i want to make you unhappy i dont in the least i want to be happy myself but you dont help me  gerald there is no help for it you see if you were happy with me here youd be happy as you arent nothing will make younot genuinely  anabel and thats all you care  gerald noi wish we could both be happy at the same moment but apparently we cant  anabel and why notbecause youre selfish and think of nothing but yourself and your own feelings  gerald if it is so it is so  anabel then we shall never be happy  gerald then we shant a pause  anabel then what are we going to do  gerald do  anabel do you want me to be with you  gerald yes  anabel are you sure  gerald yes  anabel then why dont you want me to be happy  gerald if youd only be happy here and now  anabel how can i  gerald how cant youyouve got a devil inside you  anabel then make me not have a devil  gerald ive know you long enoughand known myself long enoughto know i can make you nothing at all anabel neither can you make me if the happiness isnt therewell we shall have to wait for it like a dispensation it probably means we shall have to hate each other a little morei suppose hate is a real process  anabel yes i know you believe more in hate than in love  gerald nobody is more weary of hate than i amand yet we cant fix our own hour when we shall leave off hating and fighting it has to work itself out in us  anabel but i dont want to hate and fight with you any more i dont believe in itnot any more  gerald its a cleansing processlike aristotles katharsis we shall hate ourselves clean at last i suppose  anabel why arent you clean now why cant you love he laughs do you love me  gerald yes  anabel do you want to be with me for ever  gerald yes  anabel sure  gerald quite sure  anabel why are you so cool about it  gerald im not im only surewhich you are not  anabel yes i ami want to be married to you  gerald i know you want me to want you to be married to me but whether off your own bat you have a positive desire that way im not sure you keep something backsome sort of female reservationlike a dagger up your sleeve you want to see me in transports of love for you  anabel how can you say so thereyou seetherethis is the man that pretends to love me and then says i keep a dagger up my sleeve you liar  gerald i do love youand you do keep a dagger up your sleevesome devilish little female reservation which spies at me from a distance in your soul all the time as if i were an enemy  anabel how can you say sodoesnt it show what you must be yourself doesnt it showwhat is there in your soul  gerald i dont know  anabel love pure lovedo you pretend its love  gerald im so tired of this  anabel so am i dead tired you selfdeceiving self complacent thing haarent you just the same you havent altered one scrap not a scrap

wrapped up in your new goodness i wish youd make up your mind to be downright bad  anabel hado youyoud soon see youd soon see where youd be if theres somebody coming rises  gerald never mind its the clerks leaving work i suppose sit still  anabel wont you go  gerald no a man draws near followed by another  clerk good evening sir passes on good evening mr barlow  anabel they are afraid  gerald i suppose their consciences are uneasy about this strike  anabel did you come to sit here just to catch them like a spider waiting for them  gerald no i wanted to speak to breffitt  anabel i believe youre capable of any horridness  gerald all right you believe it two more figures approach good evening  clerks good night sir one passes one stops good evening mr barlow erdid you want to see mr breffitt sir  gerald not particularly  clerk oh hell be out directly sirif youd like me to go back and tell him you wanted him  gerald no thank you  clerk good night sir excuse me asking  gerald good night  anabel who is mr breffitt  gerald he is the chief clerkand cashierone of fathers old pillars of society  anabel dont you like him  gerald not much  anabel whyyou seem to dislike very easily  gerald oh they all used to try to snub me these old buffers they detest me like poison because i am different from father  anabel i believe you enjoy being detested  gerald i do another clerk approacheshesitatesstops  clerk good evening sir good evening mr barlow erdid you want anybody at the office sir were just closing  gerald no i didnt want anybody  clerk oh no sir i see erby the way sireri hope you dont think thiserbother about an increasethis strike threatstarted in the office  gerald where did it start  clerk i should think it startedwhere it usually starts mr barlowamong a few loudmouthed people who think they can do as they like with the men theyre only using the office men as a crytheyve no interest in us they want to show their powerthats how it is sir  gerald oh yes  clerk were powerless if they like to make a cry out of us  gerald quite  clerk were as much put out about it as anybody  gerald of course  clerk yeswellgood night sir clerks draw nearthere is a sound of loud young voices and bicycle bells bicycles sweep past  clerks good night sirgood night sir  gerald good nighttheyre very bucked to see me sitting here with a womana young lady as theyll say i guess your name will be flying round tomorrow they stop partly to have a good look at you do they know you do you think  anabel sure  clerks mr breffitts just coming sirgood night sirgood night sir another bicycle passes  anabel the bicycles dont see usisnt it rather hateful to be a master the attitude of them all is so ugly i can quite see that it makes you rather a bully  gerald i suppose it does figure of a large man approaches  breffitt ohahits mr geraldi couldnt make out who it waswere you coming up to the office sir do you want me to go back with you  gerald no thank youi just wanted a word with you about this agitation itll do just as well here its a pity it startedthat the office should have set it going breffitt  breffitt its none of the offices doing i think youll find mr gerald the office men did nothing but ask for a just advanceat any rate time and prices being what they are i consider it a fair advance if the men took it up its because theyve got a set of loudmouthed blatherers and agitators among them like job arthur freer who deserve to be hungand hanging theyd get if i could have the judging of them  gerald wellits very unfortunatebecause we cant give the clerks their increase now you know  breffitt cant youcant you i cant see that it would be anything out of the way if i say what i think  gerald no they wont get any increase now it shouldnt have been allowed to become a public cry with the colliers we cant give in now  breffitt have the board decided that  gerald they haveon my advice  breffitt hmthen the men will come out  gerald we will see  breffitt its trouble for nothingits trouble that could be avoided the clerks could have their advance and it would hurt nobody  gerald too late nowi suppose if the men come out the clerks will come out with them  breffitt theyll have totheyll have to  gerald if they do we may then make certain alterations in the office staff which have needed making for some time  breffitt very goodvery good i know what you meani dont know how your father bears all this mr gerald  gerald we keep it from him as much as possibleyoull let the clerks know the decision and if they stay out with the men ill go over the list of the staff with you it has needed revising for a long time  breffitt i know what you meani know what you meani believe i understand the firms interest in my department i ought after forty years studying it ive studied the firms interest for forty years mr gerald im not likely to forget them now  gerald of course  breffitt but i think its a mistakei think its a mistake and im bound to say it to let a great deal of trouble rise for a very small cause the clerks might have had what they reasonably asked her  gerald well its too late now  breffitt i suppose it isi suppose it is i hope youll remember sir that ive put the interest of the firm before everythingbefore every consideration  gerald of course breffitt  breffitt but youve not had any liking for the office staff im afraid sirnot since your father put you amongst us for a few monthswell sir we shall weather this gale i hope as weve weathered those in the past times dont become better do they men are an ungrateful lot and these agitators should be lynched they would if i had my way  gerald yes of course dont wait  breffitt good night to you exit  gerald good night  anabel hes the last apparently  gerald well hope so  anabel he puts you in a fury  gerald its his manner my father spoilt themabominable old limpets and theyre so selfrighteous they think im a sort of criminal who has instigated this new devilish system which runs everything so close and cuts it so fineas if they hadnt made this inevitable by their shameless carelessness and wastefulness in the past he may well boast of his forty yearsforty years crass stupid wastefulness        two or three more clerks pass talking till they approach the seat      then becoming silent after bidding good night   anabel but arent you a bit sorry for them  gerald why if theyre poor what does it matter in a world of chaos  anabel and arent you an obstinate ass not to give them the bit they want its mere stupid obstinacy  gerald it may be i call it policy  anabel men always do call their obstinacy policy  gerald well i dont care what happens i wish things would come to a head i only fear they wont  anabel arent you rather wickedasking for strife  gerald i hope i am its quite a relief to me to feel that i may be wicked i fear im not i can see them all anticipating victory in their lowdown fashion wanting to crow their lowdown crowings im afraid i feel its a righteous cause to cut a lot of little combs before i die  anabel but if theyre right in what they want  gerald in the rightin the righttheyre just greedy incompetent stupid gloating in a sense of the worst sort of power theyre like vicious children who would like to kill their parents so that they could have the run of the larder the rest is just cant  anabel if youre the parent in the case i must say you flow over with lovingkindness for them  gerald i donti detest them i only hope they will fight if they would id have some respect for them but youll see what it will be  anabel i wish i neednt for its very sickening  gerald sickening beyond expression  anabel i wish we could go right away  gerald so do iif one could get oneself out of this but one cant its the same wherever you have industrialismand you have industrialism everywhere whether its in timbuctoo or paraguay or antananarivo  anabel no it isnt you exaggerate  job arthur suddenly approaching from the other side good evening mr barlow i heard you were in here could i have a word with you  gerald get on with it then  job arthur is it right that you wont meet the clerks  gerald yes  job arthur not in any way  gerald not in any way whatsoever  job arthur buti thought i understood from you the other night  gerald its all the same what you understood  job arthur then you

bumps his funnyboneor to laugh  job arthur its no laughing matter you see  gerald an im sure its no crying matterunless you want to cry do you see  job arthur ah but very likely it wouldnt be me would cryyou dont know what might happen now  gerald im waiting for something to happen i should like something to happenvery muchvery much indeed  job arthur yes but perhaps youd be sorry if it did happen  gerald is that warning or a threat  job arthur i dont knowit might be a bit of both what i mean to say  gerald suddenly seizing him by the scruff of the neck and shaking him what do you mean to sayi

after this if im to die ill die by myself as for living it seems impossible  job arthur have the men nothing to be said for their side  oliver they have a great dealbut not everything you see  job arthur havent they been wronged and arent they wronged  oliver they haveand they are but havent they been wrong themselves tooand arent they wrong now  job arthur how  oliver what about this affair do you call it right  job arthur havent we been driven to it  oliver partly and havent you driven the masters to it as well  job arthur i dont see that  oliver cant you see that it takes two to make a quarrel and as long as each party hangs on to its own end of the stick and struggles to get full hold of the stick the quarrel will continue it will continue till youve killed one another and even then what better shall you be what better would you be really if youd killed gerald barlow just now you wouldnt you know were all human beings after all and why cant we try really to leave off struggling against one another and set up a new state of things  job arthur thats all very well you see while youve got the goods  oliver ive got very little i assure you  job arthur well if you havent those you mix with have theyve got the money and the power and they intend to keep it  oliver as for power somebody must have it you know it only rests with you to put it into the hands of the best men the men you really believe inand as for money its life its living that matters not simply having money  job arthur you cant live without money  oliver i know that and therefore why cant we have the decency to agree simply about moneyjust agree to dispose of it so that all men could live their own lives  job arthur thats what we want to do but the others such as gerald barlow they keep the moneyand the power  oliver you see if you wanted to arrange things so that money flowed more naturally so that it flowed naturally to every man according to his needs i think we could all soon agree but you dont what you want is to take it away from one set and give it to anotheror keep it yourselves  job arthur we want every man to have his proper share  oliver im sure i do i want every man to be able to live and be free but we shall never manage it by fighting over the money if you want what is natural and good im sure the owners would soon agree with you  job arthur what gerald barlow agree with us  oliver why not i believe so  job arthur you ask him  oliver do you think gerald that if the men really wanted a whole better way you would agree with them  gerald i want a better way myselfbut not their way  job arthur there you see  voices ahh look youthats himthats him all over  oliver you want a better waybut not his way he wants a better waybut not your way why cant you both drop your buts and simply say you want a better way and believe yourselves and one another when you say it why cant you  gerald look here im quite as tired of my way of life as you are of yours if you make me believe you want something better then i assure you i do i want what you want but job arthur freers not the man to lead you to anything better you can tell what people want by the leaders they choose do you see you choose leaders whom i respect and ill respect you do you see as it is i dont and now im going  voices who saysoh aywho says goin  gerald yes im going about this affair here well cry quits no more said about it about a new way of life a better way all roundi tell you i want it and need it as much as ever you do i dont care about money really but im never going to be bullied  voice who doesnt care about money  gerald i dont i think we ought to be able to alter the whole systembut not by bullying not because one lot wants what the other has got  voice no because youve got everything  gerald wheres my coat now then step out of the way they move towards the car   curtain
