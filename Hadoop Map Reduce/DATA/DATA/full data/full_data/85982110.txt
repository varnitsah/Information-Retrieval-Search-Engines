november 1806 and there is no evidence that he returned to westmoreland till april 1808 although his sister spent part of the winter of 18078 at dove cottage while he and mrs wordsworth wintered at stockton with the hutchinson family several of the sonnets which are published in the poems of 1807 refer however to grasmere and were probably composed there i have conjecturally assigned a good many of them to the year 1806 some may have been composed earlier than 1806 but it is not likely that any belong to a later year  in addition to these the poems of 1806 include the character of the happy warrior unless it should be assigned to the close of the previous year see the note to the poem p 11 the horn of egremont castle the three poems composed in london in the spring of the year april or mayviz stray pleasures power of music and stargazersthe lines on the mountain echo those composed in expectation of the death of mr fox and the ode intimations of immortalitya southey in writing to sir walter scott on the 4th of february 1806 said wordsworth has of late been more employed in correcting his poems than in writing othersed   footnotes  a for reasons stated in the preface to vol i this ode is printed in vol viii at the close of the poemsed     to the spade of a friend  an agriculturist  composed while we were labouringa together in his pleasureground  composed 1806published 1807   this person was thomas wilkinson a quaker by religious profession by natural constitution of mindor shall i venture to say by gods grace he was something better he had inherited a small estate and built a house upon it near yanwath upon the banks of the emont i have heard him say that his heart used to beat in his boyhood when he heard the sound of a drum and fife nevertheless the spirit of adventure in him confined itself in tilling his ground and conquering such obstacles as stood in the way of its fertility persons of his religious persuasion do now in a far greater degree than formerly attach themselves to trade and commerce he kept the old track as represented in this poem he employed his leisure hours in shaping pleasant walks by the side of his beloved river where he also built something between a hermitage and a summer house attaching to it inscriptions after the manner of shenstone at his leasowes he used to travel from time to time partly from love of nature and partly with religious friends in the service of humanity his admiration of genius in every department did him much honour through his connection with the family in which edmund burke was educated he became acquainted with that great man who used to receive him with great kindness and condescension and many times i have heard wilkinson speak of those interesting interviews he was honoured also by the friendship of elizabeth smith and of thomas clarkson and his excellent wife and was much esteemed by lord and lady lonsdale and every member of that family among his verses he wrote many are some worthy of preservation one little poem in particular upon disturbing by prying curiosity a bird while hatching her young in his garden the latter part of this innocent and good mans life was melancholy he became blind and also poor by becoming surety for some of his relations he was a bachelor he bore as i have often witnessed his calamities with unfailing resignation i will only add that while working in one of his fields he unearthed a stone of considerable size then another then two more observing that they had been placed in order as if forming the segment of a circle he proceeded carefully to uncover the soil and brought into view a beautiful druids temple of perfect though small dimensions in order to make his farm more compact he exchanged this field for another and i am sorry to add the new proprietor destroyed this interesting relic of remote ages for some vulgar purpose the fact so far as concerns thomas wilkinson is mentioned in the note on a sonnet on long meg and her daughtersi f  one of the poems of sentiment and reflectioned       spade with which wilkinson hath tilled his lands     and shaped these pleasant walks by emonts side     thou art a tool of honour in my hands     i press thee through the yielding soil with pride      rare master has it been thy lot to know                     5     long hast thou served a man to reason true     whose life combines the best of high and low     the labouring1 many and the resting few      health meekness ardour quietness secure2     and industry of body and of mind                           10     and elegant enjoyments that are pure     as nature istoo pure to be refined      here often hast thou heard the poet sing     in concord with his river murmuring by     or in some silent field while timid spring                 15     is yet uncheered by other minstrelsy      who shall inherit thee when death has3 laid     low in the darksome cell thine own dear lord     that man will have a trophy humble spade     a trophy nobler than a conquerors sword4                20      if he be one that feels with skill to part     false praise from true or greater from the less     thee will he welcome to his hand and heart     thou monument of peaceful happiness      he will not dread with thee a toilsome day                25     thee his loved servant his inspiring mate5     and when thou art past service worn away     no dull oblivious nook shall hide thy fate6      his thrift thy uselessness7 will never scorn     an heirloom in his cottage wilt thou be               30     high will he hang thee up well pleased to adorn8     his rustic chimney with the last of thee   thomas wilkinson of yanwath the friend of wordsworth and the subject of these verses deserves more than a passing note                                  he was a man       whom no one could have passed without remark  one of the old race of cumbrian statesmenmen who owned and themselves cultivated small bits of land see wordsworths letter on the brothers and michael vol ii p 234he was wordsworths senior by nineteen years and lived on a patrimonial farm of about forty acres on the banks of the emontthe stream which flowing out of ullswater divides cumberland from westmoreland he was a friend and used to travel great distances to attend religious conferences or engage in philanthropic workon one occasion riding on his pony from yanwath to london to the yearly meeting of the friends and on another walking the 300 miles to town in eight days for the same purpose a simple genuine nature serene refined hospitable naïve and humorous withal a quaint original man with a true eye for nature a keen relish for rural life especially for gardening and a happy knack of characterization whether he undertook descriptions of scenery in the course of his travels or narrated the incidents which befell him on the way this is how he writes of his farm and his work upon itwe have at length some traces of spring 6th april 1784 the primrose under the hedge begins to open her modest flower the buds begin to swell and the birds to build yet we have still a wide horizon the mountain tops resign not their snows the happiest season of the year with me is now commencingi mean that in which i am at the plough my horses pace slowly on before the larks sing above my head and the furrow falls at my side and the face of nature and my own mind seem to wear a sweet and cheerful tranquillity  the following extract shows the interest which he took in the very implements of his industry and may serve as an illustration of wordsworths stanzas on his spade eighth month 16th 1789 yesterday i parted without regret from an old acquaintancei set by my scythe for this year i have often this season seen the dark blue mountains before the sun and his rising embroider them with gold i have had many a good sleep in the shade among fragrant grass and refreshing breezes and though closely engaged in what may be thought heavy work i was sensible of the enjoyments of life with uninterrupted health in the closing years of the last century when the spirit of patriotic ardour was so thoroughly roused in england by the restlessness of france and the ambition of napoleon he lived on at his pastoral farm busy with his husbandry in london he made the acquaintance of edmund burke and thomas clarkson the philanthropistwhose labours for the abolition of the slave trade are matter of historybecame his intimate friend and was a frequent visitor at yanwath clarkson afterwards bought an estate near to wilkinsons home on the shores of ullswater where he built a house and named it eusemere and there the wordsworths were not infrequent guests see the note to the poem beginning i wandered lonely as a cloud vol iii p 5 wordsworth stayed at yanwath for two days in 1806 the tours to the british mountains with the descriptive poems of lowther and emont vale london 1824 have been referred to in the note to the solitary reaper vol ii p 399 one of the poems in the memorials of a tour in scotland 1803 it is an interesting volumethe prose much superior to the verseand might be reprinted with advantage wilkinson was urged repeatedly to publish his tour through the highlands but he always declined and it was printed at last without his knowledge by some one to whom he had lent his ms  wilkinsons relations to wordsworth are alluded to in the note to the solitary reaper he is occasionally referred to in dorothy wordsworths grasmere journal of january and march 1802 egmonday 12th marchthe ground covered with snow walked to t wilkinsons and sent for letters the woman brought me one from wm and mary it was a sharp windy night thomas wilkinson came with me to barton and questioned me like a catechiser all the way every question was like the snapping of a little thread about my heart i was so full of thought of my halfread letter and other things  the following are extracts from letters of wilkinson to miss mary leadbeater of ballintoreyanwath 15 2 1801i had lately a young poet seeing me that sprang originally from the next village he has left the college turned his back on all preferment and settled down contentedly among our lakes with his sister and his muse he  writes in what he conceives to be the language of nature in opposition to the finery of our present poetry he has published two volumes of poems mostly of the same character his name is william wordsworth in a letter dated 29 1 1809 the following occursthou hast wished to have w wordsworths lines on my spade which i shall transcribe thee i had promised lord lonsdale to take him to lowther when he came to see me but when we arrived he was gone to shoot moorgame with judge sutton william and i then returned and wrought together at a walk i was then forming which gave birth to his verses the expression sprang from the next village might not be intended to mean that he was born there or if it did the fact that wordsworths mother was a native of penrith and his own visits to that town might account for the mistake of one who had made no minute enquiry as to the poets birthplace he was born at cockermouth compare an interesting account of thomas wilkinson by mary carr reprinted from the friends quarterly examiner 1882ed   variants  1 1837         toiling

warrior  composed 1806published 1807   the course of the great war with the french naturally fixed ones attention upon the military character and to the honour of our country there were many illustrious instances of the qualities that constitute its highest excellence lord nelson carried most of the virtues that the trials he was exposed to in his department of the service necessarily call forth and sustain if they do not produce the contrary vices but his public life was stained with one great crime so that though many passages of these lines were suggested by what was generally known as excellent in his conduct i have not been able to connect his name with the poem as i could wish or even to think of him with satisfaction in reference to the idea of what a warrior ought to be for the sake of such of my friends as may happen to read this note i will add that many elements of the character here pourtrayed were found in my brother john who perished by shipwreck as mentioned elsewhere his messmates used to call him the philosopher from which it must be inferred that the qualities and dispositions i allude to had not escaped their notice he often expressed his regret after the war had continued some time that he had not chosen the naval instead of the east india companys service to which his family connection had led him he greatly valued moral and religious instruction for youth as tending to make good sailors the best he used to say came from scotland the next to them from the north of england especially from westmoreland and cumberland where

the edition of 1807 the above verses were written soon after tidings had been received of the death of lord nelson which event directed the authors thoughts to the subject his respect for the memory of his great fellowcountryman induces him to mention this though he is well aware that the verses must suffer from any connection in the readers mind with a name so illustrious                                       this note would seem to warrant our removing the date of the composition of the poem from 1806 to 1805 since lord nelson died at the battle of trafalgar on the 21st of october 1805 on the other hand wordsworth himself gave the date 1806 and the soon after of the above note may perhaps be stretched to include two months and a half in writing to sir george beaumont on the 11th of february 1806 and enclosing a copy of these verses he says they were written several weeks ago southey writing to sir walter scott from keswick on the 4th of february 1806 says wordsworth was with me last week he has of late been more employed in correcting his poems than in writing others but one piece he has written upon the ideal character of a soldier than which i have never seen anything more full of meaning and sound thought the subject was suggested by nelsons most glorious death though having no reference to it he had some thoughts of sending it to the courier in which case you will easily recognise his hand the life and correspondence of robert southey vol iii p 19 as it is impossible to decide with accuracy in the absence of more definite data i follow the poets own statement and assign it to the year 1806  wordsworth tells us that features in the character both of lord nelson and of his own brother john are delineated in this poem mr william davies writes to me he might

century by william brother of ranulph de meschines who bestowed on william the whole of the extensive barony of copeland the gateway of the castle is vaulted with semicircular arches and defended by a strong tower westward from the castle area is an ascent to three narrow gates standing in a line and close together these communicated with the outworks each being defended by a portcullis beyond the gates is an artificial mound seventyeight feet above the moat and on this stood an ancient circular tower see a description of the castle in britton and brayleys cumberland the river dacor or dacre

furness was the centre  in the fenwick note prefixed to this sonnet wordsworth refers to his earliest attempt at sonnet writing he says he wrote an irregular one at school and the next were three sonnets written one afternoon in dove cottage in the year 1801 after his sister had read the sonnets of milton this note is not however to be trusted it was not in 1801 but on the 21st of may 1802 that his sister read to him these sonnets of milton and he afterwards wrote not one but two sonnets on buonaparte what the irregular sonnet written at school was it is impossible to say unless he

wordsworth wrotethis is the first of my published poems with the exception of a sonnet written when i was a schoolboy and published in the european magazine in june or july 1786 and signed axiologus even as to this date his memory was at fault it was published in 1787 when he was seventeen years of age its full title may be given although for reasons already stated it would be unjustifiable to republish the sonnet except in an appendix to the poems and mainly for its biographical interest it was entitled sonnet on seeing miss maria williams weep at a tale of distress but fully ten years before the date mentioned by dorothy wordsworth in her grasmere journalas the day on which she read miltons sonnets to her brother and on which he wrote the two on buonapartehe had written others the existence of which he had evidently forgotten on the 6th of may 1792 his sister wrote thus from forncett rectory in norfolk to her friend miss jane pollardi promised to transcribe some of williams compositions as i made the promise i will give you a little sonnet i take the first that offers it is very valuable to me because the cause which gave birth to it was the favourite evening walk of william and me i have not chosen this sonnet from any particular beauty it has it was the first i laid my hands upon from the clause i have italicised it would almost seem that other sonnets belong to that period viz before 1793 when an evening walk appeared she would hardly have spoken of it as she did if this was the only sonnet her brother had then written though very inferior to his later work this sonnet may be preserved as a specimen of wordsworths earlier manner before he had broken away by the force of his own imagination from the trammels of the conventional style which he inherited it

remembrance of me when the greatest part of my patrimony was kept back from us by injustice it may be satisfactory to your wife for me to declare that my friends bequest enabled me to devote myself to literary pursuits independent of any necessity to look at pecuniary emolument so that my talents such as they might be were free to take their natural course your brothers raisley and william were

reestablished he adds reflecting that his return is uncertain your brother requests me to inform you that he has drawn out his will which he means to get executed in london the purport of his will is to leave you all his property real and personal chargeable with a legacy of £600 to me in case that on inquiry into the state of our affairs in london he should think it advisable to do so it is at my request that this information is communicated to you calvert did not live to go south and he changed the sum left to wordsworth from £600 to £900 the relationship of the two men suggests the somewhat

written at grasmere if it was written during a boisterous winter evening in 1806 it could not have been written at grasmere because the wordsworths spent most of that winter at coleorton i am inclined to believe that the date which the poet gave is wrong and that the address really belongs to the year 1805 but as it is just possible thatalthough referring to winterit may have been written at townend in the summer of 1806 it is placed among the poems belonging to the latter year  this address was translated into french by mme amable tastu and published in a popular schoolbook series of extracts but wordsworths name is not given along with the translation  from 1815 to 1843 the authorship was veiled under the title by a female friend of the author in 1845 it was disclosed by my

that rill5 in vision clear6   one of the ms readings of the ninth line of this sonnet gives the date of the incident as now seven years gone but i leave the date of composition undetermined if we could know accurately the date of the first visit to the district with his sister referred to in the fenwick note and if we could implicitly trust this ms reading it might be possible to fix it but we can do neither wordsworth visited the lake district with his sister as early as 1794 and in december 1799 he took up his abode with her at dove cottage i have no doubt that the sonnet belongs to the year 1806 or was composed at an earlier date as to the locality of the rill the late rev r perceval graves of dublin wrote to me    it was in 1843 when quitting the parsonage at bowness i went to   reside at dovenest that calling one day at rydal mount i was   told by both mr and mrs wordsworth as a fact in which i should   take a special interest that the little unpretending rill   associated by the poet with the immortal spirit of one happy   day was the rill which rising near high skelgill at the back of   wansfell descends steeply down the hillside passes behind the   house at dovenest and crossing beneath the road enters the lake   near the gate of the drive which leads up to dovenest    the authority on which i give this information is decisive of the   question i have often traced upwards the course of the rill and   the secluded hollow which by its source is beautified with fresh   herbage and wild straggling bushes was a favourite haunt of   mineed   variants  1 1820

evident that the dates which wordsworth affixed to his poems in the editions of 1815 1820 1836 and 1845and those assigned in the fenwick notescannot be absolutely relied upon than in the case of the poems referring to coleorton trusting to these dates in the absence of contrary evidence one would naturally assign the majority of the coleorton poems to the year 1808 but it is clear that while the sonnet to lady beaumont may have been written in 1806 the inscription for a seat in the groves of coleorton beginning        beneath yon eastern ridge the craggy bound  was written not in 1808 as stated by wordsworth himself but in 1811 and that the other inscription designed for a niche in the wintergarden at coleorton belongs i think to the same year a year in which he also wrote the sonnet on sir george beaumonts picture of bredon hill and cloud hill beginning        praised be the art whose subtle power could stay  when the dates are so difficult to determine there is a natural fitness in bringing all the poems referring to coleorton together so far as this can be done without seriously interfering with chronological order the two inscriptions intended for the coleorton grounds which were written at grasmere in 1811 are therefore printed along with the poems of 1807 the precise date of each being givenso far as it can be ascertainedunderneath its title  several political sonnets and others were written in 1807 also the song at the feast of brougham castle and the first and larger part of the white doe of rylstone with a few minor fragments but for reasons stated in the notes to the white doe of rylstone see p 191 i have assigned that poem to the year 1808 the song at the feast of brougham castle forms as natural a preface to the white doe as the force of prayer a tradition of bolton abbey is its natural appendix the latter was written however before the white doe of rylstone was finished  it would be easier to fix the date of some of the poems written between the years 1806 and 1808 if we knew the exact month in which the two volumes of 1807 were published but this i fear it is impossible to discover now  on november 10th 1806 wordsworth wrote to sir george beaumont from coleorton in a day or two i mean to send a sheet or two of my intended volume to the press evidently referring to the poems of 1807 on the following day11th november 1806dorothy wordsworth wrote to lady beaumont william has written two other poems which you will see when they are printed he composes frequently in the grove we have not yet received a sheet from the

subsequent letter from coleorton undated but bearing the postmark february 18 1807 she is speaking of her brothers poetical labour and says he must go on when he begins and any interruptions such as attending to the progress of the workmen and planning the garden are of the greatest use to him for after a certain time the progress is by no means proportioned to the labour in composition and if he is called from it by other thoughts he returns to it with ten times the pleasure and the work goes on proportionately the more rapidly from this we may infer that the years 18067 were productive ones but it is disappointing that the dates of the composition of the poems are so difficult to determineed     to lady beaumont  composed 1807published 1807   the winter garden of coleorton fashioned out

to the lady beaumont  this winter garden fashioned by the wordsworths out of the old quarry at coleorton during sir george and lady beaumonts absence in 1807 exists very much as it was at the beginning of the century the perennial bowers and murmuring pines may still be seen little altered since 1807 the late sir george beaumont whose grandfather was firstcousin to the artist sir george wordsworths friend with strong reverence for the past and for the traditions of literary men which have made the district famous since the days of his ancestor beaumont the dramatist and especially for the memorials of wordsworths ten months residence at coleortontook a pleasure in preserving these memorials very much as they were when he entered in possession of the estates of his ancestors such a reverence for the past is not only consistent with the improvement of an estate and its belongings it is a part of it wordsworth and his wife and sister were adepts in the laying out of grounds see the reference to the poets joint labour with wilkinson at yanwath p 2 it was the wordsworths also i believe who designed the grounds of fox howdr arnolds residence near ambleside similar memorials

cottage at grasmere being too small for their increasing household it is more likely that wordsworth wrote the poem at coleorton than at grasmere and it looks as if it had been an evening impromptu

coleorton if the locality wasas mrs wordsworth statescoleorton and if the lines were written after hearing the nightingale the year would be 1807 and not 1806 the poets own date the nightingale is a summer visitor in this country and could not have been heard by wordsworth at coleorton in 1806 as he did not go south to leicestershire till november in that year but it is quite possible that it was the stockdoves voice that alone suggested the lines and that they were written either in 1806 or as i think more likely very early in 1807 in the month of january wordsworth was corresponding with

referring to coleorton together so far as possible this and the next sonnet are transferred from their places in the chronological list and placed beside the coleorton inscriptions  i am indebted to mr william kelly of leicester for the following note on the leicestershire superstition of the seven whistlers    there is an old superstition which it is not easy to get to the   bottom of concerning a certain cry or sound heard in the night   supposed to be produced by the seven whistlers what or who those   whistlers are is an unsolved problem in some districts they are   popularly believed to be witches in others ghosts in others   devils while in the midland counties they are supposed to be   birds either plovers or martinssome say swifts in   leicestershire it is deemed a bad omen to hear the seven   whistlers and our old writers supply many passages illustrative   of the popular credulity spenser in his faërie queene book   ii canto xii stanza 36 speaks of        the whistler shrill that whoso hears doth die    sir walter scott in the lady of the lake names the bird with   which his character associated the cry        and in the plovers shrilly strain       the signal whistlers heard again    when the colliers of leicestershire are flush of money we are   told and indulge in a drinking bout they sometimes hear the   warning voice of the seven whistlers get sobered and frightened   and will not descend the pit again till next day wordsworth   speaks of a countryman who                the seven birds hath seen that never part       seen the seven whistlers in their nightly rounds       and counted them    a few years ago during a thunderstorm which passed over   leicestershire and while vivid lightning was darting through the   sky immense flocks of birds were seen flying about uttering   doleful affrighted cries as they passed and keeping up for a   long time a continual whistling like that made by some kinds of   seabirds the number must have been immense for the local   newspapers mentioned the same phenomenon in different parts of the   neighbouring counties of northampton leicester and lincoln a   gentleman conversing with a countryman on the following day   asked him what kind of birds he supposed them to have been the   man answered they are what we call the seven whistlers and   added that whenever they are heard it is considered a sign of   some great calamity and that the last time he had heard them was   on the night before the deplorable explosion of fire damp at the   hartley colliery  in notes and queries there are several allusions to this local superstition in the fifth series vol ii p 264 oct 3 1874 the editor gives a summary of several notes on the subject in vol viii of the fourth series pp 68 134 196 and 268 with additional information he says record was made of their having been heard in leicestershire and that the develin or martin the swift and the plover were probably of the whistling fraternity that frightened men at p 134 it was shown that wordsworth had spoken of one who              the seven birds hath seen that never part       seen the seven whistlers in their nightly rounds       and counted them  on the same page the swift is said to be the true whistler but as noted at page 196 the swifts never make nightly rounds and the superstition is said to be common in our midland counties at page 268 mr pearson put on record that in lancashire the plovers whistling as they fly are accounted heralds of ill though sometimes of trivial accident and that they are there called wandering jews and are said to be or to carry with them the everrestless souls of those jews who assisted at the crucifixion at page 336 the whistlers are chronicled as having been the harbingers of the great hartley colliery explosion a correspondent viator added that on the bosphorus there are flocks of birds the size of a thrush which fly up and down the channel and are never seen to rest on land or water the men who rowed viators caique told him that they were the souls of the damned condemned to perpetual motion the seven whistlers have not furnished chroniclers with later circumstances of their tuneful and awful progresses till a week or two ago the whistlers are also heard and feared in portugal see the new quarterly for july 1874 for a record of some travelling experience in that country  another extract from notes and queries is to the following effect    your excellency laughs at ghosts but there is no lie about the   seven whistlers many a man besides me has heard them    who are the seven whistlers and have you seen them yourself    not seen thank heaven but i have heard them plenty of times   some say they are the ghosts of children unbaptized who are to   know no rest till the judgment day once last winter i was going   with donkeys and a mule to caia just at the moment i stopped by   the river bank to tighten the mules girth i heard the accursed   whistlers coming down the wind along the river i buried my head   under the mule and never moved till the danger was over but they   passed very near for i heard the flap and rustle of their wings    what was the danger    if a man once sees them heaven only knows what will not happen   to himdeath and damnation at the very least    i have seen them many times i shot or tried to shoot them    holy mother

wordsworth wrote i like your ancestors verses the more the more i see of them they are manly dignified and extremely harmonious i do not remember in any author of that age such a series of welltuned couplets  in another letter written from grasmere probably in 1811 to sir george he says in reference to his own poems these inscriptions have all one fault they are too long but i was unable to do justice to the thoughts in less room the second has brought sir john beaumont and his brother francis so livelily to my mind that i recur to the plan of republishing the formers poems perhaps in connection with those of francis  on november 16 1811 he wrote to him again i am glad that the inscriptions please you it did always appear to me that inscriptions particularly those in verse or in a dead language were never supposed necessarily to be the composition of those in whose name they appeared if a more striking or more dramatic effect could be produced i have always thought that in an epitaph or memorial of any kind a father or husband etc might be introduced speaking without any absolute deception being intended that is the reader is understood to be at liberty to say to himselfthese verses or this latin may be the composition of some unknown person and not that of the father widow or friend from whose hand or voice they profess to proceed i have altered the verses and i have only to regret that the alteration is not more happily done but i never found anything more difficult i wished to preserve the expression patrimonial groundsa but i found this impossible on account of the awkwardness of the pronouns he and his as applied to reynolds and to yourself this even when it does not produce confusion is always inelegant i was therefore obliged to drop it so that we must be content i fear with the inscription as it stands below i hope it will do i tried a hundred different ways but cannot hit upon anything bettered   variants  1 1815        shall

yewtrees over and around it has darkened the seat and constant damp has decayed the soft stone the niche having been scooped out by mrs wordsworth and dorothy as well as by wordsworth suggests the cutting of the inscriptions on the rock of names in 1800 in which they all took part see vol iii pp 61 62 on his return to grasmere from coleorton wordsworth wrote thus to sir george beaumont in an

is hollowed out of the sandstone in the wintergarden i am told that this is in the present form of the niche impossible but i shall be most ready when i come to coleorton to scoop out a place for it

laid in earth     the good lord clifford was the name he bore   the original text of this song was altered but little in succeeding editions and was not changed at all till 1836 and 1845 the following is wordsworths explanatory note appended to the poem in all the editions    henry lord clifford etc etc who is the subject of this poem   was the son of john lord clifford who was slain at towton   fieldh which john lord clifford as is known to the reader of   english history was the person who after the battle of wakefield   slew in the pursuit the young earl of rutland son of the duke   of york who had fallen in the battle in part of revenge say   the authors of the history of cumberland and westmoreland for   the earls father had slain his a deed which worthily blemished   the author saith speed but who as he adds dare promise any   thing temperate of himself in the heat of martial fury chiefly   when it was resolved not to leave any branch of the york line   standing for so one maketh this lord to speak this no doubt i   would observe by the bye was an action sufficiently in the   vindictive spirit of the times and yet not altogether so bad as   represented for the earl was no child as some writers would   have him but able to bear arms being sixteen or seventeen years   of age as is evident from this say the memoirs of the countess   of pembroke who was laudably anxious to wipe away as far as   could be this stigma from the illustrious name to which she was   born that he was the next child to king edward the fourth which   his mother had by richard duke of york and that king was then   eighteen years of age and for the small distance betwixt her   children see austin vincent in his book of nobility page 622   where he writes of them all it may further be observed that lord   clifford who was then himself only twentyfive years of age had   been a leading man and commander two or three years together in   the army of lancaster before this time and therefore would be   less likely to think that the earl of rutland might be entitled to   mercy from his youthbut independent of this act at best a   cruel and savage one the family of clifford had done enough to   draw upon them the vehement hatred of the house of york so that   after the battle of towton there was no hope for them but in   flight and concealment henry the subject of the poem was   deprived of his estate and honours during the space of twentyfour   years all which time he lived as a shepherd in yorkshire or in   cumberland where the estate of his fatherinlaw sir lancelot   threlkeld lay he was restored to his estate and honours in the   first year of henry the seventh it is recorded that when called   to parliament he behaved nobly and wisely but otherwise came   seldom to london or the court and rather delighted to live in the   country where he repaired several of his castles which had gone   to decay during the late troubles thus far is chiefly collected   from nicholson and burn and i can add from my own knowledge   that there is a tradition current in the village of threlkeld and   its neighbourhood his principal retreat that in the course of   his shepherd life he had acquired great astronomical knowledge i   cannot conclude this note without adding a word upon the subject   of those numerous and noble feudal edifices spoken of in the   poem the ruins of some of which are at this day so great an   ornament to that interesting country the cliffords had always   been distinguished for an honourable pride in these castles and   we have seen that after the wars of york and lancaster they were   rebuilt in the civil wars of charles the first they were again   laid waste and again restored almost to their former magnificence   by the celebrated lady anne clifford countess of pembroke etc   etc not more than twentyfive years after this was done when the   estates of clifford had passed into the family of tufton three of   these castles namely brough brougham and pendragon were   demolished and the timber and other materials sold by thomas earl   of thanet we will hope that when this order was issued the earl   had not consulted the text of isaiah 58th chap 12th verse to   which the inscription placed over the gate of pendragon castle by   the countess of pembroke i believe his grandmother at the time   she repaired that structure refers the reader and they that   shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt   raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be   called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell   in the earl of thanet the present possessor of the estates   with a due respect for the memory of his ancestors and a proper   sense of the value and beauty of these remains of antiquity has   i am told given orders that they shall be preserved from all   depredations  compare the reference to the shepherdlord in the first canto of the white doe of rylstone p 116 and the topographical allusions there with this song compare also the life of anne clifford in hartley coleridges lives of distinguished northerners        high in the breathless hall the minstrel sate       and emonts murmur mingled with the song  brougham castle past which the river emont flows is about two miles out of penrith on the appleby road it is now a ruin but was once a place of importance the larger part of it was built by roger lord clifford son of isabella de veteripont who placed over the inner door the inscription this made roger his grandson added the eastern part the castle was frequently laid waste by the scottish bands and during the wars of the roses the earl of cumberland entertained james i within it in 1617 on the occasion of the kings last return from scotland but it seems to have layen ruinous from that date and to have suffered much during the civil wars in the reign of charles i in 165152 it was repaired by lady anne clifford countess dowager of pembroke who wrote thusafter i had been there myself to direct the building of it did i cause my old decayed castle of brougham to be repaired and also the tower called the roman tower in the same old castle and the courthouse for keeping my courts in with some dozen or fourteen rooms to be built in it upon the old foundation pembroke memoirs i p 216 after the time of the countess anne the castle was neglected and much of the stone timber and lead disposed of at public sales the wainscotting being purchased by the neighbouring villagers        her thirty years of winter past       the red rose is revived at last  this refers to the thirty years interval between 1455 the first battle of st albans in the wars of the roses and 1485 the battle of bosworth and the accession of henry vii        both roses flourish red and white  alluding to the marriage of henry vii with elizabeth which united the two warring lines of york and lancaster        and it was proved in bosworthfield  the battle of bosworth field in leicestershire was fought in 1485        not long the avenger was withstood       earth helped him with the cry of blood  henry viiwho as henry earl of richmond last scion of the line of lancaster had fled to brittanyreturned with morton the exiled bishop of ely landed at milford advanced through wales and met the royal army at bosworth where richard was slain and henry crowned king on the battlefield the cry of blood refers doubtless to the murder of the young princes in the tower        how glad is skipton at this hour       though lonely a deserted tower  skipton is the capital of the craven district of yorkshire as barrow is the capital of the furness district of lancashire and westmoreland the castle of skipton was the chief residence of the cliffords architecturally it is of two periods the round tower dating from the reign of edward ii and the rest from that of henry viii from the time of robert de clifford who fell at bannockburn 1314 until the seventeenth century the estates of the cliffords extended from skipton to brougham castleseventy mileswith only a short interruption of ten miles the shepherdlord clifford of this poem was attaintedas explained in wordsworths noteby the triumphant house of york he was committed by his mother to the care of certain shepherds whose wives had served her and who kept him concealed both in cumberland and at londesborough in yorkshire where his mothers lady margaret vesci own estates lay the old tower of skipton castle was deserted during these years when the shepherdlord was concealed in cumberland        how glad pendragonthough the sleep       of years be on her  pendragon castle in a narrow dell in the forest of mallerstang near the source of the eden south of kirkbystephen was another of the castles of the cliffords its building was traditionally ascribed to uter pendragon of stonehenge celebrity who was fabled to have tried to make the eden flow round the castle of pendragon hence the distich        let uter pendragon do what he can       eden will run where eden ran  in the countess of pembrokes memoirs vol i pp 22 228 we are told that idonea de veteripont made a great part of her residence in westmoreland at brough castle near stanemore and at pendragon castle in mallerstang the castle was burned and destroyed by scottish raiders in 1341 and for 140 years it was in a ruinous state it is probably to this that reference is made in the phrase though the sleep of years be on her during the attainder of henry lord clifford in the reign of edward iv part of this estate of mallerstang was granted to sir william parr of kendal castle it was again destroyed during the civil wars of the stuarts and was restored along with skipton and brougham by lady anne clifford in 1660 who put up an inscription  repaired in 1660 so as she came to lye in it herself for a little while in october 1661 after it had lain ruinous without timber or any other covering since

descends from warcop fell runs through market brough and joins the eden below it the date of the building of the castle of brough is uncertain but it is probably older than the conquest it was sacked by the scottish king william in 1174 it was one of the chief residences of idonea de veteripont above referred to for then it was in its prime pemb mem vol i p 22 probably she rebuilt it and changed it from a towerlike pendragoninto a castle in the pembroke memoirs i p 108 we read of its subsequent destruction by fire a great misfortune befell henry lord clifford some two years before his death which happened in 1521 his ancient and great castle of broughunderstanemore was set on fire by a casual mischance a little after he had kept a great christmas there so as all the timber and lead were utterly consumed and nothing left but the bare walls which since are more and more consumed and quite ruinated this same countess anne pembroke began to repair it in april 1660 at her exceeding great charge and cost she put up an inscription over the gate similar to the one which she inscribed at pendragon        and she that keepeth watch and ward       her statelier edens course to guard

veteriponts cliffords and percys which with several parts of the castle walls was defaced and broken down in the civil war of 1648 his successor thomas lord clifford built the chiefest part of the castle towards the east as the hall the chapel and the great chamber this was in 1454 the countess anne pembroke wrote of appleby castle thus pemb mem vol i p 187 in 1651 i continued to live in appleby castle a whole year and spent much time in repairing it and brougham castle to make them as habitable as i could though brougham was very ruinous and much out of repair and in this year the

criticism of the song at the feast of brougham castle in the editorial note to her fathers biographia literaria vol ii ch ix p 152 ed 1847    the transitions and vicissitudes in this noble lyric i have   always thought rendered it one of the finest specimens of modern   subjective poetry which our age has seen the ode commences in a   tone of high gratulation and festivitya tone not only glad but   comparatively even jocund and lighthearted the clifford is   restored to the home the honours and estates of his ancestors   then it sinks and falls away to the remembrance of   tribulationtimes of war and bloodshed flight and terror and   hiding away from the enemytimes of poverty and distress when   the clifford was brought a little child to the shelter of a   northern valley after a while it emerges from those depths of   sorrowgradually rises into a strain of elevated tranquillity and   contemplative rapture through the power of imagination the   beautiful and impressive aspects of nature are brought into   relationship with the spirit of him whose fortunes and character   form the subject of the piece and are represented as gladdening   and exalting it whilst they keep it pure and unspotted from the   world suddenly the poet is carried on with greater animation and   passion he has returned to the point whence he startedflung   himself back into the tide of stirring life and moving events   all is to come over again struggle and conflict chances and   changes of war victory and triumph overthrow and desolation i   know nothing in lyric poetry more beautiful or affecting than   the final transition from this part of the ode with its rapid   metre to the slow elegiac stanzas at the end when from the   warlike fervour and eagerness the jubilant strain which has just   been described the poet passes back into the sublime silence of   nature gathering amid her deep and quiet bosom a more subdued and   solemn tenderness than he had manifested before it is as if from   the heights of the imaginative intellect his spirit had retreated   into the recesses of a profoundly thoughtful christian heart  professor henry reed said of this poemhad he never written another ode this alone would set him at the head of the lyric poets of englanded   variants  1 1815         sorrows                                     1807  2 1827         hath

number with the exception of the white doe of rylstoneto which additions were made in that yearthey include only the two sonnets composed while the author was engaged in writing a tract occasioned by the convention of cintra and the fragment on george and sarah green the latter poem wordsworth gave to de quincey who published it in his recollections of grasmere which appeared in taits edinburgh magazine in september 1839 but it never found a place in any edition of wordsworths own poems in this edition it is printed in the appendix to volume viii  the reasons which have led me to assign the white doe of rylstone to the year 1808 are stated in a note to the poem see p 191 i infer that it was practically finished in april 1808 because dorothy wordsworth in a letter to lady beaumont dated april 20 1808 says the poem is to be published longman has consentedin spite of the odium under which my brother labours as a poetto give him 100 guineas for 1000 copies according to his demand she gives no indication of the name of the poem referred to as it must however have been one which was to be published separately she can only refer to the white doe or to the excursion but the latter poem was not finished in 1808  it is probable from the remark made in a subsequent letter to lady beaumont february 1810 that wordsworth intended either to add to what he had written in 1808 or to alter some passages before publication or by completing the poem he may have meant simply adding the dedication which was not written till 1815  all things considered it seems the best arrangement that the poems of 1808 should begin with the white doe of rylstone in the year 1891 i edited this poem for the clarendon press a few additional details have come to light since then and are introduced into the notes s t coleridges criticism of the poem in biographia literaria vol ii chap xxii p 176 edition 1817 should be consulteded     the white doe of rylstone  or the fate of the nortons  composed 180710published 1815   advertisement  during the summer of 1807 i visited for the first time the beautiful country that surrounds bolton priory in yorkshire and the poem of the white doe founded upon a tradition connected with that place was composed at the close of the same yearw wa   the earlier half of this poem was composed at stocktonupontees when mrs wordsworth and i were on a visit to her eldest brother mr hutchinson at the close of the year 1807 the country is flat and the weather was rough i was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row of stacks in a field at a small distance from the town and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would come mrs wordsworth reminds me that her brother stood upon the punctilio of not sitting down to dinner till i joined the party and it frequently happened that i did not make my appearance till too late so that she was made uncomfortable i here beg her pardon for this and similar transgressions during the whole course of our wedded life to my beloved sister the same apology is due  when from the visit just mentioned we returned to townend grasmere i proceeded with the poem and it may be worth while to note as a caution to others who may cast their eye on these memoranda that the skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe though i desisted from walking i found that the irritation of the wounded part was kept up by the act of composition to a degree that made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday a rapid cure was the consequence poetic excitement when accompanied by protracted labour in composition has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement nevertheless i am at the close of my seventythird year in what may be called excellent health so that intellectual labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity but perhaps i ought here to add that mine has been generally carried on out of doors  let me here say a few words of this poem in the way of criticism the subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to some of walter scotts poems that belong to the same age and state of society the comparison is inconsiderate sir walter pursued the customary and very natural course of conducting an action presenting various turns of fortune to some outstanding point on which the mind might rest as a termination or catastrophe the course i have attempted to pursue is entirely different everything that is attempted by the principal personages in the white doe fails so far as its object is external and substantial so far as it is moral and spiritual it succeeds the heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events either to forward or delay them but                            to abide       the shock and finally secure       oer pain and grief a triumph pure  this she does in obedience to her brothers injunction as most suitable to a mind and character that under previous trials has been proved to accord with his she achieves this not without aid from the communication with the inferior creature which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses her the anticipated beatification if i may so say of her mind and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude are the points at which the poem aims and constitute its legitimate catastrophe far too spiritual a one for instant or widelyspread sympathy but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things and interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit how insignificant a thing for example does personal prowess appear compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom in other words with struggles for the sake of principle in preference to victory gloried in for its own sakei f                      dedication                         i      in trellised shed with clustering roses gayb

noises filled the hall38     and scarcely could the father hear     that namepronounced with a dying fall39x     the name of his only daughter dear                         65     as on40 the banner

and desolate     he found his way to a posterngate                         90     and when he waked his languid eye45     was on the calm and silent sky     with air about him breathing sweet     and earths green grass beneath his feet     nor did he fail ere long to hear                            95     a sound of military cheer     faintbut it reached that sheltered spot     he heard and it disturbed him not        there stood he leaning on a lance     which he had grasped unknowingly                          100     had blindly grasped in that strong trance     that dimness of

of this brave man when he shall see     that form beneath the spreading tree     and know that it is emily46        he saw her where in open view                            110     she sate beneath

  lo francis comes there were who cried137     a prisoner once but now set free     tis well for he the worst defied     through force of138 natural piety                        70     he rose not in this quarrel he     for concords sake and englands good     suit to his brothers often made     with tears and of his father prayed     and when he had in vain withstood                           75     their purposethen did he divide139     he parted from them but at their side     now walks in unanimity     then peace to cruelty and scorn     while to the prison they are borne                         80     peace peace to all indignity        and so in prison were they laid     oh hear me hear me gentle maid     for i am come with power to bless     by scattering gleams140 through your

son                        95     thoughts press and time is hurrying on142     and so to francis he renewed     his words more calmly thus pursued        might this our enterprise have sped

banner francis saw     and with a look of calm command     inspiring universal awe                                   170     he took it from the soldiers hand     and all the people that stood

punishment without remorse     he marked not heard not as he fled     all but the suffering heart was dead     for him abandoned to blank awe     to vacancy and horror strong159                         25     and the first object which he saw     with conscious sight as he swept along     it was the banner in his hand     he feltand made a sudden stand        he looked about like one betrayed                        30     what hath he done what promise made     oh weak weak moment to what end     can such a vain oblation tend     and he the bearercan he go     carrying this instrument of woe

own life into danger brought                            45     by this sad burdeneven that thought     exciting selfsuspicion strong     swayed the brave man to his wrong161     and howunless it were the sense     of alldisposing providence                                50     its will unquestionably shown     how has the banner clung so fast     to a palsied and unconscious hand     clung to the hand to which it passed     without impediment and why                                 55     but that heavens purpose might be known     doth now no hindrance meet his eye     no intervention to withstand     fulfilment of a fathers prayer     breathed to a son forgiven and blest                       60     when all resentments were at rest     and life in death laid the heart bare     then like a spectre sweeping by     rushed through his mind the prophecy     of utter desolation made                                    65     to emily in the yewtree shade     he sighed submitting will

at the dawn of day     attained a summit whence his eyes163     could see the tower of bolton rise     there francis for a moments space     made haltbut hark a noise behind                         80

unhappy freight i bear     and must not part with but beware     err not by hasty zeal misled166                        110     nor do a suffering spirit wrong     whose selfreproaches are too strong     at this he from the beaten road     retreated towards a brake of thorn     that167 like a place of vantage showed                  115     and there stood bravely though forlorn     in selfdefence with warlike brow168     he stoodnor weaponless was now     he from a soldiers hand had snatched     a spearand so protected watched                       120     the assailants turning round and round     but from behind with treacherous wound     a spearman brought him to the ground     the guardian lance as francis fell     dropped from him but his other hand                       125     the banner clenched till from out the band     one the most eager for the prize     rushed in andwhile o grief to tell     a glimmering sense still left with eyes     unclosed the noble francis lay                           130     seized it as hunters seize their prey     but not before the warm lifeblood     had tinged more deeply as it flowed     the wounds the broidered banner showed     thy fatal work o maiden innocent as good169           135        proudly the horsemen bore away     the standard and where francis lay170     there was he left alone unwept     and for two days unnoticed slept     for at that time bewildering fear                          140     possessed the country far and near     but on the third day passing by     one of the norton tenantry     espied the uncovered corse the man     shrunk as he recognised the face                          145     and to the nearest homesteads ran     and called the people to the place     how desolate is rylstonehall     this was the instant thought of all     and if the lonely lady there                               150     should be to her they cannot bear     this weight of anguish and despair     so when upon sad thoughts had prest     thoughts sadder still they deemed it best     that if the priest should yield assent                    155     and no one hinder their intent171     then they for christian pitys sake     in holy ground a grave would make     and straightway172 buried he should be     in the churchyard of the priory                          160        apart some little space was made

father for his lord     a hut by tufted trees defended     where rylstone brook with wharf is blendedqq        when emily by morning light     went forth the doe stood there189 in sight             145     she shrunkwith one frail shock of pain     received and followed by a prayer     she saw the creature once again190     shun will she not she feels will bear     but wheresoever she looked

the white doe followed up the vale                        155     up to another cottage hidden     in the deep fork of amerdalerr     and there may emily restore     herself in spots unseen before

 or in the meadow wandered wide     how pleased when down the straggler sank     beside her on some sunny bank                            185     how soothed when in thick bower enclosed     they like a nested pair reposed     fair vision when it crossed the maid     within some rocky cavern laid     the dark caves portal gliding by                         190     white as whitest194 cloud on high

her companion in such frame     of mind to rylstone back she came     and ranging197 through the wasted groves     received the memory of old loves     undisturbed and undistrest                                205     into a soul which now was blest     with a soft springday of holy     mild and grateful melancholy198     not sunless gloom or unenlightened     but by tender fancies brightened

day     but now when such sad change was wrought                 220     and of that lonely name she thought     the bells of rylstone seemed to say     while she sate listening in the shade     with

eternal prime                        360   the following is the full text of the first note to the white doe of rylstone published in the quarto edition of 1815 the other notes to that edition are printed in this at the foot of the pages where they occur    the poem of the white doe of rylstone is founded on a local   tradition and on the ballad in percys collection entitled the   rising of the north the tradition is as follows about this   time not long after the dissolution a white doe say the aged   people of the neighbourhood long continued to make a weekly   pilgrimage from rylstone over the fells of bolton and was   constantly found in the abbey churchyard during divine service   after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the   rest of the congregationdr whitakers history of the deanery   of cravenrylstone was the property and residence of the   nortons distinguished in that illadvised and unfortunate   insurrection which led me to connect with this tradition the   principal circumstances of their fate as recorded in the ballad   which i have thought it proper to annex        the rising in the north    the subject of this ballad is the great northern insurrection in   the 12th year of elizabeth 1569 which proved so fatal to thomas   percy the seventh earl of northumberland    there had not long before been a secret negociation entered into   between some of the scottish and english nobility to bring about   a marriage between mary q of scots at that time a prisoner in   england and the duke of norfolk a nobleman of excellent   character this match was proposed to all the most considerable of   the english nobility and among the rest to the earls of   northumberland and westmoreland two noblemen very powerful in the   north as it seemed to promise a speedy and safe conclusion of the   troubles in scotland with many advantages to the crown of   england they all consented to it provided it should prove   agreeable to queen elizabeth the earl of leicester elizabeths   favourite undertook to break the matter to her but before he   could find an opportunity the affair had come to her ears by   other hands and she was thrown into a violent flame the duke of   norfolk with several of his friends was committed to the tower   and summons were sent to the northern earls instantly to make   their appearance at court it is said that the earl of   northumberland who was a man of a mild and gentle naturexx was   deliberating with himself whether he should not obey the message   and rely upon the queens candour and clemency when he was forced   into desperate measures by a sudden report at midnight nov 14   that a party of his enemies were come to seize his person the   earl was then at his house at topcliffe in yorkshire when rising   hastily out of bed he withdrew to the earl of westmoreland at   brancepeth where the country came in to them and pressed them to   take up arms in their own defence they accordingly set up their   standards declaring their intent was to restore the ancient   religion to get the succession of the crown firmly settled and   to prevent the destruction of the ancient nobility etc their   common banner on which was displayed the cross together with the   five wounds of christ was borne by an ancient gentleman richard   norton esquire who with his sons among whom christopher   marmaduke and thomas are expressly named by camden   distinguished himself on this occasion having entered durham   they tore the bible etc and caused mass to be said there they   then marched on to cliffordmoor near wetherby where they   mustered their men the two earls who spent their large   estates in hospitality and were extremely beloved on that   account were masters of little ready money the e of   northumberland bringing with him only 8000 crowns and the e of   westmoreland nothing at all for the subsistence of their forces   they were not able to march to london as they had at first   intended in these circumstances westmoreland began so visibly to   despond that many of his men slunk away though northumberland   still kept up his resolution and was master of the field till   december 13 when the earl of sussex accompanied with lord   hunsden and others having marched out of york at the head of a   large body of forces and being followed by a still larger army   under the command of ambrose dudley earl of warwick the   insurgents retreated northward towards the borders and there   dismissing their followers made their escape into scotland   though this insurrection had been suppressed with so little   bloodshed the earl of sussex and sir george bowes marshal of the   army put vast numbers to death by martial law without any   regular trial the former of these caused at durham sixtythree   constables to be hanged at once and the latter made his boast   that for sixty miles in length and forty in breadth betwixt   newcastle and wetherby there was hardly a town or village wherein   he had not executed some of the inhabitants this exceeds the   cruelties practised in the west after monmouths rebellion    such is the account collected from stow speed camden guthrie   carte and rapin it agrees in most particulars with the   following ballad apparently the production of some northern   minstrel         listen lively lordings all         lithe and listen unto mee       and i will sing of a noble earle         the noblest earle in the north countrie        earle percy is into his garden gone         and after him walks his fair leddie

fatherlesse         and widowed many a tender wife     bolton priory says dr whitaker in his excellent bookthe   history and antiquities of the deanery of cravenstands upon a   beautiful curvature of the wharf on a level sufficiently elevated   to protect it from inundations and low enough for every purpose   of picturesque effect    opposite to the east window of the priory church the river   washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular and of the richest   purple where several of the mineral beds which break out   instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon are   twisted by some inconceivable process into undulating and spiral   lines to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes   upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river   sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the   bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude   even in winter any portion of his rays    but after all the glories of bolton are on the north whatever   the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect   landscape is not only found here but in its proper place in   front and immediately under the eye is a smooth expanse of   parklike enclosure spotted with native elm ash etc of the   finest growth on the right a skirting oak wood with jutting   points of grey rock on the left a rising copse still forward are   seen the aged groves of bolton park the growth of centuries and   farther yet the barren and rocky distances of simonseat and   barden fell contrasted with the warmth fertility and luxuriant   foliage of the valley below    about half a mile above bolton the valley closes and either   side of the wharf is overhung by solemn woods from which huge   perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at intervals    this sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late   that ridings have been cut on both sides of the river and the   most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the   woods here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall and bursts   through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the wharf there   the wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock and   next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody islandsometimes it   reposes for a moment and then resumes its native character   lively irregular and impetuous    the cleft mentioned above is the tremendous strid this chasm   being incapable of receiving the winter floods has formed on   either side a broad strand of naked gritstone full of   rockbasons or pots of the linn which bear witness to the   restless impetuosity of so many northern torrents but if here   wharf is lost to the eye it amply repays another sense by its   deep and solemn roar like the voice of the angry spirit of the   waters heard far above and beneath amidst the silence of the   surrounding woods    the terminating object of the landscape is the remains of barden   tower interesting from their form and situation and still more   so from the recollections which they excite                                       the white doe of rylstone has been assigned chronologically to the year 1808 although part of itprobably the larger halfwas written during the autumn of the previous year and it remained unfinished in 1810 while the dedication was not written till 1815 in the fenwick note wordsworth tells us that the earlier half was written at stocktonontees at the close of 1807 and proceeded with at dove cottage after his return to grasmere which was in april 1808 but on the 28th february 1810 dorothy wordsworth writing from allan bank to lady beaumont says before my brother turns to any other labour i hope he will have finished three books of the recluse he seldom writes less than 50 lines every day after this task is finished he hopes to complete the white doe and proud should we all be if it should be honoured by a frontispiece from the pencil of sir george beaumont perhaps this is not impossible if you come into the north next summer  a frontispiece was drawn by sir george beaumont for the quarto edition of 1815  when part of the poem was finished wordsworth showed it to southey and southey writing to walter scott in february 1808 said    wordsworth has just completed a most masterly poem upon the fate   of the nortons two or three lines in the old ballad of the   rising of the north gave him the hint the story affected me more   deeply than i wish to be affected younger readers however will   not object to the depth of the distress and nothing was ever more   ably treated he is looking too for a narrative subject pitched   in a lower key  one of the most interesting letters of s t coleridge to wordsworth is an undated one sent from london in the spring of 1808 containing a characteristic criticism of the white doe the wordsworth family had asked coleridge to discuss the subject of the publication of the poem with the longmans firm it is more than probable that it was coleridges criticism of the structural defects in the poem that led wordsworth to postpone its publication the following is part of the letter     in my reperusals of the poem it seemed always to strike on   my feeling as well as judgment that if there were any serious   defect it consisted in a disproportion of the accidents to the   spiritual incidents and closely connected with thisif it be   not indeed the samethat emily is indeed talked of and once   appears but neither speaks nor acts in all the first   threefourths of the poem then as the outward interest of the   poem is in favour of the old mans religious feelings and the   filial heroism of his band of sons it seemed to require something   in order to place the two protestant malcontents of the family in   a light that made them beautiful as well as virtuous in short to   express it far more strongly than i mean or think in order in   the present anguish of my spirits to be able to express it at   all that threefourths of the work is everything rather than   emily and then the lastalmost a separate and doubtless an   exquisite poemwholly of emily the whole of the rest and the   delivering up of the family by francis i never ceased to find   not only comparatively heavy but to me quite obscure as to   franciss motives on the few to whom within my acquaintance   the poem has been read either by yourself or me i have i   believe read it only at the beaumonts it produced the same   effect    now i have conceived two little incidents the introduction of   which joined to a little abridgment and lyrical precipitation of   the last half of the third i had thought would have removed this   defect so seeming to me and bring to a finer balance the   business with the action of the tale but after my receipt of   your letter concerning lambs censures i felt my courage fail   and that what i deemed a harmonizing would disgust you as a   materialization of the plan and appear to you like   insensibility to the power of the history in the mind not that i   should have shrunk back from the mere fear of giving transient   pain and a temporary offence from the want of sympathy of   feeling and coincidence of opinions i rather envy than blame that   deep interest in a production which is inevitable perhaps and   certainly not dishonourable to such as feel poetry their calling   and their duty and which no man would find much fault with if the   object instead of a poem were a large estate or a title it   appears to me to become a foible only when the poet denies or is   unconscious of its existence but i did not deem myself in such a   state of mind as to entitle me to rely on my own opinion when   opposed to yours from the heat and bustle of these disgusting   lectures                                         from most of these causes i was suffering so as not to allow me   any rational confidence in my opinions when contrary to yours   which had been formed in calmness and on long reflection then i   received your sisters letter stating the wish that i would give   up the thought of proposing the means of correction and merely   point out the things to be corrected whichas they could be of   no great consequenceyou might do in a day or two and the   publication of the poemfor the immediacy of which she expressed   great anxietybe no longer retarded the merely verbal   alteranda did appear to me very few and trifling from your   letter on l i concluded that you would not have the incidents   and action interfered with and therefore i sent it off but soon   retracted it in order to note down the single words and phrases   that i disliked in the books after the two first as there would   be time to receive your opinion of them during the printing of the   two first in which i saw nothing amiss except the one passage we   altered together and the two lines which i scratched out because   you yourself were doubtful mrs shepherd told me that she had   felt them exactly as i didnamely as interrupting the spirit of   the continuous tranquil motion of the white doe  it will be seen from this letter that wordsworth had gone over the poem with coleridge and that they had altered some passages together that coleridge had read a copy of it sent to the beaumonts doubtless at dunmow in essex that he had thought of a plan by which the poem could be immensely improved both by addition and subtraction but that hearing from wordsworth or more probably from his sister dorothy that charles lamb had also criticised its structure he gave up his intention of sending to his friend suggestions which evidently implied a radical alteration of the incidents and action of the tale it would have been extremely interesting to know how the author of christabel and the ancient mariner proposed to recast the white doe of rylstone it is alas impossible for posterity to know this although it is not difficult to conjecture the line which the alterations would take wordsworths genius was not great in construction as in imagination and he valued a story only as giving him a point of departure for a flight of fancy or of idealization early in 1808 he wrote to walter scott asking him for facts about the norton family scott supplied him with them and the following was wordsworths reply                                          grasmere may 14 1808    my dear scottthank you for the interesting particulars about   the nortons i like them much for their own sakes but so far from   being serviceable to my poem they would stand in the way of it   as i have followed as i was in duty bound to do the traditionary   and common historic account therefore i shall say in this case   a plague upon your industrious antiquarians that have put my fine   story to confusion  from the advertisement which wordsworth prefixed to his edition of 1815 i infer that the larger part of the poem was written at stockton in it he says that the poem of the white doe was composed at the close of the year 1807 this is an illustration of the vague manner in which he was in the habit of assigning dates the fenwick note and the evidence of his sisters letter is conclusive although the fact that the force of prayerwritten in 1807is called in the fenwick note an appendage to the white doe is further confirmation of the belief that the principal part of the latter poem was finished in 1807 all things considered the white doe of rylstone may be most conveniently placed after the poems belonging to the year 1807 and before those known to have been written in 1808 while the force of prayer naturally follows it  the poemfirst published in quarto in 1815was scarcely altered in the editions of 1820 1827 and 1832 in 1837 however it was revised throughout and in that year the text was virtually settled the subsequent changes being few and insignificant while those introduced in 1837 were numerous and important a glance at the footnotes will show that many passages were entirely rewritten in that year and that a good many lines of the earlier text were altogether omitted all the poems were subjected to minute revision in 183637 but few if any were more thoroughly recast and improved in that year than the white doe of rylstone as a sample of the best kind of changeswhere a new thought was added to the earlier text with admirable felicitycompare the lines in canto vii as it stood in 1815 when the lady emily first saw the white doe at the old hall of rylstone after her terrible losses and desolation        lone sufferer will not she believe       the promise in that speaking face       and take this gift of heaven with grace  with the additional thought conveyed in the version of 1837        lone sufferer will not she believe       the promise in that speaking face       and welcome as a gift of grace       the saddest thought the creature brings  in the reminiscences of wordsworthwritten by the hon mr justice coleridge for the late bishop of lincolns memoirs of his unclethe following occurs see vol ii p 311 his conversation was on critical subjects arising out of his attempts to alter his poems he said he considered the white doe as in conception the highest work he had ever produced the mere physical action was all unsuccessful but the true action of the poem was spiritualthe subduing of the will and all inferior fancies to the perfect purifying and spiritualizing of the intellectual nature while the doe by connection with emily is raised as it were from its mere animal nature into something mysterious and saintlike he said he should devote much labour to perfecting the execution of it in the mere business parts in which from anxiety to get on with the more important parts he was sensible that imperfections had crept in which gave the style a feebleness of character  from this conversationwhich took place in 1836it will be seen that wordsworth knew very well that there were feeble passages in the earlier editions and that in the thorough revision which he gave to all his poems in 183637 this one was specially singled out for much labour the result is seen by a glance at the changes of the text  the notes appended by wordsworth to the edition of 1815 explain some of the historical and topographical allusions in the poem to these the following editorial notes may be added         i see pp 106 107         boltons mouldering priory                                             the tower       is standing with a voice of power                            and in the shattered fabrics heart       remaineth one protected part       a chapel like a wildbirds nest       closely embowered and trimly drest  in 1153 the canons of the augustinian priory at embsay near skipton were removed to bolton by william fitz duncan and his wife cecilia de romillé who granted it by charter in exchange for the manors of skibdem and stretton the establishment at bolton consisted of a prior and about 15 canons over 200 persons including servants and lay brethren being supported at bolton during the scottish raids of the fourteenth century the prior and canons had frequently to retreat to skipton for safety in 1542 the site of the priory and demesnes were sold to harry clifford first earl of cumberland from the last earl of cumberland it passed to the second earl of cork and then to the devonshire family to which it still belongs the following is part of the excellent account of the priory given in murrays yorkshire    the chief relic of the priory is the church the nave of which   after the dissolution was retained as the chapel of this socalled   saxoncure this nave remains perfect but the rest of the   church is in complete ruin the lower walls of the choir are   transnorman and must have been built immediately after if not   before the removal from embsay the upper walls and windows the   tracery of which is destroyed are decorated the nave is early   english and decorated and the original west front remains with   an elaborate perpendicular front of excellent design intended as   the base of a western tower which was never finished the nave   which has been restored under the direction of cracethe                 one protected part       in the shattered fabrics heart    is early english on the south side and decorated on the north   at the end of the nave aisle enclosed by a perpendicular screen   is a chantry founded by the mauleverers and below it is the   vault in which according to tradition the claphams of beamsley   and their ancestors the mauleverers were interred upright        pass pass who will yon chantry door       and through the chink in the fractured floor       look down and see a griesly sight       a vault where the bodies are buried upright       there face by face and hand by hand       the claphams and mauleverers stand    whitaker however could never see this griesly sight through   the chink in the floor and it is perhaps altogether traditional   the ruined portion of the church is entirely decorated with the   exception of the lower walls of the choir the transepts had   eastern aisles the north transept is nearly perfect the south   retains only its western wall in which are two decorated windows   the piers of a central tower remain but at what period it was   destroyed or if it was ever completed is uncertain the choir is   long and aisleless some fragments of tracery remain in the south   window which was a very fine one below the window runs a   transitional norman arcade some portions of tombslabs remain in   the choir the churchyard lies on the north side of the ruins   this has been made classic ground by wordsworths poem         ii see p 118                        the shy recess       of bardens lowly

the accession of henry viithere was only a keepers lodge or tower at barden one of six which existed in different parts of barden forest the shepherdlord whose early life among the cumberland fells led him to seek quiet and retirement after his restoration preferred barden to his greater castles and enlarged or rather rebuilt it so as to provide accommodation for a moderate train of attendants         iii see p 121          it was the time when englands queen       twelve years had reigned a sovereign dread                             but now the inlyworking north       was ripe to send its thousands forth       a potent vassalage to fight       in percys and in nevilles right etc  the circumstances which led to the rising in the north and the chief incidents of that unfortunate episode in english history are traced in detail by mr froude in the fiftythird chapter of his history of england they are also summarized in a lecture on the white doe of rylstone by the late principal shairp in his aspects of poetry from which the following passage is an extract pp 34648    the incidents on which the white doe is founded belong to the   year 1569 the twelfth of queen elizabeth    it is well known that as soon as queen mary of scotland was   imprisoned in england she became the centre around which gathered   all the intrigues which were then on foot not only in england but   throughout catholic europe to dethrone the protestant queen   elizabeth abroad the catholic world was collecting all its   strength to crush the heretical island the bigot pope pius v   with the dark intriguer philip ii of spain and the savage duke   of alva were ready to pour their forces on the shores of england    at home a secret negotiation for a marriage between queen mary   and the duke of norfolk had received the approval of many of the   chief english nobles the queen discovered the plot threw norfolk   and some of his friends into the tower and summoned percy earl   of northumberland and neville earl of westmoreland immediately   to appear at court these two earls were known to be holding   secret communications with mary and longing to see the old faith   restored    on receiving the summons northumberland at once withdrew to   brancepeth castle a stronghold of the earl of westmoreland   straightway all their vassals rose and gathered round the two   great earls the whole of the north was in arms a proclamation   went forth that they intended to restore the ancient religion to   settle the succession to the crown and to prevent the destruction   of the old nobility as they marched forward they were joined by   all the strength of the yorkshire dales and among others by a   gentleman of ancient name richard norton accompanied by eight   brave sons he came bearing the common banner called the banner   of the five wounds because on it was displayed the cross with the   five wounds of our lord the insurgents entered durham tore the   bible caused mass to be said in the cathedral and then set   forward as for york changing their purpose on the way they   turned aside to lay siege to barnard castle which was held by sir   george bowes for the queen while they lingered there for eleven   days sussex marched against them from york and the earls losing   heart retired towards the border and disbanded their forces   which were left to the vengeance of the enemy while they   themselves sought refuge in scotland northumberland after a   confinement of several years in loch leven castle was betrayed by   the scots to the english and put to death westmoreland died an   exile in flanders the last of the ancient house of the nevilles   earls of westmoreland norton with his eight sons fell into the   hands of sussex and all suffered death at york it is the fate of   this ancient family on which wordsworths poem is founded  this statement as to the fate of nortons sons however is not borne out by the historians mr froude says history of england chap 53 two sons of old norton and two of his brothers after long and close crossquestioning in the tower were tried and convicted at westminster two of these nortons were afterwards pardoned two one of whom was christopher the poor youth who had been bewildered by the fair eyes of the queen of scots at bolton were put to death at tyburn with the usual cruelties         iv see p 127        for we

but the site some garden flowers still as when whitaker wrote mark the site of the pleasaunce the house fell into decay immediately after the attainder of the nortons and with the estates here remained in the hands of the crown until the second year of james i when they were granted to the earl of cumberland although wordsworth makes the nortons raise their famous banner here they assembled their followers in fact at ripon november 18 1569 but their rylstone tenants rose with them         v see p 137        until lord dacre with his power       from naworth come and howards aid       be with them openly displayed  naworth castle at the head of the vale of llanercort in the gilsland district of cumberland was the seat of the dacres from the reign of edward iii george lord dacre the last heirmale of that family was killed in 1559 and lord william howard the third son of thomas duke of norfolk who was made warden of the borders by queen elizabeth and did much to introduce order and good government into the district married the heiress of the dacre family and succeeded to the castle and estate of naworth the arms over the entrance of the castle are the howards and dacres

point of rugged ground       among the wastes of rylstone fell       above the loftiest ridge or mound       where foresters or shepherds dwell       an edifice of warlike frame       stands singlenorton tower its name       it fronts all quarters and looks round       oer path and road and plain and dell       dark moor and gleam of pool and stream       upon a prospect without bound    some mounds near the tower are thought to have been used as butts   for archers and there are traces of a strong wall running from   the tower to the edge of a deep glen whence a ditch runs to   another ravine this was once a pond used by the nortons for   detaining the red deer within the township of rylstone which they   asserted was not within the forest of skipton and consequently   that the cliffords had no right to hunt therein the cliffords   eventually became lords of all the norton lands here                                       in january 1816 wordsworth wrote thus to his friend archdeacon wrangham    of the white doe i have little to say but that i hope it will   be acceptable to the intelligent for whom alone it is written it   starts from a high point of imagination and comes round through   various wanderings of that faculty to a still highernothing   less than the apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the   two titles to the poem and as the poem thus begins and ends with   pure and lofty imagination every motive and impetus that actuates   the persons introduced is from the same source a kindred spirit   pervades and is intended to harmonise the whole throughout   objects the banner for instance derive their influence not   from properties inherent in them not from what they are   actually in themselves but from such as are bestowed upon them   by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by   these objects thus the poetry if there be any in the work   proceeds as it ought to do from the soul of man communicating   its creative energies to the images of the external world  the following is from a letter to southey in the same yeardo you know who reviewed the white doe in the quarterly after having asserted that mr w uses his words without any regard to their sense the writer says that on no other principle can he explain that emily is always called the consecrated emily now the name emily occurs just fifteen times in the poem and out of these fifteen the epithet is attached to it once and that for the express purpose of recalling the scene in which she had been consecrated by her brothers solemn adjuration that she would fulfil her destiny and become a soul        by force of sorrows high       uplifted to the purest sky       of undisturbed mortality  the point upon which the whole moral interest of the piece hinges when that speech is closed occurs in this line        he kissed the consecrated maid  and to bring back this to the reader i repeated the epithet  in a letter to wordsworth about the waggoner charles lamb wrote june 7 1819 i reread the white doe of rylstone the title should be always written at length as mary sabilla novello a very nice woman of our acquaintance always signs hers at the bottom of the shortest note manning had just sent it home and it came as fresh to me as the immortal creature it speaks of m sent it home with a note having this passage in it i cannot help writing to you while i am reading wordsworths poem tis broad noble poetical with a masterly scanning of human actions absolutely above common readers see the letters of charles lamb edited by alfred ainger vol ii pp 25 26  henry crabb robinsons judgment as given in his diary june 1815 is interesting see vol i p 484  the following is from principal shairps estimate of the white doe of rylstone in his oxford lectures aspects of poetry chapter xii pp 37376 what is it that gives to it the poem its chief power and charm is it not the imaginative use which the poet has made of the white doe with her appearance the poem opens with her reappearance it closes and the passages in which she is introduced are radiant with the purest light of poetry a mere floating tradition she was which the historian of craven had preserved how much does the poet bring out of how little it was a high stroke of genius to seize on this slight traditionary incident and make it the organ of so much what were the objects which he had to describe and blend into one harmonious whole they were these  1 the last expiring gleam of feudal chivalry ending in the ruin of an ancient race and the desolation of an ancestral home  2 the sole survivor purified and exalted by the sufferings she had to undergo  3 the pathos of the decaying sanctities of bolton after wrong and outrage abandoned to the healing of nature and time  4 lastly the beautiful scenery of pastoral wharfdale and of the fells around bolton which blend so well with these affecting memories  all these were before himthey had melted into his imagination and waited to be woven into one harmonious creation he takes the white doe and makes her the exponent the symbol the embodiment of them all the one central aimto represent the beatification of the heroinehow was this to be attained had it been a drama the poet would have made the heroine give forth in speeches her hidden mind and character but this was a romantic narrative was the poet to make her soliloquise analyse her own feelings lay bare her heart in metaphysical monologue this might have been done by some modern poets but it was not wordsworths way of exhibiting character reflective though he was when he analyses feelings they are generally his own not those of his characters to shadow forth that which is invisible the sanctity of emilys chastened soul he lays hold of this sensible imagea creature the purest most innocent most beautiful in the whole realm of natureand makes her the vehicle in which he embodies the saintliness which is a thing invisible it is the hardest of all tasks to make spiritual things sensuous without degrading them i know not where this difficulty has been more happily met for we are made to feel that before the poem closes the doe has ceased to be a mere animal or a physical creature at all but in the light of the poets imagination has been transfigured into a heavenly apparitiona type of all that is pure and affecting and saintly and not only the chastened soul of her mistress but the beautiful priory of bolton the whole vale of wharfe and all the surrounding scenery are illumined by the glory which she makes her presence irradiates them all with a beauty and an interest more than the eye discovers seen through her as an imaginative transparency they become spiritualized in fact she and they alike become the symbol and expression of the sentiment which pervades the poema sentiment broad and deep as the world and yet any one who visits these scenes in a mellow autumnal day will feel that she is no alien or adventitious image imported by the caprice of the poet but altogether native to the place one which gathers up and concentrates all the undefined spirit and sentiment which lie spread around it she both glorifies the scenery by her presence and herself seems to be a natural growth of the scenery so that it finds in her its most appropriate utterance this power of imagination to divine and project the very corporeal image which suits and expresses the image of a scene wordsworth has many times shown  and so the poem has no definite end but passes off as it were into the illimitable it rises out of the perturbations of time and transitory things and passing upward itself takes our thoughts with it to calm places and eternal sunshineed   variants  1 1837         born of heavenly birth                        1815  2 1837         which                                       1815  3 1837         is

personage p 89 chiefly extracted from burns and nicholsons history of cumberland and westmoreland it gives me pleasure to add these further particulars concerning him from dr whitaker who says he retired to the solitude of barden where he seems to have enlarged the tower out of a common keepers lodge and where he found a retreat equally favourable to taste to instruction and to devotion the narrow limits of his residence shew that he had learned to despise the pomp of greatness and that a small train of servants could suffice him who had lived to the age of thirty a servant himself i think this nobleman resided here almost entirely when in yorkshire for all his charters which i have seen are dated at barden  his early habits and the want of those artificial measures of time which even shepherds now possess had given him a turn for observing the motions of the heavenly bodies and having purchased such an apparatus as could then be procured he amused and informed himself by those pursuits with the aid of the canons of bolton some of whom are said to have been well versed in what was then known of the science  i suspect this nobleman to have been sometimes occupied in a more visionary pursuit and probably in the same company  for from the family evidences i have met with two mss on the subject of alchemy which from the character spelling etc may almost certainly be referred to the reign of henry the seventh if these were originally deposited with the mss of the cliffords it might have been for the use of this nobleman if they were brought from bolton at the dissolution they must have been the work of those canons whom he almost exclusively conversed with  in these peaceful employments lord clifford spent the whole reign of henry the seventh and the first years of his son but in the year 1513 when almost sixty years old he was appointed to a principal command over the army which fought at flodden and shewed that the military genius of the family had neither been chilled in him by age nor extinguished by habits of peace  he survived the battle of flodden ten years and died april 23d 1523 aged about 70 i shall endeavour to appropriate to him a tomb vault and chantry in the choir of the church of bolton as i should be sorry to believe that he was deposited when dead at a distance from the place which in his lifetime he loved so well  by his last will he appointed his body to be interred at shap if he died in westmoreland or at bolton if he died in yorkshire  with respect to the canons of bolton dr whitaker shews from mss that not only alchemy

commanding him to take the holy corporaxcloth wherewith st cuthbert did cover the chalice when he used to say mass and to put the same holy relique like to a bannercloth upon the point of a spear and the next morning to go and repair to a place on the west side of the city of durham called the red hills where the maids bower wont to be and there to remain and abide till the end of the battle to which vision the prior obeying and taking the same for a revelation of gods grace and mercy by the mediation of holy st cuthbert did accordingly the next morning with the monks of the said abbey repair to the said red hills and there most devoutly humbling and prostrating themselves in prayer for the victory in the said battle a great multitude of the scots running and pressing by them with intention to have spoiled them yet had no power to commit any violence under such holy persons so occupied in prayer being protected and defended by the mighty providence of almighty god and by the mediation of holy st cuthbert and the presence of the holy relique and after many conflicts and warlike exploits there had and done between the english men and the king of scots and his company the said battle ended and the victory was obtained to the great overthrow and confusion of the scots their enemies and then the said prior and monks accompanied with ralph lord nevil and john nevil his son and the lord percy and many other nobles of england returned home and went to the abbey church there joining in hearty prayer and thanksgiving to god and holy st cuthbert for the victory atchieved that day  this battle was afterwards called the battle of nevilles cross from the following circumstance  on the west side of the city of durham where two roads pass each other a most notable famous and goodly cross of stonework was erected and set up to the honour of god for the victory there obtained in the field of battle and known by the name of nevils cross and built at the sole cost of the lord ralph nevil one of the most excellent and chief persons in the said battle the relique of st cuthbert afterwards became of great importance in military events for soon after this battle says the same author the prior caused a goodly and sumptuous banner to be made which is then described at great length and in the midst of the same bannercloth was the said holy relique and corporaxcloth enclosed etc etc and so sumptuously finished and absolutely perfected this banner was dedicated to holy st cuthbert of intent and purpose that for the future it should be carried to any battle as occasion should serve and was never carried and shewed at any battle but by the especial grace of god almighty and the mediation of holy st cuthbert it brought home victory which bannercloth after the dissolution of the abbey fell into the possession of dean whittingham whose wife was called katharine being a french woman as is most credibly reported by eyewitnesses did most injuriously burn the same in her fire to the open contempt and disgrace of all ancient and goodly reliquesextracted from a book entitled durham cathedral as it stood before the dissolution of the monastery it appears from

w 1815  the valley of littondale as is shown in wordsworths note once bore the name of amerdale though the name is not now given to the beck it survives singularly enough in one pool in the stream where it joins the wharfe which is still called amerdale dubed  ss from this valley of litton a small lateral one runs up in a southwesterly direction at arncliffe making a deep fork and is called dernbrook dern means seclusion and two or three miles up this ghyll is a farmhouse bearing the name of dernbrook house the phrase by lurking dernbrooks pathless side is so appropriate says the late incumbent of arncliffe the ven archdeacon boyd in a letter to the editor that it would almost seem that wordsworth had been there mr boyd adds in the illustrated edition of the white doe published by

scottish border it appears that such pounds for deer sheep etc were far from being uncommon in the south of scotland the principle of them was something like that of a wire mousetrap on the declivity of a steep hill the bottom and sides of which were fenced so as to be impassable a wall was constructed nearly level with the surface on the outside yet so high within that without wings it was impossible to escape in the opposite direction care was probably taken that these enclosures should contain better feed than the neighbouring parks or forests and whoever is acquainted with the habits

subject grew in importance to him as he discussed it and he threw his reflections on the subject into the form of a small treatise the preface to which was dated 20th may 1809 the full title of this

was being added to at intervals of twentyfour which were included by wordsworth in the final arrangement of his poems among those dedicated to national independence and liberty fourteen belong to the year 1809 and ten to 1810 it is difficult to ascertain the principle which guided him in determining the succession of these sonnets they were not placed in chronological order nor is there any historical or topographical reason for their being arranged as they were i have therefore felt at liberty to depart from his order to the following extent  the six sonnets referring to the tyrolese have been brought together in one group those containing allusions to spain might have been similarly treated but the sonnets on schill the king of sweden and napoleonas arranged by wordsworth himselfdo not break the continuity of the series on spain in the same way that the insertion of those on palafox and zaragoza interferes with the unity of the tyrolean group and the rearrangement of

tyrolese the translation of a paper contributed by alois brandl a tyrolean to the neue freie presse of october 22 1880 herr brandl was for some time in england investigating the traces of a german literary influence on coleridge wordsworth and their contemporaries    it was in the year 1809 napoleon was at the height of his career   of victory and england alone of all his opponents held the   supremacy at sea for years the english were the only   representatives of freedom in europe at last it seemed that two   fortunate allies arose to join their causethe insurgents in   spain and in the little land of tyrol no wonder then that now   british poets sympathised with the victors at the hill of isel   and praised their courage and their leaders and at last when   they were overcome by superior forces laid the laurel wreath of   tragic heroism on their graves    thirty or forty years before english poets would scarcely have   shown such a lively interest in a war of independence in a foreign   country they stood under the curse of narrowmindedness and   onesidedness both in politics and in art so that their   smoothrunning verses neither sought nor found a response even in   the hearts of their own fellowcountrymen the poets who appeared   before the public in the year 1798 with the famous lyrical   ballads were the first to strike out a new path although   differing considerably from one another in other respects they   agreed in their opposition to the conventionality of the old   school            wordsworth lived in a simple little house on the romantic lake   of grasmere in the heart of the mountains of westmoreland he   studied more in his walks over heath and field than in books and   entered with interest into the questions affecting the good of the   country people around him all this of necessity impelled him to   take a warm interest in the herdsmen of the alps    but the tyrolese inspired him with still greater interest on   political grounds like all the lake poets he was an enthusiastic   admirer not of the french revolution but of the republic as long   as it seemed to desire the realization of the ideas of liberty   fraternity equality and the rest of rousseaus arcadian notions   and it was a bitter disillusion for him as well as for klopstock   when this muchpraised home of the free rights of man resolved   itself into the empire of napoleon from this moment he took his   place on the side of the enemies of france and particularly on   the side of the tyrolese since they had never lost the natural   simplicity of their habits and had regained the hereditary   freedom of which they had been deprived with the sword thus   arose the curious paradox that a republican poet glorified   spontaneously the cause of an exceedingly monarchical and   conservative country    wordsworth gave vent to his enthusiasm in six sonnets which as   far as power of language and vigour of thought are concerned form   interesting companionpieces to the poems of the contemporary   tyrolese poet alois weissenbach in the first three sonnets the   splendour of the alpine world which he knew from his journeys in   switzerland forms the background of the picture in the   foreground he sees a band of brave and daring men in whose hearts   he thought he could find all his own moral pathos many of the   features which he has introduced certainly show more ideal fancy   than knowledge of detail but it was not his purpose to compose a   correct report of the war but to give an exciting description of   the heroes of this struggle for independence in order that even   though they themselves should be overpowered their spirit might   arise again among his own fellowcountrymen in the fourth sonnet   in his enthusiasm for the tyrolese he has treated the german   universities with unnecessary severity but this does not prove   any intentional want of fairness on his part for at that time our   universities stood under general discredit in england as the   hotbeds of the wildest metaphysics and political dreams the   events of the year 1813 would probably induce wordsworth to view   them in a more favourable light similarly the sixth sonnet is not   quite just to austria in particular wordsworth has made   decidedly too little allowance for the fact that the emperor franz   i ceded the tyrol quite against his own will under the pressure   of circumstances but in this case we must not simply impute all   the blame to the poet for as we see from the diary of his friend   southey his information as to the doings of austria was of a most   vague and unfavourable character we however cannot have any   wish to impute to austria the sins of illadvised diplomacy  the following are herr brandls german translations of five of wordsworths sonnets                              1                   andreas hofer        von sterblichen geboren sei der held         der den tirolern todeskühn gebeut

bootle on the southwest coast of cumberland the whole among mountain roads through a beautiful country and we had fine weather the verses end with our breakfast at the head of yewdale in a yeomans house which like all the other property in that sequestered vale has passed or is passing into the hands of mr james marshall of monk conistonin mr knotts the late owners time called waterhead our hostess married a mr oldfield a lieutenant in the navy they lived together for some time at hacket where she still resides as his widow it was in front of that house on the mountain side near which stood the peasant who while we were passing at a distance saluted us waving a kerchief in her hand as described in the poema this matron and her husband were then residing at the hacket the house and its inmates are referred to in the fifth book of the excursion in the passage beginning                                      you behold       high on the breast of yon dark mountain dark       with stony barrenness a shining speckj cb  the dog which we met with soon after our starting belonged to mr rowlandson who for forty years was curate of grasmere in place of the rector who lived to extreme old age in a state of insanity of this mr r much might be said both with reference to his character and the way in which he was regarded by his parishioners he was a man of a robust frame had a firm voice and authoritative manner of strong natural talents of which he was himself conscious for he has been heard to say it grieves me to add with an oathif i had been brought up at college i should have been a bishop two vices used to struggle in him for mastery avarice and the love of strong drink but avarice as is common in like cases always got the better of its opponent for though he was often intoxicated it was never i believe at his own expense as has been said of one in a more exalted station he would take any given quantity i have heard a story of him which is worth the telling one summers morning our grasmere curate after a nights carouse in the vale of langdale on his return home having reached a point near which the whole of the vale of grasmere might be seen with the lake immediately below him stepped aside and sat down on the turf after looking for some time at the landscape then in the perfection of its morning beauty he exclaimedgood god that i should have led so long such a life in such a place this no doubt was deeply felt by him at the time but i am not authorised to say that any noticeable amendment followed penuriousness strengthened upon him as his body grew feebler with age he had purchased property and kept some land in his own hands but he could not find in his heart to lay out the necessary hire for labourers at the proper season and consequently he has often been seen in halfdotage working his hay in the month of november by moonlight a melancholy sight which i myself have witnessed notwithstanding all that has been said this man on account of his talents and superior education was looked up to by his parishioners who without a single exception lived at that time and most of them upon their own small inheritances in a state of republican equality a condition favourable to the growth of kindly feelings among them and in a striking degree exclusive to temptations to gross vice and scandalous behaviour as a pastor their curate did little or nothing for them but what could more strikingly set forth the efficacy of the church of england through its ordinances and liturgy than that in spite of the unworthiness of the minister his church was regularly attended and though there was not much appearance in the flock of what might be called animated piety intoxication was rare and dissolute morals unknown with the bible they were for the most part well acquainted and as was strikingly shown when they were under affliction must have been supported and comforted by habitual belief in those truths which it is the aim of the church to inculcate loughrigg tarnthis beautiful pool and the surrounding scene are minutely described in my little book upon the lakes sir g h beaumont in the earlier part of his life was induced by his love of nature and the art of painting to take up his abode at old brathay about three miles from this spot so that he must have seen it under many aspects and he was so much pleased with it that he purchased the tarn with a view to build near it such a residence as is alluded to in this epistle baronets and knights were not so common in that day as now and sir michael le fleming not liking to have a rival in that kind of distinction so near him claimed a sort of lordship over the territory and showed dispositions little in unison with those of sir g beaumont who was eminently a lover of peace the project of building was in consequence given up sir george retaining possession of the tarn many years afterwards a kendal tradesman born upon its banks applied to me for the purchase of it and accordingly it was sold for the sum that had been given for it and the money was laid out under my direction upon a substantial oak fence for a certain number of yew trees to be planted in grasmere churchyard two were planted in each enclosure with a view to remove after a certain time the one which throve least after several years the stouter plant being left the others were taken up and placed in other parts of the same churchyard and were adequately fenced at the expense and under the care of the late mr barber mr greenwood and myself the whole eight are now thriving and are already an ornament to a place which during late years has lost much of its rustic simplicity by the introduction of iron palisades to fence off family buryinggrounds and by numerous monuments some of them in very bad taste from which this place of burial was in my memory quite free see the lines in the sixth book of the excursion beginninggreen is the churchyard beautiful and green the epistle to which these notes refer though written so far back as 1804c was carefully revised so late as 1842 previous to its publication i am loth to add that it was never seen by the person to whom it is addressed so sensible am i of the deficiencies in all that i write and so far does everything i attempt fall short of what i wish it to be that even private publication if such a term may be allowed requires more resolution than i can command i have written to give vent to my own mind and not without hope that some time or other kindred minds might benefit by my labours but i am inclined to believe i should never have ventured to send forth any verses of mine to the world if it had not been done on the pressure of personal occasions had i been a rich man my productions like this epistle

written from bootle to sir george beaumont on the 28th august 1811 wordsworth says    this is like most others a bleak and treeless coast but   abounding in corn fields and with a noble beach which is   delightful either for walking or riding the isle of man is right   opposite our window and though in this unsettled weather often   invisible its appearance has afforded us great amusement one   afternoon above the whole length of it was stretched a body of   clouds shaped and coloured like a magnificent grove in winter   when whitened with snow and illuminated by the morning sun   which having melted the snow in part has intermingled black   masses among the brightness the whole sky was scattered over with   fleecy dark clouds such as any sunshiny day produces and which   were changing their shapes and positions every moment but this   line of clouds was immovably attached to the island and   manifestly took their shape from the influence of its mountains   there appeared to be just span enough of sky to allow the hand to   slide between the top of snâfell the highest peak in the island   and the base of this glorious forest in which little change was   noticeable for more than the space of half an hour  in the fenwick note wordsworth tells us that this epistle was written in 1804 and by referring to the note prefixed to the first poem in the memorials of a tour in scotland 1803 see vol ii p 377 it will be seen that the lines entitled departure from the vale of grasmere august 1803 beginning        the gentlest shade that walked elysian plains  were not actually written for the occasion but transplanted from my epistle to sir george beaumont  it does not follow from this however that the lines belong to the year 1803 or 1804 because they were not published along with the earlier memorials of the scotch tour but appeared for the first time in the edition of 1827 it is certain that wordsworth travelled down with his household from the grasmere parsonage to bootle in august 1811mainly to get some seaair for his invalid childrenand that he lived there for some time during the autumn of that year he may have also gone down to the southwest coast of cumberland in 1804 and then written a part of the poem but we have no direct evidence of this and i rather think that the mention of the year 1804 to miss fenwick is just another instance in which wordsworths memory failed him while dictating these memoranda if the poem was not written at different times but was composed as a whole in 1811 we may partly account for the date he gave to miss fenwick when we remember that in the year 1827 he transferred a part of it viz the introduction to these memorials of the scotch tour of 1803        up many a sharplytwining road and down       and over many a wide hills craggy crown       through the quick turns of many a hollow nook       and the rough bed of many an unbridged brook  their route would be from grasmere by red bank over by high
